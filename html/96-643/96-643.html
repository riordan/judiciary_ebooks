				Alleging that petitioner manufacturer had violated the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act of 1986 (EPCRA) by failing to file timely toxic- and hazardous-chemical storage and emission reports for past years, respondent environmental protection organization filed this private enforcement action for declaratory and injunctive relief under EPCRAs citizen-suit provision, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/11046.html#a_1" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §11046(a)(1)</a>.  The District Court held that, because petitioner had brought its filings up to date by the time the complaint was filed, the court lacked jurisdiction to entertain a suit for a present violation; and that, because EPCRA does not allow suit for a purely historical violation, respondents allegation of untimely filing was not a claim upon which relief could be granted.  The Seventh Circuit reversed, concluding that EPCRA authorizes citizen suits for purely past violations.

        <p class="SYLCTE">
            <em>
					Held:&lt;unicode value="8194"&gt;

				Because none of the relief sought would likely remedy respondents alleged injury in fact, respondent lacks standing to maintain this suit, and this Court and the lower courts lack jurisdiction to entertain it.  Pp. 326. 
			</p>
        <p class="SYLCTF">
				
				    
				(a) The merits issue in this casewhether §11046(a) permits citizen suits for purely past violationsis not also jurisdictional, and so does not occupy the same status as standing to sue as a question that must be resolved first.  It is firmly established that a district courts subject-matter jurisdiction is not defeated by the absence of a valid (as opposed to arguable) cause of action, see, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Bell
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Hood,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/327/678" class="subref" title="subref">327 U. S. 678</a>.  Subject-matter jurisdiction exists if the right to recover will be sustained under one reading of the Constitution and laws and defeated under another, 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 685, unless the claim clearly appears to be immaterial, wholly insubstantial and frivolous, or otherwise so devoid of merit as not to involve a federal controversy, see, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y. 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					County of Oneida,

            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/414/661" class="subref" title="subref">414 U. S. 661</a>.  Here, respondent wins under one construction of EPCRA and loses under another, and its claim is not frivolous or immaterial.  It is unreasonable to read §11046(c)which provides that [t]he district court shall have jurisdiction in actions brought under subsection (a) … to enforce [an EPCRA] requirement … and to impose any civil penalty provided for violation of that requirementas making all the elements of the §11046(a) cause of action jurisdictional, rather than as merely specifying the remedial 
				<em>
					powers
				</em>
				 of the court.

S. 49</a>, as well as cases deciding a statutory standing question before a constitutional standing question, distinguished.  In no case has this Court called the existence of a cause of action jurisdictional, and decided that question before resolving a dispute concerning the existence of an Article III case or controversy.  Such a principle would turn every statutory question in an EPCRA citizen suit into a question of jurisdiction that this Court would have to considerindeed, raise 
				<em>
					sua sponte
				</em>
				even if not raised below.  Pp. 38.

				(b) This Court declines to endorse the doctrine of hypothetical jurisdiction, under which several Courts of Appeals have found it proper to proceed immediately to the merits question, despite jurisdictional objections, at least where (1) the merits question is more readily resolved, and (2) the prevailing party on the merits would be the same as the prevailing party were jurisdiction denied.  That doctrine carries the courts beyond the bounds of authorized judicial action and thus offends fundamental separation-of-powers principles.  In a long and venerable line of cases, this Court has held that, without proper jurisdiction, a court cannot proceed at all, but can only note the jurisdictional defect and dismiss the suit.

				<em>
					E.g., ibid.

				at 578, the complaint nevertheless fails the redressability test: None of the specific items of relief soughta declaratory judgment that petitioner violated EPCRA; injunctive relief authorizing respondent to make periodic inspections of petitioners facility and records and requiring petitioner to give respondent copies of its compliance reports; and orders requiring petitioner to pay EPCRA civil penalties to the Treasury and to reimburse respondent's litigation expensesand no conceivable relief under the complaints final, general request, would serve to reimburse respondent for losses caused by petitioners late reporting, or to eliminate any effects of that late reporting upon respondent.

				This is a private enforcement action under the citizen-suit provision of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act of 1986 (EPCRA),

				Respondent, an association of individuals interested in environmental protection, sued petitioner, a small manufacturing company in Chicago, for past violations of EPCRA.  EPCRA establishes a framework of state, regional and local agencies designed to inform the public about the presence of hazardous and toxic chemicals, and to provide for emergency response in the event of health-threatening release.  Central to its operation are reporting requirements compelling users of specified toxic and hazardous chemicals to file annual emergency and hazardous chemical inventory forms and toxic chemical release forms, which contain, 
				<em>
					inter alia
				</em>
				, the name and location of the facility, the name and quantity of the chemical on hand, and, in the case of toxic chemicals, the waste-disposal method employed and the annual quantity released into each environmental medium.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/11022.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §§11022</a> and 11023.  The hazardous-chemical inventory forms for any given calendar year are due the following March 1st, and the toxic-chemical release forms the following July 1st.  §§11022(a)(2) and 11023(a).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Enforcement of EPCRA can take place on many fronts.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has the most powerful enforcement arsenal: it may seek criminal, civil, or administrative penalties. §11045.  State and local governments can also seek civil penalties, as well as injunctive relief. §§11046(a)(2) and (c).  For purposes of this case, however, the crucial enforcement mechanism is the citizen-suit provision, §11046(a)(1), which likewise authorizes civil penalties and injunctive relief, see §11046(c).  This provides that any person may commence a civil action on his own behalf against … [a]n owner or operator of a facility for failure, among other things, to [c]omplete and submit an inventory form under section 11022(a) of this title … [and] section 11023(a) of this title.  §11046(a)(1).  As a prerequisite to bringing such a suit, the plaintiff must, 60 days prior to filing his complaint, give notice to the Administrator of the EPA, the State in which the alleged violation occurs, and the alleged violator.  §11046(d).  The citizen suit may not go forward if the Administrator has commenced and is diligently pursuing an administrative order or civil action to enforce the requirement concerned or to impose a civil penalty.  §11046(e).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In 1995 respondent sent a notice to petitioner, the Administrator, and the relevant Illinois authorities, allegingaccurately, as it turns outthat petitioner had failed since 1988, the first year of EPCRAs filing deadlines, to complete and to submit the requisite hazardous-chemical inventory and toxic-chemical release forms under §§11022 and 11023.  Upon receiving the notice, petitioner filed all of the overdue forms with the relevant agencies.  The EPA chose not to bring an action against petitioner, and when the 60-day waiting period expired, respondent filed suit in Federal District Court.  Petitioner promptly filed a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and (6), contending that, because its filings were up to date when the complaint was filed, the court had no jurisdiction to entertain a suit for a present violation; and that, because EPCRA does not allow suit for a purely historical violation, respondents allegation of untimeliness in filing was not a claim upon which relief could be granted.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The District Court agreed with petitioner on both points. App. to Pet. for Cert. A24A26. The Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that citizens may seek penalties against EPCRA violators who file after the statutory deadline and after receiving notice.  90 F. 3d 1237 (CA7 1996).  We granted certiorari, 519 U. S. ___ (1997).

Petitioner, however, both in its petition for certiorari and in its briefs on the merits, has raised the issue of respondent's standing to maintain the suit, and hence this Courts jurisdiction to entertain it.  Though there is some dispute on this point, see Part III,

				It is also the case that the

				 opinion does not display the slightest awareness that anything 
				<em>
					turned upon
				</em>
				 whether the existence of a cause of action for past violations was technically jurisdictionalas indeed nothing of substance did.  The District Court had statutory jurisdiction over the suit in any event, since continuing violations were also alleged.  See 484 U. S., at 64.  It is true, as 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Stevens
				</span>
				 points out, that the issue of Article III standing which is addressed at the end of the opinion should technically have been addressed at the outset if the statutory question was not jurisdictional.  But that also did not really matter, since Article III standing was in any event found.  The short of the matter is that the jurisdictional character of the elements of the cause of action in

Of course, even if there were not solid precedent contradicting

				 analysis, §11046(c)s grant of jurisdiction in actions brought

				 [§11046(a)] withholds jurisdiction over claims involving purely past violations if past violations are not in fact 
				<em>

				 by §11046(a).  By parity of reasoning, if there is a dispute as to whether the omission of a particular item constituted a failure to complete the form; or as to whether a particular manner of delivery complied in time with the requirement to submit the form; and if the court agreed with the defendant on the point; the action would not be brought under [§11046(a)], and would be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction rather than decided on the merits.  Moreover, those statutory arguments, since they are jurisdictional, would have to be considered by this Court even though not raised earlier in the litigationindeed, this Court would have to raise them

				We decline to endorse such an approach because it carries the courts beyond the bounds of authorized judicial action and thus offends fundamental principles of separation of powers.  This conclusion should come as no surprise, since it is reflected in a long and venerable line of our cases.  Without jurisdiction the court cannot proceed at all in any cause.  Jurisdiction is power to declare the law, and when it ceases to exist, the only function remaining to the court is that of announcing the fact and dismissing the cause.

				  Both are readily explained, we think, by their extraordinary procedural postures.  In 
				<em>
					Norton, 
				</em>
				the case came to us on direct appeal from a three-judge District Court, and the jurisdictional question was whether the action was properly brought in that forum rather than in an ordinary district court.  We declined to decide that jurisdictional question, because the merits question was decided 
				<em>
					in a companion case
				</em>
				, 
				<em>

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/427/495" class="subref" title="subref">427 U. S. 495</a> (1976)
, with the consequence that the jurisdictional question could have no effect on the outcome: If the three-judge court had been properly convened, we would have affirmed, and if not we would have vacated and remanded for a fresh decree from which an appeal could be taken to the Court of Appeals, the outcome of which was foreordained by 
				<em>

				<em>

				<em>

				</em>
				 did not use the pretermission of the jurisdictional question as a device for reaching a question of law that otherwise would have gone unaddressed.  Moreover, the Court seems to have regarded the merits judgment that it entered on the basis of 
				<em>
					Lucas
				</em>
				 as equivalent to a jurisdictional dismissal for failure to present a substantial federal question.  The Court said: This disposition 
				<em>
					[Lucas]
				</em>
				 renders the merits in the present case a decided issue and thus one no longer substantial in the jurisdictional sense.  427 U. S., at 530531.  We think it clear that this peculiar case, involving a merits issue dispositively resolved in a companion case, was not meant to overrule,

				, two centuries of jurisprudence affirming the necessity of determining jurisdiction before proceeding to the merits.  See

				<em>

				</em>
				 opinion.  The first thing to be observed about 
				<em>
					Avrech
				</em>
				 is that the supposed jurisdictional issue was technically not that.  The issue was whether a court-martial judgment could be attacked collaterally by a suit for back pay.  Although

				</em>
				 hardly permit it to be cited for the precedent-shattering general proposition that an easy merits question may be decided 
				<em>
					on the assumption
				</em>
				 of jurisdiction.  To the contrary, the fact that the Court ordered briefing on the jurisdictional question 
				<em>

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1343.html#3" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1343(3)</a> against the Commissioner of the Vermont Department of Social Welfare for deprivation of federal rights under color of state law by denying payments under a federally funded welfare program, the plaintiff could join a similar claim against the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare.  The merits issue of statutory construction involved in the claim against the Secretary was precisely the same as that involved in the claim against the Commissioner, and the Secretary (while challenging jurisdiction) assured the Court that he would comply with any judgment entered against the Commissioner.  The Courts disposition of the case was to dismiss the Secretarys appeal under what was then Court Rule 40(g), for failure to brief the jurisdictional question adequately.  Normally, the Court acknowledged, its obligation to inquire into the jurisdiction of the District Court might prevent this disposition.  But here, the Court concluded, the substantive issue decided by the District Court would have been decided by that court even if it had concluded that the Secretary was not properly a party, and the only practical difference that resulted … was that its injunction was directed against him as well as against [the Commissioner], which the Secretary has [not] properly contended to be wrongful before this Court.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1651.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1651</a>, and because there was no record to review.

				While some of the above cases must be acknowledged to have diluted the absolute purity of the rule that Article III jurisdiction is always an antecedent question, none of them even approaches approval of a doctrine of hypothetical jurisdiction that enables a court to resolve contested questions of law when its jurisdiction is in doubt.  Hypothetical jurisdiction produces nothing more than a hypothetical judgmentwhich comes to the same thing as an advisory opinion, disapproved by this Court from the beginning.

				Having reached the end of what seems like a long front walk, we finally arrive at the threshold jurisdictional question: whether respondent, the plaintiff below, has standing to sue.  Article III, §2 of the Constitution extends the judicial Power of the United States only to Cases and Controversies.   We have always taken this to mean cases and controversies of the sort traditionally amenable to and resolved by the judicial process.  
				<em>
					Muskrat
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 supra, 
				</em>
				at 356357.  Such a meaning is fairly implied by the text, since otherwise the purported restriction upon the judicial power would scarcely be a restriction at all.  Every criminal investigation conducted by the Executive is a case, and every policy issue resolved by congressional legislation involves a controversy.  These are not, however, the sort of cases and controversies that Article III, §2, refers to, since the Constitutions central mechanism of separation of powers depends largely upon common understanding of what activities are appropriate to legislatures, to executives, and to courts.

				v.

				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 560.  First and foremost, there must be alleged (and ultimately proven) an injury in facta harm suffered by the plaintiff that is concrete and actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical. 

				We turn now to the particulars of respondents complaint to see how it measures up to Article IIIs requirements.

				 App. 4.  It describes respondent as an organization that seeks, uses, and acquires data reported under EPCRA.  It says that respondent reports to its members and the public about storage and releases of toxic chemicals into the environment, advocates changes in environmental regulations and statutes, prepares reports for its members and the public, seeks the reduction of toxic chemicals and further seeks to promote the effective enforcement of environmental laws.  App. 5.  The complaint asserts that respondents right to know about [toxic chemical] releases and its interests in protecting and improving the environment and the health of its members have been, are being, and will be adversely affected by [petitioners] actions in failing to provide timely and required information under EPCRA.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  The complaint also alleges that respondents members, who live in or frequent the area near petitioners facility, use the EPRCA-reported information to learn about toxic chemical releases, the use of hazardous substances in their communities, to plan emergency preparedness in the event of accidents, and to attempt to reduce the toxic chemicals in areas in which they live, work and visit.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  The members safety, health, recreational, economic, aesthetic and environmental interests in the information, it is claimed, have been, are being, and will be adversely affected by [petitioners] actions in failing to file timely and required reports under EPCRA.

				As appears from the above, respondent asserts petitioners failure to provide EPCRA information in a timely fashion, and the lingering effects of that failure, as the injury in fact to itself and its members.  We have not had occasion to decide whether being deprived of information that is supposed to be disclosed under EPCRAor at least being deprived of it when one has a particular plan for its useis a concrete injury in fact that satisfies Article III.  Cf. 
				<em>

				 v.

				The complaint asks for (1) a declaratory judgment that petitioner violated EPCRA; (2) authorization to inspect periodically petitioners facility and records (with costs borne by petitioner); (3) an order requiring petitioner to provide respondent copies of all compliance reports submitted to the EPA; (4) an order requiring petitioner to pay civil penalties of $25,000 per day for each violation of §§11022 and 11023; (5) an award of all respondents costs, in connection with the investigation and prosecution of this matter, including reasonable attorney and expert witness fees, as authorized by Section 326(f) of [EPCRA]; and (6) any such further relief as the court deems appropriate.  App. 11.  None of the specific items of relief sought, and none that we can envision as appropriate under the general request, would serve to reimburse
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				respondent for losses caused by the late reporting,
				<span class="softbreak"></span>

				The first item, the request for a declaratory judgment that petitioner violated EPCRA, can be disposed of summarily.

				Item (4), the civil penalties authorized by the statute, see §11045(c), might be viewed as a sort of compensation or redress to respondent if they were payable to respondent.  But they are not.  These penaltiesthe only damages authorized by EPCRAare payable to the United States Treasury.  In requesting them, therefore, respondent seeks not remediation of its own injuryreimbursement for the costs it incurred as a result of the late filingbut vindication of the rule of lawthe undifferentiated public interest in faithful execution of EPCRA.

				Item (5), the investigation and prosecution costs as authorized by Section 326(f), would assuredly benefit respondent as opposed to the citizenry at large.  Obviously, however, a plaintiff cannot achieve standing to litigate a substantive issue by bringing suit for the cost of bringing suit.  The litigation must give the plaintiff some other benefit besides reimbursement of costs that are a byproduct of the litigation itself.  An interest in attorneys fees is … insufficient to create an Article III case or controversy where none exists on the merits of the underlying claim.

).  Respondent asserts that the investigation costs it seeks were incurred prior to the litigation, in digging up the emissions and storage information that petitioner should have filed, and that respondent needed for its own purposes.  See Brief for Respondent 3738.  The recovery of such expenses unrelated to litigation would assuredly support Article III standing, but the problem is that §326(f), which is the entitlement to monetary relief that the complaint invokes, covers only the costs of litigation.

				The remaining relief respondent seeks (item (2), giving respondent authority to inspect petitioners facility and records, and item (3), compelling petitioner to provide respondent copies of EPA compliance reports) is injunctive in nature.  It cannot conceivably remedy any past wrong but is aimed at deterring petitioner from violating EPCRA in the future.  See Brief for Respondent 36.  The latter objective can of course be remedial for Article III purposes, when threatened injury is one of the gravamens of the complaint.  If respondent had alleged a continuing violation or the imminence of a future violation, the injunctive relief requested would remedy that alleged harm.  But there is no such allegation hereand on the facts of the case, there seems no basis for it.  Nothing supports the requested injunctive relief except respondents generalized interest in deterrence, which is insufficient for purposes of Article III. See

				The United States, as

				 2728, and n. 11.  This makes a sword out of a shield.  The presumption the Government refers to has been applied to refute the assertion of mootness by a defendant who, when sued in a complaint that alleges present or threatened injury, ceases the complained-of activity.  See,

 ([T]he mootness exception for disputes capable of repetition yet evading review … will not revive a dispute which became moot before the action commenced).

						 Our disposition makes it appropriate to address the approach taken by this substantial body of court of appeals precedent.  The fact that Justice Stevens concurrence takes essentially the same approach makes his contention that this discussion is an excursion, and unnecessary to an explanation of our decision, post, at 10, particularly puzzling.

						 Justice Stevens thinks it illogical that a merits question can be given priority over a statutory standing question (National Railroad Passenger Corp.) and a statutory standing question can be given priority over an Article III question (the cases discussed post, at 46), but a merits question cannot be given priority over an Article III question.  See post, at 9, n. 12.  It seems to us no more illogical than many other broken circles that appear in life and the law: that Executive agreements may displace state law, for example, see United States v. Belmont, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/301/324" class="subref" title="subref">301 U. S. 324</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">330</a>331 (1937)
, and that unilateral presidential action (renunciation) may displace Executive agreements, does not produce the logical conclusion that unilateral presidential action may displace state law.  The reasons for allowing merits questions to be decided before statutory standing questions do not support allowing merits questions to be decided before Article III questions.  As National Railroad Passenger Corp. points out, the merits inquiry and the statutory standing inquiry often overlap,  414 U. S., at 456.  The question whether this plaintiff has a cause of action under the statute, and the question whether any plaintiff has a cause of action under the statute are closely connectedindeed, depending upon the asserted basis for lack of statutory standing, they are sometimes identical, so that it would be exceedingly artificial to draw a distinction between the two.  The same cannot be said of the Article III requirement of remediable injury in fact, which (except with regard to entirely frivolous claims) has nothing to do with the text of the statute relied upon.  Moreover, deciding whether any cause of action exists under a particular statute, rather than whether the particular plaintiff can sue, does not take the court into vast, uncharted realms of judicial opinion-giving; whereas the proposition that the court can reach a merits question when there is no Article III jurisdiction opens the door to all sorts of generalized grievances, Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to Stop the War, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/418/208" class="subref" title="subref">418 U. S. 208</a>,

						 Justice Stevens adds three cases to the list of those that might support hypothetical jurisdiction. Post, at 12, n. 15.  They are all inapposite.  In Moor v. County of Alameda, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/411/693" class="subref" title="subref">411 U. S. 693</a> (1973)
, we declined to decide whether a federal courts pendent jurisdiction extended to state law claims against a new party, because we agreed with the district courts discretionary declination of pendent jurisdiction.  Id., at 715716.  Thus, the case decided, not a merits question before a jurisdictional question, but a discretionary jurisdictional question before a nondiscretionary jurisdictional question.  Similarly in Ellis v. Dyson, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/421/426" class="subref" title="subref">421 U. S. 426</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">436</a> (1975)
, the authoritative ground of decision upon which the District Court relied in lieu of determining whether there was a case or controversy was Younger abstention, which we have treated as jurisdictional.  And finally, the issue pretermitted in Neese v. Southern R. Co., 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/350/77" class="subref" title="subref">350 U. S. 77</a> (1955)
, was not Article III jurisdiction at all, but the substantive question whether the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvii" class="subref" title="subref">Seventh Amendment</a> permits a court to grant a motion for new trial on the basis of an excessive jury verdict.  We declined to consider that question because we agreed with the District Courts decision to deny the motion on the facts in the record.  The more numerous the look-alike-but-inapposite cases Justice Stevens cites, the more strikingly clear it becomes: his concurrence cannot identify a single opinion of ours deciding the merits before a disputed question of Article III jurisdiction.

						 Our opinion is not motivated, as Justice Stevens suggests, by the more specific separation-of-powers concern that this citizens suit somehow interferes with the Executives power to take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed, Art. II, §3, post, at 18.  The courts must stay within their constitutionally prescribed sphere of action, whether or not exceeding that sphere will harm one of the other two branches.  This case calls for nothing more than a straightforward application of our standing jurisprudence, which, though it may sometimes have an impact on presidential powers, derives from Article III and not Article II.

						 Contrary to Justice Stevens belief that redressability is a judicial creation of the past 25 years, post, at 14, the concept has been ingrained in our jurisprudence from the beginning.  Although we have packaged the requirements of constitutional case or controversy somewhat differently in the past 25 yearsan era rich in three-part teststhe point has always been the same: whether a plaintiff personally would benefit in a tangible way from the courts intervention.  Warth, supra, 422 U. S., at 508.  For example, in Marye v. Parsons, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/114/325" class="subref" title="subref">114 U. S. 325</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">328</a>329 (1885)
, we held that a bill in equity should have been dismissed because it was a clear case of damnum absque injuria.  Although the complainant alleged a breach of contract by the State, the complainant asks no relief as to that, for there is no remedy by suit to compel the State to pay its debts… .  The bill as framed, therefore, calls for a declaration of an abstract character.  Because courts do not sit[ ] to determine questions of law in thesi, we remanded with directions to dismiss the bill.  Id., at 328330.


Also contrary to Justice Stevens unprecedented suggestion, post, at 14, redressabilitylike the other prongs of the standing inquirydoes not depend on the defendants status as a governmental entity.  There is no conceivable reason why it should.  If it is true, as Justice Stevens claims, that all of the cases in which the Court has denied standing because of a lack of redressability happened to involve government action or inaction, that would be unsurprising.  Suits that promise no concrete benefit to the plaintiff, and that are brought to have us determine questions of law in thesi, Marye, supra, at 330, are most often inspired by the psychological smart of perceived official injustice, or by the government-policy preferences of political activists.  But the principle of redressability has broader application than that.

C. §11046(1)</a> (emphasis added).  Person includes an association, see §11049(7), so it is arguable that the statute permits respondent to vindicate only its own interests as an organization, and not the interests of its individual members.  Since it makes no difference to our disposition of the case, we assume without deciding that the interests of individual members may be the basis of suit.

						 Justice Stevens claims that redressability was found lacking in our prior cases because the relief required action by a party not before the Court.  Post, at 1516.  Even if that were so, it would not prove that redressability is lacking only when relief depends on the actions of a third party.  But in any event, Justice Stevens has overlooked decisions that destroy his premise.  See Lyons, 461 U. S., at 105; OShea v. Littleton, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/414/488" class="subref" title="subref">414 U. S. 488</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">495</a>496 (1974)
.  He also seems to suggest that redressability always exists when the defendant has directly injured the plaintiff.  If that were so, the redressability requirement would be entirely superfluous, since the causation requirement asks whether the injury is fairly … trace[able] to the challenged action of the defendant, and not … th[e] result [of] the independent action of some third party not before the court.  Simon v. Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Organization,

						 Justice Stevens contends, post, at 13, n. 16, that this argument involves us in a construction of the statute, and thus belies our insistence that jurisdictional issues be resolved first.  It involves us in a construction of the statute only to the extent of rejecting as frivolous the contention that costs incurred for respondents own purposes, not in preparation for litigation (and hence sufficient to support Article III standing) are nonetheless costs of litigation under the statute.  As we have described earlier, our cases make clear that frivolous claims are themselves a jurisdictional defect.  See supra, at 4.

				Respondent, an association of individuals interested in environmental protection, sued petitioner, a small manufacturing company in Chicago, for past violations of EPCRA.  EPCRA establishes a framework of state, regional and local agencies designed to inform the public about the presence of hazardous and toxic chemicals, and to provide for emergency response in the event of health-threatening release.  Central to its operation are reporting requirements compelling users of specified toxic and hazardous chemicals to file annual emergency and hazardous chemical inventory forms and toxic chemical release forms, which contain, 
				<em>
					inter alia
				</em>
				, the name and location of the facility, the name and quantity of the chemical on hand, and, in the case of toxic chemicals, the waste-disposal method employed and the annual quantity released into each environmental medium.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/11022.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §§11022</a> and 11023.  The hazardous-chemical inventory forms for any given calendar year are due the following March 1st, and the toxic-chemical release forms the following July 1st.  §§11022(a)(2) and 11023(a).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Enforcement of EPCRA can take place on many fronts.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has the most powerful enforcement arsenal: it may seek criminal, civil, or administrative penalties. §11045.  State and local governments can also seek civil penalties, as well as injunctive relief. §§11046(a)(2) and (c).  For purposes of this case, however, the crucial enforcement mechanism is the citizen-suit provision, §11046(a)(1), which likewise authorizes civil penalties and injunctive relief, see §11046(c).  This provides that any person may commence a civil action on his own behalf against … [a]n owner or operator of a facility for failure, among other things, to [c]omplete and submit an inventory form under section 11022(a) of this title … [and] section 11023(a) of this title.  §11046(a)(1).  As a prerequisite to bringing such a suit, the plaintiff must, 60 days prior to filing his complaint, give notice to the Administrator of the EPA, the State in which the alleged violation occurs, and the alleged violator.  §11046(d).  The citizen suit may not go forward if the Administrator has commenced and is diligently pursuing an administrative order or civil action to enforce the requirement concerned or to impose a civil penalty.  §11046(e).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In 1995 respondent sent a notice to petitioner, the Administrator, and the relevant Illinois authorities, allegingaccurately, as it turns outthat petitioner had failed since 1988, the first year of EPCRAs filing deadlines, to complete and to submit the requisite hazardous-chemical inventory and toxic-chemical release forms under §§11022 and 11023.  Upon receiving the notice, petitioner filed all of the overdue forms with the relevant agencies.  The EPA chose not to bring an action against petitioner, and when the 60-day waiting period expired, respondent filed suit in Federal District Court.  Petitioner promptly filed a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and (6), contending that, because its filings were up to date when the complaint was filed, the court had no jurisdiction to entertain a suit for a present violation; and that, because EPCRA does not allow suit for a purely historical violation, respondents allegation of untimeliness in filing was not a claim upon which relief could be granted.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The District Court agreed with petitioner on both points. App. to Pet. for Cert. A24A26. The Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that citizens may seek penalties against EPCRA violators who file after the statutory deadline and after receiving notice.  90 F. 3d 1237 (CA7 1996).  We granted certiorari, 519 U. S. ___ (1997).

				It is also the case that the 
				<em>

				</em>
				 opinion does not display the slightest awareness that anything 
				<em>
					turned upon
				</em>
				 whether the existence of a cause of action for past violations was technically jurisdictionalas indeed nothing of substance did.  The District Court had statutory jurisdiction over the suit in any event, since continuing violations were also alleged.  See 484 U. S., at 64.  It is true, as 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Stevens
				</span>
				 points out, that the issue of Article III standing which is addressed at the end of the opinion should technically have been addressed at the outset if the statutory question was not jurisdictional.  But that also did not really matter, since Article III standing was in any event found.  The short of the matter is that the jurisdictional character of the elements of the cause of action in 
				<em>

Of course, even if there were not solid precedent contradicting

				 analysis, §11046(c)s grant of jurisdiction in actions brought

				 [§11046(a)] withholds jurisdiction over claims involving purely past violations if past violations are not in fact 
				<em>

				 by §11046(a).  By parity of reasoning, if there is a dispute as to whether the omission of a particular item constituted a failure to complete the form; or as to whether a particular manner of delivery complied in time with the requirement to submit the form; and if the court agreed with the defendant on the point; the action would not be brought under [§11046(a)], and would be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction rather than decided on the merits.  Moreover, those statutory arguments, since they are jurisdictional, would have to be considered by this Court even though not raised earlier in the litigationindeed, this Court would have to raise them

				We decline to endorse such an approach because it carries the courts beyond the bounds of authorized judicial action and thus offends fundamental principles of separation of powers.  This conclusion should come as no surprise, since it is reflected in a long and venerable line of our cases.  Without jurisdiction the court cannot proceed at all in any cause.  Jurisdiction is power to declare the law, and when it ceases to exist, the only function remaining to the court is that of announcing the fact and dismissing the cause.

				  Both are readily explained, we think, by their extraordinary procedural postures.  In 
				<em>
					Norton, 
				</em>
				the case came to us on direct appeal from a three-judge District Court, and the jurisdictional question was whether the action was properly brought in that forum rather than in an ordinary district court.  We declined to decide that jurisdictional question, because the merits question was decided 
				<em>
					in a companion case
				</em>
				, 
				<em>

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/427/495" class="subref" title="subref">427 U. S. 495</a> (1976)
, with the consequence that the jurisdictional question could have no effect on the outcome: If the three-judge court had been properly convened, we would have affirmed, and if not we would have vacated and remanded for a fresh decree from which an appeal could be taken to the Court of Appeals, the outcome of which was foreordained by 
				<em>

				<em>

				<em>

				</em>
				 did not use the pretermission of the jurisdictional question as a device for reaching a question of law that otherwise would have gone unaddressed.  Moreover, the Court seems to have regarded the merits judgment that it entered on the basis of 
				<em>
					Lucas
				</em>
				 as equivalent to a jurisdictional dismissal for failure to present a substantial federal question.  The Court said: This disposition 
				<em>
					[Lucas]
				</em>
				 renders the merits in the present case a decided issue and thus one no longer substantial in the jurisdictional sense.  427 U. S., at 530531.  We think it clear that this peculiar case, involving a merits issue dispositively resolved in a companion case, was not meant to overrule,

				, two centuries of jurisprudence affirming the necessity of determining jurisdiction before proceeding to the merits.  See

				<em>

				</em>
				 opinion.  The first thing to be observed about 
				<em>
					Avrech
				</em>
				 is that the supposed jurisdictional issue was technically not that.  The issue was whether a court-martial judgment could be attacked collaterally by a suit for back pay.  Although

				</em>
				 hardly permit it to be cited for the precedent-shattering general proposition that an easy merits question may be decided 
				<em>
					on the assumption
				</em>
				 of jurisdiction.  To the contrary, the fact that the Court ordered briefing on the jurisdictional question 
				<em>

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1343.html#3" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1343(3)</a> against the Commissioner of the Vermont Department of Social Welfare for deprivation of federal rights under color of state law by denying payments under a federally funded welfare program, the plaintiff could join a similar claim against the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare.  The merits issue of statutory construction involved in the claim against the Secretary was precisely the same as that involved in the claim against the Commissioner, and the Secretary (while challenging jurisdiction) assured the Court that he would comply with any judgment entered against the Commissioner.  The Courts disposition of the case was to dismiss the Secretarys appeal under what was then Court Rule 40(g), for failure to brief the jurisdictional question adequately.  Normally, the Court acknowledged, its obligation to inquire into the jurisdiction of the District Court might prevent this disposition.  But here, the Court concluded, the substantive issue decided by the District Court would have been decided by that court even if it had concluded that the Secretary was not properly a party, and the only practical difference that resulted … was that its injunction was directed against him as well as against [the Commissioner], which the Secretary has [not] properly contended to be wrongful before this Court.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1651.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1651</a>, and because there was no record to review.

				While some of the above cases must be acknowledged to have diluted the absolute purity of the rule that Article III jurisdiction is always an antecedent question, none of them even approaches approval of a doctrine of hypothetical jurisdiction that enables a court to resolve contested questions of law when its jurisdiction is in doubt.  Hypothetical jurisdiction produces nothing more than a hypothetical judgmentwhich comes to the same thing as an advisory opinion, disapproved by this Court from the beginning.

				Having reached the end of what seems like a long front walk, we finally arrive at the threshold jurisdictional question: whether respondent, the plaintiff below, has standing to sue.  Article III, §2 of the Constitution extends the judicial Power of the United States only to Cases and Controversies.   We have always taken this to mean cases and controversies of the sort traditionally amenable to and resolved by the judicial process.  
				<em>
					Muskrat
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 supra, 
				</em>
				at 356357.  Such a meaning is fairly implied by the text, since otherwise the purported restriction upon the judicial power would scarcely be a restriction at all.  Every criminal investigation conducted by the Executive is a case, and every policy issue resolved by congressional legislation involves a controversy.  These are not, however, the sort of cases and controversies that Article III, §2, refers to, since the Constitutions central mechanism of separation of powers depends largely upon common understanding of what activities are appropriate to legislatures, to executives, and to courts.

				v.

				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 560.  First and foremost, there must be alleged (and ultimately proven) an injury in facta harm suffered by the plaintiff that is concrete and actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical. 

				We turn now to the particulars of respondents complaint to see how it measures up to Article IIIs requirements.

				 App. 4.  It describes respondent as an organization that seeks, uses, and acquires data reported under EPCRA.  It says that respondent reports to its members and the public about storage and releases of toxic chemicals into the environment, advocates changes in environmental regulations and statutes, prepares reports for its members and the public, seeks the reduction of toxic chemicals and further seeks to promote the effective enforcement of environmental laws.  App. 5.  The complaint asserts that respondents right to know about [toxic chemical] releases and its interests in protecting and improving the environment and the health of its members have been, are being, and will be adversely affected by [petitioners] actions in failing to provide timely and required information under EPCRA.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  The complaint also alleges that respondents members, who live in or frequent the area near petitioners facility, use the EPRCA-reported information to learn about toxic chemical releases, the use of hazardous substances in their communities, to plan emergency preparedness in the event of accidents, and to attempt to reduce the toxic chemicals in areas in which they live, work and visit.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  The members safety, health, recreational, economic, aesthetic and environmental interests in the information, it is claimed, have been, are being, and will be adversely affected by [petitioners] actions in failing to file timely and required reports under EPCRA.

				As appears from the above, respondent asserts petitioners failure to provide EPCRA information in a timely fashion, and the lingering effects of that failure, as the injury in fact to itself and its members.  We have not had occasion to decide whether being deprived of information that is supposed to be disclosed under EPCRAor at least being deprived of it when one has a particular plan for its useis a concrete injury in fact that satisfies Article III.  Cf. 
				<em>

				 v.

				The complaint asks for (1) a declaratory judgment that petitioner violated EPCRA; (2) authorization to inspect periodically petitioners facility and records (with costs borne by petitioner); (3) an order requiring petitioner to provide respondent copies of all compliance reports submitted to the EPA; (4) an order requiring petitioner to pay civil penalties of $25,000 per day for each violation of §§11022 and 11023; (5) an award of all respondents costs, in connection with the investigation and prosecution of this matter, including reasonable attorney and expert witness fees, as authorized by Section 326(f) of [EPCRA]; and (6) any such further relief as the court deems appropriate.  App. 11.  None of the specific items of relief sought, and none that we can envision as appropriate under the general request, would serve to reimburse
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				respondent for losses caused by the late reporting,
				<span class="softbreak"></span>

				The first item, the request for a declaratory judgment that petitioner violated EPCRA, can be disposed of summarily.

				Item (4), the civil penalties authorized by the statute, see §11045(c), might be viewed as a sort of compensation or redress to respondent if they were payable to respondent.  But they are not.  These penaltiesthe only damages authorized by EPCRAare payable to the United States Treasury.  In requesting them, therefore, respondent seeks not remediation of its own injuryreimbursement for the costs it incurred as a result of the late filingbut vindication of the rule of lawthe undifferentiated public interest in faithful execution of EPCRA.

				Item (5), the investigation and prosecution costs as authorized by Section 326(f), would assuredly benefit respondent as opposed to the citizenry at large.  Obviously, however, a plaintiff cannot achieve standing to litigate a substantive issue by bringing suit for the cost of bringing suit.  The litigation must give the plaintiff some other benefit besides reimbursement of costs that are a byproduct of the litigation itself.  An interest in attorneys fees is … insufficient to create an Article III case or controversy where none exists on the merits of the underlying claim.

).  Respondent asserts that the investigation costs it seeks were incurred prior to the litigation, in digging up the emissions and storage information that petitioner should have filed, and that respondent needed for its own purposes.  See Brief for Respondent 3738.  The recovery of such expenses unrelated to litigation would assuredly support Article III standing, but the problem is that §326(f), which is the entitlement to monetary relief that the complaint invokes, covers only the costs of litigation.

				The remaining relief respondent seeks (item (2), giving respondent authority to inspect petitioners facility and records, and item (3), compelling petitioner to provide respondent copies of EPA compliance reports) is injunctive in nature.  It cannot conceivably remedy any past wrong but is aimed at deterring petitioner from violating EPCRA in the future.  See Brief for Respondent 36.  The latter objective can of course be remedial for Article III purposes, when threatened injury is one of the gravamens of the complaint.  If respondent had alleged a continuing violation or the imminence of a future violation, the injunctive relief requested would remedy that alleged harm.  But there is no such allegation hereand on the facts of the case, there seems no basis for it.  Nothing supports the requested injunctive relief except respondents generalized interest in deterrence, which is insufficient for purposes of Article III. See

				The United States, as

				 2728, and n. 11.  This makes a sword out of a shield.  The presumption the Government refers to has been applied to refute the assertion of mootness by a defendant who, when sued in a complaint that alleges present or threatened injury, ceases the complained-of activity.  See,

 ([T]he mootness exception for disputes capable of repetition yet evading review … will not revive a dispute which became moot before the action commenced).

						 Our disposition makes it appropriate to address the approach taken by this substantial body of court of appeals precedent.  The fact that Justice Stevens concurrence takes essentially the same approach makes his contention that this discussion is an excursion, and unnecessary to an explanation of our decision, post, at 10, particularly puzzling.

						 Justice Stevens thinks it illogical that a merits question can be given priority over a statutory standing question (National Railroad Passenger Corp.) and a statutory standing question can be given priority over an Article III question (the cases discussed post, at 46), but a merits question cannot be given priority over an Article III question.  See post, at 9, n. 12.  It seems to us no more illogical than many other broken circles that appear in life and the law: that Executive agreements may displace state law, for example, see United States v. Belmont, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/301/324" class="subref" title="subref">301 U. S. 324</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">330</a>331 (1937)
, and that unilateral presidential action (renunciation) may displace Executive agreements, does not produce the logical conclusion that unilateral presidential action may displace state law.  The reasons for allowing merits questions to be decided before statutory standing questions do not support allowing merits questions to be decided before Article III questions.  As National Railroad Passenger Corp. points out, the merits inquiry and the statutory standing inquiry often overlap,  414 U. S., at 456.  The question whether this plaintiff has a cause of action under the statute, and the question whether any plaintiff has a cause of action under the statute are closely connectedindeed, depending upon the asserted basis for lack of statutory standing, they are sometimes identical, so that it would be exceedingly artificial to draw a distinction between the two.  The same cannot be said of the Article III requirement of remediable injury in fact, which (except with regard to entirely frivolous claims) has nothing to do with the text of the statute relied upon.  Moreover, deciding whether any cause of action exists under a particular statute, rather than whether the particular plaintiff can sue, does not take the court into vast, uncharted realms of judicial opinion-giving; whereas the proposition that the court can reach a merits question when there is no Article III jurisdiction opens the door to all sorts of generalized grievances, Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to Stop the War, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/418/208" class="subref" title="subref">418 U. S. 208</a>,

						 Justice Stevens adds three cases to the list of those that might support hypothetical jurisdiction. Post, at 12, n. 15.  They are all inapposite.  In Moor v. County of Alameda, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/411/693" class="subref" title="subref">411 U. S. 693</a> (1973)
, we declined to decide whether a federal courts pendent jurisdiction extended to state law claims against a new party, because we agreed with the district courts discretionary declination of pendent jurisdiction.  Id., at 715716.  Thus, the case decided, not a merits question before a jurisdictional question, but a discretionary jurisdictional question before a nondiscretionary jurisdictional question.  Similarly in Ellis v. Dyson, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/421/426" class="subref" title="subref">421 U. S. 426</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">436</a> (1975)
, the authoritative ground of decision upon which the District Court relied in lieu of determining whether there was a case or controversy was Younger abstention, which we have treated as jurisdictional.  And finally, the issue pretermitted in Neese v. Southern R. Co., 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/350/77" class="subref" title="subref">350 U. S. 77</a> (1955)
, was not Article III jurisdiction at all, but the substantive question whether the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvii" class="subref" title="subref">Seventh Amendment</a> permits a court to grant a motion for new trial on the basis of an excessive jury verdict.  We declined to consider that question because we agreed with the District Courts decision to deny the motion on the facts in the record.  The more numerous the look-alike-but-inapposite cases Justice Stevens cites, the more strikingly clear it becomes: his concurrence cannot identify a single opinion of ours deciding the merits before a disputed question of Article III jurisdiction.

						 Our opinion is not motivated, as Justice Stevens suggests, by the more specific separation-of-powers concern that this citizens suit somehow interferes with the Executives power to take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed, Art. II, §3, post, at 18.  The courts must stay within their constitutionally prescribed sphere of action, whether or not exceeding that sphere will harm one of the other two branches.  This case calls for nothing more than a straightforward application of our standing jurisprudence, which, though it may sometimes have an impact on presidential powers, derives from Article III and not Article II.

						 Contrary to Justice Stevens belief that redressability is a judicial creation of the past 25 years, post, at 14, the concept has been ingrained in our jurisprudence from the beginning.  Although we have packaged the requirements of constitutional case or controversy somewhat differently in the past 25 yearsan era rich in three-part teststhe point has always been the same: whether a plaintiff personally would benefit in a tangible way from the courts intervention.  Warth, supra, 422 U. S., at 508.  For example, in Marye v. Parsons, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/114/325" class="subref" title="subref">114 U. S. 325</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">328</a>329 (1885)
, we held that a bill in equity should have been dismissed because it was a clear case of damnum absque injuria.  Although the complainant alleged a breach of contract by the State, the complainant asks no relief as to that, for there is no remedy by suit to compel the State to pay its debts… .  The bill as framed, therefore, calls for a declaration of an abstract character.  Because courts do not sit[ ] to determine questions of law in thesi, we remanded with directions to dismiss the bill.  Id., at 328330.


Also contrary to Justice Stevens unprecedented suggestion, post, at 14, redressabilitylike the other prongs of the standing inquirydoes not depend on the defendants status as a governmental entity.  There is no conceivable reason why it should.  If it is true, as Justice Stevens claims, that all of the cases in which the Court has denied standing because of a lack of redressability happened to involve government action or inaction, that would be unsurprising.  Suits that promise no concrete benefit to the plaintiff, and that are brought to have us determine questions of law in thesi, Marye, supra, at 330, are most often inspired by the psychological smart of perceived official injustice, or by the government-policy preferences of political activists.  But the principle of redressability has broader application than that.

C. §11046(1)</a> (emphasis added).  Person includes an association, see §11049(7), so it is arguable that the statute permits respondent to vindicate only its own interests as an organization, and not the interests of its individual members.  Since it makes no difference to our disposition of the case, we assume without deciding that the interests of individual members may be the basis of suit.

						 Justice Stevens claims that redressability was found lacking in our prior cases because the relief required action by a party not before the Court.  Post, at 1516.  Even if that were so, it would not prove that redressability is lacking only when relief depends on the actions of a third party.  But in any event, Justice Stevens has overlooked decisions that destroy his premise.  See Lyons, 461 U. S., at 105; OShea v. Littleton, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/414/488" class="subref" title="subref">414 U. S. 488</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">495</a>496 (1974)
.  He also seems to suggest that redressability always exists when the defendant has directly injured the plaintiff.  If that were so, the redressability requirement would be entirely superfluous, since the causation requirement asks whether the injury is fairly … trace[able] to the challenged action of the defendant, and not … th[e] result [of] the independent action of some third party not before the court.  Simon v. Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Organization,

						 Justice Stevens contends, post, at 13, n. 16, that this argument involves us in a construction of the statute, and thus belies our insistence that jurisdictional issues be resolved first.  It involves us in a construction of the statute only to the extent of rejecting as frivolous the contention that costs incurred for respondents own purposes, not in preparation for litigation (and hence sufficient to support Article III standing) are nonetheless costs of litigation under the statute.  As we have described earlier, our cases make clear that frivolous claims are themselves a jurisdictional defect.  See supra, at 4.

				Respondent, an association of individuals interested in environmental protection, sued petitioner, a small manufacturing company in Chicago, for past violations of EPCRA.  EPCRA establishes a framework of state, regional and local agencies designed to inform the public about the presence of hazardous and toxic chemicals, and to provide for emergency response in the event of health-threatening release.  Central to its operation are reporting requirements compelling users of specified toxic and hazardous chemicals to file annual emergency and hazardous chemical inventory forms and toxic chemical release forms, which contain, 
				<em>
					inter alia
				</em>
				, the name and location of the facility, the name and quantity of the chemical on hand, and, in the case of toxic chemicals, the waste-disposal method employed and the annual quantity released into each environmental medium.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/11022.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §§11022</a> and 11023.  The hazardous-chemical inventory forms for any given calendar year are due the following March 1st, and the toxic-chemical release forms the following July 1st.  §§11022(a)(2) and 11023(a).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Enforcement of EPCRA can take place on many fronts.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has the most powerful enforcement arsenal: it may seek criminal, civil, or administrative penalties. §11045.  State and local governments can also seek civil penalties, as well as injunctive relief. §§11046(a)(2) and (c).  For purposes of this case, however, the crucial enforcement mechanism is the citizen-suit provision, §11046(a)(1), which likewise authorizes civil penalties and injunctive relief, see §11046(c).  This provides that any person may commence a civil action on his own behalf against … [a]n owner or operator of a facility for failure, among other things, to [c]omplete and submit an inventory form under section 11022(a) of this title … [and] section 11023(a) of this title.  §11046(a)(1).  As a prerequisite to bringing such a suit, the plaintiff must, 60 days prior to filing his complaint, give notice to the Administrator of the EPA, the State in which the alleged violation occurs, and the alleged violator.  §11046(d).  The citizen suit may not go forward if the Administrator has commenced and is diligently pursuing an administrative order or civil action to enforce the requirement concerned or to impose a civil penalty.  §11046(e).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In 1995 respondent sent a notice to petitioner, the Administrator, and the relevant Illinois authorities, allegingaccurately, as it turns outthat petitioner had failed since 1988, the first year of EPCRAs filing deadlines, to complete and to submit the requisite hazardous-chemical inventory and toxic-chemical release forms under §§11022 and 11023.  Upon receiving the notice, petitioner filed all of the overdue forms with the relevant agencies.  The EPA chose not to bring an action against petitioner, and when the 60-day waiting period expired, respondent filed suit in Federal District Court.  Petitioner promptly filed a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and (6), contending that, because its filings were up to date when the complaint was filed, the court had no jurisdiction to entertain a suit for a present violation; and that, because EPCRA does not allow suit for a purely historical violation, respondents allegation of untimeliness in filing was not a claim upon which relief could be granted.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The District Court agreed with petitioner on both points. App. to Pet. for Cert. A24A26. The Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that citizens may seek penalties against EPCRA violators who file after the statutory deadline and after receiving notice.  90 F. 3d 1237 (CA7 1996).  We granted certiorari, 519 U. S. ___ (1997).

				It is also the case that the 
				<em>

				</em>
				 opinion does not display the slightest awareness that anything 
				<em>
					turned upon
				</em>
				 whether the existence of a cause of action for past violations was technically jurisdictionalas indeed nothing of substance did.  The District Court had statutory jurisdiction over the suit in any event, since continuing violations were also alleged.  See 484 U. S., at 64.  It is true, as 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Stevens
				</span>
				 points out, that the issue of Article III standing which is addressed at the end of the opinion should technically have been addressed at the outset if the statutory question was not jurisdictional.  But that also did not really matter, since Article III standing was in any event found.  The short of the matter is that the jurisdictional character of the elements of the cause of action in 
				<em>

Of course, even if there were not solid precedent contradicting

				 analysis, §11046(c)s grant of jurisdiction in actions brought

				 [§11046(a)] withholds jurisdiction over claims involving purely past violations if past violations are not in fact 
				<em>

				 by §11046(a).  By parity of reasoning, if there is a dispute as to whether the omission of a particular item constituted a failure to complete the form; or as to whether a particular manner of delivery complied in time with the requirement to submit the form; and if the court agreed with the defendant on the point; the action would not be brought under [§11046(a)], and would be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction rather than decided on the merits.  Moreover, those statutory arguments, since they are jurisdictional, would have to be considered by this Court even though not raised earlier in the litigationindeed, this Court would have to raise them

				We decline to endorse such an approach because it carries the courts beyond the bounds of authorized judicial action and thus offends fundamental principles of separation of powers.  This conclusion should come as no surprise, since it is reflected in a long and venerable line of our cases.  Without jurisdiction the court cannot proceed at all in any cause.  Jurisdiction is power to declare the law, and when it ceases to exist, the only function remaining to the court is that of announcing the fact and dismissing the cause.

				  Both are readily explained, we think, by their extraordinary procedural postures.  In 
				<em>
					Norton, 
				</em>
				the case came to us on direct appeal from a three-judge District Court, and the jurisdictional question was whether the action was properly brought in that forum rather than in an ordinary district court.  We declined to decide that jurisdictional question, because the merits question was decided 
				<em>
					in a companion case
				</em>
				, 
				<em>

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/427/495" class="subref" title="subref">427 U. S. 495</a> (1976)
, with the consequence that the jurisdictional question could have no effect on the outcome: If the three-judge court had been properly convened, we would have affirmed, and if not we would have vacated and remanded for a fresh decree from which an appeal could be taken to the Court of Appeals, the outcome of which was foreordained by 
				<em>

				<em>

				<em>

				</em>
				 did not use the pretermission of the jurisdictional question as a device for reaching a question of law that otherwise would have gone unaddressed.  Moreover, the Court seems to have regarded the merits judgment that it entered on the basis of 
				<em>
					Lucas
				</em>
				 as equivalent to a jurisdictional dismissal for failure to present a substantial federal question.  The Court said: This disposition 
				<em>
					[Lucas]
				</em>
				 renders the merits in the present case a decided issue and thus one no longer substantial in the jurisdictional sense.  427 U. S., at 530531.  We think it clear that this peculiar case, involving a merits issue dispositively resolved in a companion case, was not meant to overrule,

				, two centuries of jurisprudence affirming the necessity of determining jurisdiction before proceeding to the merits.  See

				<em>

				</em>
				 opinion.  The first thing to be observed about 
				<em>
					Avrech
				</em>
				 is that the supposed jurisdictional issue was technically not that.  The issue was whether a court-martial judgment could be attacked collaterally by a suit for back pay.  Although

				</em>
				 hardly permit it to be cited for the precedent-shattering general proposition that an easy merits question may be decided 
				<em>
					on the assumption
				</em>
				 of jurisdiction.  To the contrary, the fact that the Court ordered briefing on the jurisdictional question 
				<em>

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1343.html#3" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1343(3)</a> against the Commissioner of the Vermont Department of Social Welfare for deprivation of federal rights under color of state law by denying payments under a federally funded welfare program, the plaintiff could join a similar claim against the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare.  The merits issue of statutory construction involved in the claim against the Secretary was precisely the same as that involved in the claim against the Commissioner, and the Secretary (while challenging jurisdiction) assured the Court that he would comply with any judgment entered against the Commissioner.  The Courts disposition of the case was to dismiss the Secretarys appeal under what was then Court Rule 40(g), for failure to brief the jurisdictional question adequately.  Normally, the Court acknowledged, its obligation to inquire into the jurisdiction of the District Court might prevent this disposition.  But here, the Court concluded, the substantive issue decided by the District Court would have been decided by that court even if it had concluded that the Secretary was not properly a party, and the only practical difference that resulted … was that its injunction was directed against him as well as against [the Commissioner], which the Secretary has [not] properly contended to be wrongful before this Court.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1651.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1651</a>, and because there was no record to review.

				While some of the above cases must be acknowledged to have diluted the absolute purity of the rule that Article III jurisdiction is always an antecedent question, none of them even approaches approval of a doctrine of hypothetical jurisdiction that enables a court to resolve contested questions of law when its jurisdiction is in doubt.  Hypothetical jurisdiction produces nothing more than a hypothetical judgmentwhich comes to the same thing as an advisory opinion, disapproved by this Court from the beginning.

				Having reached the end of what seems like a long front walk, we finally arrive at the threshold jurisdictional question: whether respondent, the plaintiff below, has standing to sue.  Article III, §2 of the Constitution extends the judicial Power of the United States only to Cases and Controversies.   We have always taken this to mean cases and controversies of the sort traditionally amenable to and resolved by the judicial process.  
				<em>
					Muskrat
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 supra, 
				</em>
				at 356357.  Such a meaning is fairly implied by the text, since otherwise the purported restriction upon the judicial power would scarcely be a restriction at all.  Every criminal investigation conducted by the Executive is a case, and every policy issue resolved by congressional legislation involves a controversy.  These are not, however, the sort of cases and controversies that Article III, §2, refers to, since the Constitutions central mechanism of separation of powers depends largely upon common understanding of what activities are appropriate to legislatures, to executives, and to courts.

				v.

				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 560.  First and foremost, there must be alleged (and ultimately proven) an injury in facta harm suffered by the plaintiff that is concrete and actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical. 

				We turn now to the particulars of respondents complaint to see how it measures up to Article IIIs requirements.

				 App. 4.  It describes respondent as an organization that seeks, uses, and acquires data reported under EPCRA.  It says that respondent reports to its members and the public about storage and releases of toxic chemicals into the environment, advocates changes in environmental regulations and statutes, prepares reports for its members and the public, seeks the reduction of toxic chemicals and further seeks to promote the effective enforcement of environmental laws.  App. 5.  The complaint asserts that respondents right to know about [toxic chemical] releases and its interests in protecting and improving the environment and the health of its members have been, are being, and will be adversely affected by [petitioners] actions in failing to provide timely and required information under EPCRA.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  The complaint also alleges that respondents members, who live in or frequent the area near petitioners facility, use the EPRCA-reported information to learn about toxic chemical releases, the use of hazardous substances in their communities, to plan emergency preparedness in the event of accidents, and to attempt to reduce the toxic chemicals in areas in which they live, work and visit.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  The members safety, health, recreational, economic, aesthetic and environmental interests in the information, it is claimed, have been, are being, and will be adversely affected by [petitioners] actions in failing to file timely and required reports under EPCRA.

				As appears from the above, respondent asserts petitioners failure to provide EPCRA information in a timely fashion, and the lingering effects of that failure, as the injury in fact to itself and its members.  We have not had occasion to decide whether being deprived of information that is supposed to be disclosed under EPCRAor at least being deprived of it when one has a particular plan for its useis a concrete injury in fact that satisfies Article III.  Cf. 
				<em>

				 v.

				The complaint asks for (1) a declaratory judgment that petitioner violated EPCRA; (2) authorization to inspect periodically petitioners facility and records (with costs borne by petitioner); (3) an order requiring petitioner to provide respondent copies of all compliance reports submitted to the EPA; (4) an order requiring petitioner to pay civil penalties of $25,000 per day for each violation of §§11022 and 11023; (5) an award of all respondents costs, in connection with the investigation and prosecution of this matter, including reasonable attorney and expert witness fees, as authorized by Section 326(f) of [EPCRA]; and (6) any such further relief as the court deems appropriate.  App. 11.  None of the specific items of relief sought, and none that we can envision as appropriate under the general request, would serve to reimburse
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				respondent for losses caused by the late reporting,
				<span class="softbreak"></span>

				The first item, the request for a declaratory judgment that petitioner violated EPCRA, can be disposed of summarily.

				Item (4), the civil penalties authorized by the statute, see §11045(c), might be viewed as a sort of compensation or redress to respondent if they were payable to respondent.  But they are not.  These penaltiesthe only damages authorized by EPCRAare payable to the United States Treasury.  In requesting them, therefore, respondent seeks not remediation of its own injuryreimbursement for the costs it incurred as a result of the late filingbut vindication of the rule of lawthe undifferentiated public interest in faithful execution of EPCRA.

				Item (5), the investigation and prosecution costs as authorized by Section 326(f), would assuredly benefit respondent as opposed to the citizenry at large.  Obviously, however, a plaintiff cannot achieve standing to litigate a substantive issue by bringing suit for the cost of bringing suit.  The litigation must give the plaintiff some other benefit besides reimbursement of costs that are a byproduct of the litigation itself.  An interest in attorneys fees is … insufficient to create an Article III case or controversy where none exists on the merits of the underlying claim.

).  Respondent asserts that the investigation costs it seeks were incurred prior to the litigation, in digging up the emissions and storage information that petitioner should have filed, and that respondent needed for its own purposes.  See Brief for Respondent 3738.  The recovery of such expenses unrelated to litigation would assuredly support Article III standing, but the problem is that §326(f), which is the entitlement to monetary relief that the complaint invokes, covers only the costs of litigation.

				The remaining relief respondent seeks (item (2), giving respondent authority to inspect petitioners facility and records, and item (3), compelling petitioner to provide respondent copies of EPA compliance reports) is injunctive in nature.  It cannot conceivably remedy any past wrong but is aimed at deterring petitioner from violating EPCRA in the future.  See Brief for Respondent 36.  The latter objective can of course be remedial for Article III purposes, when threatened injury is one of the gravamens of the complaint.  If respondent had alleged a continuing violation or the imminence of a future violation, the injunctive relief requested would remedy that alleged harm.  But there is no such allegation hereand on the facts of the case, there seems no basis for it.  Nothing supports the requested injunctive relief except respondents generalized interest in deterrence, which is insufficient for purposes of Article III. See

				The United States, as

				 2728, and n. 11.  This makes a sword out of a shield.  The presumption the Government refers to has been applied to refute the assertion of mootness by a defendant who, when sued in a complaint that alleges present or threatened injury, ceases the complained-of activity.  See,

 ([T]he mootness exception for disputes capable of repetition yet evading review … will not revive a dispute which became moot before the action commenced).

						 Our disposition makes it appropriate to address the approach taken by this substantial body of court of appeals precedent.  The fact that Justice Stevens concurrence takes essentially the same approach makes his contention that this discussion is an excursion, and unnecessary to an explanation of our decision, post, at 10, particularly puzzling.

						 Justice Stevens thinks it illogical that a merits question can be given priority over a statutory standing question (National Railroad Passenger Corp.) and a statutory standing question can be given priority over an Article III question (the cases discussed post, at 46), but a merits question cannot be given priority over an Article III question.  See post, at 9, n. 12.  It seems to us no more illogical than many other broken circles that appear in life and the law: that Executive agreements may displace state law, for example, see United States v. Belmont, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/301/324" class="subref" title="subref">301 U. S. 324</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">330</a>331 (1937)
, and that unilateral presidential action (renunciation) may displace Executive agreements, does not produce the logical conclusion that unilateral presidential action may displace state law.  The reasons for allowing merits questions to be decided before statutory standing questions do not support allowing merits questions to be decided before Article III questions.  As National Railroad Passenger Corp. points out, the merits inquiry and the statutory standing inquiry often overlap,  414 U. S., at 456.  The question whether this plaintiff has a cause of action under the statute, and the question whether any plaintiff has a cause of action under the statute are closely connectedindeed, depending upon the asserted basis for lack of statutory standing, they are sometimes identical, so that it would be exceedingly artificial to draw a distinction between the two.  The same cannot be said of the Article III requirement of remediable injury in fact, which (except with regard to entirely frivolous claims) has nothing to do with the text of the statute relied upon.  Moreover, deciding whether any cause of action exists under a particular statute, rather than whether the particular plaintiff can sue, does not take the court into vast, uncharted realms of judicial opinion-giving; whereas the proposition that the court can reach a merits question when there is no Article III jurisdiction opens the door to all sorts of generalized grievances, Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to Stop the War, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/418/208" class="subref" title="subref">418 U. S. 208</a>,

						 Justice Stevens adds three cases to the list of those that might support hypothetical jurisdiction. Post, at 12, n. 15.  They are all inapposite.  In Moor v. County of Alameda, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/411/693" class="subref" title="subref">411 U. S. 693</a> (1973)
, we declined to decide whether a federal courts pendent jurisdiction extended to state law claims against a new party, because we agreed with the district courts discretionary declination of pendent jurisdiction.  Id., at 715716.  Thus, the case decided, not a merits question before a jurisdictional question, but a discretionary jurisdictional question before a nondiscretionary jurisdictional question.  Similarly in Ellis v. Dyson, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/421/426" class="subref" title="subref">421 U. S. 426</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">436</a> (1975)
, the authoritative ground of decision upon which the District Court relied in lieu of determining whether there was a case or controversy was Younger abstention, which we have treated as jurisdictional.  And finally, the issue pretermitted in Neese v. Southern R. Co., 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/350/77" class="subref" title="subref">350 U. S. 77</a> (1955)
, was not Article III jurisdiction at all, but the substantive question whether the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvii" class="subref" title="subref">Seventh Amendment</a> permits a court to grant a motion for new trial on the basis of an excessive jury verdict.  We declined to consider that question because we agreed with the District Courts decision to deny the motion on the facts in the record.  The more numerous the look-alike-but-inapposite cases Justice Stevens cites, the more strikingly clear it becomes: his concurrence cannot identify a single opinion of ours deciding the merits before a disputed question of Article III jurisdiction.

						 Our opinion is not motivated, as Justice Stevens suggests, by the more specific separation-of-powers concern that this citizens suit somehow interferes with the Executives power to take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed, Art. II, §3, post, at 18.  The courts must stay within their constitutionally prescribed sphere of action, whether or not exceeding that sphere will harm one of the other two branches.  This case calls for nothing more than a straightforward application of our standing jurisprudence, which, though it may sometimes have an impact on presidential powers, derives from Article III and not Article II.

						 Contrary to Justice Stevens belief that redressability is a judicial creation of the past 25 years, post, at 14, the concept has been ingrained in our jurisprudence from the beginning.  Although we have packaged the requirements of constitutional case or controversy somewhat differently in the past 25 yearsan era rich in three-part teststhe point has always been the same: whether a plaintiff personally would benefit in a tangible way from the courts intervention.  Warth, supra, 422 U. S., at 508.  For example, in Marye v. Parsons, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/114/325" class="subref" title="subref">114 U. S. 325</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">328</a>329 (1885)
, we held that a bill in equity should have been dismissed because it was a clear case of damnum absque injuria.  Although the complainant alleged a breach of contract by the State, the complainant asks no relief as to that, for there is no remedy by suit to compel the State to pay its debts… .  The bill as framed, therefore, calls for a declaration of an abstract character.  Because courts do not sit[ ] to determine questions of law in thesi, we remanded with directions to dismiss the bill.  Id., at 328330.


Also contrary to Justice Stevens unprecedented suggestion, post, at 14, redressabilitylike the other prongs of the standing inquirydoes not depend on the defendants status as a governmental entity.  There is no conceivable reason why it should.  If it is true, as Justice Stevens claims, that all of the cases in which the Court has denied standing because of a lack of redressability happened to involve government action or inaction, that would be unsurprising.  Suits that promise no concrete benefit to the plaintiff, and that are brought to have us determine questions of law in thesi, Marye, supra, at 330, are most often inspired by the psychological smart of perceived official injustice, or by the government-policy preferences of political activists.  But the principle of redressability has broader application than that.

C. §11046(1)</a> (emphasis added).  Person includes an association, see §11049(7), so it is arguable that the statute permits respondent to vindicate only its own interests as an organization, and not the interests of its individual members.  Since it makes no difference to our disposition of the case, we assume without deciding that the interests of individual members may be the basis of suit.

						 Justice Stevens claims that redressability was found lacking in our prior cases because the relief required action by a party not before the Court.  Post, at 1516.  Even if that were so, it would not prove that redressability is lacking only when relief depends on the actions of a third party.  But in any event, Justice Stevens has overlooked decisions that destroy his premise.  See Lyons, 461 U. S., at 105; OShea v. Littleton, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/414/488" class="subref" title="subref">414 U. S. 488</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">495</a>496 (1974)
.  He also seems to suggest that redressability always exists when the defendant has directly injured the plaintiff.  If that were so, the redressability requirement would be entirely superfluous, since the causation requirement asks whether the injury is fairly … trace[able] to the challenged action of the defendant, and not … th[e] result [of] the independent action of some third party not before the court.  Simon v. Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Organization,

						 Justice Stevens contends, post, at 13, n. 16, that this argument involves us in a construction of the statute, and thus belies our insistence that jurisdictional issues be resolved first.  It involves us in a construction of the statute only to the extent of rejecting as frivolous the contention that costs incurred for respondents own purposes, not in preparation for litigation (and hence sufficient to support Article III standing) are nonetheless costs of litigation under the statute.  As we have described earlier, our cases make clear that frivolous claims are themselves a jurisdictional defect.  See supra, at 4.

				Respondent, an association of individuals interested in environmental protection, sued petitioner, a small manufacturing company in Chicago, for past violations of EPCRA.  EPCRA establishes a framework of state, regional and local agencies designed to inform the public about the presence of hazardous and toxic chemicals, and to provide for emergency response in the event of health-threatening release.  Central to its operation are reporting requirements compelling users of specified toxic and hazardous chemicals to file annual emergency and hazardous chemical inventory forms and toxic chemical release forms, which contain, 
				<em>
					inter alia
				</em>
				, the name and location of the facility, the name and quantity of the chemical on hand, and, in the case of toxic chemicals, the waste-disposal method employed and the annual quantity released into each environmental medium.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/11022.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §§11022</a> and 11023.  The hazardous-chemical inventory forms for any given calendar year are due the following March 1st, and the toxic-chemical release forms the following July 1st.  §§11022(a)(2) and 11023(a).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Enforcement of EPCRA can take place on many fronts.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has the most powerful enforcement arsenal: it may seek criminal, civil, or administrative penalties. §11045.  State and local governments can also seek civil penalties, as well as injunctive relief. §§11046(a)(2) and (c).  For purposes of this case, however, the crucial enforcement mechanism is the citizen-suit provision, §11046(a)(1), which likewise authorizes civil penalties and injunctive relief, see §11046(c).  This provides that any person may commence a civil action on his own behalf against … [a]n owner or operator of a facility for failure, among other things, to [c]omplete and submit an inventory form under section 11022(a) of this title … [and] section 11023(a) of this title.  §11046(a)(1).  As a prerequisite to bringing such a suit, the plaintiff must, 60 days prior to filing his complaint, give notice to the Administrator of the EPA, the State in which the alleged violation occurs, and the alleged violator.  §11046(d).  The citizen suit may not go forward if the Administrator has commenced and is diligently pursuing an administrative order or civil action to enforce the requirement concerned or to impose a civil penalty.  §11046(e).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In 1995 respondent sent a notice to petitioner, the Administrator, and the relevant Illinois authorities, allegingaccurately, as it turns outthat petitioner had failed since 1988, the first year of EPCRAs filing deadlines, to complete and to submit the requisite hazardous-chemical inventory and toxic-chemical release forms under §§11022 and 11023.  Upon receiving the notice, petitioner filed all of the overdue forms with the relevant agencies.  The EPA chose not to bring an action against petitioner, and when the 60-day waiting period expired, respondent filed suit in Federal District Court.  Petitioner promptly filed a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and (6), contending that, because its filings were up to date when the complaint was filed, the court had no jurisdiction to entertain a suit for a present violation; and that, because EPCRA does not allow suit for a purely historical violation, respondents allegation of untimeliness in filing was not a claim upon which relief could be granted.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The District Court agreed with petitioner on both points. App. to Pet. for Cert. A24A26. The Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that citizens may seek penalties against EPCRA violators who file after the statutory deadline and after receiving notice.  90 F. 3d 1237 (CA7 1996).  We granted certiorari, 519 U. S. ___ (1997).

				It is also the case that the 
				<em>

				</em>
				 opinion does not display the slightest awareness that anything 
				<em>
					turned upon
				</em>
				 whether the existence of a cause of action for past violations was technically jurisdictionalas indeed nothing of substance did.  The District Court had statutory jurisdiction over the suit in any event, since continuing violations were also alleged.  See 484 U. S., at 64.  It is true, as 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Stevens
				</span>
				 points out, that the issue of Article III standing which is addressed at the end of the opinion should technically have been addressed at the outset if the statutory question was not jurisdictional.  But that also did not really matter, since Article III standing was in any event found.  The short of the matter is that the jurisdictional character of the elements of the cause of action in 
				<em>

Of course, even if there were not solid precedent contradicting

				 analysis, §11046(c)s grant of jurisdiction in actions brought

				 [§11046(a)] withholds jurisdiction over claims involving purely past violations if past violations are not in fact 
				<em>

				 by §11046(a).  By parity of reasoning, if there is a dispute as to whether the omission of a particular item constituted a failure to complete the form; or as to whether a particular manner of delivery complied in time with the requirement to submit the form; and if the court agreed with the defendant on the point; the action would not be brought under [§11046(a)], and would be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction rather than decided on the merits.  Moreover, those statutory arguments, since they are jurisdictional, would have to be considered by this Court even though not raised earlier in the litigationindeed, this Court would have to raise them

				We decline to endorse such an approach because it carries the courts beyond the bounds of authorized judicial action and thus offends fundamental principles of separation of powers.  This conclusion should come as no surprise, since it is reflected in a long and venerable line of our cases.  Without jurisdiction the court cannot proceed at all in any cause.  Jurisdiction is power to declare the law, and when it ceases to exist, the only function remaining to the court is that of announcing the fact and dismissing the cause.

				  Both are readily explained, we think, by their extraordinary procedural postures.  In 
				<em>
					Norton, 
				</em>
				the case came to us on direct appeal from a three-judge District Court, and the jurisdictional question was whether the action was properly brought in that forum rather than in an ordinary district court.  We declined to decide that jurisdictional question, because the merits question was decided 
				<em>
					in a companion case
				</em>
				, 
				<em>

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/427/495" class="subref" title="subref">427 U. S. 495</a> (1976)
, with the consequence that the jurisdictional question could have no effect on the outcome: If the three-judge court had been properly convened, we would have affirmed, and if not we would have vacated and remanded for a fresh decree from which an appeal could be taken to the Court of Appeals, the outcome of which was foreordained by 
				<em>

				<em>

				<em>

				</em>
				 did not use the pretermission of the jurisdictional question as a device for reaching a question of law that otherwise would have gone unaddressed.  Moreover, the Court seems to have regarded the merits judgment that it entered on the basis of 
				<em>
					Lucas
				</em>
				 as equivalent to a jurisdictional dismissal for failure to present a substantial federal question.  The Court said: This disposition 
				<em>
					[Lucas]
				</em>
				 renders the merits in the present case a decided issue and thus one no longer substantial in the jurisdictional sense.  427 U. S., at 530531.  We think it clear that this peculiar case, involving a merits issue dispositively resolved in a companion case, was not meant to overrule,

				, two centuries of jurisprudence affirming the necessity of determining jurisdiction before proceeding to the merits.  See

				<em>

				</em>
				 opinion.  The first thing to be observed about 
				<em>
					Avrech
				</em>
				 is that the supposed jurisdictional issue was technically not that.  The issue was whether a court-martial judgment could be attacked collaterally by a suit for back pay.  Although

				</em>
				 hardly permit it to be cited for the precedent-shattering general proposition that an easy merits question may be decided 
				<em>
					on the assumption
				</em>
				 of jurisdiction.  To the contrary, the fact that the Court ordered briefing on the jurisdictional question 
				<em>

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1343.html#3" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1343(3)</a> against the Commissioner of the Vermont Department of Social Welfare for deprivation of federal rights under color of state law by denying payments under a federally funded welfare program, the plaintiff could join a similar claim against the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare.  The merits issue of statutory construction involved in the claim against the Secretary was precisely the same as that involved in the claim against the Commissioner, and the Secretary (while challenging jurisdiction) assured the Court that he would comply with any judgment entered against the Commissioner.  The Courts disposition of the case was to dismiss the Secretarys appeal under what was then Court Rule 40(g), for failure to brief the jurisdictional question adequately.  Normally, the Court acknowledged, its obligation to inquire into the jurisdiction of the District Court might prevent this disposition.  But here, the Court concluded, the substantive issue decided by the District Court would have been decided by that court even if it had concluded that the Secretary was not properly a party, and the only practical difference that resulted … was that its injunction was directed against him as well as against [the Commissioner], which the Secretary has [not] properly contended to be wrongful before this Court.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1651.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1651</a>, and because there was no record to review.

				While some of the above cases must be acknowledged to have diluted the absolute purity of the rule that Article III jurisdiction is always an antecedent question, none of them even approaches approval of a doctrine of hypothetical jurisdiction that enables a court to resolve contested questions of law when its jurisdiction is in doubt.  Hypothetical jurisdiction produces nothing more than a hypothetical judgmentwhich comes to the same thing as an advisory opinion, disapproved by this Court from the beginning.

				Having reached the end of what seems like a long front walk, we finally arrive at the threshold jurisdictional question: whether respondent, the plaintiff below, has standing to sue.  Article III, §2 of the Constitution extends the judicial Power of the United States only to Cases and Controversies.   We have always taken this to mean cases and controversies of the sort traditionally amenable to and resolved by the judicial process.  
				<em>
					Muskrat
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 supra, 
				</em>
				at 356357.  Such a meaning is fairly implied by the text, since otherwise the purported restriction upon the judicial power would scarcely be a restriction at all.  Every criminal investigation conducted by the Executive is a case, and every policy issue resolved by congressional legislation involves a controversy.  These are not, however, the sort of cases and controversies that Article III, §2, refers to, since the Constitutions central mechanism of separation of powers depends largely upon common understanding of what activities are appropriate to legislatures, to executives, and to courts.

				v.

				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 560.  First and foremost, there must be alleged (and ultimately proven) an injury in facta harm suffered by the plaintiff that is concrete and actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical. 

				We turn now to the particulars of respondents complaint to see how it measures up to Article IIIs requirements.

				 App. 4.  It describes respondent as an organization that seeks, uses, and acquires data reported under EPCRA.  It says that respondent reports to its members and the public about storage and releases of toxic chemicals into the environment, advocates changes in environmental regulations and statutes, prepares reports for its members and the public, seeks the reduction of toxic chemicals and further seeks to promote the effective enforcement of environmental laws.  App. 5.  The complaint asserts that respondents right to know about [toxic chemical] releases and its interests in protecting and improving the environment and the health of its members have been, are being, and will be adversely affected by [petitioners] actions in failing to provide timely and required information under EPCRA.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  The complaint also alleges that respondents members, who live in or frequent the area near petitioners facility, use the EPRCA-reported information to learn about toxic chemical releases, the use of hazardous substances in their communities, to plan emergency preparedness in the event of accidents, and to attempt to reduce the toxic chemicals in areas in which they live, work and visit.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  The members safety, health, recreational, economic, aesthetic and environmental interests in the information, it is claimed, have been, are being, and will be adversely affected by [petitioners] actions in failing to file timely and required reports under EPCRA.

				As appears from the above, respondent asserts petitioners failure to provide EPCRA information in a timely fashion, and the lingering effects of that failure, as the injury in fact to itself and its members.  We have not had occasion to decide whether being deprived of information that is supposed to be disclosed under EPCRAor at least being deprived of it when one has a particular plan for its useis a concrete injury in fact that satisfies Article III.  Cf. 
				<em>

				 v.

				The complaint asks for (1) a declaratory judgment that petitioner violated EPCRA; (2) authorization to inspect periodically petitioners facility and records (with costs borne by petitioner); (3) an order requiring petitioner to provide respondent copies of all compliance reports submitted to the EPA; (4) an order requiring petitioner to pay civil penalties of $25,000 per day for each violation of §§11022 and 11023; (5) an award of all respondents costs, in connection with the investigation and prosecution of this matter, including reasonable attorney and expert witness fees, as authorized by Section 326(f) of [EPCRA]; and (6) any such further relief as the court deems appropriate.  App. 11.  None of the specific items of relief sought, and none that we can envision as appropriate under the general request, would serve to reimburse
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				respondent for losses caused by the late reporting,
				<span class="softbreak"></span>

				The first item, the request for a declaratory judgment that petitioner violated EPCRA, can be disposed of summarily.

				Item (4), the civil penalties authorized by the statute, see §11045(c), might be viewed as a sort of compensation or redress to respondent if they were payable to respondent.  But they are not.  These penaltiesthe only damages authorized by EPCRAare payable to the United States Treasury.  In requesting them, therefore, respondent seeks not remediation of its own injuryreimbursement for the costs it incurred as a result of the late filingbut vindication of the rule of lawthe undifferentiated public interest in faithful execution of EPCRA.

				Item (5), the investigation and prosecution costs as authorized by Section 326(f), would assuredly benefit respondent as opposed to the citizenry at large.  Obviously, however, a plaintiff cannot achieve standing to litigate a substantive issue by bringing suit for the cost of bringing suit.  The litigation must give the plaintiff some other benefit besides reimbursement of costs that are a byproduct of the litigation itself.  An interest in attorneys fees is … insufficient to create an Article III case or controversy where none exists on the merits of the underlying claim.

).  Respondent asserts that the investigation costs it seeks were incurred prior to the litigation, in digging up the emissions and storage information that petitioner should have filed, and that respondent needed for its own purposes.  See Brief for Respondent 3738.  The recovery of such expenses unrelated to litigation would assuredly support Article III standing, but the problem is that §326(f), which is the entitlement to monetary relief that the complaint invokes, covers only the costs of litigation.

				The remaining relief respondent seeks (item (2), giving respondent authority to inspect petitioners facility and records, and item (3), compelling petitioner to provide respondent copies of EPA compliance reports) is injunctive in nature.  It cannot conceivably remedy any past wrong but is aimed at deterring petitioner from violating EPCRA in the future.  See Brief for Respondent 36.  The latter objective can of course be remedial for Article III purposes, when threatened injury is one of the gravamens of the complaint.  If respondent had alleged a continuing violation or the imminence of a future violation, the injunctive relief requested would remedy that alleged harm.  But there is no such allegation hereand on the facts of the case, there seems no basis for it.  Nothing supports the requested injunctive relief except respondents generalized interest in deterrence, which is insufficient for purposes of Article III. See

				The United States, as

				 2728, and n. 11.  This makes a sword out of a shield.  The presumption the Government refers to has been applied to refute the assertion of mootness by a defendant who, when sued in a complaint that alleges present or threatened injury, ceases the complained-of activity.  See,

 ([T]he mootness exception for disputes capable of repetition yet evading review … will not revive a dispute which became moot before the action commenced).

						 Our disposition makes it appropriate to address the approach taken by this substantial body of court of appeals precedent.  The fact that Justice Stevens concurrence takes essentially the same approach makes his contention that this discussion is an excursion, and unnecessary to an explanation of our decision, post, at 10, particularly puzzling.

						 Justice Stevens thinks it illogical that a merits question can be given priority over a statutory standing question (National Railroad Passenger Corp.) and a statutory standing question can be given priority over an Article III question (the cases discussed post, at 46), but a merits question cannot be given priority over an Article III question.  See post, at 9, n. 12.  It seems to us no more illogical than many other broken circles that appear in life and the law: that Executive agreements may displace state law, for example, see United States v. Belmont, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/301/324" class="subref" title="subref">301 U. S. 324</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">330</a>331 (1937)
, and that unilateral presidential action (renunciation) may displace Executive agreements, does not produce the logical conclusion that unilateral presidential action may displace state law.  The reasons for allowing merits questions to be decided before statutory standing questions do not support allowing merits questions to be decided before Article III questions.  As National Railroad Passenger Corp. points out, the merits inquiry and the statutory standing inquiry often overlap,  414 U. S., at 456.  The question whether this plaintiff has a cause of action under the statute, and the question whether any plaintiff has a cause of action under the statute are closely connectedindeed, depending upon the asserted basis for lack of statutory standing, they are sometimes identical, so that it would be exceedingly artificial to draw a distinction between the two.  The same cannot be said of the Article III requirement of remediable injury in fact, which (except with regard to entirely frivolous claims) has nothing to do with the text of the statute relied upon.  Moreover, deciding whether any cause of action exists under a particular statute, rather than whether the particular plaintiff can sue, does not take the court into vast, uncharted realms of judicial opinion-giving; whereas the proposition that the court can reach a merits question when there is no Article III jurisdiction opens the door to all sorts of generalized grievances, Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to Stop the War, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/418/208" class="subref" title="subref">418 U. S. 208</a>,

						 Justice Stevens adds three cases to the list of those that might support hypothetical jurisdiction. Post, at 12, n. 15.  They are all inapposite.  In Moor v. County of Alameda, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/411/693" class="subref" title="subref">411 U. S. 693</a> (1973)
, we declined to decide whether a federal courts pendent jurisdiction extended to state law claims against a new party, because we agreed with the district courts discretionary declination of pendent jurisdiction.  Id., at 715716.  Thus, the case decided, not a merits question before a jurisdictional question, but a discretionary jurisdictional question before a nondiscretionary jurisdictional question.  Similarly in Ellis v. Dyson, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/421/426" class="subref" title="subref">421 U. S. 426</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">436</a> (1975)
, the authoritative ground of decision upon which the District Court relied in lieu of determining whether there was a case or controversy was Younger abstention, which we have treated as jurisdictional.  And finally, the issue pretermitted in Neese v. Southern R. Co., 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/350/77" class="subref" title="subref">350 U. S. 77</a> (1955)
, was not Article III jurisdiction at all, but the substantive question whether the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvii" class="subref" title="subref">Seventh Amendment</a> permits a court to grant a motion for new trial on the basis of an excessive jury verdict.  We declined to consider that question because we agreed with the District Courts decision to deny the motion on the facts in the record.  The more numerous the look-alike-but-inapposite cases Justice Stevens cites, the more strikingly clear it becomes: his concurrence cannot identify a single opinion of ours deciding the merits before a disputed question of Article III jurisdiction.

						 Our opinion is not motivated, as Justice Stevens suggests, by the more specific separation-of-powers concern that this citizens suit somehow interferes with the Executives power to take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed, Art. II, §3, post, at 18.  The courts must stay within their constitutionally prescribed sphere of action, whether or not exceeding that sphere will harm one of the other two branches.  This case calls for nothing more than a straightforward application of our standing jurisprudence, which, though it may sometimes have an impact on presidential powers, derives from Article III and not Article II.

						 Contrary to Justice Stevens belief that redressability is a judicial creation of the past 25 years, post, at 14, the concept has been ingrained in our jurisprudence from the beginning.  Although we have packaged the requirements of constitutional case or controversy somewhat differently in the past 25 yearsan era rich in three-part teststhe point has always been the same: whether a plaintiff personally would benefit in a tangible way from the courts intervention.  Warth, supra, 422 U. S., at 508.  For example, in Marye v. Parsons, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/114/325" class="subref" title="subref">114 U. S. 325</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">328</a>329 (1885)
, we held that a bill in equity should have been dismissed because it was a clear case of damnum absque injuria.  Although the complainant alleged a breach of contract by the State, the complainant asks no relief as to that, for there is no remedy by suit to compel the State to pay its debts… .  The bill as framed, therefore, calls for a declaration of an abstract character.  Because courts do not sit[ ] to determine questions of law in thesi, we remanded with directions to dismiss the bill.  Id., at 328330.


Also contrary to Justice Stevens unprecedented suggestion, post, at 14, redressabilitylike the other prongs of the standing inquirydoes not depend on the defendants status as a governmental entity.  There is no conceivable reason why it should.  If it is true, as Justice Stevens claims, that all of the cases in which the Court has denied standing because of a lack of redressability happened to involve government action or inaction, that would be unsurprising.  Suits that promise no concrete benefit to the plaintiff, and that are brought to have us determine questions of law in thesi, Marye, supra, at 330, are most often inspired by the psychological smart of perceived official injustice, or by the government-policy preferences of political activists.  But the principle of redressability has broader application than that.

C. §11046(1)</a> (emphasis added).  Person includes an association, see §11049(7), so it is arguable that the statute permits respondent to vindicate only its own interests as an organization, and not the interests of its individual members.  Since it makes no difference to our disposition of the case, we assume without deciding that the interests of individual members may be the basis of suit.

						 Justice Stevens claims that redressability was found lacking in our prior cases because the relief required action by a party not before the Court.  Post, at 1516.  Even if that were so, it would not prove that redressability is lacking only when relief depends on the actions of a third party.  But in any event, Justice Stevens has overlooked decisions that destroy his premise.  See Lyons, 461 U. S., at 105; OShea v. Littleton, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/414/488" class="subref" title="subref">414 U. S. 488</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">495</a>496 (1974)
.  He also seems to suggest that redressability always exists when the defendant has directly injured the plaintiff.  If that were so, the redressability requirement would be entirely superfluous, since the causation requirement asks whether the injury is fairly … trace[able] to the challenged action of the defendant, and not … th[e] result [of] the independent action of some third party not before the court.  Simon v. Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Organization,

						 Justice Stevens contends, post, at 13, n. 16, that this argument involves us in a construction of the statute, and thus belies our insistence that jurisdictional issues be resolved first.  It involves us in a construction of the statute only to the extent of rejecting as frivolous the contention that costs incurred for respondents own purposes, not in preparation for litigation (and hence sufficient to support Article III standing) are nonetheless costs of litigation under the statute.  As we have described earlier, our cases make clear that frivolous claims are themselves a jurisdictional defect.  See supra, at 4.

				Respondent, an association of individuals interested in environmental protection, sued petitioner, a small manufacturing company in Chicago, for past violations of EPCRA.  EPCRA establishes a framework of state, regional and local agencies designed to inform the public about the presence of hazardous and toxic chemicals, and to provide for emergency response in the event of health-threatening release.  Central to its operation are reporting requirements compelling users of specified toxic and hazardous chemicals to file annual emergency and hazardous chemical inventory forms and toxic chemical release forms, which contain, 
				<em>
					inter alia
				</em>
				, the name and location of the facility, the name and quantity of the chemical on hand, and, in the case of toxic chemicals, the waste-disposal method employed and the annual quantity released into each environmental medium.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/11022.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §§11022</a> and 11023.  The hazardous-chemical inventory forms for any given calendar year are due the following March 1st, and the toxic-chemical release forms the following July 1st.  §§11022(a)(2) and 11023(a).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Enforcement of EPCRA can take place on many fronts.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has the most powerful enforcement arsenal: it may seek criminal, civil, or administrative penalties. §11045.  State and local governments can also seek civil penalties, as well as injunctive relief. §§11046(a)(2) and (c).  For purposes of this case, however, the crucial enforcement mechanism is the citizen-suit provision, §11046(a)(1), which likewise authorizes civil penalties and injunctive relief, see §11046(c).  This provides that any person may commence a civil action on his own behalf against … [a]n owner or operator of a facility for failure, among other things, to [c]omplete and submit an inventory form under section 11022(a) of this title … [and] section 11023(a) of this title.  §11046(a)(1).  As a prerequisite to bringing such a suit, the plaintiff must, 60 days prior to filing his complaint, give notice to the Administrator of the EPA, the State in which the alleged violation occurs, and the alleged violator.  §11046(d).  The citizen suit may not go forward if the Administrator has commenced and is diligently pursuing an administrative order or civil action to enforce the requirement concerned or to impose a civil penalty.  §11046(e).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In 1995 respondent sent a notice to petitioner, the Administrator, and the relevant Illinois authorities, allegingaccurately, as it turns outthat petitioner had failed since 1988, the first year of EPCRAs filing deadlines, to complete and to submit the requisite hazardous-chemical inventory and toxic-chemical release forms under §§11022 and 11023.  Upon receiving the notice, petitioner filed all of the overdue forms with the relevant agencies.  The EPA chose not to bring an action against petitioner, and when the 60-day waiting period expired, respondent filed suit in Federal District Court.  Petitioner promptly filed a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and (6), contending that, because its filings were up to date when the complaint was filed, the court had no jurisdiction to entertain a suit for a present violation; and that, because EPCRA does not allow suit for a purely historical violation, respondents allegation of untimeliness in filing was not a claim upon which relief could be granted.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The District Court agreed with petitioner on both points. App. to Pet. for Cert. A24A26. The Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that citizens may seek penalties against EPCRA violators who file after the statutory deadline and after receiving notice.  90 F. 3d 1237 (CA7 1996).  We granted certiorari, 519 U. S. ___ (1997).

				It is also the case that the 
				<em>

				</em>
				 opinion does not display the slightest awareness that anything 
				<em>
					turned upon
				</em>
				 whether the existence of a cause of action for past violations was technically jurisdictionalas indeed nothing of substance did.  The District Court had statutory jurisdiction over the suit in any event, since continuing violations were also alleged.  See 484 U. S., at 64.  It is true, as 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Stevens
				</span>
				 points out, that the issue of Article III standing which is addressed at the end of the opinion should technically have been addressed at the outset if the statutory question was not jurisdictional.  But that also did not really matter, since Article III standing was in any event found.  The short of the matter is that the jurisdictional character of the elements of the cause of action in 
				<em>

Of course, even if there were not solid precedent contradicting

				 analysis, §11046(c)s grant of jurisdiction in actions brought

				 [§11046(a)] withholds jurisdiction over claims involving purely past violations if past violations are not in fact 
				<em>

				 by §11046(a).  By parity of reasoning, if there is a dispute as to whether the omission of a particular item constituted a failure to complete the form; or as to whether a particular manner of delivery complied in time with the requirement to submit the form; and if the court agreed with the defendant on the point; the action would not be brought under [§11046(a)], and would be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction rather than decided on the merits.  Moreover, those statutory arguments, since they are jurisdictional, would have to be considered by this Court even though not raised earlier in the litigationindeed, this Court would have to raise them

				We decline to endorse such an approach because it carries the courts beyond the bounds of authorized judicial action and thus offends fundamental principles of separation of powers.  This conclusion should come as no surprise, since it is reflected in a long and venerable line of our cases.  Without jurisdiction the court cannot proceed at all in any cause.  Jurisdiction is power to declare the law, and when it ceases to exist, the only function remaining to the court is that of announcing the fact and dismissing the cause.

				  Both are readily explained, we think, by their extraordinary procedural postures.  In 
				<em>
					Norton, 
				</em>
				the case came to us on direct appeal from a three-judge District Court, and the jurisdictional question was whether the action was properly brought in that forum rather than in an ordinary district court.  We declined to decide that jurisdictional question, because the merits question was decided 
				<em>
					in a companion case
				</em>
				, 
				<em>

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/427/495" class="subref" title="subref">427 U. S. 495</a> (1976)
, with the consequence that the jurisdictional question could have no effect on the outcome: If the three-judge court had been properly convened, we would have affirmed, and if not we would have vacated and remanded for a fresh decree from which an appeal could be taken to the Court of Appeals, the outcome of which was foreordained by 
				<em>

				<em>

				<em>

				</em>
				 did not use the pretermission of the jurisdictional question as a device for reaching a question of law that otherwise would have gone unaddressed.  Moreover, the Court seems to have regarded the merits judgment that it entered on the basis of 
				<em>
					Lucas
				</em>
				 as equivalent to a jurisdictional dismissal for failure to present a substantial federal question.  The Court said: This disposition 
				<em>
					[Lucas]
				</em>
				 renders the merits in the present case a decided issue and thus one no longer substantial in the jurisdictional sense.  427 U. S., at 530531.  We think it clear that this peculiar case, involving a merits issue dispositively resolved in a companion case, was not meant to overrule,

				, two centuries of jurisprudence affirming the necessity of determining jurisdiction before proceeding to the merits.  See

				<em>

				</em>
				 opinion.  The first thing to be observed about 
				<em>
					Avrech
				</em>
				 is that the supposed jurisdictional issue was technically not that.  The issue was whether a court-martial judgment could be attacked collaterally by a suit for back pay.  Although

				</em>
				 hardly permit it to be cited for the precedent-shattering general proposition that an easy merits question may be decided 
				<em>
					on the assumption
				</em>
				 of jurisdiction.  To the contrary, the fact that the Court ordered briefing on the jurisdictional question 
				<em>

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1343.html#3" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1343(3)</a> against the Commissioner of the Vermont Department of Social Welfare for deprivation of federal rights under color of state law by denying payments under a federally funded welfare program, the plaintiff could join a similar claim against the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare.  The merits issue of statutory construction involved in the claim against the Secretary was precisely the same as that involved in the claim against the Commissioner, and the Secretary (while challenging jurisdiction) assured the Court that he would comply with any judgment entered against the Commissioner.  The Courts disposition of the case was to dismiss the Secretarys appeal under what was then Court Rule 40(g), for failure to brief the jurisdictional question adequately.  Normally, the Court acknowledged, its obligation to inquire into the jurisdiction of the District Court might prevent this disposition.  But here, the Court concluded, the substantive issue decided by the District Court would have been decided by that court even if it had concluded that the Secretary was not properly a party, and the only practical difference that resulted … was that its injunction was directed against him as well as against [the Commissioner], which the Secretary has [not] properly contended to be wrongful before this Court.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1651.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1651</a>, and because there was no record to review.

				While some of the above cases must be acknowledged to have diluted the absolute purity of the rule that Article III jurisdiction is always an antecedent question, none of them even approaches approval of a doctrine of hypothetical jurisdiction that enables a court to resolve contested questions of law when its jurisdiction is in doubt.  Hypothetical jurisdiction produces nothing more than a hypothetical judgmentwhich comes to the same thing as an advisory opinion, disapproved by this Court from the beginning.

				Having reached the end of what seems like a long front walk, we finally arrive at the threshold jurisdictional question: whether respondent, the plaintiff below, has standing to sue.  Article III, §2 of the Constitution extends the judicial Power of the United States only to Cases and Controversies.   We have always taken this to mean cases and controversies of the sort traditionally amenable to and resolved by the judicial process.  
				<em>
					Muskrat
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 supra, 
				</em>
				at 356357.  Such a meaning is fairly implied by the text, since otherwise the purported restriction upon the judicial power would scarcely be a restriction at all.  Every criminal investigation conducted by the Executive is a case, and every policy issue resolved by congressional legislation involves a controversy.  These are not, however, the sort of cases and controversies that Article III, §2, refers to, since the Constitutions central mechanism of separation of powers depends largely upon common understanding of what activities are appropriate to legislatures, to executives, and to courts.

				v.

				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 560.  First and foremost, there must be alleged (and ultimately proven) an injury in facta harm suffered by the plaintiff that is concrete and actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical. 

				We turn now to the particulars of respondents complaint to see how it measures up to Article IIIs requirements.

				 App. 4.  It describes respondent as an organization that seeks, uses, and acquires data reported under EPCRA.  It says that respondent reports to its members and the public about storage and releases of toxic chemicals into the environment, advocates changes in environmental regulations and statutes, prepares reports for its members and the public, seeks the reduction of toxic chemicals and further seeks to promote the effective enforcement of environmental laws.  App. 5.  The complaint asserts that respondents right to know about [toxic chemical] releases and its interests in protecting and improving the environment and the health of its members have been, are being, and will be adversely affected by [petitioners] actions in failing to provide timely and required information under EPCRA.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  The complaint also alleges that respondents members, who live in or frequent the area near petitioners facility, use the EPRCA-reported information to learn about toxic chemical releases, the use of hazardous substances in their communities, to plan emergency preparedness in the event of accidents, and to attempt to reduce the toxic chemicals in areas in which they live, work and visit.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  The members safety, health, recreational, economic, aesthetic and environmental interests in the information, it is claimed, have been, are being, and will be adversely affected by [petitioners] actions in failing to file timely and required reports under EPCRA.

				As appears from the above, respondent asserts petitioners failure to provide EPCRA information in a timely fashion, and the lingering effects of that failure, as the injury in fact to itself and its members.  We have not had occasion to decide whether being deprived of information that is supposed to be disclosed under EPCRAor at least being deprived of it when one has a particular plan for its useis a concrete injury in fact that satisfies Article III.  Cf. 
				<em>

				 v.

				The complaint asks for (1) a declaratory judgment that petitioner violated EPCRA; (2) authorization to inspect periodically petitioners facility and records (with costs borne by petitioner); (3) an order requiring petitioner to provide respondent copies of all compliance reports submitted to the EPA; (4) an order requiring petitioner to pay civil penalties of $25,000 per day for each violation of §§11022 and 11023; (5) an award of all respondents costs, in connection with the investigation and prosecution of this matter, including reasonable attorney and expert witness fees, as authorized by Section 326(f) of [EPCRA]; and (6) any such further relief as the court deems appropriate.  App. 11.  None of the specific items of relief sought, and none that we can envision as appropriate under the general request, would serve to reimburse
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				respondent for losses caused by the late reporting,
				<span class="softbreak"></span>

				The first item, the request for a declaratory judgment that petitioner violated EPCRA, can be disposed of summarily.

				Item (4), the civil penalties authorized by the statute, see §11045(c), might be viewed as a sort of compensation or redress to respondent if they were payable to respondent.  But they are not.  These penaltiesthe only damages authorized by EPCRAare payable to the United States Treasury.  In requesting them, therefore, respondent seeks not remediation of its own injuryreimbursement for the costs it incurred as a result of the late filingbut vindication of the rule of lawthe undifferentiated public interest in faithful execution of EPCRA.

				Item (5), the investigation and prosecution costs as authorized by Section 326(f), would assuredly benefit respondent as opposed to the citizenry at large.  Obviously, however, a plaintiff cannot achieve standing to litigate a substantive issue by bringing suit for the cost of bringing suit.  The litigation must give the plaintiff some other benefit besides reimbursement of costs that are a byproduct of the litigation itself.  An interest in attorneys fees is … insufficient to create an Article III case or controversy where none exists on the merits of the underlying claim.

).  Respondent asserts that the investigation costs it seeks were incurred prior to the litigation, in digging up the emissions and storage information that petitioner should have filed, and that respondent needed for its own purposes.  See Brief for Respondent 3738.  The recovery of such expenses unrelated to litigation would assuredly support Article III standing, but the problem is that §326(f), which is the entitlement to monetary relief that the complaint invokes, covers only the costs of litigation.

				The remaining relief respondent seeks (item (2), giving respondent authority to inspect petitioners facility and records, and item (3), compelling petitioner to provide respondent copies of EPA compliance reports) is injunctive in nature.  It cannot conceivably remedy any past wrong but is aimed at deterring petitioner from violating EPCRA in the future.  See Brief for Respondent 36.  The latter objective can of course be remedial for Article III purposes, when threatened injury is one of the gravamens of the complaint.  If respondent had alleged a continuing violation or the imminence of a future violation, the injunctive relief requested would remedy that alleged harm.  But there is no such allegation hereand on the facts of the case, there seems no basis for it.  Nothing supports the requested injunctive relief except respondents generalized interest in deterrence, which is insufficient for purposes of Article III. See

				The United States, as

				<em>
					Amicus Curiae
				</em>
				 2728, and n. 11.  This makes a sword out of a shield.  The presumption the Government refers to has been applied to refute the assertion of mootness by a defendant who, when sued in a complaint that alleges present or threatened injury, ceases the complained-of activity.  See,

 ([T]he mootness exception for disputes capable of repetition yet evading review … will not revive a dispute which became moot before the action commenced).

						 Our disposition makes it appropriate to address the approach taken by this substantial body of court of appeals precedent.  The fact that Justice Stevens concurrence takes essentially the same approach makes his contention that this discussion is an excursion, and unnecessary to an explanation of our decision, post, at 10, particularly puzzling.

						 Justice Stevens thinks it illogical that a merits question can be given priority over a statutory standing question (National Railroad Passenger Corp.) and a statutory standing question can be given priority over an Article III question (the cases discussed post, at 46), but a merits question cannot be given priority over an Article III question.  See post, at 9, n. 12.  It seems to us no more illogical than many other broken circles that appear in life and the law: that Executive agreements may displace state law, for example, see United States v. Belmont, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/301/324" class="subref" title="subref">301 U. S. 324</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">330</a>331 (1937)
, and that unilateral presidential action (renunciation) may displace Executive agreements, does not produce the logical conclusion that unilateral presidential action may displace state law.  The reasons for allowing merits questions to be decided before statutory standing questions do not support allowing merits questions to be decided before Article III questions.  As National Railroad Passenger Corp. points out, the merits inquiry and the statutory standing inquiry often overlap,  414 U. S., at 456.  The question whether this plaintiff has a cause of action under the statute, and the question whether any plaintiff has a cause of action under the statute are closely connectedindeed, depending upon the asserted basis for lack of statutory standing, they are sometimes identical, so that it would be exceedingly artificial to draw a distinction between the two.  The same cannot be said of the Article III requirement of remediable injury in fact, which (except with regard to entirely frivolous claims) has nothing to do with the text of the statute relied upon.  Moreover, deciding whether any cause of action exists under a particular statute, rather than whether the particular plaintiff can sue, does not take the court into vast, uncharted realms of judicial opinion-giving; whereas the proposition that the court can reach a merits question when there is no Article III jurisdiction opens the door to all sorts of generalized grievances, Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to Stop the War, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/418/208" class="subref" title="subref">418 U. S. 208</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">217</a> (1974)

						 Justice Stevens adds three cases to the list of those that might support hypothetical jurisdiction. Post, at 12, n. 15.  They are all inapposite.  In Moor v. County of Alameda, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/411/693" class="subref" title="subref">411 U. S. 693</a> (1973)
, we declined to decide whether a federal courts pendent jurisdiction extended to state law claims against a new party, because we agreed with the district courts discretionary declination of pendent jurisdiction.  Id., at 715716.  Thus, the case decided, not a merits question before a jurisdictional question, but a discretionary jurisdictional question before a nondiscretionary jurisdictional question.  Similarly in Ellis v. Dyson, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/421/426" class="subref" title="subref">421 U. S. 426</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">436</a> (1975)
, the authoritative ground of decision upon which the District Court relied in lieu of determining whether there was a case or controversy was Younger abstention, which we have treated as jurisdictional.  And finally, the issue pretermitted in Neese v. Southern R. Co., 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/350/77" class="subref" title="subref">350 U. S. 77</a> (1955)
, was not Article III jurisdiction at all, but the substantive question whether the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvii" class="subref" title="subref">Seventh Amendment</a> permits a court to grant a motion for new trial on the basis of an excessive jury verdict.  We declined to consider that question because we agreed with the District Courts decision to deny the motion on the facts in the record.  The more numerous the look-alike-but-inapposite cases Justice Stevens cites, the more strikingly clear it becomes: his concurrence cannot identify a single opinion of ours deciding the merits before a disputed question of Article III jurisdiction.

						 Our opinion is not motivated, as Justice Stevens suggests, by the more specific separation-of-powers concern that this citizens suit somehow interferes with the Executives power to take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed, Art. II, §3, post, at 18.  The courts must stay within their constitutionally prescribed sphere of action, whether or not exceeding that sphere will harm one of the other two branches.  This case calls for nothing more than a straightforward application of our standing jurisprudence, which, though it may sometimes have an impact on presidential powers, derives from Article III and not Article II.

					</a>
						 Contrary to Justice Stevens belief that redressability is a judicial creation of the past 25 years, post, at 14, the concept has been ingrained in our jurisprudence from the beginning.  Although we have packaged the requirements of constitutional case or controversy somewhat differently in the past 25 yearsan era rich in three-part teststhe point has always been the same: whether a plaintiff personally would benefit in a tangible way from the courts intervention.  Warth, supra, 422 U. S., at 508.  For example, in Marye v. Parsons, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/114/325" class="subref" title="subref">114 U. S. 325</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">328</a>329 (1885)
, we held that a bill in equity should have been dismissed because it was a clear case of damnum absque injuria.  Although the complainant alleged a breach of contract by the State, the complainant asks no relief as to that, for there is no remedy by suit to compel the State to pay its debts… .  The bill as framed, therefore, calls for a declaration of an abstract character.  Because courts do not sit[ ] to determine questions of law in thesi, we remanded with directions to dismiss the bill.  Id., at 328330.


Also contrary to Justice Stevens unprecedented suggestion, post, at 14, redressabilitylike the other prongs of the standing inquirydoes not depend on the defendants status as a governmental entity.  There is no conceivable reason why it should.  If it is true, as Justice Stevens claims, that all of the cases in which the Court has denied standing because of a lack of redressability happened to involve government action or inaction, that would be unsurprising.  Suits that promise no concrete benefit to the plaintiff, and that are brought to have us determine questions of law in thesi, Marye, supra, at 330, are most often inspired by the psychological smart of perceived official injustice, or by the government-policy preferences of political activists.  But the principle of redressability has broader application than that.

						 EPCRA states that any person may commence a civil action on his own behalf…  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/11046.html#1" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §11046(1)</a> (emphasis added).  Person includes an association, see §11049(7), so it is arguable that the statute permits respondent to vindicate only its own interests as an organization, and not the interests of its individual members.  Since it makes no difference to our disposition of the case, we assume without deciding that the interests of individual members may be the basis of suit.

						 Justice Stevens claims that redressability was found lacking in our prior cases because the relief required action by a party not before the Court.  Post, at 1516.  Even if that were so, it would not prove that redressability is lacking only when relief depends on the actions of a third party.  But in any event, Justice Stevens has overlooked decisions that destroy his premise.  See Lyons, 461 U. S., at 105; OShea v. Littleton, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/414/488" class="subref" title="subref">414 U. S. 488</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">495</a>496 (1974)
.  He also seems to suggest that redressability always exists when the defendant has directly injured the plaintiff.  If that were so, the redressability requirement would be entirely superfluous, since the causation requirement asks whether the injury is fairly … trace[able] to the challenged action of the defendant, and not … th[e] result [of] the independent action of some third party not before the court.  Simon v. Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Organization, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/426/26" class="subref" title="subref">426 U. S. 26</a>,

						 Justice Stevens contends, post, at 13, n. 16, that this argument involves us in a construction of the statute, and thus belies our insistence that jurisdictional issues be resolved first.  It involves us in a construction of the statute only to the extent of rejecting as frivolous the contention that costs incurred for respondents own purposes, not in preparation for litigation (and hence sufficient to support Article III standing) are nonetheless costs of litigation under the statute.  As we have described earlier, our cases make clear that frivolous claims are themselves a jurisdictional defect.  See supra, at 4.

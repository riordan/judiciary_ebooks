        <p class="bodytext">
				Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/8/1226.html#c" class="subref" title="subref">8 U. S. C. §1226(c)</a>, [t]he Attorney General shall take into custody any alien who is removable from this country because he has been convicted of one of a specified set of crimes, including an aggravated felony.  After respondent, a lawful permanent resident alien, was convicted in state court of first-degree burglary and, later, of petty theft with priors, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) charged him with being deportable from the United States in light of these convictions, and detained him pending his removal hearing.  Without disputing the validity of his convictions or the INS conclusion that he is deportable and therefore subject to mandatory detention under §1226(c), respondent filed a habeas corpus action challenging §1226(c) on the ground that his detention thereunder violated due process because the INS had made no determination that he posed either a danger to society or a flight risk.  The District Court agreed and granted respondents petition subject to the INS prompt undertaking of an individualized bond hearing, after which respondent was released on bond.  In affirming, the Ninth Circuit held that §1226(c) violates substantive due process as applied to respondent because he is a lawful permanent resident, the most favored category of aliens.   The court rejected the Governments two principal justifications for mandatory detention under §1226(c), discounting the firstensuring the presence of criminal aliens at their removal proceedingsupon finding that not all aliens detained pursuant to §1226(c) would ultimately be deported, and discounting the secondprotecting the public from dangerous criminal alienson the grounds that the aggravated felony classification triggering respondents detention included crimes (such as respondents) that the court did not consider egregious or otherwise sufficiently dangerous to the public to necessitate mandatory detention.  Relying on

            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/533/678" class="subref" title="subref">533 U. S. 678</a>, the court concluded that the INS had not provided a justification for no-bail civil detention sufficient to overcome a permanent resident aliens liberty interest.

				1. Section 1226(e)which states that [t]he Attorney Generals discretionary judgment regarding the application of this section shall not be subject to review and that [n]o court may set aside any action or decision by the Attorney General under this section regarding the detention or release of any aliendoes not deprive the federal courts of jurisdiction to grant habeas relief to aliens challenging their detention under §1226(c).  Respondent does not challenge a discretionary judgment by the Attorney General or a decision that the Attorney General has made regarding his detention or release.  Rather, respondent challenges the statutory framework that permits his detention without bail.  Where Congress intends to preclude judicial review of constitutional claims its intent to do so must be clear.  
				<em>
					E.g., Webster
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Doe,

				<em>
					St. Cyr,

				2. Congress, justifiably concerned with evidence that deportable criminal aliens who are not detained continue to engage in crime and fail to appear for their removal hearings in large numbers, may require that persons such as respondent be detained for the brief period necessary for their removal proceedings.  In the exercise of its broad power over naturalization and immigration, Congress regularly makes rules that would be unacceptable if applied to citizens.

            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/342/524" class="subref" title="subref">342 U. S. 524</a>.  The INS detention of respondent, a criminal alien who has conceded that he is deportable, for the limited period of his removal proceedings, is governed by these cases.  Respondent argues unpersuasively that the §1226(c) detention policy violates due process under 
				<em>
					Zadvydas, 
				</em>
				533 U. S.
				<em>
					, 
				</em>
				at 699, in which the Court held that §1231(a)(b) authorizes continued detention of an alien subject to a final removal order beyond that sections 90-day removal period for only such time as is reasonably necessary to secure the removal.  
				<em>
					Zadvydas
				</em>
				 is materially different from the present case in two respects.  First, the aliens there challenging their detention following final deportation orders were ones for whom removal was no longer practically attainable, such that their detention did not serve its purported immigration purpose.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 690.  In contrast, because the statutory provision at issue in this case governs detention of deportable criminal aliens 
				<em>
					pending their removal proceedings,
				</em>
				 the detention necessarily serves the purpose of preventing the aliens from fleeing prior to or during such proceedings.  Second, while the period of detention at issue in 
				<em>
					Zadvydas
				</em>
				 was indefinite and potentially permanent, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 690691, the record shows that 1226(c) detention not only has a definite termination point, but lasts, in the majority of cases, for less than the 90 days the Court considered presumptively valid in

In July 1996, he was convicted of first-degree burglary in state court in California and, in April 1997, he was convicted of a second crime, petty theft with priors.  The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) charged respondent with being deportable from the United States in light of these convictions, and detained him pending his removal hearing.

				The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed.  
				<em>
					Kim 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					Ziglar
				</em>
				, 276 F. 3d 523 (2002).  That court held that §1226(c) violates substantive due process as applied to respondent because he is a permanent resident alien.  
				<em>
					Id.,

				at 528.  It noted that permanent resident aliens constitute the most favored category of aliens and that they have the right to reside permanently in the United States, to work here, and to apply for citizenship.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  The court recognized and rejected the Governments two principal justifications for mandatory detention under §1226(c): (1) ensuring the presence of criminal aliens at their removal proceedings; and (2) protecting the public from dangerous criminal aliens.  The Court of Appeals discounted the first justification because it found that not all aliens detained pursuant to §1226(c) would ultimately be deported.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 531532
				.
				  And it discounted the second justification on the grounds that the aggravated felony classification triggering respondents detention included crimes that the court did not consider egregious or otherwise sufficiently dangerous to the public to necessitate mandatory detention.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 532533.  Respondents crimes of first-degree burglary (burglary of an inhabited dwelling) and petty theft, for instance, the Ninth Circuit dismissed as rather ordinary crimes.

				Having determined that the federal courts have jurisdiction to review a constitutional challenge to §1226(c), we proceed to review respondents claim.  Section 1226(c) mandates detention during removal proceedings for a limited class of deportable aliensincluding those convicted of an aggravated felony.  Congress adopted this provision against a backdrop of wholesale failure by the INS to deal with increasing rates of criminal activity by aliens.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 Criminal Aliens in the United States: Hearings before the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Senate Committee on Governmental
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				Affairs, 103d Cong., 1st Sess. (1993); S. Rep. No. 10448, p. 1 (1995) (hereinafter S. Rep. 10448) (confinement of criminal aliens alone cost $724 million in 1990).  Criminal aliens were the fastest growing segment of the federal prison population, already constituting roughly 25% of all federal prisoners, and they formed a rapidly rising share of state prison populations as well.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 69
				.  
				Congress investigations showed, however, that the INS could not even 
				<em>
					identify
				</em>
				 most deportable aliens, much less locate them and remove them from the country.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 1
				<em>
					.  
				</em>
				One study showed that, at the then-current rate of deportation, it would take 23 years to remove every criminal alien already subject to deportation.  
				<em>

				The agencys near-total inability to remove deportable criminal aliens imposed more than a monetary cost on the Nation.  First, as Congress explained, [a]liens who enter or remain in the United States in violation of our law are effectively taking immigration opportunities that might otherwise be extended to others.  S. Rep. No. 104249, p. 7 (1996).  Second, deportable criminal aliens who remained in the United States often committed more crimes before being removed.  One 1986 study showed that, after criminal aliens were identified as deportable, 77% were arrested at least once more and 45%nearly halfwere arrested multiple times before their deportation proceedings even began.  Hearing on H. R. 3333 before the Subcommittee on Immigration, Refugees, and International Law of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 101st Cong., 1st Sess., 54, 52 (1989) (hereinafter 1989 House Hearing); see also

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Congress also had before it evidence that one of the major causes of the INS failure to remove deportable criminal aliens was the agencys failure to detain those aliens during their deportation proceedings.  See Department of Justice, Office of the Inspector General, Immigration and Naturalization Service, Deportation of Aliens After Final Orders Have Been Issued, Rep. No. I9603 (Mar. 1996), App. 46 (hereinafter Inspection Report) (Detention is key to effective deportation); see also H. R. Rep. No. 104469, p. 123 (1995).  The Attorney General at the time had broad discretion to conduct individualized bond hearings and to release criminal aliens from custody during their removal proceedings when those aliens were determined not to present an excessive flight risk or threat to society.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/8/1252.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">8 U. S. C. §1252(a)</a> (1982 ed.).  Despite this discretion to conduct bond hearings, however, in practice the INS faced severe limitations on funding and detention space, which considerations affected its release determinations.  S. Rep. 10448, at 23 ([R]elease determinations are made by the INS in large part, according to the number of beds available in a particular region); see also Reply Brief for Petitioners 9.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Once released, more than 20% of deportable criminal aliens failed to appear for their removal hearings.  See S. Rep. 10448, at 2; see also Brief for Petitioners 19.

				  The Vera Institute study strongly supports Congress concern that, even with individualized screening, releasing deportable criminal aliens on bond would lead to an unacceptable rate of flight.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Congress amended the immigration laws several times toward the end of the 1980s.  In 1988, Congress limited the Attorney Generals discretion over custody determinations with respect to deportable aliens who had been convicted of aggravated felonies.  See Pub. L. 100690, Tit. VII, §7343(a), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">102</a>Stat.
4470.  Then, in 1990, Congress broadened the definition of aggravated felony, subjecting more criminal aliens to mandatory detention.  See Pub. L. 101649, Tit. V, §501(a), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">104</a>Stat.
5048.  At the same time, however, Congress added a new provision, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/8/1252.html#a_2_B" class="subref" title="subref">8 U. S. C. §1252(a)(2)(B)</a> (1988 ed., Supp. II), authorizing the Attorney General to release permanent resident aliens during their deportation proceedings where such aliens were found not to constitute a flight risk or threat to the community.

<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">104</a>Stat.

				During the same period in which Congress was making incremental changes to the immigration laws, it was also considering wholesale reform of those laws.  Some studies presented to Congress suggested that detention of criminal aliens during their removal proceedings might be the best way to ensure their successful removal from this country.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g

				.
				<em>

				It was following those Reports that Congress enacted 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/8/1226.html" class="subref" title="subref">8 U. S. C. §1226</a>, requiring the Attorney General to detain a subset of deportable criminal aliens pending a determination of their removability.

 the Court considered another due process challenge to detention during deportation proceedings.  The due process challenge there was brought by a class of alien juveniles.  The INS had arrested them and was holding them in custody pending their deportation hearings.  The aliens challenged the agencys policy of releasing detained alien juveniles only into the care of their parents, legal guardians, or certain other adult relatives.  See,

The aliens argued that the policy improperly relied upon a blanket presumption of the unsuitability of custodians other than parents, close relatives, and guardians to care for the detained juvenile aliens.  507 U. S., at 313.  In rejecting this argument, the Court emphasized that reasonable presumptions and generic rules, even when made by the INS rather than Congress, are not necessarily impermissible exercises of Congress traditional power to legislate with respect to aliens.  
				<em>

				In the present case, the statutory provision at issue governs detention of deportable criminal aliens 
				<em>
					pending their removal proceedings
				</em>
				.  Such detention necessarily serves the purpose of preventing deportable criminal aliens from fleeing prior to or during their removal proceedings, thus increasing the chance that, if ordered removed, the aliens will be successfully removed.  Respondent disagrees, arguing that there is no evidence that mandatory detention is necessary because the Government has never shown that individualized bond hearings would be ineffective.  See Brief for Respondent 14.  But as discussed above, see 
				<em>
					supra, 
				</em>
				at 67, in adopting §1226(c), Congress had before it evidence suggesting that permitting discretionary release of aliens pending their removal hearings would lead to large numbers of deportable criminal aliens skipping their hearings and remaining at large in the United States unlawfully.

				Respondent argues that these statistics are irrelevant and do not demonstrate that individualized bond hearings are ineffective or burdensome.  Brief for Respondent 33

				40.  It is of course true that when Congress enacted §1226, individualized bail determinations had not been tested under optimal conditions, or tested in all their possible permutations.  But when the Government deals with deportable aliens, the Due Process Clause does not require it to employ the least burdensome means to accomplish its goal.  The evidence Congress had before it certainly supports the approach it selected even if other, hypothetical studies might have suggested different courses of action.  Cf.,

Section 1226(c) authorizes detention of aliens who have committed certain crimes including, inter alia, any aggravated felony, §§1226(c)(1)(B), 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), and any two crimes involving moral turpitude, §§1226(c)(1)(B), 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii).

						 As respondent explained: The statute requires the [INS] to take into custody any alien who is deportable from the United States based on having been convicted of any of a wide range of crimes… .  [Respondent] does not challenge INSs authority to take him into custody after he finished serving his criminal sentence.  His challenge is solely to Section 1226(c)s absolute prohibition on his release from detention, even where, as here, the INS never asserted that he posed a danger or significant flight risk.  Brief in Opposition 12.

						 This Joseph hearing is immediately provided to a detainee who claims that he is not covered by §1226(c).  Tr. of Oral Arg. 22.  At the hearing, the detainee may avoid mandatory detention by demonstrating that he is not an alien, was not convicted of the predicate crime, or that the INS is otherwise substantially unlikely to establish that he is in fact subject to mandatory detention.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/8/3" class="subref" title="subref">8 CFR §3.19</a>(h)(2)(ii) (2002); In re Joseph, 22 I. &amp; N. Dec. 799 (1999).  Because respondent conceded that he was deportable because of a conviction that triggers §1226(c) and thus sought no Joseph hearing, we have no occasion to review the adequacy of Joseph hearings generally in screening out those who are improperly detained pursuant to §1226(c).  Such individualized review is available, however, and the dissent is mistaken if it means to suggest otherwise.  See post, at 17, 20 (opinion of Souter, J.).

						 Although the Attorney General had authority to release these aliens on bond, it is not clear that all of the aliens released were in fact given individualized bond hearings.  See Brief for Petitioners 19 ([M]ore than 20% of criminal aliens who were released on bond or otherwise not kept in custody throughout their deportation proceedings failed to appear for those proceedings), citing S. Rep. 10448, at 2 (emphasis added).  The evidence does suggest, however, that many deportable criminal aliens in this released criminal aliens sample received such determinations.  See Brief for Petitioners 19 (noting that, for aliens not evaluated for flight risk at a bond hearing, the prehearing skip rate doubled to 40%).

						 The dissent also claims that the study demonstrated that 92% of criminal aliens … who were released under supervisory conditions attended all of their hearings.  Post, at 27 (opinion of Souter, J.).  The study did manage to raise the appearance rate for criminal aliens through a supervision program known as the Appearance Assistance Program (AAP).  But the AAP study is of limited value.  First, the study included only 16 aliens who, like respondent, were released from prison and charged with being deportable on the basis of an aggravated felony.  1 Vera Institute of Justice, Testing Community Supervision for the INS: An Evaluation of the Appearance Assistance Program, pp. 3334, 36 (Aug. 1, 2000).  In addition, all 127 aliens in the AAP study were admitted into the study group only after being screened for strength of family and community ties, appearance rates in prior legal proceedings, and eligibility to apply for a legal remedy.  Id., at 13; see also id., at 37.  Following this selection process, supervision staff were in frequent, ongoing communication with participants, id., at 14, through, among other things, required reporting sessions, periodic home visits, and assistance in retaining legal representation.  Id., at 4142.  And, in any event, respondent seeks an individualized bond hearing, not community supervision. The dissents claim that criminal aliens released under supervisory conditions are likely to attend their hearings, post, at 27, therefore, is totally beside the point.

						 Respondents concession on this score is relevant for two reasons:  First, because of the concession, respondent by his own choice did not receive one of the procedural protections otherwise provided to aliens detained under §1226(c).  And, second, because of the concession we do not reach a contrary argument raised by respondent for the first time in his brief on the merits in this Court.  Specifically, in his brief on the merits, respondent suggests that he might not be subject to detention under §1226(c) after all because his 1997 conviction for petty theft with priors might not qualify as an aggravated felony under recent Ninth Circuit precedent.  Respondent now states that he intends to argue at his next removal hearing that his 1997 conviction does not constitute an aggravated felony … and his 1996 conviction [for first-degree burglary] does not constitute either an aggravated felony or a crime involving moral turpitude.  Brief for Respondent 1112.  As respondent has conceded that he is deportable for purposes of his habeas corpus challenge to §1226(c) at all previous stages of this proceeding, see n. 3, supra, we decide the case on that basis.  Lest there be any confusion, we emphasize that by conceding he is deportable and, hence, subject to mandatory detention under §1226(c), respondent did not concede that he will ultimately be deported.  As the dissent notes, respondent has applied for withholding of removal. Post, at 3 (opinion of Souter, J.).

						 Apart from its error with respect to the dangerousness determination, the dissent attempts to distinguish Carlson from the present case by arguing that the aliens in Carlson had engaged in  personal activity  in support of a political party Congress considered  a menace to the public.   Post, at 31 (opinion of Souter, J.).  In suggesting that this is a distinction, the dissent ignores the personal activity that aliens like respondent have undertaken in committing the crimes that subject them to detention in the first instancepersonal activity that has been determined with far greater procedural protections than any finding of active membership in the Communist Party involved in Carlson.  See 342 U. S., at 530 ([T]he Director made allegation[s], supported by affidavits, that the Services dossier of each petitioner contained evidence indicating to him that each was at the time of arrest a member of the Communist Party of the United States and had since 1930 participated … in the Partys indoctrination of others).  In the present case, respondent became deportable under §1226(c) only following criminal convictions that were secured following full procedural protections.  These convictions, moreover, reflect personal activity that Congress considered relevant to future dangerousness.  Cf. Zadvydas v. Davis,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">714</a> (2001)
 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (noting that a criminal record accumulated by an admitted alien is a good indicator of future danger, and that [a]ny suggestion that aliens who have completed prison terms no longer present a danger simply does not accord with the reality that a significant risk may still exist).

						 The dissent denies this point, insisting that the detention at issue in Zadvydas actually did bear a reasonable relation to its immigration purpose.  Post, at 23 (opinion of Souter, J.) ([T]he statute in Zadvydas … served the purpose of preventing aliens … from fleeing prior to actual deportation).

						 The dissent concedes that [t]he scheme considered in Zadvydas did not provide review immediately … . [C]ustody review hearings usually occurred within three months of a transfer to a postorder detention unit.  Post, at 17, n. 11 (opinion of Souter, J.).  Yet, in discussing the present case, the dissent insists that the due process requirement of an individualized finding of necessity applies to detention periods shorter than respondents.  Post, at 30, n. 24 (citing Schall v. Martin, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/467/253" class="subref" title="subref">467 U. S. 253</a> (1984)
, in which the detainee was entitled to a hearing when threatened with a maximum detention period of 17 days).  The dissent makes no attempt to reconcile its suggestion that aliens are entitled to an immediate hearing with the holding in Zadvydas permitting aliens to be detained for several months prior to such a hearing.

						 Congress has directed the INS to identify and track deportable criminal aliens while they are still in the criminal justice system, and to complete removal proceedings against them as promptly as possible.  See Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub. L. 10432, §§432, 438(a), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">110</a>Stat.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/8/1228.html" class="subref" title="subref">8 U. S. C. §1228</a>).  The INS therefore established the Institutional Hearing Program (IHP) (subsequently subsumed under the Institutional Removal Program).  By 1997, the General Accounting Office found that nearly half of all deportable criminal aliens cases were completed through the IHP prior to the aliens release from prison.  See General Accounting Office, Report to the Chairman, Subcommittee on Immigration and Claims of the House Committee on the Judiciary, INS Efforts to Remove Imprisoned Aliens Continue to Need to Improve 10, Fig. 1 (Oct. 1998).  The report urged, however, that the INS needed to improve its operations in order to complete removal proceedings against all deportable criminal aliens before their release.  Id., at 13.  Should this come to pass, of course, §1226(c) and the temporary detention it mandates would be rendered obsolete.

						 Prior to the enactment of §1226(c), when the vast majority of deportable criminal aliens were not detained during their deportation proceedings, many filed frivolous appeals in order to delay their deportation.  See S. Rep. 10448, at 2 (Delays can earn criminal aliens more than work permits and wagesif they delay long enough they may even obtain U. S. citizenship).  Cf. Zadvydas, 533 U. S., at 713 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) ([C]ourt ordered release cannot help but encourage dilatory and obstructive tactics by aliens).  Respondent contends that the length of detention required to appeal may deter aliens from exercising their right to do so.  Brief for Respondent 32.  As we have explained before, however, the legal system … is replete with situations requiring the making of difficult judgments as to which course to follow, and, even in the criminal context, there is no constitutional prohibition against requiring parties to make such choices.

Respondent is a citizen of the Republic of South Korea.  He entered the United States in 1984, at the age of six, and became a lawful permanent resident of the United States two years later.  In July 1996, he was convicted of first-degree burglary in state court in California and, in April 1997, he was convicted of a second crime, petty theft with priors.  The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) charged respondent with being deportable from the United States in light of these convictions, and detained him pending his removal hearing.

				<em>

				<em>

				, 276 F. 3d 523 (2002).  That court held that §1226(c) violates substantive due process as applied to respondent because he is a permanent resident alien.  
				<em>

				at 528.  It noted that permanent resident aliens constitute the most favored category of aliens and that they have the right to reside permanently in the United States, to work here, and to apply for citizenship.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  The court recognized and rejected the Governments two principal justifications for mandatory detention under §1226(c): (1) ensuring the presence of criminal aliens at their removal proceedings; and (2) protecting the public from dangerous criminal aliens.  The Court of Appeals discounted the first justification because it found that not all aliens detained pursuant to §1226(c) would ultimately be deported.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 531532
				.
				  And it discounted the second justification on the grounds that the aggravated felony classification triggering respondents detention included crimes that the court did not consider egregious or otherwise sufficiently dangerous to the public to necessitate mandatory detention.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 532533.  Respondents crimes of first-degree burglary (burglary of an inhabited dwelling) and petty theft, for instance, the Ninth Circuit dismissed as rather ordinary crimes.

				Having determined that the federal courts have jurisdiction to review a constitutional challenge to §1226(c), we proceed to review respondents claim.  Section 1226(c) mandates detention during removal proceedings for a limited class of deportable aliensincluding those convicted of an aggravated felony.  Congress adopted this provision against a backdrop of wholesale failure by the INS to deal with increasing rates of criminal activity by aliens.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 Criminal Aliens in the United States: Hearings before the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Senate Committee on Governmental
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				Affairs, 103d Cong., 1st Sess. (1993); S. Rep. No. 10448, p. 1 (1995) (hereinafter S. Rep. 10448) (confinement of criminal aliens alone cost $724 million in 1990).  Criminal aliens were the fastest growing segment of the federal prison population, already constituting roughly 25% of all federal prisoners, and they formed a rapidly rising share of state prison populations as well.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 69
				.  
				Congress investigations showed, however, that the INS could not even 
				<em>
					identify
				</em>
				 most deportable aliens, much less locate them and remove them from the country.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 1
				<em>
					.  
				</em>
				One study showed that, at the then-current rate of deportation, it would take 23 years to remove every criminal alien already subject to deportation.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 5.  Making matters worse, criminal aliens who were deported swiftly reentered the country illegally in great numbers.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 3.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The agencys near-total inability to remove deportable criminal aliens imposed more than a monetary cost on the Nation.  First, as Congress explained, [a]liens who enter or remain in the United States in violation of our law are effectively taking immigration opportunities that might otherwise be extended to others.  S. Rep. No. 104249, p. 7 (1996).  Second, deportable criminal aliens who remained in the United States often committed more crimes before being removed.  One 1986 study showed that, after criminal aliens were identified as deportable, 77% were arrested at least once more and 45%nearly halfwere arrested multiple times before their deportation proceedings even began.  Hearing on H. R. 3333 before the Subcommittee on Immigration, Refugees, and International Law of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 101st Cong., 1st Sess., 54, 52 (1989) (hereinafter 1989 House Hearing); see also 
				<em>

				 533 U. S., at 713714 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Kennedy
				</span>
				, J., dissenting) (discussing high rates of recidivism for released criminal aliens).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Congress also had before it evidence that one of the major causes of the INS failure to remove deportable criminal aliens was the agencys failure to detain those aliens during their deportation proceedings.  See Department of Justice, Office of the Inspector General, Immigration and Naturalization Service, Deportation of Aliens After Final Orders Have Been Issued, Rep. No. I9603 (Mar. 1996), App. 46 (hereinafter Inspection Report) (Detention is key to effective deportation); see also H. R. Rep. No. 104469, p. 123 (1995).  The Attorney General at the time had broad discretion to conduct individualized bond hearings and to release criminal aliens from custody during their removal proceedings when those aliens were determined not to present an excessive flight risk or threat to society.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/8/1252.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">8 U. S. C. §1252(a)</a> (1982 ed.).  Despite this discretion to conduct bond hearings, however, in practice the INS faced severe limitations on funding and detention space, which considerations affected its release determinations.  S. Rep. 10448, at 23 ([R]elease determinations are made by the INS in large part, according to the number of beds available in a particular region); see also Reply Brief for Petitioners 9.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Once released, more than 20% of deportable criminal aliens failed to appear for their removal hearings.  See S. Rep. 10448, at 2; see also Brief for Petitioners 19.

				<em>

				<em>
					Post, 
				</em>
				at 27.  This findingthat one out of four criminal aliens released on bond absconded prior to the completion of his removal proceedingsis even more striking than the one-in-five flight rate reflected in the evidence before Congress when it adopted §1226(c).

				  The Vera Institute study strongly supports Congress concern that, even with individualized screening, releasing deportable criminal aliens on bond would lead to an unacceptable rate of flight.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Congress amended the immigration laws several times toward the end of the 1980s.  In 1988, Congress limited the Attorney Generals discretion over custody determinations with respect to deportable aliens who had been convicted of aggravated felonies.  See Pub. L. 100690, Tit. VII, §7343(a), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">102</a>Stat.
4470.  Then, in 1990, Congress broadened the definition of aggravated felony, subjecting more criminal aliens to mandatory detention.  See Pub. L. 101649, Tit. V, §501(a), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">104</a>Stat.
5048.  At the same time, however, Congress added a new provision, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/8/1252.html#a_2_B" class="subref" title="subref">8 U. S. C. §1252(a)(2)(B)</a> (1988 ed., Supp. II), authorizing the Attorney General to release permanent resident aliens during their deportation proceedings where such aliens were found not to constitute a flight risk or threat to the community.  See Pub. L. 101649, Tit. V, §504(a)(5), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">104</a>Stat.
5049.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				During the same period in which Congress was making incremental changes to the immigration laws, it was also considering wholesale reform of those laws.  Some studies presented to Congress suggested that detention of criminal aliens during their removal proceedings might be the best way to ensure their successful removal from this country.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g
				</em>
				.
				<em>
					,
				</em>
				 1989 House Hearing 75; Inspection Report, App. 46; S. Rep. 10448, at 32 (Congress should consider requiring that all aggravated felons be detained pending deportation.  Such a step may be necessary because of the high rate of no-shows for those criminal aliens released on bond).
				  
				It was following those Reports that Congress enacted 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/8/1226.html" class="subref" title="subref">8 U. S. C. §1226</a>, requiring the Attorney General to detain a subset of deportable criminal aliens pending a determination of their removability.

 the Court considered another due process challenge to detention during deportation proceedings.  The due process challenge there was brought by a class of alien juveniles.  The INS had arrested them and was holding them in custody pending their deportation hearings.  The aliens challenged the agencys policy of releasing detained alien juveniles only into the care of their parents, legal guardians, or certain other adult relatives.  See, 
				<em>

				,

The aliens argued that the policy improperly relied upon a blanket presumption of the unsuitability of custodians other than parents, close relatives, and guardians to care for the detained juvenile aliens.  507 U.

In rejecting this argument, the Court emphasized that reasonable presumptions and generic rules, even when made by the INS rather than Congress, are not necessarily impermissible exercises of Congress traditional power to legislate with respect to aliens.

				In the present case, the statutory provision at issue governs detention of deportable criminal aliens 
				<em>
					pending their removal proceedings
				</em>
				.  Such detention necessarily serves the purpose of preventing deportable criminal aliens from fleeing prior to or during their removal proceedings, thus increasing the chance that, if ordered removed, the aliens will be successfully removed.  Respondent disagrees, arguing that there is no evidence that mandatory detention is necessary because the Government has never shown that individualized bond hearings would be ineffective.  See Brief for Respondent 14.  But as discussed above, see 
				<em>
					supra, 
				</em>
				at 67, in adopting §1226(c), Congress had before it evidence suggesting that permitting discretionary release of aliens pending their removal hearings would lead to large numbers of deportable criminal aliens skipping their hearings and remaining at large in the United States unlawfully.

				Respondent argues that these statistics are irrelevant and do not demonstrate that individualized bond hearings are ineffective or burdensome.  Brief for Respondent 33

				40.  It is of course true that when Congress enacted §1226, individualized bail determinations had not been tested under optimal conditions, or tested in all their possible permutations.  But when the Government deals with deportable aliens, the Due Process Clause does not require it to employ the least burdensome means to accomplish its goal.  The evidence Congress had before it certainly supports the approach it selected even if other, hypothetical studies might have suggested different courses of action.  Cf.,

						 This Joseph hearing is immediately provided to a detainee who claims that he is not covered by §1226(c).  Tr. of Oral Arg. 22.  At the hearing, the detainee may avoid mandatory detention by demonstrating that he is not an alien, was not convicted of the predicate crime, or that the INS is otherwise substantially unlikely to establish that he is in fact subject to mandatory detention.

Because respondent conceded that he was deportable because of a conviction that triggers §1226(c) and thus sought no Joseph hearing, we have no occasion to review the adequacy of Joseph hearings generally in screening out those who are improperly detained pursuant to §1226(c).  Such individualized review is available, however, and the dissent is mistaken if it means to suggest otherwise.  See post, at 17, 20 (opinion of Souter, J.).

						 Although the Attorney General had authority to release these aliens on bond, it is not clear that all of the aliens released were in fact given individualized bond hearings.  See Brief for Petitioners 19 ([M]ore than 20% of criminal aliens who were released on bond or otherwise not kept in custody throughout their deportation proceedings failed to appear for those proceedings), citing S. Rep. 10448, at 2 (emphasis added).  The evidence does suggest, however, that many deportable criminal aliens in this released criminal aliens sample received such determinations.  See Brief for Petitioners 19 (noting that, for aliens not evaluated for flight risk at a bond hearing, the prehearing skip rate doubled to 40%).

						 The dissent also claims that the study demonstrated that 92% of criminal aliens … who were released under supervisory conditions attended all of their hearings.  Post, at 27 (opinion of Souter, J.).  The study did manage to raise the appearance rate for criminal aliens through a supervision program known as the Appearance Assistance Program (AAP).  But the AAP study is of limited value.  First, the study included only 16 aliens who, like respondent, were released from prison and charged with being deportable on the basis of an aggravated felony.  1 Vera Institute of Justice, Testing Community Supervision for the INS: An Evaluation of the Appearance Assistance Program, pp. 3334, 36 (Aug. 1, 2000).  In addition, all 127 aliens in the AAP study were admitted into the study group only after being screened for strength of family and community ties, appearance rates in prior legal proceedings, and eligibility to apply for a legal remedy.  Id., at 13; see also id., at 37.  Following this selection process, supervision staff were in frequent, ongoing communication with participants, id., at 14, through, among other things, required reporting sessions, periodic home visits, and assistance in retaining legal representation.  Id., at 4142.  And, in any event, respondent seeks an individualized bond hearing, not community supervision. The dissents claim that criminal aliens released under supervisory conditions are likely to attend their hearings, post, at 27, therefore, is totally beside the point.

						 Respondents concession on this score is relevant for two reasons:  First, because of the concession, respondent by his own choice did not receive one of the procedural protections otherwise provided to aliens detained under §1226(c).  And, second, because of the concession we do not reach a contrary argument raised by respondent for the first time in his brief on the merits in this Court.  Specifically, in his brief on the merits, respondent suggests that he might not be subject to detention under §1226(c) after all because his 1997 conviction for petty theft with priors might not qualify as an aggravated felony under recent Ninth Circuit precedent.  Respondent now states that he intends to argue at his next removal hearing that his 1997 conviction does not constitute an aggravated felony … and his 1996 conviction [for first-degree burglary] does not constitute either an aggravated felony or a crime involving moral turpitude.  Brief for Respondent 1112.  As respondent has conceded that he is deportable for purposes of his habeas corpus challenge to §1226(c) at all previous stages of this proceeding, see n. 3, supra, we decide the case on that basis.  Lest there be any confusion, we emphasize that by conceding he is deportable and, hence, subject to mandatory detention under §1226(c), respondent did not concede that he will ultimately be deported.  As the dissent notes, respondent has applied for withholding of removal. Post, at 3 (opinion of Souter, J.).

						 Apart from its error with respect to the dangerousness determination, the dissent attempts to distinguish Carlson from the present case by arguing that the aliens in Carlson had engaged in  personal activity  in support of a political party Congress considered  a menace to the public.   Post, at 31 (opinion of Souter, J.).  In suggesting that this is a distinction, the dissent ignores the personal activity that aliens like respondent have undertaken in committing the crimes that subject them to detention in the first instancepersonal activity that has been determined with far greater procedural protections than any finding of active membership in the Communist Party involved in Carlson.  See 342 U. S., at 530 ([T]he Director made allegation[s], supported by affidavits, that the Services dossier of each petitioner contained evidence indicating to him that each was at the time of arrest a member of the Communist Party of the United States and had since 1930 participated … in the Partys indoctrination of others).  In the present case, respondent became deportable under §1226(c) only following criminal convictions that were secured following full procedural protections.  These convictions, moreover, reflect personal activity that Congress considered relevant to future dangerousness.  Cf. Zadvydas v. Davis, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/533/678" class="subref" title="subref">533 U. S. 678</a>,

 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (noting that a criminal record accumulated by an admitted alien is a good indicator of future danger, and that [a]ny suggestion that aliens who have completed prison terms no longer present a danger simply does not accord with the reality that a significant risk may still exist).

						 The dissent concedes that [t]he scheme considered in Zadvydas did not provide review immediately … . [C]ustody review hearings usually occurred within three months of a transfer to a postorder detention unit.  Post, at 17, n. 11 (opinion of Souter, J.).  Yet, in discussing the present case, the dissent insists that the due process requirement of an individualized finding of necessity applies to detention periods shorter than respondents.  Post, at 30, n. 24 (citing Schall v. Martin, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/467/253" class="subref" title="subref">467 U. S. 253</a> (1984)
, in which the detainee was entitled to a hearing when threatened with a maximum detention period of 17 days).  The dissent makes no attempt to reconcile its suggestion that aliens are entitled to an immediate hearing with the holding in Zadvydas permitting aliens to be detained for several months prior to such a hearing.

						 Congress has directed the INS to identify and track deportable criminal aliens while they are still in the criminal justice system, and to complete removal proceedings against them as promptly as possible.  See Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub. L. 10432, §§432, 438(a), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">110</a>Stat.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/8/1228.html" class="subref" title="subref">8 U. S. C. §1228</a>).  The INS therefore established the Institutional Hearing Program (IHP) (subsequently subsumed under the Institutional Removal Program).  By 1997, the General Accounting Office found that nearly half of all deportable criminal aliens cases were completed through the IHP prior to the aliens release from prison.  See General Accounting Office, Report to the Chairman, Subcommittee on Immigration and Claims of the House Committee on the Judiciary, INS Efforts to Remove Imprisoned Aliens Continue to Need to Improve 10, Fig. 1 (Oct. 1998).  The report urged, however, that the INS needed to improve its operations in order to complete removal proceedings against all deportable criminal aliens before their release.  Id., at 13.  Should this come to pass, of course, §1226(c) and the temporary detention it mandates would be rendered obsolete.

						 Prior to the enactment of §1226(c), when the vast majority of deportable criminal aliens were not detained during their deportation proceedings, many filed frivolous appeals in order to delay their deportation.  See S. Rep. 10448, at 2 (Delays can earn criminal aliens more than work permits and wagesif they delay long enough they may even obtain U. S. citizenship).  Cf. Zadvydas, 533 U. S., at 713 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) ([C]ourt ordered release cannot help but encourage dilatory and obstructive tactics by aliens).  Respondent contends that the length of detention required to appeal may deter aliens from exercising their right to do so.  Brief for Respondent 32.  As we have explained before, however, the legal system … is replete with situations requiring the making of difficult judgments as to which course to follow, and, even in the criminal context, there is no constitutional prohibition against requiring parties to make such choices.

In July 1996, he was convicted of first-degree burglary in state court in California and, in April 1997, he was convicted of a second crime, petty theft with priors.  The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) charged respondent with being deportable from the United States in light of these convictions, and detained him pending his removal hearing.

				.  The court recognized and rejected the Governments two principal justifications for mandatory detention under §1226(c): (1) ensuring the presence of criminal aliens at their removal proceedings; and (2) protecting the public from dangerous criminal aliens.  The Court of Appeals discounted the first justification because it found that not all aliens detained pursuant to §1226(c) would ultimately be deported.  
				<em>

				at 531532

				  And it discounted the second justification on the grounds that the aggravated felony classification triggering respondents detention included crimes that the court did not consider egregious or otherwise sufficiently dangerous to the public to necessitate mandatory detention.

				Having determined that the federal courts have jurisdiction to review a constitutional challenge to §1226(c), we proceed to review respondents claim.  Section 1226(c) mandates detention during removal proceedings for a limited class of deportable aliensincluding those convicted of an aggravated felony.  Congress adopted this provision against a backdrop of wholesale failure by the INS to deal with increasing rates of criminal activity by aliens.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 Criminal Aliens in the United States: Hearings before the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Senate Committee on Governmental
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				Affairs, 103d Cong., 1st Sess. (1993); S. Rep. No. 10448, p. 1 (1995) (hereinafter S. Rep. 10448) (confinement of criminal aliens alone cost $724 million in 1990).  Criminal aliens were the fastest growing segment of the federal prison population, already constituting roughly 25% of all federal prisoners, and they formed a rapidly rising share of state prison populations as well.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 69
				.  
				Congress investigations showed, however, that the INS could not even 
				<em>
					identify
				</em>
				 most deportable aliens, much less locate them and remove them from the country.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 1
				<em>
					.  
				</em>
				One study showed that, at the then-current rate of deportation, it would take 23 years to remove every criminal alien already subject to deportation.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 5.  Making matters worse, criminal aliens who were deported swiftly reentered the country illegally in great numbers.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 3.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The agencys near-total inability to remove deportable criminal aliens imposed more than a monetary cost on the Nation.  First, as Congress explained, [a]liens who enter or remain in the United States in violation of our law are effectively taking immigration opportunities that might otherwise be extended to others.  S. Rep. No. 104249, p. 7 (1996).  Second, deportable criminal aliens who remained in the United States often committed more crimes before being removed.  One 1986 study showed that, after criminal aliens were identified as deportable, 77% were arrested at least once more and 45%nearly halfwere arrested multiple times before their deportation proceedings even began.  Hearing on H. R. 3333 before the Subcommittee on Immigration, Refugees, and International Law of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 101st Cong., 1st Sess., 54, 52 (1989) (hereinafter 1989 House Hearing); see also

			</p>

				Congress also had before it evidence that one of the major causes of the INS failure to remove deportable criminal aliens was the agencys failure to detain those aliens during their deportation proceedings.  See Department of Justice, Office of the Inspector General, Immigration and Naturalization Service, Deportation of Aliens After Final Orders Have Been Issued, Rep. No. I9603 (Mar. 1996), App. 46 (hereinafter Inspection Report) (Detention is key to effective deportation); see also H. R. Rep. No. 104469, p. 123 (1995).  The Attorney General at the time had broad discretion to conduct individualized bond hearings and to release criminal aliens from custody during their removal proceedings when those aliens were determined not to present an excessive flight risk or threat to society.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/8/1252.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">8 U. S. C. §1252(a)</a> (1982 ed.).  Despite this discretion to conduct bond hearings, however, in practice the INS faced severe limitations on funding and detention space, which considerations affected its release determinations.  S. Rep. 10448, at 23 ([R]elease determinations are made by the INS in large part, according to the number of beds available in a particular region); see also Reply Brief for Petitioners 9.

				Congress amended the immigration laws several times toward the end of the 1980s.  In 1988, Congress limited the Attorney Generals discretion over custody determinations with respect to deportable aliens who had been convicted of aggravated felonies.  See Pub. L. 100690, Tit. VII, §7343(a), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">102</a>Stat.
4470.  Then, in 1990, Congress broadened the definition of aggravated felony, subjecting more criminal aliens to mandatory detention.  See Pub. L. 101649, Tit. V, §501(a), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">104</a>Stat.

				During the same period in which Congress was making incremental changes to the immigration laws, it was also considering wholesale reform of those laws.

 the Court considered another due process challenge to detention during deportation proceedings.  The due process challenge there was brought by a class of alien juveniles.  The INS had arrested them and was holding them in custody pending their deportation hearings.  The aliens challenged the agencys policy of releasing detained alien juveniles only into the care of their parents, legal guardians, or certain other adult relatives.  See,

The aliens argued that the policy improperly relied upon a blanket presumption of the unsuitability of custodians other than parents, close relatives, and guardians to care for the detained juvenile aliens.  507 U. S., at 313.  In rejecting this argument, the Court emphasized that reasonable presumptions and generic rules, even when made by the INS rather than Congress, are not necessarily impermissible exercises of Congress traditional power to legislate with respect to aliens.

				In the present case, the statutory provision at issue governs detention of deportable criminal aliens 
				<em>
					pending their removal proceedings
				</em>
				.  Such detention necessarily serves the purpose of preventing deportable criminal aliens from fleeing prior to or during their removal proceedings, thus increasing the chance that, if ordered removed, the aliens will be successfully removed.  Respondent disagrees, arguing that there is no evidence that mandatory detention is necessary because the Government has never shown that individualized bond hearings would be ineffective.  See Brief for Respondent 14.  But as discussed above, see 
				<em>
					supra, 
				</em>
				at 67, in adopting §1226(c), Congress had before it evidence suggesting that permitting discretionary release of aliens pending their removal hearings would lead to large numbers of deportable criminal aliens skipping their hearings and remaining at large in the United States unlawfully.

				Respondent argues that these statistics are irrelevant and do not demonstrate that individualized bond hearings are ineffective or burdensome.  Brief for Respondent 33

				40.  It is of course true that when Congress enacted §1226, individualized bail determinations had not been tested under optimal conditions, or tested in all their possible permutations.  But when the Government deals with deportable aliens, the Due Process Clause does not require it to employ the least burdensome means to accomplish its goal.  The evidence Congress had before it certainly supports the approach it selected even if other, hypothetical studies might have suggested different courses of action.  Cf.,

				  In those cases, the aliens involved are never subjected to mandatory detention at all.  In sum, the detention at stake under §1226(c) lasts roughly a month and a half in the vast majority of cases in which it is invoked, and about five months in the minority of cases in which the alien chooses to appeal.

Section 1226(c) authorizes detention of aliens who have committed certain crimes including, inter alia, any aggravated felony, §§1226(c)(1)(B), 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), and any two crimes involving moral turpitude, §§1226(c)(1)(B), 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii).  Although the INS initially included only respondents 1997 conviction in the charging document, it subsequently amended the immigration charges against him to include his 1996 conviction for first-degree burglary as another basis for mandatory detention and deportation.

						 As respondent explained: The statute requires the [INS] to take into custody any alien who is deportable from the United States based on having been convicted of any of a wide range of crimes… .  [Respondent] does not challenge INSs authority to take him into custody after he finished serving his criminal sentence.  His challenge is solely to Section 1226(c)s absolute prohibition on his release from detention, even where, as here, the INS never asserted that he posed a danger or significant flight risk.  Brief in Opposition 12.

						 This Joseph hearing is immediately provided to a detainee who claims that he is not covered by §1226(c).  Tr. of Oral Arg. 22.  At the hearing, the detainee may avoid mandatory detention by demonstrating that he is not an alien, was not convicted of the predicate crime, or that the INS is otherwise substantially unlikely to establish that he is in fact subject to mandatory detention.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/8/3" class="subref" title="subref">8 CFR §3.19</a>(h)(2)(ii) (2002); In re Joseph, 22 I. &amp; N. Dec. 799 (1999).  Because respondent conceded that he was deportable because of a conviction that triggers §1226(c) and thus sought no Joseph hearing, we have no occasion to review the adequacy of Joseph hearings generally in screening out those who are improperly detained pursuant to §1226(c).  Such individualized review is available, however, and the dissent is mistaken if it means to suggest otherwise.  See post, at 17, 20 (opinion of Souter, J.).

						 Although the Attorney General had authority to release these aliens on bond, it is not clear that all of the aliens released were in fact given individualized bond hearings.  See Brief for Petitioners 19 ([M]ore than 20% of criminal aliens who were released on bond or otherwise not kept in custody throughout their deportation proceedings failed to appear for those proceedings), citing S. Rep. 10448, at 2 (emphasis added).  The evidence does suggest, however, that many deportable criminal aliens in this released criminal aliens sample received such determinations.  See Brief for Petitioners 19 (noting that, for aliens not evaluated for flight risk at a bond hearing, the prehearing skip rate doubled to 40%).

						 The dissent also claims that the study demonstrated that 92% of criminal aliens … who were released under supervisory conditions attended all of their hearings.  Post, at 27 (opinion of Souter, J.).  The study did manage to raise the appearance rate for criminal aliens through a supervision program known as the Appearance Assistance Program (AAP).  But the AAP study is of limited value.  First, the study included only 16 aliens who, like respondent, were released from prison and charged with being deportable on the basis of an aggravated felony.  1 Vera Institute of Justice, Testing Community Supervision for the INS: An Evaluation of the Appearance Assistance Program, pp. 3334, 36 (Aug. 1, 2000).  In addition, all 127 aliens in the AAP study were admitted into the study group only after being screened for strength of family and community ties, appearance rates in prior legal proceedings, and eligibility to apply for a legal remedy.  Id., at 13; see also id., at 37.  Following this selection process, supervision staff were in frequent, ongoing communication with participants, id., at 14, through, among other things, required reporting sessions, periodic home visits, and assistance in retaining legal representation.  Id., at 4142.  And, in any event, respondent seeks an individualized bond hearing, not community supervision. The dissents claim that criminal aliens released under supervisory conditions are likely to attend their hearings, post, at 27, therefore, is totally beside the point.

						 Respondents concession on this score is relevant for two reasons:  First, because of the concession, respondent by his own choice did not receive one of the procedural protections otherwise provided to aliens detained under §1226(c).  And, second, because of the concession we do not reach a contrary argument raised by respondent for the first time in his brief on the merits in this Court.  Specifically, in his brief on the merits, respondent suggests that he might not be subject to detention under §1226(c) after all because his 1997 conviction for petty theft with priors might not qualify as an aggravated felony under recent Ninth Circuit precedent.  Respondent now states that he intends to argue at his next removal hearing that his 1997 conviction does not constitute an aggravated felony … and his 1996 conviction [for first-degree burglary] does not constitute either an aggravated felony or a crime involving moral turpitude.  Brief for Respondent 1112.  As respondent has conceded that he is deportable for purposes of his habeas corpus challenge to §1226(c) at all previous stages of this proceeding, see n. 3, supra, we decide the case on that basis.  Lest there be any confusion, we emphasize that by conceding he is deportable and, hence, subject to mandatory detention under §1226(c), respondent did not concede that he will ultimately be deported.  As the dissent notes, respondent has applied for withholding of removal. Post, at 3 (opinion of Souter, J.).

						 Apart from its error with respect to the dangerousness determination, the dissent attempts to distinguish Carlson from the present case by arguing that the aliens in Carlson had engaged in  personal activity  in support of a political party Congress considered  a menace to the public.   Post, at 31 (opinion of Souter, J.).  In suggesting that this is a distinction, the dissent ignores the personal activity that aliens like respondent have undertaken in committing the crimes that subject them to detention in the first instancepersonal activity that has been determined with far greater procedural protections than any finding of active membership in the Communist Party involved in Carlson.  See 342 U. S., at 530 ([T]he Director made allegation[s], supported by affidavits, that the Services dossier of each petitioner contained evidence indicating to him that each was at the time of arrest a member of the Communist Party of the United States and had since 1930 participated … in the Partys indoctrination of others).  In the present case, respondent became deportable under §1226(c) only following criminal convictions that were secured following full procedural protections.  These convictions, moreover, reflect personal activity that Congress considered relevant to future dangerousness.  Cf. Zadvydas v. Davis, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/533/678" class="subref" title="subref">533 U. S. 678</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">714</a> (2001)
 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (noting that a criminal record accumulated by an admitted alien is a good indicator of future danger, and that [a]ny suggestion that aliens who have completed prison terms no longer present a danger simply does not accord with the reality that a significant risk may still exist).

						 The dissent denies this point, insisting that the detention at issue in Zadvydas actually did bear a reasonable relation to its immigration purpose.  Post, at 23 (opinion of Souter, J.) ([T]he statute in Zadvydas … served the purpose of preventing aliens … from fleeing prior to actual deportation).

						 The dissent concedes that [t]he scheme considered in Zadvydas did not provide review immediately … . [C]ustody review hearings usually occurred within three months of a transfer to a postorder detention unit.  Post, at 17, n. 11 (opinion of Souter, J.).  Yet, in discussing the present case, the dissent insists that the due process requirement of an individualized finding of necessity applies to detention periods shorter than respondents.  Post, at 30, n. 24 (citing Schall v. Martin, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/467/253" class="subref" title="subref">467 U. S. 253</a> (1984)
, in which the detainee was entitled to a hearing when threatened with a maximum detention period of 17 days).  The dissent makes no attempt to reconcile its suggestion that aliens are entitled to an immediate hearing with the holding in Zadvydas permitting aliens to be detained for several months prior to such a hearing.

						 The very limited time of the detention at stake under §1226(c) is not missed by the dissent.  See post, at 30 (opinion of Souter, J.) (Successful challenges often require several months); post, at 30, (considering [t]he potential for several months [worth] of confinement); but see post, at 10 (potentially lengthy detention).

						 Congress has directed the INS to identify and track deportable criminal aliens while they are still in the criminal justice system, and to complete removal proceedings against them as promptly as possible.  See Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub. L. 10432, §§432, 438(a), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">110</a>Stat.
12731276; Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104208, §§326, 329,

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/8/1228.html" class="subref" title="subref">8 U. S. C. §1228</a>).  The INS therefore established the Institutional Hearing Program (IHP) (subsequently subsumed under the Institutional Removal Program).  By 1997, the General Accounting Office found that nearly half of all deportable criminal aliens cases were completed through the IHP prior to the aliens release from prison.  See General Accounting Office, Report to the Chairman, Subcommittee on Immigration and Claims of the House Committee on the Judiciary, INS Efforts to Remove Imprisoned Aliens Continue to Need to Improve 10, Fig. 1 (Oct. 1998).  The report urged, however, that the INS needed to improve its operations in order to complete removal proceedings against all deportable criminal aliens before their release.  Id., at 13.  Should this come to pass, of course, §1226(c) and the temporary detention it mandates would be rendered obsolete.

						 Prior to the enactment of §1226(c), when the vast majority of deportable criminal aliens were not detained during their deportation proceedings, many filed frivolous appeals in order to delay their deportation.  See S. Rep. 10448, at 2 (Delays can earn criminal aliens more than work permits and wagesif they delay long enough they may even obtain U. S. citizenship).  Cf. Zadvydas, 533 U. S., at 713 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) ([C]ourt ordered release cannot help but encourage dilatory and obstructive tactics by aliens).  Respondent contends that the length of detention required to appeal may deter aliens from exercising their right to do so.  Brief for Respondent 32.  As we have explained before, however, the legal system … is replete with situations requiring the making of difficult judgments as to which course to follow, and, even in the criminal context, there is no constitutional prohibition against requiring parties to make such choices.

The court recognized and rejected the Governments two principal justifications for mandatory detention under §1226(c): (1) ensuring the presence of criminal aliens at their removal proceedings; and (2) protecting the public from dangerous criminal aliens.

				Having determined that the federal courts have jurisdiction to review a constitutional challenge to §1226(c), we proceed to review respondents claim.  Section 1226(c) mandates detention during removal proceedings for a limited class of deportable aliensincluding those convicted of an aggravated felony.  Congress adopted this provision against a backdrop of wholesale failure by the INS to deal with increasing rates of criminal activity by aliens.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 Criminal Aliens in the United States: Hearings before the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Senate Committee on Governmental
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				Affairs, 103d Cong., 1st Sess. (1993); S. Rep. No. 10448, p. 1 (1995) (hereinafter S. Rep. 10448) (confinement of criminal aliens alone cost $724 million in 1990).  Criminal aliens were the fastest growing segment of the federal prison population, already constituting roughly 25% of all federal prisoners, and they formed a rapidly rising share of state prison populations as well.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 69
				.  
				Congress investigations showed, however, that the INS could not even 
				<em>
					identify
				</em>
				 most deportable aliens, much less locate them and remove them from the country.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 1
				<em>
					.  
				</em>
				One study showed that, at the then-current rate of deportation, it would take 23 years to remove every criminal alien already subject to deportation.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 5.  Making matters worse, criminal aliens who were deported swiftly reentered the country illegally in great numbers.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 3.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The agencys near-total inability to remove deportable criminal aliens imposed more than a monetary cost on the Nation.  First, as Congress explained, [a]liens who enter or remain in the United States in violation of our law are effectively taking immigration opportunities that might otherwise be extended to others.  S. Rep. No. 104249, p. 7 (1996).  Second, deportable criminal aliens who remained in the United States often committed more crimes before being removed.  One 1986 study showed that, after criminal aliens were identified as deportable, 77% were arrested at least once more and 45%nearly halfwere arrested multiple times before their deportation proceedings even began.  Hearing on H. R. 3333 before the Subcommittee on Immigration, Refugees, and International Law of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 101st Cong., 1st Sess., 54, 52 (1989) (hereinafter 1989 House Hearing); see also

				</span>
				, J., dissenting) (discussing high rates of recidivism for released criminal aliens).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Congress also had before it evidence that one of the major causes of the INS failure to remove deportable criminal aliens was the agencys failure to detain those aliens during their deportation proceedings.  See Department of Justice, Office of the Inspector General, Immigration and Naturalization Service, Deportation of Aliens After Final Orders Have Been Issued, Rep. No. I9603 (Mar. 1996), App. 46 (hereinafter Inspection Report) (Detention is key to effective deportation); see also H. R. Rep. No. 104469, p. 123 (1995).  The Attorney General at the time had broad discretion to conduct individualized bond hearings and to release criminal aliens from custody during their removal proceedings when those aliens were determined not to present an excessive flight risk or threat to society.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/8/1252.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">8 U. S. C. §1252(a)</a> (1982 ed.).  Despite this discretion to conduct bond hearings, however, in practice the INS faced severe limitations on funding and detention space, which considerations affected its release determinations.  S. Rep. 10448, at 23 ([R]elease determinations are made by the INS in large part, according to the number of beds available in a particular region); see also Reply Brief for Petitioners 9.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Once released, more than 20% of deportable criminal aliens failed to appear for their removal hearings.  See S. Rep. 10448, at 2; see also Brief for Petitioners 19.

				<em>

				</em>
				at 27.  This findingthat one out of four criminal aliens released on bond absconded prior to the completion of his removal proceedingsis even more striking than the one-in-five flight rate reflected in the evidence before Congress when it adopted §1226(c).

				  The Vera Institute study strongly supports Congress concern that, even with individualized screening, releasing deportable criminal aliens on bond would lead to an unacceptable rate of flight.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Congress amended the immigration laws several times toward the end of the 1980s.  In 1988, Congress limited the Attorney Generals discretion over custody determinations with respect to deportable aliens who had been convicted of aggravated felonies.  See Pub. L. 100690, Tit. VII, §7343(a), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">102</a>Stat.
4470.  Then, in 1990, Congress broadened the definition of aggravated felony, subjecting more criminal aliens to mandatory detention.  See Pub. L. 101649, Tit. V, §501(a), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">104</a>Stat.
5048.  At the same time, however, Congress added a new provision, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/8/1252.html#a_2_B" class="subref" title="subref">8 U. S. C. §1252(a)(2)(B)</a> (1988 ed., Supp. II), authorizing the Attorney General to release permanent resident aliens during their deportation proceedings where such aliens were found not to constitute a flight risk or threat to the community.  See Pub. L. 101649, Tit. V, §504(a)(5), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">104</a>Stat.
5049.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				During the same period in which Congress was making incremental changes to the immigration laws, it was also considering wholesale reform of those laws.  Some studies presented to Congress suggested that detention of criminal aliens during their removal proceedings might be the best way to ensure their successful removal from this country.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g
				</em>
				.
				<em>

				</em>

				It was following those Reports that Congress enacted 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/8/1226.html" class="subref" title="subref">8 U. S. C. §1226</a>, requiring the Attorney General to detain a subset of deportable criminal aliens pending a determination of their removability.

 the Court considered another due process challenge to detention during deportation proceedings.  The due process challenge there was brought by a class of alien juveniles.  The INS had arrested them and was holding them in custody pending their deportation hearings.  The aliens challenged the agencys policy of releasing detained alien juveniles only into the care of their parents, legal guardians, or certain other adult relatives.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 
				<em>

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/8/242" class="subref" title="subref">8 CFR §242.24</a> (1992))).  The aliens argued that the policy improperly relied upon a blanket presumption of the unsuitability of custodians other than parents, close relatives, and guardians to care for the detained juvenile aliens.  507 U. S., at 313.  In rejecting this argument, the Court emphasized that reasonable presumptions and generic rules, even when made by the INS rather than Congress, are not necessarily impermissible exercises of Congress traditional power to legislate with respect to aliens.

				In the present case, the statutory provision at issue governs detention of deportable criminal aliens 
				<em>
					pending their removal proceedings
				</em>
				.  Such detention necessarily serves the purpose of preventing deportable criminal aliens from fleeing prior to or during their removal proceedings, thus increasing the chance that, if ordered removed, the aliens will be successfully removed.  Respondent disagrees, arguing that there is no evidence that mandatory detention is necessary because the Government has never shown that individualized bond hearings would be ineffective.  See Brief for Respondent 14.  But as discussed above, see 
				<em>
					supra, 
				</em>
				at 67, in adopting §1226(c), Congress had before it evidence suggesting that permitting discretionary release of aliens pending their removal hearings would lead to large numbers of deportable criminal aliens skipping their hearings and remaining at large in the United States unlawfully.

				Respondent argues that these statistics are irrelevant and do not demonstrate that individualized bond hearings are ineffective or burdensome.  Brief for Respondent 33

				40.  It is of course true that when Congress enacted §1226, individualized bail determinations had not been tested under optimal conditions, or tested in all their possible permutations.  But when the Government deals with deportable aliens, the Due Process Clause does not require it to employ the least burdensome means to accomplish its goal.  The evidence Congress had before it certainly supports the approach it selected even if other, hypothetical studies might have suggested different courses of action.  Cf.,

						 This Joseph hearing is immediately provided to a detainee who claims that he is not covered by §1226(c).  Tr. of Oral Arg. 22.  At the hearing, the detainee may avoid mandatory detention by demonstrating that he is not an alien, was not convicted of the predicate crime, or that the INS is otherwise substantially unlikely to establish that he is in fact subject to mandatory detention.  See

Because respondent conceded that he was deportable because of a conviction that triggers §1226(c) and thus sought no Joseph hearing, we have no occasion to review the adequacy of Joseph hearings generally in screening out those who are improperly detained pursuant to §1226(c).  Such individualized review is available, however, and the dissent is mistaken if it means to suggest otherwise.  See post, at 17, 20 (opinion of Souter, J.).

						 Although the Attorney General had authority to release these aliens on bond, it is not clear that all of the aliens released were in fact given individualized bond hearings.  See Brief for Petitioners 19 ([M]ore than 20% of criminal aliens who were released on bond or otherwise not kept in custody throughout their deportation proceedings failed to appear for those proceedings), citing S. Rep. 10448, at 2 (emphasis added).  The evidence does suggest, however, that many deportable criminal aliens in this released criminal aliens sample received such determinations.  See Brief for Petitioners 19 (noting that, for aliens not evaluated for flight risk at a bond hearing, the prehearing skip rate doubled to 40%).

						 The dissent also claims that the study demonstrated that 92% of criminal aliens … who were released under supervisory conditions attended all of their hearings.  Post, at 27 (opinion of Souter, J.).  The study did manage to raise the appearance rate for criminal aliens through a supervision program known as the Appearance Assistance Program (AAP).  But the AAP study is of limited value.  First, the study included only 16 aliens who, like respondent, were released from prison and charged with being deportable on the basis of an aggravated felony.  1 Vera Institute of Justice, Testing Community Supervision for the INS: An Evaluation of the Appearance Assistance Program, pp. 3334, 36 (Aug. 1, 2000).  In addition, all 127 aliens in the AAP study were admitted into the study group only after being screened for strength of family and community ties, appearance rates in prior legal proceedings, and eligibility to apply for a legal remedy.  Id., at 13; see also id., at 37.  Following this selection process, supervision staff were in frequent, ongoing communication with participants, id., at 14, through, among other things, required reporting sessions, periodic home visits, and assistance in retaining legal representation.  Id., at 4142.  And, in any event, respondent seeks an individualized bond hearing, not community supervision. The dissents claim that criminal aliens released under supervisory conditions are likely to attend their hearings, post, at 27, therefore, is totally beside the point.

						 Respondents concession on this score is relevant for two reasons:  First, because of the concession, respondent by his own choice did not receive one of the procedural protections otherwise provided to aliens detained under §1226(c).  And, second, because of the concession we do not reach a contrary argument raised by respondent for the first time in his brief on the merits in this Court.  Specifically, in his brief on the merits, respondent suggests that he might not be subject to detention under §1226(c) after all because his 1997 conviction for petty theft with priors might not qualify as an aggravated felony under recent Ninth Circuit precedent.  Respondent now states that he intends to argue at his next removal hearing that his 1997 conviction does not constitute an aggravated felony … and his 1996 conviction [for first-degree burglary] does not constitute either an aggravated felony or a crime involving moral turpitude.  Brief for Respondent 1112.  As respondent has conceded that he is deportable for purposes of his habeas corpus challenge to §1226(c) at all previous stages of this proceeding, see n. 3, supra, we decide the case on that basis.  Lest there be any confusion, we emphasize that by conceding he is deportable and, hence, subject to mandatory detention under §1226(c), respondent did not concede that he will ultimately be deported.  As the dissent notes, respondent has applied for withholding of removal. Post, at 3 (opinion of Souter, J.).

						 Apart from its error with respect to the dangerousness determination, the dissent attempts to distinguish Carlson from the present case by arguing that the aliens in Carlson had engaged in  personal activity  in support of a political party Congress considered  a menace to the public.   Post, at 31 (opinion of Souter, J.).  In suggesting that this is a distinction, the dissent ignores the personal activity that aliens like respondent have undertaken in committing the crimes that subject them to detention in the first instancepersonal activity that has been determined with far greater procedural protections than any finding of active membership in the Communist Party involved in Carlson.  See 342 U. S., at 530 ([T]he Director made allegation[s], supported by affidavits, that the Services dossier of each petitioner contained evidence indicating to him that each was at the time of arrest a member of the Communist Party of the United States and had since 1930 participated … in the Partys indoctrination of others).  In the present case, respondent became deportable under §1226(c) only following criminal convictions that were secured following full procedural protections.  These convictions, moreover, reflect personal activity that Congress considered relevant to future dangerousness.  Cf. Zadvydas v. Davis,

 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (noting that a criminal record accumulated by an admitted alien is a good indicator of future danger, and that [a]ny suggestion that aliens who have completed prison terms no longer present a danger simply does not accord with the reality that a significant risk may still exist).

						 The dissent concedes that [t]he scheme considered in Zadvydas did not provide review immediately … . [C]ustody review hearings usually occurred within three months of a transfer to a postorder detention unit.  Post, at 17, n. 11 (opinion of Souter, J.).  Yet, in discussing the present case, the dissent insists that the due process requirement of an individualized finding of necessity applies to detention periods shorter than respondents.  Post, at 30, n. 24 (citing Schall v. Martin,

, in which the detainee was entitled to a hearing when threatened with a maximum detention period of 17 days).  The dissent makes no attempt to reconcile its suggestion that aliens are entitled to an immediate hearing with the holding in Zadvydas permitting aliens to be detained for several months prior to such a hearing.

						 Congress has directed the INS to identify and track deportable criminal aliens while they are still in the criminal justice system, and to complete removal proceedings against them as promptly as possible.

The INS therefore established the Institutional Hearing Program (IHP) (subsequently subsumed under the Institutional Removal Program).  By 1997, the General Accounting Office found that nearly half of all deportable criminal aliens cases were completed through the IHP prior to the aliens release from prison.

The report urged, however, that the INS needed to improve its operations in order to complete removal proceedings against all deportable criminal aliens before their release.  Id., at 13.  Should this come to pass, of course, §1226(c) and the temporary detention it mandates would be rendered obsolete.

						 Prior to the enactment of §1226(c), when the vast majority of deportable criminal aliens were not detained during their deportation proceedings, many filed frivolous appeals in order to delay their deportation.  See S. Rep. 10448, at 2 (Delays can earn criminal aliens more than work permits and wagesif they delay long enough they may even obtain U. S. citizenship).  Cf. Zadvydas, 533 U. S., at 713 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) ([C]ourt ordered release cannot help but encourage dilatory and obstructive tactics by aliens).  Respondent contends that the length of detention required to appeal may deter aliens from exercising their right to do so.  Brief for Respondent 32.  As we have explained before, however, the legal system … is replete with situations requiring the making of difficult judgments as to which course to follow, and, even in the criminal context, there is no constitutional prohibition against requiring parties to make such choices.

In July 1996, he was convicted of first-degree burglary in state court in California and, in April 1997, he was convicted of a second crime, petty theft with priors.  The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) charged respondent with being deportable from the United States in light of these convictions, and detained him pending his removal hearing.

				.  The court recognized and rejected the Governments two principal justifications for mandatory detention under §1226(c): (1) ensuring the presence of criminal aliens at their removal proceedings; and (2) protecting the public from dangerous criminal aliens.  The Court of Appeals discounted the first justification because it found that not all aliens detained pursuant to §1226(c) would ultimately be deported.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 531532
				.
				  And it discounted the second justification on the grounds that the aggravated felony classification triggering respondents detention included crimes that the court did not consider egregious or otherwise sufficiently dangerous to the public to necessitate mandatory detention.  
				<em>

				Having determined that the federal courts have jurisdiction to review a constitutional challenge to §1226(c), we proceed to review respondents claim.  Section 1226(c) mandates detention during removal proceedings for a limited class of deportable aliensincluding those convicted of an aggravated felony.  Congress adopted this provision against a backdrop of wholesale failure by the INS to deal with increasing rates of criminal activity by aliens.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 Criminal Aliens in the United States: Hearings before the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Senate Committee on Governmental
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				Affairs, 103d Cong., 1st Sess. (1993); S. Rep. No. 10448, p. 1 (1995) (hereinafter S. Rep. 10448) (confinement of criminal aliens alone cost $724 million in 1990).  Criminal aliens were the fastest growing segment of the federal prison population, already constituting roughly 25% of all federal prisoners, and they formed a rapidly rising share of state prison populations as well.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 69
				.  
				Congress investigations showed, however, that the INS could not even 
				<em>
					identify
				</em>
				 most deportable aliens, much less locate them and remove them from the country.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 1
				<em>
					.  
				</em>
				One study showed that, at the then-current rate of deportation, it would take 23 years to remove every criminal alien already subject to deportation.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 5.  Making matters worse, criminal aliens who were deported swiftly reentered the country illegally in great numbers.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 3.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The agencys near-total inability to remove deportable criminal aliens imposed more than a monetary cost on the Nation.  First, as Congress explained, [a]liens who enter or remain in the United States in violation of our law are effectively taking immigration opportunities that might otherwise be extended to others.  S. Rep. No. 104249, p. 7 (1996).  Second, deportable criminal aliens who remained in the United States often committed more crimes before being removed.  One 1986 study showed that, after criminal aliens were identified as deportable, 77% were arrested at least once more and 45%nearly halfwere arrested multiple times before their deportation proceedings even began.  Hearing on H. R. 3333 before the Subcommittee on Immigration, Refugees, and International Law of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 101st Cong., 1st Sess., 54, 52 (1989) (hereinafter 1989 House Hearing); see also 
				<em>

				 533 U. S., at 713714 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Kennedy
				</span>
				, J., dissenting) (discussing high rates of recidivism for released criminal aliens).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Congress also had before it evidence that one of the major causes of the INS failure to remove deportable criminal aliens was the agencys failure to detain those aliens during their deportation proceedings.  See Department of Justice, Office of the Inspector General, Immigration and Naturalization Service, Deportation of Aliens After Final Orders Have Been Issued, Rep. No. I9603 (Mar. 1996), App. 46 (hereinafter Inspection Report) (Detention is key to effective deportation); see also H. R. Rep. No. 104469, p. 123 (1995).  The Attorney General at the time had broad discretion to conduct individualized bond hearings and to release criminal aliens from custody during their removal proceedings when those aliens were determined not to present an excessive flight risk or threat to society.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/8/1252.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">8 U. S. C. §1252(a)</a> (1982 ed.).  Despite this discretion to conduct bond hearings, however, in practice the INS faced severe limitations on funding and detention space, which considerations affected its release determinations.  S. Rep. 10448, at 23 ([R]elease determinations are made by the INS in large part, according to the number of beds available in a particular region); see also Reply Brief for Petitioners 9.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Once released, more than 20% of deportable criminal aliens failed to appear for their removal hearings.  See S. Rep. 10448, at 2; see also Brief for Petitioners 19.

				at 27.  This findingthat one out of four criminal aliens released on bond absconded prior to the completion of his removal proceedingsis even more striking than the one-in-five flight rate reflected in the evidence before Congress when it adopted §1226(c).

				  The Vera Institute study strongly supports Congress concern that, even with individualized screening, releasing deportable criminal aliens on bond would lead to an unacceptable rate of flight.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Congress amended the immigration laws several times toward the end of the 1980s.  In 1988, Congress limited the Attorney Generals discretion over custody determinations with respect to deportable aliens who had been convicted of aggravated felonies.  See Pub. L. 100690, Tit. VII, §7343(a), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">102</a>Stat.
4470.  Then, in 1990, Congress broadened the definition of aggravated felony, subjecting more criminal aliens to mandatory detention.  See Pub. L. 101649, Tit. V, §501(a), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">104</a>Stat.
5048.  At the same time, however, Congress added a new provision, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/8/1252.html#a_2_B" class="subref" title="subref">8 U. S. C. §1252(a)(2)(B)</a> (1988 ed., Supp. II), authorizing the Attorney General to release permanent resident aliens during their deportation proceedings where such aliens were found not to constitute a flight risk or threat to the community.  See Pub. L. 101649, Tit. V, §504(a)(5), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">104</a>Stat.
5049.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				During the same period in which Congress was making incremental changes to the immigration laws, it was also considering wholesale reform of those laws.  Some studies presented to Congress suggested that detention of criminal aliens during their removal proceedings might be the best way to ensure their successful removal from this country.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g
				</em>
				.
				<em>
					,
				</em>

				It was following those Reports that Congress enacted 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/8/1226.html" class="subref" title="subref">8 U. S. C. §1226</a>, requiring the Attorney General to detain a subset of deportable criminal aliens pending a determination of their removability.

 the Court considered another due process challenge to detention during deportation proceedings.  The due process challenge there was brought by a class of alien juveniles.  The INS had arrested them and was holding them in custody pending their deportation hearings.  The aliens challenged the agencys policy of releasing detained alien juveniles only into the care of their parents, legal guardians, or certain other adult relatives.  See,

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/8/242" class="subref" title="subref">8 CFR §242.24</a> (1992))).  The aliens argued that the policy improperly relied upon a blanket presumption of the unsuitability of custodians other than parents, close relatives, and guardians to care for the detained juvenile aliens.  507 U. S., at 313.  In rejecting this argument, the Court emphasized that reasonable presumptions and generic rules, even when made by the INS rather than Congress, are not necessarily impermissible exercises of Congress traditional power to legislate with respect to aliens.  
				<em>

				In the present case, the statutory provision at issue governs detention of deportable criminal aliens 
				<em>
					pending their removal proceedings
				</em>
				.  Such detention necessarily serves the purpose of preventing deportable criminal aliens from fleeing prior to or during their removal proceedings, thus increasing the chance that, if ordered removed, the aliens will be successfully removed.  Respondent disagrees, arguing that there is no evidence that mandatory detention is necessary because the Government has never shown that individualized bond hearings would be ineffective.  See Brief for Respondent 14.  But as discussed above, see 
				<em>
					supra, 
				</em>
				at 67, in adopting §1226(c), Congress had before it evidence suggesting that permitting discretionary release of aliens pending their removal hearings would lead to large numbers of deportable criminal aliens skipping their hearings and remaining at large in the United States unlawfully.

				Respondent argues that these statistics are irrelevant and do not demonstrate that individualized bond hearings are ineffective or burdensome.  Brief for Respondent 33
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				40.  It is of course true that when Congress enacted §1226, individualized bail determinations had not been tested under optimal conditions, or tested in all their possible permutations.  But when the Government deals with deportable aliens, the Due Process Clause does not require it to employ the least burdensome means to accomplish its goal.  The evidence Congress had before it certainly supports the approach it selected even if other, hypothetical studies might have suggested different courses of action.  Cf.,

See Brief for Petitioners 19 ([M]ore than 20% of criminal aliens who were released on bond or otherwise not kept in custody throughout their deportation proceedings failed to appear for those proceedings), citing S. Rep. 10448, at 2 (emphasis added).  The evidence does suggest, however, that many deportable criminal aliens in this released criminal aliens sample received such determinations.  See Brief for Petitioners 19 (noting that, for aliens not evaluated for flight risk at a bond hearing, the prehearing skip rate doubled to 40%).

						 The dissent also claims that the study demonstrated that 92% of criminal aliens … who were released under supervisory conditions attended all of their hearings.  Post, at 27 (opinion of Souter, J.).  The study did manage to raise the appearance rate for criminal aliens through a supervision program known as the Appearance Assistance Program (AAP).  But the AAP study is of limited value.  First, the study included only 16 aliens who, like respondent, were released from prison and charged with being deportable on the basis of an aggravated felony.  1 Vera Institute of Justice, Testing Community Supervision for the INS: An Evaluation of the Appearance Assistance Program, pp. 3334, 36 (Aug. 1, 2000).  In addition, all 127 aliens in the AAP study were admitted into the study group only after being screened for strength of family and community ties, appearance rates in prior legal proceedings, and eligibility to apply for a legal remedy.  Id., at 13; see also id., at 37.  Following this selection process, supervision staff were in frequent, ongoing communication with participants, id., at 14, through, among other things, required reporting sessions, periodic home visits, and assistance in retaining legal representation.  Id., at 4142.  And, in any event, respondent seeks an individualized bond hearing, not community supervision. The dissents claim that criminal aliens released under supervisory conditions are likely to attend their hearings, post, at 27, therefore, is totally beside the point.

						 Respondents concession on this score is relevant for two reasons:  First, because of the concession, respondent by his own choice did not receive one of the procedural protections otherwise provided to aliens detained under §1226(c).  And, second, because of the concession we do not reach a contrary argument raised by respondent for the first time in his brief on the merits in this Court.  Specifically, in his brief on the merits, respondent suggests that he might not be subject to detention under §1226(c) after all because his 1997 conviction for petty theft with priors might not qualify as an aggravated felony under recent Ninth Circuit precedent.  Respondent now states that he intends to argue at his next removal hearing that his 1997 conviction does not constitute an aggravated felony … and his 1996 conviction [for first-degree burglary] does not constitute either an aggravated felony or a crime involving moral turpitude.  Brief for Respondent 1112.  As respondent has conceded that he is deportable for purposes of his habeas corpus challenge to §1226(c) at all previous stages of this proceeding, see n. 3, supra, we decide the case on that basis.  Lest there be any confusion, we emphasize that by conceding he is deportable and, hence, subject to mandatory detention under §1226(c), respondent did not concede that he will ultimately be deported.  As the dissent notes, respondent has applied for withholding of removal. Post, at 3 (opinion of Souter, J.).

						 Apart from its error with respect to the dangerousness determination, the dissent attempts to distinguish Carlson from the present case by arguing that the aliens in Carlson had engaged in  personal activity  in support of a political party Congress considered  a menace to the public.   Post, at 31 (opinion of Souter, J.).  In suggesting that this is a distinction, the dissent ignores the personal activity that aliens like respondent have undertaken in committing the crimes that subject them to detention in the first instancepersonal activity that has been determined with far greater procedural protections than any finding of active membership in the Communist Party involved in Carlson.  See 342 U. S., at 530 ([T]he Director made allegation[s], supported by affidavits, that the Services dossier of each petitioner contained evidence indicating to him that each was at the time of arrest a member of the Communist Party of the United States and had since 1930 participated … in the Partys indoctrination of others).  In the present case, respondent became deportable under §1226(c) only following criminal convictions that were secured following full procedural protections.  These convictions, moreover, reflect personal activity that Congress considered relevant to future dangerousness.  Cf. Zadvydas v. Davis, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/533/678" class="subref" title="subref">533 U. S. 678</a>,

 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (noting that a criminal record accumulated by an admitted alien is a good indicator of future danger, and that [a]ny suggestion that aliens who have completed prison terms no longer present a danger simply does not accord with the reality that a significant risk may still exist).

						 The dissent denies this point, insisting that the detention at issue in Zadvydas actually did bear a reasonable relation to its immigration purpose.  Post, at 23 (opinion of Souter, J.) ([T]he statute in Zadvydas … served the purpose of preventing aliens … from fleeing prior to actual deportation).

						 The dissent concedes that [t]he scheme considered in Zadvydas did not provide review immediately … . [C]ustody review hearings usually occurred within three months of a transfer to a postorder detention unit.  Post, at 17, n. 11 (opinion of Souter, J.).  Yet, in discussing the present case, the dissent insists that the due process requirement of an individualized finding of necessity applies to detention periods shorter than respondents.  Post, at 30, n. 24 (citing Schall v. Martin, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/467/253" class="subref" title="subref">467 U. S. 253</a> (1984)
, in which the detainee was entitled to a hearing when threatened with a maximum detention period of 17 days).  The dissent makes no attempt to reconcile its suggestion that aliens are entitled to an immediate hearing with the holding in Zadvydas permitting aliens to be detained for several months prior to such a hearing.

						 Congress has directed the INS to identify and track deportable criminal aliens while they are still in the criminal justice system, and to complete removal proceedings against them as promptly as possible.  See Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub. L. 10432, §§432, 438(a), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">110</a>Stat.
12731276; Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104208, §§326, 329,

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/8/1228.html" class="subref" title="subref">8 U. S. C. §1228</a>).  The INS therefore established the Institutional Hearing Program (IHP) (subsequently subsumed under the Institutional Removal Program).  By 1997, the General Accounting Office found that nearly half of all deportable criminal aliens cases were completed through the IHP prior to the aliens release from prison.  See General Accounting Office, Report to the Chairman, Subcommittee on Immigration and Claims of the House Committee on the Judiciary, INS Efforts to Remove Imprisoned Aliens Continue to Need to Improve 10, Fig. 1 (Oct. 1998).  The report urged, however, that the INS needed to improve its operations in order to complete removal proceedings against all deportable criminal aliens before their release.  Id., at 13.  Should this come to pass, of course, §1226(c) and the temporary detention it mandates would be rendered obsolete.

						 Prior to the enactment of §1226(c), when the vast majority of deportable criminal aliens were not detained during their deportation proceedings, many filed frivolous appeals in order to delay their deportation.  See S. Rep. 10448, at 2 (Delays can earn criminal aliens more than work permits and wagesif they delay long enough they may even obtain U. S. citizenship).  Cf. Zadvydas, 533 U. S., at 713 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) ([C]ourt ordered release cannot help but encourage dilatory and obstructive tactics by aliens).  Respondent contends that the length of detention required to appeal may deter aliens from exercising their right to do so.  Brief for Respondent 32.  As we have explained before, however, the legal system … is replete with situations requiring the making of difficult judgments as to which course to follow, and, even in the criminal context, there is no constitutional prohibition against requiring parties to make such choices.

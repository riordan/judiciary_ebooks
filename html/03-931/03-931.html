				Respondent Nixon was arrested for a brutal murder.  Questioned by the police, Nixon described in graphic detail how he had kidnaped and killed his victim.  After gathering overwhelming evidence of his guilt, the State indicted Nixon for first-degree murder and related crimes.  Assistant public defender Corin, assigned to represent Nixon, filed a plea of not guilty and deposed all of the States potential witnesses.  Satisfied that Nixons guilt was not subject to reasonable dispute, Corin commenced plea negotiations, but the prosecutors refused to recommend a sentence other than death.  Faced with the inevitability of going to trial on a capital charge, and a strong case for the prosecution, Corin concluded that his best course would be to concede Nixons guilt, thereby preserving credibility for penalty phase evidence of Nixon's mental instability, and for defense pleas to spare Nixons life.  Corin several times attempted to explain this strategy to Nixon, but Nixon remained unresponsive, never verbally approving or protesting the proposed strategy.  Overall, Nixon gave Corin very little, if any, assistance or direction in preparing the case.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				
				    
				When trial began, Nixon engaged in disruptive behavior and absented himself from most of the proceedings.  In his opening statement, Corin acknowledged Nixons guilt and urged the jury to focus on the penalty phase.  During the States case in chief, Corin objected to the introduction of crime scene photographs as unduly prejudicial, cross-examined witnesses for clarification, and contested several aspects of the jury instructions.  In his closing argument, Corin again conceded Nixons guilt, declaring that he hoped to persuade the jury during the penalty phase that Nixon should not be sentenced to death.  The jury found Nixon guilty on all counts.  At the penalty phase, Corin argued to the jury that Nixon was not an intact human being and had committed the murder while afflicted with multiple mental disabilities.  Corin called as witnesses relatives and friends who described Nixons childhood emotional troubles and his erratic behavior preceding the murder.  Corin also presented expert testimony concerning Nixons antisocial personality, history of emotional instability and psychiatric care, low IQ, and possible brain damage.  In his closing argument, Corin emphasized Nixons youth, the psychiatric evidence, and the jurys discretion to consider any mitigating circumstances; urged that, if not sentenced to death, Nixon would never be released; maintained that the death penalty was not appropriate for a person with Nixons impairments; and asked the jury to spare Nixons life.  The jury recommended, and the trial court imposed, the death penalty.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				
				    
				The Florida Supreme Court ultimately reversed, holding that a defense attorneys concession that his client committed murder, made without the defendants express consent, automatically ranks as prejudicial ineffective assistance of counsel necessitating a new trial under the standard announced in 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Cronic,
				</em>
				 466 U. S 648.  Corins concession, according to that court, was the functional equivalent of a guilty plea in that it allowed the prosecutions guilt-phase case to proceed essentially without opposition.  Under 
				<em>
					Boykin
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Alabama,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/395/238" class="subref" title="subref">395 U. S. 238</a>, consent to a guilty plea cannot be inferred from silence; similarly, the Florida court stated, a concession of guilt at trial requires a defendants affirmative, explicit acceptance, without which counsels performance is presumably inadequate.  While acknowledging that Nixon was very disruptive and uncooperative at trial and that Corins strategy may have been in Nixons best interest, the court nevertheless declared that silent acquiescence is not enough: Counsel conceding a defendants guilt is inevitably ineffective if the defendant does not expressly approve counsels course.

			</p>
        <p class="SYLCTF">
				
				    
				(a) The Florida Supreme Court erred in requiring Nixons affirmative, explicit acceptance of Corins strategy because it mistakenly deemed Corins statements to the jury the functional equivalent of a guilty plea.  Despite Corins concession of Nixons guilt, Nixon retained the rights accorded a defendant in a criminal trial.  Cf. 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 242243, and n. 4.  The State was obliged to present during the guilt phase competent, admissible evidence establishing the essential elements of the crimes with which Nixon was charged.  That aggressive evidence would thus be separated from the penalty phase, enabling the defense to concentrate that portion of the trial on mitigating factors.  Further, the defense reserved the right to cross-examine witnesses for the prosecution and could endeavor, as Corin did, to exclude prejudicial evidence.  Futhermore, in the event of errors in the trial or jury instructions, a concession of guilt would not hinder the defendants right to appeal.  Corin was obliged to, and in fact several times did, explain his proposed trial strategy to Nixon.  Nixons characteristic silence each time information was conveyed to him did not suffice to render unreasonable Corins decision to concede guilt and to home in, instead, on the life or death penalty issue.  Pp. 1012.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				(b) Counsels effectiveness should not be evaluated under the 
				<em>
					Cronic
				</em>
				 standard, but under the standard prescribed in 
				<em>
					Strickland
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>

S. 668</a>: Did counsels representation f[a]ll below an objective standard of reasonableness?  The Florida Supreme Courts erroneous equation of Corins concession strategy to a guilty plea led it to apply the wrong standard.  The court first presumed deficient performance, then applied the presumption of prejudice that 
				<em>
					Cronic 
				</em>
				reserved for situations in which counsel has entirely failed to function as the clients advocate, 466 U. S., at 659.  Corins concession of Nixons guilt does not rank as such a failure.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 666.
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				 Although a concession of guilt in a run-of-the-mine trial might present a closer question, the gravity of the potential sentence in a capital trial and the proceedings two-phase structure vitally affect counsels strategic calculus.  Attorneys representing capital defendants face daunting challenges in developing trial strategies: Prosecutors are more likely to seek the death penalty, and to refuse to accept a plea to a life sentence, when the evidence is overwhelming and the crime heinous.  Counsel therefore may reasonably decide to focus on the trials penalty phase, at which time counsels mission is to persuade the trier that his clients life should be spared.  Defense counsel must strive at the guilt phase to avoid a counterproductive course.  Mounting a defendant did not commit the crime defense risks destroying counsels penalty phase credibility and may incline the jury against leniency for the defendant.  In a capital case, counsel must consider in conjunction both the guilt and penalty phases in determining how best to proceed.  When counsel informs the defendant of the strategy counsel believes to be in the defendants best interest and the defendant is unresponsive, counsels strategic choice is not impeded by any blanket rule demanding the defendants explicit consent.  Instead, if counsels strategy, given the evidence bearing on the defendants guilt, satisfies the 
				<em>
					Strickland
				</em>
				 standard, that is the end of the matter; no tenable claim of ineffective assistance would remain.  Pp. 1216.

				This capital case concerns defense counsels strategic decision to concede, at the guilt phase of the trial, the defendants commission of murder, and to concentrate the defense on establishing, at the penalty phase, cause for sparing the defendants life.  Any concession of that order, the Florida Supreme Court held, made without the defendants express consenthowever gruesome the crime and despite the strength of the evidence of guiltautomatically ranks as prejudicial ineffective assistance of counsel necessitating a new trial.  We reverse the Florida Supreme Courts judgment.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Defense counsel undoubtedly has a duty to discuss potential strategies with the defendant.  See 
				<em>
					Strickland
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Washington,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/466/668" class="subref" title="subref">466 U. S. 668</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">688</a> (1984)
.  But when a defendant, informed by counsel, neither consents nor objects to the course counsel describes as the most promising means to avert a sentence of death, counsel is not automatically barred from pursuing that course.  The reasonableness of counsels performance, after consultation with the defendant yields no response, must be judged in accord with the inquiry generally applicable to ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims: Did counsels representation f[a]ll below an objective standard of reasonableness?  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 688, 694.  The Florida Supreme Court erred in applying, instead, a presumption of deficient performance, as well as a presumption of prejudice; that latter presumption, we have instructed, is reserved for cases in which counsel fails meaningfully to oppose the prosecutions case.

				The State gathered overwhelming evidence establishing that Nixon had committed the murder in the manner he described.

				In late August 1984, Nixon was indicted in Leon County, Florida, for first-degree murder, kidnaping, robbery, and arson.  See App. 1, 55.  Assistant public defender Michael Corin, assigned to represent Nixon, see 
				<em>

				  Corin thereupon commenced plea negotiations, hoping to persuade the prosecution to drop the death penalty in exchange for Nixons guilty pleas to all charges.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Faced with the inevitability of going to trial on a capital charge, Corin turned his attention to the penalty phase, believing that the only way to save Nixons life would be to present extensive mitigation evidence centering on Nixons mental instability.  
				<em>
					Id.,

				<em>

				When Nixons trial began on July 15, 1985, his unresponsiveness deepened into disruptive and violent behavior.  On the second day of jury selection, Nixon pulled off his clothing, demanded a black judge and lawyer, refused to be escorted into the courtroom, and threatened to force the guards to shoot him.  
				<em>
					Nixon I
				</em>
				, 572 So. 2d, at 1341; 10 Record 19341935.  An extended on-the-record colloquy followed Nixons bizarre behavior, during which Corin urged the trial judge to explain Nixons rights to him and ascertain whether Nixon understood the significance of absenting himself from the trial.  Corin also argued that restraining Nixon and compelling him to be present would prejudice him in the eyes of the jury.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 19181920.  When the judge examined Nixon on the record in a holding cell, Nixon stated he had no interest in the trial and threatened to misbehave if forced to attend.

				The Florida Supreme Court, as just observed, see

				Despite Corins concession, Nixon retained the rights accorded a defendant in a criminal trial.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Boykin
				</em>
				, 395 U. S., at 242243, and n. 4 (a guilty plea is more than a confession which admits that the accused did various acts, it is a stipulation that no proof by the prosecution need be advanced).  The State was obliged to present during the guilt phase competent, admissible evidence establishing the essential elements of the crimes with which Nixon was charged.  That aggressive evidence would thus be separated from the penalty phase, enabling the defense to concentrate that portion of the trial on mitigating factors.  See 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 4, 7.  Further, the defense reserved the right to cross-examine witnesses for the prosecution and could endeavor, as Corin did, to exclude prejudicial evidence.  See

				, at 6.  In addition, in the event of errors in the trial or jury instructions, a concession of guilt would not hinder the defendants right to appeal.

				Nixon nevertheless urges, relying on 
				<em>

				 v.

				that this Court has already extended the requirement of affirmative, explicit acceptance to proceedings surrender[ing] the right to contest the prosecutions factual case on the issue of guilt or innocence.  Brief for Respondent 32.  Defense counsel in 
				<em>

				<em>
					Brookhart
				</em>
				, there was in Nixons case no truncated proceeding, 
				<em>
					id.

				, at 6, shorn of the need to persuade the trier beyond a reasonable doubt, and of the defendants right to confront and cross-examine witnesses.  While the prima facie trial in 
				<em>
					Brookhart
				</em>
				 was fairly characterized as the equivalent of a guilty plea, 
				<em>
					id.

				<em>

				</em>
				, in short, does not carry the weight Nixon would place on it.

				Corin was obliged to, and in fact several times did, explain his proposed trial strategy to Nixon.  See 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 4, 9.  Given Nixons constant resistance to answering inquiries put to him by counsel and court, see 
				<em>
					Nixon III
				</em>
				, 857 So. 2d, at 187188 (Wells, J., dissenting), Corin was not additionally required to gain express consent before conceding Nixons guilt.  The two evidentiary hearings conducted by the Florida trial court demonstrate beyond doubt that Corin fulfilled his duty of consultation by informing Nixon of counsels proposed strategy and its potential benefits.  Nixons characteristic silence each time information was conveyed to him, in sum, did not suffice to render unreasonable Corins decision to concede guilt and to home in, instead, on the life or death penalty issue.

				The Florida Supreme Courts erroneous equation of Corins concession strategy to a guilty plea led it to apply the wrong standard in determining whether counsels performance ranked as ineffective assistance.

				 Although such a concession in a run-of-the-mine trial might present a closer question, the gravity of the potential sentence in a capital trial and the proceedings two-phase structure vitally affect counsels strategic calculus.  Attorneys representing capital defendants face daunting challenges in developing trial strategies, not least because the defendants guilt is often clear.  Prosecutors are more likely to seek the death penalty, and to refuse to accept a plea to a life sentence, when the evidence is overwhelming and the crime heinous.  See Goodpaster, The Trial for Life: Effective Assistance of Counsel in Death Penalty Cases, 58 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 299, 329 (1983).

				Counsel therefore may reasonably decide to focus on the trials penalty phase, at which time counsels mission is to persuade the trier that his clients life should be spared.  Unable to negotiate a guilty plea in exchange for a life sentence, defense counsel must strive at the guilt phase to avoid a counterproductive course.  See Lyon, Defending the Death Penalty Case: What Makes Death Different?, 42 Mercer L. Rev. 695, 708 (1991) (It is not good to put on a he didnt do it defense and a he is sorry he did it mitigation.  This just does not work.  The jury will give the death penalty to the client and, in essence, the attorney.); Sundby, The Capital Jury and Absolution: The Intersection of Trial Strategy, Remorse, and the Death Penalty, 83 Cornell L. Rev. 1557, 15891591 (1998) (interviews of jurors in capital trials indicate that juries approach the sentencing phase cynically where counsels sentencing-phase presentation is logically inconsistent with the guilt-phase defense); 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 1597 (in capital cases, a run-of-the-mill strategy of challenging the prosecutions case for failing to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt can have dire implications for the sentencing phase).  In this light, counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for attempting to impress the jury with his candor and his unwillingness to engage in a useless charade.  See 
				<em>
					Cronic
				</em>
				, 466 U. S., at 656657, n. 19.  Renowned advocate Clarence Darrow, we note, famously employed a similar strategy as counsel for the youthful, cold-blooded killers Richard
				 
				Loeb and Nathan Leopold.  Imploring the judge to spare the boys lives, Darrow declared: I do not know how much salvage there is in these two boys. … I will be honest with this court as I have tried to be from the beginning.  I know that these boys are not fit to be at large.  Attorney for the Damned: Clarence Darrow in the Courtroom 84 (A.

				To summarize, in a capital case, counsel must consider in conjunction both the guilt and penalty phases in determining how best to proceed.  When counsel informs the defendant of the strategy counsel believes to be in the defendants best interest and the defendant is unresponsive, counsels strategic choice is not impeded by any blanket rule demanding the defendants explicit consent.  Instead, if counsels strategy, given the evidence bearing on the defendants guilt, satisfies the Strickland

						 Every court to consider this case, including the judge who presided over Nixons trial, agreed with Corins assessment of the evidence.  See, e.g., Nixon v. Singletary, 758 So. 2d 618, 625 (Fla. 2000) (per curiam) (evidence of guilt was overwhelming); State v. Nixon, Case No. 842324 (Fla. Cir. Ct., Oct. 22, 1997), App. 385; 21 Record 40094010.

						 Nixon contended in the alternative that Corins decision to concede guilt was unreasonable and prejudicial under the generally applicable standard set out in Strickland v. Washington,

						 In his brief before this Court, Nixon describes inconsistencies in the States evidence at the guilt phase of the trial.  See Brief for Respondent 1322.  Corins failure to explore these inconsistencies, measured against the Strickland standard, 466 U. S., at 690, Nixon maintains, constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. The Florida Supreme Court did not address the alleged inconsistencies and we decline to consider the matter in the first instance.

						 As Corin determined here, pleading guilty without a guarantee that the prosecution will recommend a life sentence holds little if any benefit for the defendant.  See ABA Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in Death Penalty Cases §10.9.2, Commentary (rev. ed. 2003), reprinted in 31 Hofstra L. Rev. 913, 1045 (2003) (If no written guarantee can be obtained that death will not be imposed following a plea of guilty, counsel should be extremely reluctant to participate in a waiver of the clients trial rights.).  Pleading guilty not only relinquishes trial rights, it increases the likelihood that the State will introduce aggressive evidence of guilt during the sentencing phase, so that the gruesome details of the crime are fresh in the jurors minds as they deliberate on the sentence.  See Goodpaster, The Trial for Life: Effective Assistance of Counsel in Death Penalty Cases, 58 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 299, 331 (1983); supra, at 7, 11.

        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				This capital case concerns defense counsels strategic decision to concede, at the guilt phase of the trial, the defendants commission of murder, and to concentrate the defense on establishing, at the penalty phase, cause for sparing the defendants life.  Any concession of that order, the Florida Supreme Court held, made without the defendants express consenthowever gruesome the crime and despite the strength of the evidence of guiltautomatically ranks as prejudicial ineffective assistance of counsel necessitating a new trial.  We reverse the Florida Supreme Courts judgment.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Defense counsel undoubtedly has a duty to discuss potential strategies with the defendant.  See 
				<em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">688</a> (1984)
.  But when a defendant, informed by counsel, neither consents nor objects to the course counsel describes as the most promising means to avert a sentence of death, counsel is not automatically barred from pursuing that course.  The reasonableness of counsels performance, after consultation with the defendant yields no response, must be judged in accord with the inquiry generally applicable to ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims: Did counsels representation f[a]ll below an objective standard of reasonableness?  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 688, 694.  The Florida Supreme Court erred in applying, instead, a presumption of deficient performance, as well as a presumption of prejudice; that latter presumption, we have instructed, is reserved for cases in which counsel fails meaningfully to oppose the prosecutions case.

				The State gathered overwhelming evidence establishing that Nixon had committed the murder in the manner he described.

				In late August 1984, Nixon was indicted in Leon County, Florida, for first-degree murder, kidnaping, robbery, and arson.  See App. 1, 55.  Assistant public defender Michael Corin, assigned to represent Nixon, see 
				<em>

				</em>
				 at 232, filed a plea of not guilty, 
				<em>

				</em>
				 at 468469, and deposed all of the States potential witnesses,

				 at 5358.  Corin concluded, given the strength of the evidence, that Nixons guilt was not subject to any reasonable dispute.

            </a>
				  Corin thereupon commenced plea negotiations, hoping to persuade the prosecution to drop the death penalty in exchange for Nixons guilty pleas to all charges.  
				<em>

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Faced with the inevitability of going to trial on a capital charge, Corin turned his attention to the penalty phase, believing that the only way to save Nixons life would be to present extensive mitigation evidence centering on Nixons mental instability.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 261, 473; see also 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 102.  Experienced in capital defense, see 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 248250, Corin feared that denying Nixons commission of the kidnaping and murder during the guilt phase would compromise Corins ability to persuade the jury, during the penalty phase, that Nixons conduct was the product of his mental illness.  See 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 473, 490, 505.  Corin concluded that the best strategy would be to concede guilt, thereby preserving his credibility in urging leniency during the penalty phase.  
				<em>

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Corin attempted to explain this strategy to Nixon at least three times.  
				<em>

				 at 254255.  Although Corin had represented Nixon previously on unrelated charges and the two had a good relationship in Corins estimation, see 
				<em>

				 at 466467, Nixon was generally unresponsive during their discussions, 
				<em>

				 at 478480.  He never verbally approved or protested Corins proposed strategy.  
				<em>

				 at 234238; 255; 501.  Overall, Nixon gave Corin very little, if any, assistance or direction in preparing the case,

				<em>
					Nixon I
				</em>
				, 572 So. 2d, at 1341; App.

				When Nixons trial began on July 15, 1985, his unresponsiveness deepened into disruptive and violent behavior.  On the second day of jury selection, Nixon pulled off his clothing, demanded a black judge and lawyer, refused to be escorted into the courtroom, and threatened to force the guards to shoot him.  
				<em>
					Nixon I
				</em>
				, 572 So. 2d, at 1341; 10 Record 19341935.  An extended on-the-record colloquy followed Nixons bizarre behavior, during which Corin urged the trial judge to explain Nixons rights to him and ascertain whether Nixon understood the significance of absenting himself from the trial.  Corin also argued that restraining Nixon and compelling him to be present would prejudice him in the eyes of the jury.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 19181920.  When the judge examined Nixon on the record in a holding cell, Nixon stated he had no interest in the trial and threatened to misbehave if forced to attend.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 19261931.  The judge ruled that Nixon had intelligently and voluntarily waived his right to be present at trial.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In this case, there wont be any question, none whatsoever, that my client, Joe Elton Nixon, caused Jeannie Bickners death… . [T]hat fact will be proved to your satisfaction beyond any doubt.

        <p class="bodytext">

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Now, in arriving at your verdict, in your penalty recommendation, for we will get that far, you are going to learn many facts … about Joe Elton Nixon.  Some of those facts are going to be good.  That may not seem clear to you at this time.  But, and sadly, most of the things you learn of Joe Elton Nixon are not going to be good.  But, Im suggesting to you that when you have seen all the testimony, heard all the testimony and the evidence that has been shown, there are going to be reasons why you should recommend that his life be spared.  App. 7172.

        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				During its case in chief, the State introduced the tape of Nixons confession, expert testimony on the manner in which Bickner died, and witness testimony regarding Nixons confessions to his relatives and his possession of Bickners car and personal effects.  Corin cross-examined these witnesses only when he felt their statements needed clarification, see, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 13 Record 2504, and he did not present a defense case, 20 
				<em>

				 at 3741.  Corin did object to the introduction of crime scene photographs as unduly prejudicial, 13 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 2470, and actively contested several aspects of the jury instructions during the charge conference, 11 
				<em>
					id.,

				 at 20502058.  In his closing argument, Corin again conceded Nixons guilt, App. 73, and reminded the jury of the importance of the penalty phase: I will hope to … argue to you and give you reasons not that Mr. Nixons life be spared one final and terminal confinement forever, but that he not be sentenced to die, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 74.  The jury found Nixon guilty on all counts.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				At the start of the penalty phase, Corin argued to the jury that Joe Elton Nixon is not normal organically, intellectually, emotionally or educationally or in any other way.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 102.  Corin presented the testimony of eight witnesses.  Relatives and friends described Nixons childhood emotional troubles and his erratic behavior in the days preceding the murder.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,

            <em>

				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 143147; 162166.  The State presented little evidence during the penalty phase, simply incorporating its guilt-phase evidence by reference, and introducing testimony, over Corins objection, that Nixon had removed Bickners underwear in order to terrorize her.  
				<em>

				 at 105106.

				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 209.  Corin concluded: You know, were not around here all that long.  And its rare when we have the opportunity to give or take life.  And you have that opportunity to give life.  And Im going to ask you to do that.  Thank you.

				The Florida Supreme Court, as just observed, see

				Despite Corins concession, Nixon retained the rights accorded a defendant in a criminal trial.  Cf. 
				<em>

				</em>
				, 395 U. S., at 242243, and n. 4 (a guilty plea is more than a confession which admits that the accused did various acts, it is a stipulation that no proof by the prosecution need be advanced).  The State was obliged to present during the guilt phase competent, admissible evidence establishing the essential elements of the crimes with which Nixon was charged.  That aggressive evidence would thus be separated from the penalty phase, enabling the defense to concentrate that portion of the trial on mitigating factors.  See 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 4, 7.  Further, the defense reserved the right to cross-examine witnesses for the prosecution and could endeavor, as Corin did, to exclude prejudicial evidence.  See

				Nixon nevertheless urges, relying on 
				<em>

				<em>

				</em>
				, there was in Nixons case no truncated proceeding, 
				<em>

				</em>
				 was fairly characterized as the equivalent of a guilty plea, 
				<em>

				Corin was obliged to, and in fact several times did, explain his proposed trial strategy to Nixon.  See 
				<em>

				</em>
				, at 4, 9.  Given Nixons constant resistance to answering inquiries put to him by counsel and court, see 
				<em>
					Nixon III
				</em>
				, 857 So. 2d, at 187188 (Wells, J., dissenting), Corin was not additionally required to gain express consent before conceding Nixons guilt.  The two evidentiary hearings conducted by the Florida trial court demonstrate beyond doubt that Corin fulfilled his duty of consultation by informing Nixon of counsels proposed strategy and its potential benefits.  Nixons characteristic silence each time information was conveyed to him, in sum, did not suffice to render unreasonable Corins decision to concede guilt and to home in, instead, on the life or death penalty issue.

				The Florida Supreme Courts erroneous equation of Corins concession strategy to a guilty plea led it to apply the wrong standard in determining whether counsels performance ranked as ineffective assistance.  The court first presumed deficient performance, then applied the presumption of prejudice that

				 Although such a concession in a run-of-the-mine trial might present a closer question, the gravity of the potential sentence in a capital trial and the proceedings two-phase structure vitally affect counsels strategic calculus.  Attorneys representing capital defendants face daunting challenges in developing trial strategies, not least because the defendants guilt is often clear.  Prosecutors are more likely to seek the death penalty, and to refuse to accept a plea to a life sentence, when the evidence is overwhelming and the crime heinous.  See Goodpaster, The Trial for Life: Effective Assistance of Counsel in Death Penalty Cases, 58 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 299, 329 (1983).

				Counsel therefore may reasonably decide to focus on the trials penalty phase, at which time counsels mission is to persuade the trier that his clients life should be spared.  Unable to negotiate a guilty plea in exchange for a life sentence, defense counsel must strive at the guilt phase to avoid a counterproductive course.  See Lyon, Defending the Death Penalty Case: What Makes Death Different?, 42 Mercer L. Rev. 695, 708 (1991) (It is not good to put on a he didnt do it defense and a he is sorry he did it mitigation.  This just does not work.  The jury will give the death penalty to the client and, in essence, the attorney.); Sundby, The Capital Jury and Absolution: The Intersection of Trial Strategy, Remorse, and the Death Penalty, 83 Cornell L. Rev. 1557, 15891591 (1998) (interviews of jurors in capital trials indicate that juries approach the sentencing phase cynically where counsels sentencing-phase presentation is logically inconsistent with the guilt-phase defense); 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 1597 (in capital cases, a run-of-the-mill strategy of challenging the prosecutions case for failing to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt can have dire implications for the sentencing phase).  In this light, counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for attempting to impress the jury with his candor and his unwillingness to engage in a useless charade.  See 
				<em>
					Cronic
				</em>
				, 466 U. S., at 656657, n. 19.  Renowned advocate Clarence Darrow, we note, famously employed a similar strategy as counsel for the youthful, cold-blooded killers Richard
				 
				Loeb and Nathan Leopold.  Imploring the judge to spare the boys lives, Darrow declared: I do not know how much salvage there is in these two boys. … I will be honest with this court as I have tried to be from the beginning.  I know that these boys are not fit to be at large.  Attorney for the Damned: Clarence Darrow in the Courtroom 84 (A. Weinberg ed. 1989); see Tr. of Oral Arg. 4041 (Darrows clients did not expressly consent to what he did.  But he saved their lives.); cf.

				To summarize, in a capital case, counsel must consider in conjunction both the guilt and penalty phases in determining how best to proceed.  When counsel informs the defendant of the strategy counsel believes to be in the defendants best interest and the defendant is unresponsive, counsels strategic choice is not impeded by any blanket rule demanding the defendants explicit consent.  Instead, if counsels strategy, given the evidence bearing on the defendants guilt, satisfies the Strickland
				 standard, that is the end of the matter; no tenable claim of ineffective assistance would remain.

						 As Corin determined here, pleading guilty without a guarantee that the prosecution will recommend a life sentence holds little if any benefit for the defendant.  See ABA Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in Death Penalty Cases §10.9.2, Commentary (rev. ed. 2003), reprinted in 31 Hofstra L. Rev. 913, 1045 (2003) (If no written guarantee can be obtained that death will not be imposed following a plea of guilty, counsel should be extremely reluctant to participate in a waiver of the clients trial rights.).  Pleading guilty not only relinquishes trial rights, it increases the likelihood that the State will introduce aggressive evidence of guilt during the sentencing phase, so that the gruesome details of the crime are fresh in the jurors minds as they deliberate on the sentence.  See Goodpaster, The Trial for Life: Effective Assistance of Counsel in Death Penalty Cases, 58 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 299, 331 (1983); supra, at 7, 11.

				This capital case concerns defense counsels strategic decision to concede, at the guilt phase of the trial, the defendants commission of murder, and to concentrate the defense on establishing, at the penalty phase, cause for sparing the defendants life.  Any concession of that order, the Florida Supreme Court held, made without the defendants express consenthowever gruesome the crime and despite the strength of the evidence of guiltautomatically ranks as prejudicial ineffective assistance of counsel necessitating a new trial.

.  But when a defendant, informed by counsel, neither consents nor objects to the course counsel describes as the most promising means to avert a sentence of death, counsel is not automatically barred from pursuing that course.  The reasonableness of counsels performance, after consultation with the defendant yields no response, must be judged in accord with the inquiry generally applicable to ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims: Did counsels representation f[a]ll below an objective standard of reasonableness?  
				<em>

				The State gathered overwhelming evidence establishing that Nixon had committed the murder in the manner he described.

				In late August 1984, Nixon was indicted in Leon County, Florida, for first-degree murder, kidnaping, robbery, and arson.  See App. 1, 55.  Assistant public defender Michael Corin, assigned to represent Nixon, see 
				<em>

				 at 232, filed a plea of not guilty, 
				<em>

				 at 468469, and deposed all of the States potential witnesses,

				  Corin thereupon commenced plea negotiations, hoping to persuade the prosecution to drop the death penalty in exchange for Nixons guilty pleas to all charges.  
				<em>

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Faced with the inevitability of going to trial on a capital charge, Corin turned his attention to the penalty phase, believing that the only way to save Nixons life would be to present extensive mitigation evidence centering on Nixons mental instability.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 261, 473; see also 
				<em>

				, at 102.  Experienced in capital defense, see 
				<em>

				</em>
				 at 248250, Corin feared that denying Nixons commission of the kidnaping and murder during the guilt phase would compromise Corins ability to persuade the jury, during the penalty phase, that Nixons conduct was the product of his mental illness.  See 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 473, 490, 505.  Corin concluded that the best strategy would be to concede guilt, thereby preserving his credibility in urging leniency during the penalty phase.

				Corin attempted to explain this strategy to Nixon at least three times.

				 at 254255.  Although Corin had represented Nixon previously on unrelated charges and the two had a good relationship in Corins estimation, see 
				<em>

				<em>

				When Nixons trial began on July 15, 1985, his unresponsiveness deepened into disruptive and violent behavior.  On the second day of jury selection, Nixon pulled off his clothing, demanded a black judge and lawyer, refused to be escorted into the courtroom, and threatened to force the guards to shoot him.  
				<em>
					Nixon I
				</em>
				, 572 So. 2d, at 1341; 10 Record 19341935.  An extended on-the-record colloquy followed Nixons bizarre behavior, during which Corin urged the trial judge to explain Nixons rights to him and ascertain whether Nixon understood the significance of absenting himself from the trial.  Corin also argued that restraining Nixon and compelling him to be present would prejudice him in the eyes of the jury.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 19181920.  When the judge examined Nixon on the record in a holding cell, Nixon stated he had no interest in the trial and threatened to misbehave if forced to attend.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In this case, there wont be any question, none whatsoever, that my client, Joe Elton Nixon, caused Jeannie Bickners death… . [T]hat fact will be proved to your satisfaction beyond any doubt.

        <p class="bodytext">

				Now, in arriving at your verdict, in your penalty recommendation, for we will get that far, you are going to learn many facts … about Joe Elton Nixon.  Some of those facts are going to be good.  That may not seem clear to you at this time.  But, and sadly, most of the things you learn of Joe Elton Nixon are not going to be good.  But, Im suggesting to you that when you have seen all the testimony, heard all the testimony and the evidence that has been shown, there are going to be reasons why you should recommend that his life be spared.  App. 7172.

        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				During its case in chief, the State introduced the tape of Nixons confession, expert testimony on the manner in which Bickner died, and witness testimony regarding Nixons confessions to his relatives and his possession of Bickners car and personal effects.  Corin cross-examined these witnesses only when he felt their statements needed clarification, see, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 13 Record 2504, and he did not present a defense case, 20 
				<em>

				 at 3741.  Corin did object to the introduction of crime scene photographs as unduly prejudicial, 13 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 2470, and actively contested several aspects of the jury instructions during the charge conference, 11 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 20502058.  In his closing argument, Corin again conceded Nixons guilt, App. 73, and reminded the jury of the importance of the penalty phase: I will hope to … argue to you and give you reasons not that Mr. Nixons life be spared one final and terminal confinement forever, but that he not be sentenced to die, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 74.  The jury found Nixon guilty on all counts.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				At the start of the penalty phase, Corin argued to the jury that Joe Elton Nixon is not normal organically, intellectually, emotionally or educationally or in any other way.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 102.  Corin presented the testimony of eight witnesses.  Relatives and friends described Nixons childhood emotional troubles and his erratic behavior in the days preceding the murder.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>

				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 143147; 162166.  The State presented little evidence during the penalty phase, simply incorporating its guilt-phase evidence by reference, and introducing testimony, over Corins objection, that Nixon had removed Bickners underwear in order to terrorize her.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 105106.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In his closing argument, Corin emphasized Nixons youth, the psychiatric evidence, and the jurys discretion to consider any mitigating circumstances,

				<em>

				 at 207.  The death penalty, Corin maintained, was appropriate only for intact human being[s], and Joe Elton Nixon is not one of those.  Hes never been one of those.  He never will be one of those.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 209.  Corin concluded: You know, were not around here all that long.  And its rare when we have the opportunity to give or take life.  And you have that opportunity to give life.  And Im going to ask you to do that.  Thank you.

				Despite Corins concession, Nixon retained the rights accorded a defendant in a criminal trial.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Boykin
				</em>
				, 395 U. S., at 242243, and n. 4 (a guilty plea is more than a confession which admits that the accused did various acts, it is a stipulation that no proof by the prosecution need be advanced).  The State was obliged to present during the guilt phase competent, admissible evidence establishing the essential elements of the crimes with which Nixon was charged.  That aggressive evidence would thus be separated from the penalty phase, enabling the defense to concentrate that portion of the trial on mitigating factors.  See 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 4, 7.  Further, the defense reserved the right to cross-examine witnesses for the prosecution and could endeavor, as Corin did, to exclude prejudicial evidence.  See 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 6.  In addition, in the event of errors in the trial or jury instructions, a concession of guilt would not hinder the defendants right to appeal.

				Nixon nevertheless urges, relying on 
				<em>
					Brookhart
				</em>
				 v.
				<em>

				</em>
				that this Court has already extended the requirement of affirmative, explicit acceptance to proceedings surrender[ing] the right to contest the prosecutions factual case on the issue of guilt or innocence.  Brief for Respondent 32.  Defense counsel in 
				<em>

				<em>
					Brookhart
				</em>
				, there was in Nixons case no truncated proceeding, 
				<em>
					id.

				, at 6, shorn of the need to persuade the trier beyond a reasonable doubt, and of the defendants right to confront and cross-examine witnesses.  While the prima facie trial in

				 was fairly characterized as the equivalent of a guilty plea,

				Corin was obliged to, and in fact several times did, explain his proposed trial strategy to Nixon.  See 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 4, 9.  Given Nixons constant resistance to answering inquiries put to him by counsel and court, see 
				<em>
					Nixon III
				</em>
				, 857 So. 2d, at 187188 (Wells, J., dissenting), Corin was not additionally required to gain express consent before conceding Nixons guilt.  The two evidentiary hearings conducted by the Florida trial court demonstrate beyond doubt that Corin fulfilled his duty of consultation by informing Nixon of counsels proposed strategy and its potential benefits.  Nixons characteristic silence each time information was conveyed to him, in sum, did not suffice to render unreasonable Corins decision to concede guilt and to home in, instead, on the life or death penalty issue.

				The Florida Supreme Courts erroneous equation of Corins concession strategy to a guilty plea led it to apply the wrong standard in determining whether counsels performance ranked as ineffective assistance.  The court first presumed deficient performance, then applied the presumption of prejudice that

				On the record thus far developed, Corins concession of Nixons guilt does not rank as a fail[ure] to function in any meaningful sense as the Governments adversary.

				 Although such a concession in a run-of-the-mine trial might present a closer question, the gravity of the potential sentence in a capital trial and the proceedings two-phase structure vitally affect counsels strategic calculus.  Attorneys representing capital defendants face daunting challenges in developing trial strategies, not least because the defendants guilt is often clear.  Prosecutors are more likely to seek the death penalty, and to refuse to accept a plea to a life sentence, when the evidence is overwhelming and the crime heinous.  See Goodpaster, The Trial for Life: Effective Assistance of Counsel in Death Penalty Cases, 58 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 299, 329 (1983).

				Counsel therefore may reasonably decide to focus on the trials penalty phase, at which time counsels mission is to persuade the trier that his clients life should be spared.  Unable to negotiate a guilty plea in exchange for a life sentence, defense counsel must strive at the guilt phase to avoid a counterproductive course.  See Lyon, Defending the Death Penalty Case: What Makes Death Different?, 42 Mercer L. Rev. 695, 708 (1991) (It is not good to put on a he didnt do it defense and a he is sorry he did it mitigation.  This just does not work.  The jury will give the death penalty to the client and, in essence, the attorney.); Sundby, The Capital Jury and Absolution: The Intersection of Trial Strategy, Remorse, and the Death Penalty, 83 Cornell L. Rev. 1557, 15891591 (1998) (interviews of jurors in capital trials indicate that juries approach the sentencing phase cynically where counsels sentencing-phase presentation is logically inconsistent with the guilt-phase defense); 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 1597 (in capital cases, a run-of-the-mill strategy of challenging the prosecutions case for failing to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt can have dire implications for the sentencing phase).  In this light, counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for attempting to impress the jury with his candor and his unwillingness to engage in a useless charade.  See 
				<em>
					Cronic
				</em>
				, 466 U. S., at 656657, n. 19.  Renowned advocate Clarence Darrow, we note, famously employed a similar strategy as counsel for the youthful, cold-blooded killers Richard

Imploring the judge to spare the boys lives, Darrow declared: I do not know how much salvage there is in these two boys. … I will be honest with this court as I have tried to be from the beginning.

				To summarize, in a capital case, counsel must consider in conjunction both the guilt and penalty phases in determining how best to proceed.  When counsel informs the defendant of the strategy counsel believes to be in the defendants best interest and the defendant is unresponsive, counsels strategic choice is not impeded by any blanket rule demanding the defendants explicit consent.  Instead, if counsels strategy, given the evidence bearing on the defendants guilt, satisfies the Strickland
				 standard, that is the end of the matter; no tenable claim of ineffective assistance would remain.

						 As Corin determined here, pleading guilty without a guarantee that the prosecution will recommend a life sentence holds little if any benefit for the defendant.  See ABA Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in Death Penalty Cases §10.9.2, Commentary (rev. ed. 2003), reprinted in 31 Hofstra L. Rev. 913, 1045 (2003) (If no written guarantee can be obtained that death will not be imposed following a plea of guilty, counsel should be extremely reluctant to participate in a waiver of the clients trial rights.).  Pleading guilty not only relinquishes trial rights, it increases the likelihood that the State will introduce aggressive evidence of guilt during the sentencing phase, so that the gruesome details of the crime are fresh in the jurors minds as they deliberate on the sentence.  See Goodpaster, The Trial for Life: Effective Assistance of Counsel in Death Penalty Cases, 58 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 299, 331 (1983); supra, at 7, 11.

				This capital case concerns defense counsels strategic decision to concede, at the guilt phase of the trial, the defendants commission of murder, and to concentrate the defense on establishing, at the penalty phase, cause for sparing the defendants life.  Any concession of that order, the Florida Supreme Court held, made without the defendants express consenthowever gruesome the crime and despite the strength of the evidence of guiltautomatically ranks as prejudicial ineffective assistance of counsel necessitating a new trial.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">688</a> (1984)
.  But when a defendant, informed by counsel, neither consents nor objects to the course counsel describes as the most promising means to avert a sentence of death, counsel is not automatically barred from pursuing that course.  The reasonableness of counsels performance, after consultation with the defendant yields no response, must be judged in accord with the inquiry generally applicable to ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims: Did counsels representation f[a]ll below an objective standard of reasonableness?  
				<em>

				 at 688, 694.  The Florida Supreme Court erred in applying, instead, a presumption of deficient performance, as well as a presumption of prejudice; that latter presumption, we have instructed, is reserved for cases in which counsel fails meaningfully to oppose the prosecutions case.

				The State gathered overwhelming evidence establishing that Nixon had committed the murder in the manner he described.

				In late August 1984, Nixon was indicted in Leon County, Florida, for first-degree murder, kidnaping, robbery, and arson.  See App. 1, 55.  Assistant public defender Michael Corin, assigned to represent Nixon, see

				  Corin thereupon commenced plea negotiations, hoping to persuade the prosecution to drop the death penalty in exchange for Nixons guilty pleas to all charges.

				Faced with the inevitability of going to trial on a capital charge, Corin turned his attention to the penalty phase, believing that the only way to save Nixons life would be to present extensive mitigation evidence centering on Nixons mental instability.

				When Nixons trial began on July 15, 1985, his unresponsiveness deepened into disruptive and violent behavior.

An extended on-the-record colloquy followed Nixons bizarre behavior, during which Corin urged the trial judge to explain Nixons rights to him and ascertain whether Nixon understood the significance of absenting himself from the trial.  Corin also argued that restraining Nixon and compelling him to be present would prejudice him in the eyes of the jury.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In this case, there wont be any question, none whatsoever, that my client, Joe Elton Nixon, caused Jeannie Bickners death… . [T]hat fact will be proved to your satisfaction beyond any doubt.

				Now, in arriving at your verdict, in your penalty recommendation, for we will get that far, you are going to learn many facts … about Joe Elton Nixon.  Some of those facts are going to be good.  That may not seem clear to you at this time.  But, and sadly, most of the things you learn of Joe Elton Nixon are not going to be good.  But, Im suggesting to you that when you have seen all the testimony, heard all the testimony and the evidence that has been shown, there are going to be reasons why you should recommend that his life be spared.  App. 7172.

        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				During its case in chief, the State introduced the tape of Nixons confession, expert testimony on the manner in which Bickner died, and witness testimony regarding Nixons confessions to his relatives and his possession of Bickners car and personal effects.  Corin cross-examined these witnesses only when he felt their statements needed clarification, see, 
				<em>

				<em>

				 at 20502058.  In his closing argument, Corin again conceded Nixons guilt, App. 73, and reminded the jury of the importance of the penalty phase: I will hope to … argue to you and give you reasons not that Mr. Nixons life be spared one final and terminal confinement forever, but that he not be sentenced to die,

				<em>

				<em>

				<em>

				The Florida Supreme Court, as just observed, see

				Despite Corins concession, Nixon retained the rights accorded a defendant in a criminal trial.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Boykin
				</em>
				, 395 U. S., at 242243, and n. 4 (a guilty plea is more than a confession which admits that the accused did various acts, it is a stipulation that no proof by the prosecution need be advanced).  The State was obliged to present during the guilt phase competent, admissible evidence establishing the essential elements of the crimes with which Nixon was charged.  That aggressive evidence would thus be separated from the penalty phase, enabling the defense to concentrate that portion of the trial on mitigating factors.  See 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 4, 7.  Further, the defense reserved the right to cross-examine witnesses for the prosecution and could endeavor, as Corin did, to exclude prejudicial evidence.  See

				Nixon nevertheless urges, relying on 
				<em>

				 v.

				that this Court has already extended the requirement of affirmative, explicit acceptance to proceedings surrender[ing] the right to contest the prosecutions factual case on the issue of guilt or innocence.  Brief for Respondent 32.  Defense counsel in

				<em>
					Brookhart
				</em>
				, there was in Nixons case no truncated proceeding, 
				<em>

				 was fairly characterized as the equivalent of a guilty plea, 
				<em>

				Corin was obliged to, and in fact several times did, explain his proposed trial strategy to Nixon.  See 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 4, 9.  Given Nixons constant resistance to answering inquiries put to him by counsel and court, see 
				<em>
					Nixon III
				</em>
				, 857 So. 2d, at 187188 (Wells, J., dissenting), Corin was not additionally required to gain express consent before conceding Nixons guilt.  The two evidentiary hearings conducted by the Florida trial court demonstrate beyond doubt that Corin fulfilled his duty of consultation by informing Nixon of counsels proposed strategy and its potential benefits.  Nixons characteristic silence each time information was conveyed to him, in sum, did not suffice to render unreasonable Corins decision to concede guilt and to home in, instead, on the life or death penalty issue.

				The Florida Supreme Courts erroneous equation of Corins concession strategy to a guilty plea led it to apply the wrong standard in determining whether counsels performance ranked as ineffective assistance.

				On the record thus far developed, Corins concession of Nixons guilt does not rank as a fail[ure] to function in any meaningful sense as the Governments adversary.  
				<em>

				 Although such a concession in a run-of-the-mine trial might present a closer question, the gravity of the potential sentence in a capital trial and the proceedings two-phase structure vitally affect counsels strategic calculus.  Attorneys representing capital defendants face daunting challenges in developing trial strategies, not least because the defendants guilt is often clear.  Prosecutors are more likely to seek the death penalty, and to refuse to accept a plea to a life sentence, when the evidence is overwhelming and the crime heinous.

				Counsel therefore may reasonably decide to focus on the trials penalty phase, at which time counsels mission is to persuade the trier that his clients life should be spared.  Unable to negotiate a guilty plea in exchange for a life sentence, defense counsel must strive at the guilt phase to avoid a counterproductive course.  See Lyon, Defending the Death Penalty Case: What Makes Death Different?, 42 Mercer L. Rev. 695, 708 (1991) (It is not good to put on a he didnt do it defense and a he is sorry he did it mitigation.  This just does not work.  The jury will give the death penalty to the client and, in essence, the attorney.); Sundby, The Capital Jury and Absolution: The Intersection of Trial Strategy, Remorse, and the Death Penalty, 83 Cornell L. Rev. 1557, 15891591 (1998) (interviews of jurors in capital trials indicate that juries approach the sentencing phase cynically where counsels sentencing-phase presentation is logically inconsistent with the guilt-phase defense); 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 1597 (in capital cases, a run-of-the-mill strategy of challenging the prosecutions case for failing to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt can have dire implications for the sentencing phase).  In this light, counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for attempting to impress the jury with his candor and his unwillingness to engage in a useless charade.  See 
				<em>
					Cronic
				</em>
				, 466 U. S., at 656657, n. 19.  Renowned advocate Clarence Darrow, we note, famously employed a similar strategy as counsel for the youthful, cold-blooded killers Richard
				 
				Loeb and Nathan Leopold.  Imploring the judge to spare the boys lives, Darrow declared: I do not know how much salvage there is in these two boys. … I will be honest with this court as I have tried to be from the beginning.  I know that these boys are not fit to be at large.  Attorney for the Damned: Clarence Darrow in the Courtroom 84 (A.

				To summarize, in a capital case, counsel must consider in conjunction both the guilt and penalty phases in determining how best to proceed.  When counsel informs the defendant of the strategy counsel believes to be in the defendants best interest and the defendant is unresponsive, counsels strategic choice is not impeded by any blanket rule demanding the defendants explicit consent.  Instead, if counsels strategy, given the evidence bearing on the defendants guilt, satisfies the Strickland
				 standard, that is the end of the matter; no tenable claim of ineffective assistance would remain.

						 In his brief before this Court, Nixon describes inconsistencies in the States evidence at the guilt phase of the trial.  See Brief for Respondent 1322.  Corins failure to explore these inconsistencies, measured against the Strickland standard, 466 U. S., at 690, Nixon maintains, constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. The Florida Supreme Court did not address the alleged inconsistencies and we decline to consider the matter in the first instance.

						 As Corin determined here, pleading guilty without a guarantee that the prosecution will recommend a life sentence holds little if any benefit for the defendant.  See ABA Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in Death Penalty Cases §10.9.2, Commentary (rev. ed. 2003), reprinted in 31 Hofstra L. Rev. 913, 1045 (2003) (If no written guarantee can be obtained that death will not be imposed following a plea of guilty, counsel should be extremely reluctant to participate in a waiver of the clients trial rights.).  Pleading guilty not only relinquishes trial rights, it increases the likelihood that the State will introduce aggressive evidence of guilt during the sentencing phase, so that the gruesome details of the crime are fresh in the jurors minds as they deliberate on the sentence.  See Goodpaster, The Trial for Life: Effective Assistance of Counsel in Death Penalty Cases, 58 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 299, 331 (1983); supra, at 7, 11.

				This capital case concerns defense counsels strategic decision to concede, at the guilt phase of the trial, the defendants commission of murder, and to concentrate the defense on establishing, at the penalty phase, cause for sparing the defendants life.  Any concession of that order, the Florida Supreme Court held, made without the defendants express consenthowever gruesome the crime and despite the strength of the evidence of guiltautomatically ranks as prejudicial ineffective assistance of counsel necessitating a new trial.  We reverse the Florida Supreme Courts judgment.

				Defense counsel undoubtedly has a duty to discuss potential strategies with the defendant.  See 
				<em>
					Strickland
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Washington,
				</em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">688</a> (1984)
.  But when a defendant, informed by counsel, neither consents nor objects to the course counsel describes as the most promising means to avert a sentence of death, counsel is not automatically barred from pursuing that course.  The reasonableness of counsels performance, after consultation with the defendant yields no response, must be judged in accord with the inquiry generally applicable to ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims: Did counsels representation f[a]ll below an objective standard of reasonableness?  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 688, 694.  The Florida Supreme Court erred in applying, instead, a presumption of deficient performance, as well as a presumption of prejudice; that latter presumption, we have instructed, is reserved for cases in which counsel fails meaningfully to oppose the prosecutions case.

				The State gathered overwhelming evidence establishing that Nixon had committed the murder in the manner he described.  A witness saw Nixon approach Bickner in the malls parking lot on August 12, and observed Bickner taking jumper cables out of the trunk of her car and giving them to Nixon.  13 
				<em>

				In late August 1984, Nixon was indicted in Leon County, Florida, for first-degree murder, kidnaping, robbery, and arson.  See App. 1, 55.  Assistant public defender Michael Corin, assigned to represent Nixon, see 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 232, filed a plea of not guilty, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 468469, and deposed all of the States potential witnesses, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 5358.  Corin concluded, given the strength of the evidence, that Nixons guilt was not subject to any reasonable dispute.  
				<em>
					Id.,

				 at 490.

                </sup>
            </a>
				  Corin thereupon commenced plea negotiations, hoping to persuade the prosecution to drop the death penalty in exchange for Nixons guilty pleas to all charges.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 336338; 507.  Negotiations broke down when the prosecutors indicated their unwillingness to recommend a sentence other than death.  See 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 339, 508.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Faced with the inevitability of going to trial on a capital charge, Corin turned his attention to the penalty phase, believing that the only way to save Nixons life would be to present extensive mitigation evidence centering on Nixons mental instability.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 261, 473; see also 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 102.  Experienced in capital defense, see 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 248250, Corin feared that denying Nixons commission of the kidnaping and murder during the guilt phase would compromise Corins ability to persuade the jury, during the penalty phase, that Nixons conduct was the product of his mental illness.  See 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 473, 490, 505.  Corin concluded that the best strategy would be to concede guilt, thereby preserving his credibility in urging leniency during the penalty phase.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 458, 505.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Corin attempted to explain this strategy to Nixon at least three times.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 254255.  Although Corin had represented Nixon previously on unrelated charges and the two had a good relationship in Corins estimation, see 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 466467, Nixon was generally unresponsive during their discussions, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 478480.  He never verbally approved or protested Corins proposed strategy.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 234238; 255; 501.  Overall, Nixon gave Corin very little, if any, assistance or direction in preparing the case, 
				<em>

				</em>
				 at 478, and refused to attend pretrial dispositions of various motions, 
				<em>
					Nixon I
				</em>
				, 572 So. 2d, at 1341; App.
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				478.  Corin eventually exercised his professional judgment to pursue the concession strategy.  As he explained: There are many times lawyers make decisions because they have to make them because the client does nothing.

				 at 486.

				When Nixons trial began on July 15, 1985, his unresponsiveness deepened into disruptive and violent behavior.  On the second day of jury selection, Nixon pulled off his clothing, demanded a black judge and lawyer, refused to be escorted into the courtroom, and threatened to force the guards to shoot him.  
				<em>
					Nixon I
				</em>
				, 572 So. 2d, at 1341; 10 Record 19341935.  An extended on-the-record colloquy followed Nixons bizarre behavior, during which Corin urged the trial judge to explain Nixons rights to him and ascertain whether Nixon understood the significance of absenting himself from the trial.  Corin also argued that restraining Nixon and compelling him to be present would prejudice him in the eyes of the jury.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 19181920.  When the judge examined Nixon on the record in a holding cell, Nixon stated he had no interest in the trial and threatened to misbehave if forced to attend.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 19261931.  The judge ruled that Nixon had intelligently and voluntarily waived his right to be present at trial.

				  In his opening statement, Corin acknowledged Nixons guilt and urged the jury to focus on the penalty phase:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In this case, there wont be any question, none whatsoever, that my client, Joe Elton Nixon, caused Jeannie Bickners death… . [T]hat fact will be proved to your satisfaction beyond any doubt.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				This case is about the death of Joe Elton Nixon and whether it should occur within the next few years by electrocution or maybe its natural expiration after a lifetime of confinement.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Now, in arriving at your verdict, in your penalty recommendation, for we will get that far, you are going to learn many facts … about Joe Elton Nixon.  Some of those facts are going to be good.  That may not seem clear to you at this time.  But, and sadly, most of the things you learn of Joe Elton Nixon are not going to be good.  But, Im suggesting to you that when you have seen all the testimony, heard all the testimony and the evidence that has been shown, there are going to be reasons why you should recommend that his life be spared.  App. 7172.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				During its case in chief, the State introduced the tape of Nixons confession, expert testimony on the manner in which Bickner died, and witness testimony regarding Nixons confessions to his relatives and his possession of Bickners car and personal effects.  Corin cross-examined these witnesses only when he felt their statements needed clarification, see, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 13 Record 2504, and he did not present a defense case, 20 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 3741.  Corin did object to the introduction of crime scene photographs as unduly prejudicial, 13 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 2470, and actively contested several aspects of the jury instructions during the charge conference, 11 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 20502058.  In his closing argument, Corin again conceded Nixons guilt, App. 73, and reminded the jury of the importance of the penalty phase: I will hope to … argue to you and give you reasons not that Mr. Nixons life be spared one final and terminal confinement forever, but that he not be sentenced to die, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 74.  The jury found Nixon guilty on all counts.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				At the start of the penalty phase, Corin argued to the jury that Joe Elton Nixon is not normal organically, intellectually, emotionally or educationally or in any other way.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 102.  Corin presented the testimony of eight witnesses.  Relatives and friends described Nixons childhood emotional troubles and his erratic behavior in the days preceding the murder.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,

            <em>

				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 143147; 162166.  The State presented little evidence during the penalty phase, simply incorporating its guilt-phase evidence by reference, and introducing testimony, over Corins objection, that Nixon had removed Bickners underwear in order to terrorize her.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 105106.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In his closing argument, Corin emphasized Nixons youth, the psychiatric evidence, and the jurys discretion to consider any mitigating circumstances,

				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 209.  Corin concluded: You know, were not around here all that long.  And its rare when we have the opportunity to give or take life.  And you have that opportunity to give life.  And Im going to ask you to do that.  Thank you.

				The Florida Supreme Court, as just observed, see

				Despite Corins concession, Nixon retained the rights accorded a defendant in a criminal trial.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Boykin
				</em>
				, 395 U. S., at 242243, and n. 4 (a guilty plea is more than a confession which admits that the accused did various acts, it is a stipulation that no proof by the prosecution need be advanced).  The State was obliged to present during the guilt phase competent, admissible evidence establishing the essential elements of the crimes with which Nixon was charged.  That aggressive evidence would thus be separated from the penalty phase, enabling the defense to concentrate that portion of the trial on mitigating factors.  See 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 4, 7.  Further, the defense reserved the right to cross-examine witnesses for the prosecution and could endeavor, as Corin did, to exclude prejudicial evidence.  See 
				<em>

				, at 6.  In addition, in the event of errors in the trial or jury instructions, a concession of guilt would not hinder the defendants right to appeal.

				Nixon nevertheless urges, relying on 
				<em>

				 v.

				that this Court has already extended the requirement of affirmative, explicit acceptance to proceedings surrender[ing] the right to contest the prosecutions factual case on the issue of guilt or innocence.  Brief for Respondent 32.  Defense counsel in 
				<em>

				had agreed to a prima facie bench trial at which the State would be relieved of its obligation to put on complete proof of guilt or persuade a jury of the defendants guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  384 U. S., at 56.  In contrast to 
				<em>
					Brookhart
				</em>
				, there was in Nixons case no truncated proceeding, 
				<em>

				, at 6, shorn of the need to persuade the trier beyond a reasonable doubt, and of the defendants right to confront and cross-examine witnesses.  While the prima facie trial in 
				<em>
					Brookhart
				</em>
				 was fairly characterized as the equivalent of a guilty plea, 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>

				<em>
					Brookhart
				</em>
				, in short, does not carry the weight Nixon would place on it.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Corin was obliged to, and in fact several times did, explain his proposed trial strategy to Nixon.  See 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 4, 9.  Given Nixons constant resistance to answering inquiries put to him by counsel and court, see 
				<em>
					Nixon III
				</em>
				, 857 So. 2d, at 187188 (Wells, J., dissenting), Corin was not additionally required to gain express consent before conceding Nixons guilt.  The two evidentiary hearings conducted by the Florida trial court demonstrate beyond doubt that Corin fulfilled his duty of consultation by informing Nixon of counsels proposed strategy and its potential benefits.  Nixons characteristic silence each time information was conveyed to him, in sum, did not suffice to render unreasonable Corins decision to concede guilt and to home in, instead, on the life or death penalty issue.

				The Florida Supreme Courts erroneous equation of Corins concession strategy to a guilty plea led it to apply the wrong standard in determining whether counsels performance ranked as ineffective assistance.

				 Although such a concession in a run-of-the-mine trial might present a closer question, the gravity of the potential sentence in a capital trial and the proceedings two-phase structure vitally affect counsels strategic calculus.  Attorneys representing capital defendants face daunting challenges in developing trial strategies, not least because the defendants guilt is often clear.  Prosecutors are more likely to seek the death penalty, and to refuse to accept a plea to a life sentence, when the evidence is overwhelming and the crime heinous.  See Goodpaster, The Trial for Life: Effective Assistance of Counsel in Death Penalty Cases, 58 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 299, 329 (1983).

				Counsel therefore may reasonably decide to focus on the trials penalty phase, at which time counsels mission is to persuade the trier that his clients life should be spared.  Unable to negotiate a guilty plea in exchange for a life sentence, defense counsel must strive at the guilt phase to avoid a counterproductive course.  See Lyon, Defending the Death Penalty Case: What Makes Death Different?, 42 Mercer L. Rev. 695, 708 (1991) (It is not good to put on a he didnt do it defense and a he is sorry he did it mitigation.  This just does not work.

Rev. 1557, 15891591 (1998) (interviews of jurors in capital trials indicate that juries approach the sentencing phase cynically where counsels sentencing-phase presentation is logically inconsistent with the guilt-phase defense); 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 1597 (in capital cases, a run-of-the-mill strategy of challenging the prosecutions case for failing to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt can have dire implications for the sentencing phase).  In this light, counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for attempting to impress the jury with his candor and his unwillingness to engage in a useless charade.  See 
				<em>
					Cronic
				</em>
				, 466 U. S., at 656657, n. 19.  Renowned advocate Clarence Darrow, we note, famously employed a similar strategy as counsel for the youthful, cold-blooded killers Richard
				 
				Loeb and Nathan Leopold.  Imploring the judge to spare the boys lives, Darrow declared: I do not know how much salvage there is in these two boys. … I will be honest with this court as I have tried to be from the beginning.  I know that these boys are not fit to be at large.  Attorney for the Damned: Clarence Darrow in the Courtroom 84 (A.

				To summarize, in a capital case, counsel must consider in conjunction both the guilt and penalty phases in determining how best to proceed.  When counsel informs the defendant of the strategy counsel believes to be in the defendants best interest and the defendant is unresponsive, counsels strategic choice is not impeded by any blanket rule demanding the defendants explicit consent.  Instead, if counsels strategy, given the evidence bearing on the defendants guilt, satisfies the Strickland
				 standard, that is the end of the matter; no tenable claim of ineffective assistance would remain.

						 As Corin determined here, pleading guilty without a guarantee that the prosecution will recommend a life sentence holds little if any benefit for the defendant.  See ABA Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in Death Penalty Cases §10.9.2, Commentary (rev. ed. 2003), reprinted in 31 Hofstra L. Rev. 913, 1045 (2003) (If no written guarantee can be obtained that death will not be imposed following a plea of guilty, counsel should be extremely reluctant to participate in a waiver of the clients trial rights.).  Pleading guilty not only relinquishes trial rights, it increases the likelihood that the State will introduce aggressive evidence of guilt during the sentencing phase, so that the gruesome details of the crime are fresh in the jurors minds as they deliberate on the sentence.  See Goodpaster, The Trial for Life: Effective Assistance of Counsel in Death Penalty Cases, 58 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 299, 331 (1983); supra, at 7, 11.

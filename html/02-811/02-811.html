        <p class="bodytext">
				Petitioner, a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agent, prepared and signed an application for a warrant to search respondents Montana ranch, which stated that the search was for specified weapons, explosives, and records.  The application was supported by petitioners detailed affidavit setting forth his basis for believing that such items were on the ranch and was accompanied by a warrant form that he completed.  The Magistrate Judge (Magistrate) signed the warrant form even though it did not identify any of the items that petitioner intended to seize.  The portion calling for a description of the person or property described respondents house, not the alleged weapons; the warrant did not incorporate by reference the applications itemized list.  Petitioner led federal and local law enforcement officers to the ranch the next day but found no illegal weapons or explosives.  Petitioner left a copy of the warrant, but not the application, with respondents.  Respondents sued petitioner and others under

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/1983.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §1983</a>, claiming, 
				<em>

				</em>
				 a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> violation.  The District Court granted the defendants summary judgment, finding no 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> violation, and finding that even if such a violation occurred, the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed except as to the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> claim against petitioner, holding that the warrant was invalid because it did not describe with particularity the place to be searched and the items to be seized.  The court also concluded that

        <p class="SYLCTE">
				Held:
			</p>
        <p class="SYLCTF">
				
				    
				1. The search was clearly unreasonable under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>.  Pp. 511.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				
				    
				(a) The warrant was plainly invalid.  It did not meet the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>s unambiguous requirement that a warrant particularly describ[e] … the persons or things to be seized.  The fact that the application adequately described those things does not save the warrant; 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> interests are not necessarily vindicated when another document says something about the objects of the search, but that documents contents are neither known to the person whose home is being searched nor available for her inspection.  It is not necessary to decide whether the Amendment permits a warrant to cross-reference other documents, because such incorporation did not occur here.  Pp. 56.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				
				    
				(b) Petitioners argument that the search was nonetheless reasonable is rejected.  Because the warrant did not describe the items 
				<em>
					at all,
				</em>
				 it was so obviously deficient that the search must be regarded as warrantless, and thus presumptively unreasonable.  This presumptive rule applies to searches whose only defect is a lack of particularity in the warrant.  Petitioner errs in arguing that such searches should be exempt from the presumption if they otherwise satisfy the particularity requirements goals.  Unless items in the affidavit are set forth in the warrant, there is no written assurance that the Magistrate actually found probable cause for a search as broad as the affiant requested.  The restraint petitioner showed in conducting the instant search was imposed by the agent himself, not a judicial officer.  Moreover, the particularity requirements purpose is not limited to preventing general searches; it also assures the individual whose property is searched and seized of the executing officers legal authority, his need to search, and the limits of his power to do so.  This case presents no occasion to reach petitioners argument that the particularity requirements goals were served when he orally described the items to respondents, because respondents dispute his account.  Pp. 611.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				2. Petitioner is not entitled to qualified immunity despite the constitutional violation because it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted,

            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/533/194" class="subref" title="subref">533 U. S. 194</a>.  Given that the particularity requirement is stated in the Constitutions text, no reasonable officer could believe that a warrant that did not comply with that requirement was valid.  Moreover, because petitioner prepared the warrant, he may not argue that he reasonably relied on the Magistrates assurance that it contained an adequate description and was valid.  Nor could a reasonable officer claim to be unaware of the basic rule that, absent consent or exigency, a warrantless search of a home is presumptively unconstitutional.  [A] warrant may be so facially deficient … that the executing officers cannot reasonably presume it to be valid.

				I agree with the Court that the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> was violated in this case.  The 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> states that no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.  The warrant issued in this case did not particularly describe the things to be seized, and so did not comply with the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>.  I disagree with the Court on whether the officer who obtained the warrant and led the search team is entitled to qualified immunity for his role in the search.  In my view, the officer should receive qualified immunity.

				</em>
            <em>

            <em>

				</em>
				,

 (noting that qualified immunity covers mere mistakes in judgment, whether the mistake is one of fact or one of law).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The present case involves a straightforward mistake of fact.  Although the Court does not acknowledge it directly, it is obvious from the record below that the officer simply made a clerical error when he filled out the proposed warrant and offered it to the Magistrate Judge.  The officer used the proper description of the property to be seized when he completed the affidavit.  He also used the proper description in the accompanying application.  When he typed up the description a third time for the proposed warrant, however, the officer accidentally entered a description of the place to be searched in the part of the warrant form that called for a description of the property to be seized.  No one noticed the error before the search was executed.  Although the record is not entirely clear on this point, the mistake apparently remained undiscovered until the day after the search when respondents attorney reviewed the warrant for defects.  The officer, being unaware of his mistake, did not rely on it in any way.  It is uncontested that the officer trained the search team and executed the warrant based on his mistaken belief that the warrant contained the proper description of the items to be seized.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The question is whether the officers mistaken belief that the warrant contained the proper language was a reasonable belief.  In my view, it was.  A law enforcement officer charged with leading a team to execute a search warrant for illegal weapons must fulfill a number of serious responsibilities.  The officer must establish probable cause to believe the crime has been committed and that evidence is likely to be found at the place to be searched; must articulate specific items that can be seized, and a specific place to be searched; must obtain the warrant from a magistrate judge; and must instruct a search team to execute the warrant within the time allowed by the warrant.  The officer must also oversee the execution of the warrant in a way that protects officer safety, directs a thorough and professional search for the evidence, and avoids unnecessary destruction of property.  These difficult and important tasks demand the officers full attention in the heat of an ongoing and often dangerous criminal investigation.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				An officer who complies fully with all of these duties can be excused for not being aware that he had made a clerical error in the course of filling out the proposed warrant.  See 
				<em>
					Maryland
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Garrison,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/480/79" class="subref" title="subref">480 U. S. 79</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">87</a> (1987)
 (recognizing the need to allow some latitude for honest mistakes that are made by officers in the dangerous and difficult process of making arrests and executing search warrants).  An officer who drafts an affidavit, types up an application and proposed warrant, and then obtains a judges approval naturally assumes that he has filled out the warrant form correctly.  Even if the officer checks over the warrant, he may very well miss a mistake.  We all tend toward myopia when looking for our own errors.  Every lawyer and every judge can recite examples of documents that they wrote, checked, and doublechecked, but that still contained glaring errors.  Law enforcement officers are no different.  It would be better if the officer recognizes the error, of course.  It would be better still if he does not make the mistake in the first place.  In the context of an otherwise proper search, however, an officers failure to recognize
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				his clerical error on a warrant form can be a reasonable mistake.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court reaches a different result by construing the officers error as a mistake of law rather than a mistake of fact.  According to the Court, the officer should not receive qualified immunity because no reasonable officer could believe that a warrant that plainly did not comply with [the particularity] requirement was valid.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 12.  The majority is surely right that a reasonable officer must know that a defective warrant is invalid.  This much is obvious, if not tautological.  It is also irrelevant, for the essential question here is whether a reasonable officer in petitioners position would necessarily know that the warrant had a clerical error in the first place.  The issue in this case is whether an officer can reasonably fail to recognize a clerical error, not whether an officer who recognizes a clerical error can reasonably conclude that a defective warrant is legally valid.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court gives little attention to this important and difficult question.  It receives only two sentences at the very end of the Courts opinion.  In the first sentence, the Court quotes dictum from 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Leon,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/468/897" class="subref" title="subref">468 U. S. 897</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">923</a> (1984)
, to the effect that  a warrant may be so facially deficient
				<em>
					i.e.,
				</em>
				 in failing to particularize the place to be searched or the things to be seizedthat the executing officers cannot reasonably presume it to be valid.   
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 1314.  In the second sentence, the Court informs us without explanation that [t]his is such a case.  
				<em>
					Ante, 
				</em>
				at 14.  This reasoning is not convincing.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				To understand the passage from 
				<em>
					Leon
				</em>
				 that the Court relies upon, it helps to recognize that most challenges to defective search warrants arise when officers rely on the defect and conduct a search that should not have occurred. The target of the improper search then brings a civil action challenging the improper search, or, if charges have been filed, moves to suppress the fruits of the search.  The inquiry in both instances is whether the officers reliance on the defect was reasonable.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Garrison,
				</em>
            <em>

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The language the Court quotes from 
				<em>
					Leon
				</em>
				 comes from a discussion of when an officer [who] has obtained a [defective] warrant and abided by its terms has acted reasonably.  468 U. S., at 922.  The discussion notes that there are some cases in which no reasonably well trained officer should rely on the warrant.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 923.  The passage also includes several examples, among them the one that the Court relies on in this case: depending on the circumstances of the particular case, a warrant may be so facially deficient
				<em>
					i.e
				</em>
				., in failing to particularize the place to be searched or the things to be seizedthat the executing officers cannot reasonably presume it to be valid.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court interprets this language to mean that a clerical mistake can be so obvious that an officer who fails to recognize the mistake should not receive qualified immunity.  Read in context, however, the quoted language is addressed to a quite different issue.  The most natural interpretation of the language is that a clerical mistake can be so obvious that the officer cannot reasonably rely on the mistake in the course of executing the warrant.  In other words, a defect can be so clear that an officer cannot reasonably abid[e] by its terms and execute the warrant as written.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 922.
			</p>

				We confront no such issue here, of course.  No one suggests that the officer reasonably could have relied on the defective language in the warrant.  This is a case about an officer being unaware of a clerical error, not a case about an officer relying on one.  The respondents do not make the usual claim that they were injured by a defect that led to an improper search.  Rather, they make an unusual claim that they were injured simply because the warrant form did not contain the correct description of the property to be seized, even though no property was seized.  The language from

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The present case involves a straightforward mistake of fact.  Although the Court does not acknowledge it directly, it is obvious from the record below that the officer simply made a clerical error when he filled out the proposed warrant and offered it to the Magistrate Judge.  The officer used the proper description of the property to be seized when he completed the affidavit.  He also used the proper description in the accompanying application.  When he typed up the description a third time for the proposed warrant, however, the officer accidentally entered a description of the place to be searched in the part of the warrant form that called for a description of the property to be seized.  No one noticed the error before the search was executed.  Although the record is not entirely clear on this point, the mistake apparently remained undiscovered until the day after the search when respondents attorney reviewed the warrant for defects.  The officer, being unaware of his mistake, did not rely on it in any way.  It is uncontested that the officer trained the search team and executed the warrant based on his mistaken belief that the warrant contained the proper description of the items to be seized.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The question is whether the officers mistaken belief that the warrant contained the proper language was a reasonable belief.  In my view, it was.  A law enforcement officer charged with leading a team to execute a search warrant for illegal weapons must fulfill a number of serious responsibilities.  The officer must establish probable cause to believe the crime has been committed and that evidence is likely to be found at the place to be searched; must articulate specific items that can be seized, and a specific place to be searched; must obtain the warrant from a magistrate judge; and must instruct a search team to execute the warrant within the time allowed by the warrant.  The officer must also oversee the execution of the warrant in a way that protects officer safety, directs a thorough and professional search for the evidence, and avoids unnecessary destruction of property.  These difficult and important tasks demand the officers full attention in the heat of an ongoing and often dangerous criminal investigation.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				An officer who complies fully with all of these duties can be excused for not being aware that he had made a clerical error in the course of filling out the proposed warrant.  See 
				<em>
					Maryland
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Garrison,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/480/79" class="subref" title="subref">480 U. S. 79</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">87</a> (1987)
 (recognizing the need to allow some latitude for honest mistakes that are made by officers in the dangerous and difficult process of making arrests and executing search warrants).  An officer who drafts an affidavit, types up an application and proposed warrant, and then obtains a judges approval naturally assumes that he has filled out the warrant form correctly.  Even if the officer checks over the warrant, he may very well miss a mistake.  We all tend toward myopia when looking for our own errors.  Every lawyer and every judge can recite examples of documents that they wrote, checked, and doublechecked, but that still contained glaring errors.  Law enforcement officers are no different.  It would be better if the officer recognizes the error, of course.  It would be better still if he does not make the mistake in the first place.  In the context of an otherwise proper search, however, an officers failure to recognize
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				his clerical error on a warrant form can be a reasonable mistake.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court reaches a different result by construing the officers error as a mistake of law rather than a mistake of fact.  According to the Court, the officer should not receive qualified immunity because no reasonable officer could believe that a warrant that plainly did not comply with [the particularity] requirement was valid.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 12.  The majority is surely right that a reasonable officer must know that a defective warrant is invalid.  This much is obvious, if not tautological.  It is also irrelevant, for the essential question here is whether a reasonable officer in petitioners position would necessarily know that the warrant had a clerical error in the first place.  The issue in this case is whether an officer can reasonably fail to recognize a clerical error, not whether an officer who recognizes a clerical error can reasonably conclude that a defective warrant is legally valid.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court gives little attention to this important and difficult question.  It receives only two sentences at the very end of the Courts opinion.  In the first sentence, the Court quotes dictum from 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Leon,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/468/897" class="subref" title="subref">468 U. S. 897</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">923</a> (1984)
, to the effect that  a warrant may be so facially deficient
				<em>
					i.e.,
				</em>
				 in failing to particularize the place to be searched or the things to be seizedthat the executing officers cannot reasonably presume it to be valid.   
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 1314.  In the second sentence, the Court informs us without explanation that [t]his is such a case.  
				<em>
					Ante, 
				</em>
				at 14.  This reasoning is not convincing.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				To understand the passage from 
				<em>
					Leon
				</em>
				 that the Court relies upon, it helps to recognize that most challenges to defective search warrants arise when officers rely on the defect and conduct a search that should not have occurred. The target of the improper search then brings a civil action challenging the improper search, or, if charges have been filed, moves to suppress the fruits of the search.  The inquiry in both instances is whether the officers reliance on the defect was reasonable.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Garrison,
				</em>
            <em>

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The language the Court quotes from 
				<em>
					Leon
				</em>
				 comes from a discussion of when an officer [who] has obtained a [defective] warrant and abided by its terms has acted reasonably.  468 U. S., at 922.  The discussion notes that there are some cases in which no reasonably well trained officer should rely on the warrant.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 923.  The passage also includes several examples, among them the one that the Court relies on in this case: depending on the circumstances of the particular case, a warrant may be so facially deficient
				<em>
					i.e
				</em>
				., in failing to particularize the place to be searched or the things to be seizedthat the executing officers cannot reasonably presume it to be valid.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court interprets this language to mean that a clerical mistake can be so obvious that an officer who fails to recognize the mistake should not receive qualified immunity.  Read in context, however, the quoted language is addressed to a quite different issue.  The most natural interpretation of the language is that a clerical mistake can be so obvious that the officer cannot reasonably rely on the mistake in the course of executing the warrant.  In other words, a defect can be so clear that an officer cannot reasonably abid[e] by its terms and execute the warrant as written.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>

				We confront no such issue here, of course.  No one suggests that the officer reasonably could have relied on the defective language in the warrant.

 (recognizing the need to allow some latitude for honest mistakes that are made by officers in the dangerous and difficult process of making arrests and executing search warrants).  An officer who drafts an affidavit, types up an application and proposed warrant, and then obtains a judges approval naturally assumes that he has filled out the warrant form correctly.  Even if the officer checks over the warrant, he may very well miss a mistake.  We all tend toward myopia when looking for our own errors.  Every lawyer and every judge can recite examples of documents that they wrote, checked, and doublechecked, but that still contained glaring errors.  Law enforcement officers are no different.  It would be better if the officer recognizes the error, of course.  It would be better still if he does not make the mistake in the first place.  In the context of an otherwise proper search, however, an officers failure to recognize
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				his clerical error on a warrant form can be a reasonable mistake.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court reaches a different result by construing the officers error as a mistake of law rather than a mistake of fact.  According to the Court, the officer should not receive qualified immunity because no reasonable officer could believe that a warrant that plainly did not comply with [the particularity] requirement was valid.  
				<em>
					Ante

				, at 12.  The majority is surely right that a reasonable officer must know that a defective warrant is invalid.  This much is obvious, if not tautological.  It is also irrelevant, for the essential question here is whether a reasonable officer in petitioners position would necessarily know that the warrant had a clerical error in the first place.  The issue in this case is whether an officer can reasonably fail to recognize a clerical error, not whether an officer who recognizes a clerical error can reasonably conclude that a defective warrant is legally valid.

				The Court gives little attention to this important and difficult question.  It receives only two sentences at the very end of the Courts opinion.  In the first sentence, the Court quotes dictum from

, to the effect that  a warrant may be so facially deficient

				To understand the passage from 
				<em>
					Leon
				</em>
				 that the Court relies upon, it helps to recognize that most challenges to defective search warrants arise when officers rely on the defect and conduct a search that should not have occurred. The target of the improper search then brings a civil action challenging the improper search, or, if charges have been filed, moves to suppress the fruits of the search.  The inquiry in both instances is whether the officers reliance on the defect was reasonable.  See,

				The language the Court quotes from 
				<em>
					Leon
				</em>
				 comes from a discussion of when an officer [who] has obtained a [defective] warrant and abided by its terms has acted reasonably.  468 U. S., at 922.  The discussion notes that there are some cases in which no reasonably well trained officer should rely on the warrant.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 923.  The passage also includes several examples, among them the one that the Court relies on in this case: depending on the circumstances of the particular case, a warrant may be so facially deficient
				<em>
					i.e
				</em>
				., in failing to particularize the place to be searched or the things to be seizedthat the executing officers cannot reasonably presume it to be valid.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court interprets this language to mean that a clerical mistake can be so obvious that an officer who fails to recognize the mistake should not receive qualified immunity.  Read in context, however, the quoted language is addressed to a quite different issue.  The most natural interpretation of the language is that a clerical mistake can be so obvious that the officer cannot reasonably rely on the mistake in the course of executing the warrant.  In other words, a defect can be so clear that an officer cannot reasonably abid[e] by its terms and execute the warrant as written.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 922.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We confront no such issue here, of course.  No one suggests that the officer reasonably could have relied on the defective language in the warrant.  This is a case about an officer being unaware of a clerical error, not a case about an officer relying on one.  The respondents do not make the usual claim that they were injured by a defect that led to an improper search.  Rather, they make an unusual claim that they were injured simply because the warrant form did not contain the correct description of the property to be seized, even though no property was seized.  The language from 
				<em>
					Leon
				</em>
				 is not on point.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The present case involves a straightforward mistake of fact.  Although the Court does not acknowledge it directly, it is obvious from the record below that the officer simply made a clerical error when he filled out the proposed warrant and offered it to the Magistrate Judge.  The officer used the proper description of the property to be seized when he completed the affidavit.  He also used the proper description in the accompanying application.  When he typed up the description a third time for the proposed warrant, however, the officer accidentally entered a description of the place to be searched in the part of the warrant form that called for a description of the property to be seized.  No one noticed the error before the search was executed.  Although the record is not entirely clear on this point, the mistake apparently remained undiscovered until the day after the search when respondents attorney reviewed the warrant for defects.  The officer, being unaware of his mistake, did not rely on it in any way.  It is uncontested that the officer trained the search team and executed the warrant based on his mistaken belief that the warrant contained the proper description of the items to be seized.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The question is whether the officers mistaken belief that the warrant contained the proper language was a reasonable belief.  In my view, it was.  A law enforcement officer charged with leading a team to execute a search warrant for illegal weapons must fulfill a number of serious responsibilities.  The officer must establish probable cause to believe the crime has been committed and that evidence is likely to be found at the place to be searched; must articulate specific items that can be seized, and a specific place to be searched; must obtain the warrant from a magistrate judge; and must instruct a search team to execute the warrant within the time allowed by the warrant.  The officer must also oversee the execution of the warrant in a way that protects officer safety, directs a thorough and professional search for the evidence, and avoids unnecessary destruction of property.  These difficult and important tasks demand the officers full attention in the heat of an ongoing and often dangerous criminal investigation.

				The present case involves a straightforward mistake of fact.  Although the Court does not acknowledge it directly, it is obvious from the record below that the officer simply made a clerical error when he filled out the proposed warrant and offered it to the Magistrate Judge.  The officer used the proper description of the property to be seized when he completed the affidavit.  He also used the proper description in the accompanying application.  When he typed up the description a third time for the proposed warrant, however, the officer accidentally entered a description of the place to be searched in the part of the warrant form that called for a description of the property to be seized.  No one noticed the error before the search was executed.  Although the record is not entirely clear on this point, the mistake apparently remained undiscovered until the day after the search when respondents attorney reviewed the warrant for defects.  The officer, being unaware of his mistake, did not rely on it in any way.  It is uncontested that the officer trained the search team and executed the warrant based on his mistaken belief that the warrant contained the proper description of the items to be seized.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The question is whether the officers mistaken belief that the warrant contained the proper language was a reasonable belief.  In my view, it was.  A law enforcement officer charged with leading a team to execute a search warrant for illegal weapons must fulfill a number of serious responsibilities.  The officer must establish probable cause to believe the crime has been committed and that evidence is likely to be found at the place to be searched; must articulate specific items that can be seized, and a specific place to be searched; must obtain the warrant from a magistrate judge; and must instruct a search team to execute the warrant within the time allowed by the warrant.  The officer must also oversee the execution of the warrant in a way that protects officer safety, directs a thorough and professional search for the evidence, and avoids unnecessary destruction of property.  These difficult and important tasks demand the officers full attention in the heat of an ongoing and often dangerous criminal investigation.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				An officer who complies fully with all of these duties can be excused for not being aware that he had made a clerical error in the course of filling out the proposed warrant.  See 
				<em>
					Maryland
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Garrison,
				</em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">87</a> (1987)
 (recognizing the need to allow some latitude for honest mistakes that are made by officers in the dangerous and difficult process of making arrests and executing search warrants).  An officer who drafts an affidavit, types up an application and proposed warrant, and then obtains a judges approval naturally assumes that he has filled out the warrant form correctly.  Even if the officer checks over the warrant, he may very well miss a mistake.  We all tend toward myopia when looking for our own errors.  Every lawyer and every judge can recite examples of documents that they wrote, checked, and doublechecked, but that still contained glaring errors.  Law enforcement officers are no different.  It would be better if the officer recognizes the error, of course.  It would be better still if he does not make the mistake in the first place.  In the context of an otherwise proper search, however, an officers failure to recognize
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				his clerical error on a warrant form can be a reasonable mistake.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court reaches a different result by construing the officers error as a mistake of law rather than a mistake of fact.  According to the Court, the officer should not receive qualified immunity because no reasonable officer could believe that a warrant that plainly did not comply with [the particularity] requirement was valid.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 12.  The majority is surely right that a reasonable officer must know that a defective warrant is invalid.  This much is obvious, if not tautological.  It is also irrelevant, for the essential question here is whether a reasonable officer in petitioners position would necessarily know that the warrant had a clerical error in the first place.  The issue in this case is whether an officer can reasonably fail to recognize a clerical error, not whether an officer who recognizes a clerical error can reasonably conclude that a defective warrant is legally valid.

, to the effect that  a warrant may be so facially deficient

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				To understand the passage from 
				<em>
					Leon
				</em>
				 that the Court relies upon, it helps to recognize that most challenges to defective search warrants arise when officers rely on the defect and conduct a search that should not have occurred. The target of the improper search then brings a civil action challenging the improper search, or, if charges have been filed, moves to suppress the fruits of the search.  The inquiry in both instances is whether the officers reliance on the defect was reasonable.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The language the Court quotes from 
				<em>
					Leon
				</em>
				 comes from a discussion of when an officer [who] has obtained a [defective] warrant and abided by its terms has acted reasonably.  468 U. S., at 922.  The discussion notes that there are some cases in which no reasonably well trained officer should rely on the warrant.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 923.  The passage also includes several examples, among them the one that the Court relies on in this case: depending on the circumstances of the particular case, a warrant may be so facially deficient
				<em>
					i.e
				</em>
				., in failing to particularize the place to be searched or the things to be seizedthat the executing officers cannot reasonably presume it to be valid.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court interprets this language to mean that a clerical mistake can be so obvious that an officer who fails to recognize the mistake should not receive qualified immunity.  Read in context, however, the quoted language is addressed to a quite different issue.  The most natural interpretation of the language is that a clerical mistake can be so obvious that the officer cannot reasonably rely on the mistake in the course of executing the warrant.  In other words, a defect can be so clear that an officer cannot reasonably abid[e] by its terms and execute the warrant as written.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 922.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We confront no such issue here, of course.  No one suggests that the officer reasonably could have relied on the defective language in the warrant.  This is a case about an officer being unaware of a clerical error, not a case about an officer relying on one.  The respondents do not make the usual claim that they were injured by a defect that led to an improper search.  Rather, they make an unusual claim that they were injured simply because the warrant form did not contain the correct description of the property to be seized, even though no property was seized.  The language from 
				<em>
					Leon
				</em>
				 is not on point.

				<em>

The target of the improper search then brings a civil action challenging the improper search, or, if charges have been filed, moves to suppress the fruits of the search.

				The language the Court quotes from 
				<em>
					Leon
				</em>
				 comes from a discussion of when an officer [who] has obtained a [defective] warrant and abided by its terms has acted reasonably.  468 U. S., at 922.  The discussion notes that there are some cases in which no reasonably well trained officer should rely on the warrant.

				, at 923.  The passage also includes several examples, among them the one that the Court relies on in this case: depending on the circumstances of the particular case, a warrant may be so facially deficient

				The Court interprets this language to mean that a clerical mistake can be so obvious that an officer who fails to recognize the mistake should not receive qualified immunity.  Read in context, however, the quoted language is addressed to a quite different issue.  The most natural interpretation of the language is that a clerical mistake can be so obvious that the officer cannot reasonably rely on the mistake in the course of executing the warrant.  In other words, a defect can be so clear that an officer cannot reasonably abid[e] by its terms and execute the warrant as written.

				We confront no such issue here, of course.  No one suggests that the officer reasonably could have relied on the defective language in the warrant.  This is a case about an officer being unaware of a clerical error, not a case about an officer relying on one.  The respondents do not make the usual claim that they were injured by a defect that led to an improper search.  Rather, they make an unusual claim that they were injured simply because the warrant form did not contain the correct description of the property to be seized, even though no property was seized.  The language from 
				<em>

 (noting that qualified immunity covers mere mistakes in judgment, whether the mistake is one of fact or one of law).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The present case involves a straightforward mistake of fact.  Although the Court does not acknowledge it directly, it is obvious from the record below that the officer simply made a clerical error when he filled out the proposed warrant and offered it to the Magistrate Judge.  The officer used the proper description of the property to be seized when he completed the affidavit.  He also used the proper description in the accompanying application.  When he typed up the description a third time for the proposed warrant, however, the officer accidentally entered a description of the place to be searched in the part of the warrant form that called for a description of the property to be seized.  No one noticed the error before the search was executed.  Although the record is not entirely clear on this point, the mistake apparently remained undiscovered until the day after the search when respondents attorney reviewed the warrant for defects.  The officer, being unaware of his mistake, did not rely on it in any way.  It is uncontested that the officer trained the search team and executed the warrant based on his mistaken belief that the warrant contained the proper description of the items to be seized.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The question is whether the officers mistaken belief that the warrant contained the proper language was a reasonable belief.  In my view, it was.  A law enforcement officer charged with leading a team to execute a search warrant for illegal weapons must fulfill a number of serious responsibilities.  The officer must establish probable cause to believe the crime has been committed and that evidence is likely to be found at the place to be searched; must articulate specific items that can be seized, and a specific place to be searched; must obtain the warrant from a magistrate judge; and must instruct a search team to execute the warrant within the time allowed by the warrant.  The officer must also oversee the execution of the warrant in a way that protects officer safety, directs a thorough and professional search for the evidence, and avoids unnecessary destruction of property.  These difficult and important tasks demand the officers full attention in the heat of an ongoing and often dangerous criminal investigation.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				An officer who complies fully with all of these duties can be excused for not being aware that he had made a clerical error in the course of filling out the proposed warrant.  See 
				<em>
					Maryland
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Garrison,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/480/79" class="subref" title="subref">480 U. S. 79</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">87</a> (1987)
 (recognizing the need to allow some latitude for honest mistakes that are made by officers in the dangerous and difficult process of making arrests and executing search warrants).  An officer who drafts an affidavit, types up an application and proposed warrant, and then obtains a judges approval naturally assumes that he has filled out the warrant form correctly.  Even if the officer checks over the warrant, he may very well miss a mistake.  We all tend toward myopia when looking for our own errors.  Every lawyer and every judge can recite examples of documents that they wrote, checked, and doublechecked, but that still contained glaring errors.  Law enforcement officers are no different.  It would be better if the officer recognizes the error, of course.  It would be better still if he does not make the mistake in the first place.  In the context of an otherwise proper search, however, an officers failure to recognize
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				his clerical error on a warrant form can be a reasonable mistake.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court reaches a different result by construing the officers error as a mistake of law rather than a mistake of fact.  According to the Court, the officer should not receive qualified immunity because no reasonable officer could believe that a warrant that plainly did not comply with [the particularity] requirement was valid.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 12.  The majority is surely right that a reasonable officer must know that a defective warrant is invalid.  This much is obvious, if not tautological.  It is also irrelevant, for the essential question here is whether a reasonable officer in petitioners position would necessarily know that the warrant had a clerical error in the first place.  The issue in this case is whether an officer can reasonably fail to recognize a clerical error, not whether an officer who recognizes a clerical error can reasonably conclude that a defective warrant is legally valid.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court gives little attention to this important and difficult question.  It receives only two sentences at the very end of the Courts opinion.  In the first sentence, the Court quotes dictum from

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">923</a> (1984)
, to the effect that  a warrant may be so facially deficient
				<em>
					i.e.,
				</em>
				 in failing to particularize the place to be searched or the things to be seizedthat the executing officers cannot reasonably presume it to be valid. 

				, at 1314.  In the second sentence, the Court informs us without explanation that [t]his is such a case.

				The present case involves a straightforward mistake of fact.  Although the Court does not acknowledge it directly, it is obvious from the record below that the officer simply made a clerical error when he filled out the proposed warrant and offered it to the Magistrate Judge.  The officer used the proper description of the property to be seized when he completed the affidavit.  He also used the proper description in the accompanying application.  When he typed up the description a third time for the proposed warrant, however, the officer accidentally entered a description of the place to be searched in the part of the warrant form that called for a description of the property to be seized.  No one noticed the error before the search was executed.  Although the record is not entirely clear on this point, the mistake apparently remained undiscovered until the day after the search when respondents attorney reviewed the warrant for defects.  The officer, being unaware of his mistake, did not rely on it in any way.  It is uncontested that the officer trained the search team and executed the warrant based on his mistaken belief that the warrant contained the proper description of the items to be seized.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The question is whether the officers mistaken belief that the warrant contained the proper language was a reasonable belief.  In my view, it was.  A law enforcement officer charged with leading a team to execute a search warrant for illegal weapons must fulfill a number of serious responsibilities.  The officer must establish probable cause to believe the crime has been committed and that evidence is likely to be found at the place to be searched; must articulate specific items that can be seized, and a specific place to be searched; must obtain the warrant from a magistrate judge; and must instruct a search team to execute the warrant within the time allowed by the warrant.  The officer must also oversee the execution of the warrant in a way that protects officer safety, directs a thorough and professional search for the evidence, and avoids unnecessary destruction of property.  These difficult and important tasks demand the officers full attention in the heat of an ongoing and often dangerous criminal investigation.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				An officer who complies fully with all of these duties can be excused for not being aware that he had made a clerical error in the course of filling out the proposed warrant.  See 
				<em>
					Maryland
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Garrison,
				</em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">87</a> (1987)
 (recognizing the need to allow some latitude for honest mistakes that are made by officers in the dangerous and difficult process of making arrests and executing search warrants).  An officer who drafts an affidavit, types up an application and proposed warrant, and then obtains a judges approval naturally assumes that he has filled out the warrant form correctly.  Even if the officer checks over the warrant, he may very well miss a mistake.  We all tend toward myopia when looking for our own errors.  Every lawyer and every judge can recite examples of documents that they wrote, checked, and doublechecked, but that still contained glaring errors.  Law enforcement officers are no different.  It would be better if the officer recognizes the error, of course.  It would be better still if he does not make the mistake in the first place.  In the context of an otherwise proper search, however, an officers failure to recognize
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				his clerical error on a warrant form can be a reasonable mistake.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court reaches a different result by construing the officers error as a mistake of law rather than a mistake of fact.  According to the Court, the officer should not receive qualified immunity because no reasonable officer could believe that a warrant that plainly did not comply with [the particularity] requirement was valid.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 12.  The majority is surely right that a reasonable officer must know that a defective warrant is invalid.  This much is obvious, if not tautological.  It is also irrelevant, for the essential question here is whether a reasonable officer in petitioners position would necessarily know that the warrant had a clerical error in the first place.  The issue in this case is whether an officer can reasonably fail to recognize a clerical error, not whether an officer who recognizes a clerical error can reasonably conclude that a defective warrant is legally valid.

, to the effect that  a warrant may be so facially deficient

				To understand the passage from 
				<em>

				 that the Court relies upon, it helps to recognize that most challenges to defective search warrants arise when officers rely on the defect and conduct a search that should not have occurred. The target of the improper search then brings a civil action challenging the improper search, or, if charges have been filed, moves to suppress the fruits of the search.  The inquiry in both instances is whether the officers reliance on the defect was reasonable.  See,

				The language the Court quotes from 
				<em>
					Leon
				</em>
				 comes from a discussion of when an officer [who] has obtained a [defective] warrant and abided by its terms has acted reasonably.  468 U. S., at 922.  The discussion notes that there are some cases in which no reasonably well trained officer should rely on the warrant.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 923.  The passage also includes several examples, among them the one that the Court relies on in this case: depending on the circumstances of the particular case, a warrant may be so facially deficient
				<em>
					i.e
				</em>
				., in failing to particularize the place to be searched or the things to be seizedthat the executing officers cannot reasonably presume it to be valid.  
				<em>

				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court interprets this language to mean that a clerical mistake can be so obvious that an officer who fails to recognize the mistake should not receive qualified immunity.  Read in context, however, the quoted language is addressed to a quite different issue.  The most natural interpretation of the language is that a clerical mistake can be so obvious that the officer cannot reasonably rely on the mistake in the course of executing the warrant.  In other words, a defect can be so clear that an officer cannot reasonably abid[e] by its terms and execute the warrant as written.

					Id., 
				</em>

				We confront no such issue here, of course.  No one suggests that the officer reasonably could have relied on the defective language in the warrant.  This is a case about an officer being unaware of a clerical error, not a case about an officer relying on one.  The respondents do not make the usual claim that they were injured by a defect that led to an improper search.  Rather, they make an unusual claim that they were injured simply because the warrant form did not contain the correct description of the property to be seized, even though no property was seized.  The language from 
				<em>

				 is not on point.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The present case involves a straightforward mistake of fact.  Although the Court does not acknowledge it directly, it is obvious from the record below that the officer simply made a clerical error when he filled out the proposed warrant and offered it to the Magistrate Judge.  The officer used the proper description of the property to be seized when he completed the affidavit.  He also used the proper description in the accompanying application.  When he typed up the description a third time for the proposed warrant, however, the officer accidentally entered a description of the place to be searched in the part of the warrant form that called for a description of the property to be seized.  No one noticed the error before the search was executed.  Although the record is not entirely clear on this point, the mistake apparently remained undiscovered until the day after the search when respondents attorney reviewed the warrant for defects.  The officer, being unaware of his mistake, did not rely on it in any way.  It is uncontested that the officer trained the search team and executed the warrant based on his mistaken belief that the warrant contained the proper description of the items to be seized.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The question is whether the officers mistaken belief that the warrant contained the proper language was a reasonable belief.  In my view, it was.  A law enforcement officer charged with leading a team to execute a search warrant for illegal weapons must fulfill a number of serious responsibilities.  The officer must establish probable cause to believe the crime has been committed and that evidence is likely to be found at the place to be searched; must articulate specific items that can be seized, and a specific place to be searched; must obtain the warrant from a magistrate judge; and must instruct a search team to execute the warrant within the time allowed by the warrant.  The officer must also oversee the execution of the warrant in a way that protects officer safety, directs a thorough and professional search for the evidence, and avoids unnecessary destruction of property.  These difficult and important tasks demand the officers full attention in the heat of an ongoing and often dangerous criminal investigation.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				An officer who complies fully with all of these duties can be excused for not being aware that he had made a clerical error in the course of filling out the proposed warrant.  See 
				<em>
					Maryland
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Garrison,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/480/79" class="subref" title="subref">480 U. S. 79</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">87</a> (1987)
 (recognizing the need to allow some latitude for honest mistakes that are made by officers in the dangerous and difficult process of making arrests and executing search warrants).  An officer who drafts an affidavit, types up an application and proposed warrant, and then obtains a judges approval naturally assumes that he has filled out the warrant form correctly.  Even if the officer checks over the warrant, he may very well miss a mistake.  We all tend toward myopia when looking for our own errors.  Every lawyer and every judge can recite examples of documents that they wrote, checked, and doublechecked, but that still contained glaring errors.  Law enforcement officers are no different.  It would be better if the officer recognizes the error, of course.  It would be better still if he does not make the mistake in the first place.  In the context of an otherwise proper search, however, an officers failure to recognize
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				his clerical error on a warrant form can be a reasonable mistake.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court reaches a different result by construing the officers error as a mistake of law rather than a mistake of fact.  According to the Court, the officer should not receive qualified immunity because no reasonable officer could believe that a warrant that plainly did not comply with [the particularity] requirement was valid.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 12.  The majority is surely right that a reasonable officer must know that a defective warrant is invalid.  This much is obvious, if not tautological.  It is also irrelevant, for the essential question here is whether a reasonable officer in petitioners position would necessarily know that the warrant had a clerical error in the first place.  The issue in this case is whether an officer can reasonably fail to recognize a clerical error, not whether an officer who recognizes a clerical error can reasonably conclude that a defective warrant is legally valid.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court gives little attention to this important and difficult question.  It receives only two sentences at the very end of the Courts opinion.  In the first sentence, the Court quotes dictum from 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Leon,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/468/897" class="subref" title="subref">468 U. S. 897</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">923</a> (1984)
, to the effect that  a warrant may be so facially deficient
				<em>
					i.e.,
				</em>
				 in failing to particularize the place to be searched or the things to be seizedthat the executing officers cannot reasonably presume it to be valid.   
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 1314.  In the second sentence, the Court informs us without explanation that [t]his is such a case.  
				<em>
					Ante, 
				</em>
				at 14.  This reasoning is not convincing.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				To understand the passage from 
				<em>
					Leon
				</em>
				 that the Court relies upon, it helps to recognize that most challenges to defective search warrants arise when officers rely on the defect and conduct a search that should not have occurred. The target of the improper search then brings a civil action challenging the improper search, or, if charges have been filed, moves to suppress the fruits of the search.  The inquiry in both instances is whether the officers reliance on the defect was reasonable.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Garrison,
				</em>
            <em>

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The language the Court quotes from 
				<em>
					Leon
				</em>
				 comes from a discussion of when an officer [who] has obtained a [defective] warrant and abided by its terms has acted reasonably.  468 U. S., at 922.  The discussion notes that there are some cases in which no reasonably well trained officer should rely on the warrant.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 923.  The passage also includes several examples, among them the one that the Court relies on in this case: depending on the circumstances of the particular case, a warrant may be so facially deficient
				<em>
					i.e
				</em>
				., in failing to particularize the place to be searched or the things to be seizedthat the executing officers cannot reasonably presume it to be valid.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court interprets this language to mean that a clerical mistake can be so obvious that an officer who fails to recognize the mistake should not receive qualified immunity.  Read in context, however, the quoted language is addressed to a quite different issue.  The most natural interpretation of the language is that a clerical mistake can be so obvious that the officer cannot reasonably rely on the mistake in the course of executing the warrant.  In other words, a defect can be so clear that an officer cannot reasonably abid[e] by its terms and execute the warrant as written.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 922.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We confront no such issue here, of course.  No one suggests that the officer reasonably could have relied on the defective language in the warrant.  This is a case about an officer being unaware of a clerical error, not a case about an officer relying on one.  The respondents do not make the usual claim that they were injured by a defect that led to an improper search.  Rather, they make an unusual claim that they were injured simply because the warrant form did not contain the correct description of the property to be seized, even though no property was seized.  The language from 
				<em>
					Leon
				</em>
				 is not on point.

Even if the officer checks over the warrant, he may very well miss a mistake.  We all tend toward myopia when looking for our own errors.  Every lawyer and every judge can recite examples of documents that they wrote, checked, and doublechecked, but that still contained glaring errors.  Law enforcement officers are no different.  It would be better if the officer recognizes the error, of course.  It would be better still if he does not make the mistake in the first place.  In the context of an otherwise proper search, however, an officers failure to recognize
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				his clerical error on a warrant form can be a reasonable mistake.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court reaches a different result by construing the officers error as a mistake of law rather than a mistake of fact.  According to the Court, the officer should not receive qualified immunity because no reasonable officer could believe that a warrant that plainly did not comply with [the particularity] requirement was valid.  
				<em>

				, at 12.  The majority is surely right that a reasonable officer must know that a defective warrant is invalid.  This much is obvious, if not tautological.  It is also irrelevant, for the essential question here is whether a reasonable officer in petitioners position would necessarily know that the warrant had a clerical error in the first place.  The issue in this case is whether an officer can reasonably fail to recognize a clerical error, not whether an officer who recognizes a clerical error can reasonably conclude that a defective warrant is legally valid.

				To understand the passage from 
				<em>

				 that the Court relies upon, it helps to recognize that most challenges to defective search warrants arise when officers rely on the defect and conduct a search that should not have occurred. The target of the improper search then brings a civil action challenging the improper search, or, if charges have been filed, moves to suppress the fruits of the search.  The inquiry in both instances is whether the officers reliance on the defect was reasonable.  See,

				The language the Court quotes from 
				<em>
					Leon
				</em>
				 comes from a discussion of when an officer [who] has obtained a [defective] warrant and abided by its terms has acted reasonably.  468 U. S., at 922.  The discussion notes that there are some cases in which no reasonably well trained officer should rely on the warrant.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 923.  The passage also includes several examples, among them the one that the Court relies on in this case: depending on the circumstances of the particular case, a warrant may be so facially deficient
				<em>
					i.e
				</em>
				., in failing to particularize the place to be searched or the things to be seizedthat the executing officers cannot reasonably presume it to be valid.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court interprets this language to mean that a clerical mistake can be so obvious that an officer who fails to recognize the mistake should not receive qualified immunity.  Read in context, however, the quoted language is addressed to a quite different issue.  The most natural interpretation of the language is that a clerical mistake can be so obvious that the officer cannot reasonably rely on the mistake in the course of executing the warrant.  In other words, a defect can be so clear that an officer cannot reasonably abid[e] by its terms and execute the warrant as written.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 922.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We confront no such issue here, of course.  No one suggests that the officer reasonably could have relied on the defective language in the warrant.  This is a case about an officer being unaware of a clerical error, not a case about an officer relying on one.  The respondents do not make the usual claim that they were injured by a defect that led to an improper search.  Rather, they make an unusual claim that they were injured simply because the warrant form did not contain the correct description of the property to be seized, even though no property was seized.  The language from 
				<em>

				 is not on point.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The present case involves a straightforward mistake of fact.  Although the Court does not acknowledge it directly, it is obvious from the record below that the officer simply made a clerical error when he filled out the proposed warrant and offered it to the Magistrate Judge.  The officer used the proper description of the property to be seized when he completed the affidavit.  He also used the proper description in the accompanying application.  When he typed up the description a third time for the proposed warrant, however, the officer accidentally entered a description of the place to be searched in the part of the warrant form that called for a description of the property to be seized.  No one noticed the error before the search was executed.  Although the record is not entirely clear on this point, the mistake apparently remained undiscovered until the day after the search when respondents attorney reviewed the warrant for defects.  The officer, being unaware of his mistake, did not rely on it in any way.  It is uncontested that the officer trained the search team and executed the warrant based on his mistaken belief that the warrant contained the proper description of the items to be seized.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The question is whether the officers mistaken belief that the warrant contained the proper language was a reasonable belief.  In my view, it was.  A law enforcement officer charged with leading a team to execute a search warrant for illegal weapons must fulfill a number of serious responsibilities.  The officer must establish probable cause to believe the crime has been committed and that evidence is likely to be found at the place to be searched; must articulate specific items that can be seized, and a specific place to be searched; must obtain the warrant from a magistrate judge; and must instruct a search team to execute the warrant within the time allowed by the warrant.  The officer must also oversee the execution of the warrant in a way that protects officer safety, directs a thorough and professional search for the evidence, and avoids unnecessary destruction of property.  These difficult and important tasks demand the officers full attention in the heat of an ongoing and often dangerous criminal investigation.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				An officer who complies fully with all of these duties can be excused for not being aware that he had made a clerical error in the course of filling out the proposed warrant.  See

					Maryland
				</em>
				 v.

					Garrison,

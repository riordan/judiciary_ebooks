				The Organic Act of Guam, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/48/1422.html" class="subref" title="subref">48 U. S. C. §1422</a>, provides, 
				<em>
					inter alia,
				</em>
				 that [i]f no [slate of] candidates [for Governor and Lieutenant Governor of Guam] receive[s] a majority of the votes cast in any election, . . . a runoff election shall be held.  Petitioners, candidates running on one slate for Governor and Lieutenant Governor, received a majority of the votes cast for gubernatorial slates in the 1998 Guam general election, but did not receive a majority of the total number of ballots that voters cast.  Respondents, petitioners opponents, sought a writ of mandamus ordering a runoff election.  The District Court issued the writ, and the Ninth Circuit ultimately affirmed, interpreting the statutory phrase majority of the votes cast in any election to require that a slate receive a majority of the total number of ballots cast in the general election.

            <em>
					Held:
				</em>
				 The Guam Organic Act does not require a runoff election when a candidate slate has received a majority of the votes cast for Governor and Lieutenant Governor of the Territory, but not a majority of the number of ballots cast in the simultaneous general election.  Section 1422 contains six express references to an election for those offices, two of them preceding the phrase in any election, and four following.  So surrounded, any election can only refer to an election for Governor and Lieutenant Governor, for words are known by their companions.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Gustafson
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Alloyd Co.,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/513/561" class="subref" title="subref">513 U. S. 561</a>.  This reading is confirmed by the fact that, later in §1422, Congress varied the specific modifier when it spoke of the general election at which the gubernatorial election would occur.  Congress would hardly have used any election to mean general election, only to mention general election a few lines further on.  It would be equally odd to think that after repeatedly using votes or vote to mean an expression of choice for the gubernatorial slate, Congress suddenly used votes cast in any election to mean ballots cast, as respondents suggest.  Congress, indeed, has shown that it recognizes the difference between ballots and votes in the very context of Guamanian elections: From 1972 until 1998, §1712 expressly required that the Guam Delegate be elected by separate ballot and by a majority of the votes cast for … Delegate.  To accept respondents reading would also impute to Congress a strange preference for making it hard to select a Governor, because a runoff would be required even though one slate already had a majority of all those who cared to choose among gubernatorial candidates.  Requiring a majority of the total number of voters on election day would also be in some tension with §1422a, which provides for removal of a Governor or Lieutenant Governor upon the vote of at least two-thirds of the total number of persons who actually voted for such office, not the total number who went to the polls.  Respondents two considerations pointing to a contrary readingthat because §1712 specifically states that a majority of the votes cast for . . . Delegate is necessary to elect a Delegate, §1422 would require a comparably clear modifier to refer to sufficient votes to elect gubernatorial slates; and that this Courts reading of any election would render that phrase a nullity and thus offend the rule against attributing redundancy to Congressare rejected.

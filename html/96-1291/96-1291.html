				An employee, as part of a termination agreement, signed a release of all claims against her employer.  In consideration, she received severance pay in installments.

				  After receiving the last payment, the employee brought suit under the ADEA.  The employer claims the employee ratified and validated the nonconforming release by retaining the monies paid to secure it.  The employer also insists the release bars the action unless, as a precondition to filing suit, the employee tenders back the monies received.  We disagree and rule that, as the release did not comply with the statute, it cannot bar the ADEA claim.

				Petitioner Dolores Oubre worked as a scheduler at a power plant in Killona, Louisiana, run by her employer, respondent Entergy Operations, Inc.  In 1994, she received a poor performance rating.  Oubres supervisor met with her on January 17, 1995, and gave her the option of either improving her performance during the coming year or accepting a voluntary arrangement for her severance.  She received a packet of information about the severance agreement and had 14 days to consider her options, during which she consulted with attorneys.  On January 31, Oubre decided to accept.  She signed a release, in which she agree[d] to waive, settle, release, and discharge any and all claims, demands, damages, actions, or causes of action … that I may have against Entergy … .  App. 61.  In exchange, she received six installment payments over the next four months, totaling $6,258.

In procuring the release, Entergy did not comply with the OWBPA in at least three respects: (1) Entergy did not give Oubre enough time to consider her options.  (2) Entergy did not give Oubre seven days after she signed the release to change her mind.  And (3) the release made no specific reference to claims under the ADEA.

				Oubre filed a charge of age discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which dismissed her charge on the merits but issued a right-to-sue letter.  She filed this suit against Entergy in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, alleging constructive discharge on the basis of her age in violation of the ADEA and state law.  Oubre has not offered or tried to return the $6,258 to Entergy, nor is it clear she has the means to do so.  Entergy moved for summary judgment, claiming Oubre had ratified the defective release by failing to return or offer to return the monies she had received.  The District Court agreed and entered summary judgment for Entergy.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, 112 F. 3d 787 (CA5 1996)

				The employer rests its case upon general principles of state contract jurisprudence.  As the employer recites the rule, contracts tainted by mistake, duress, or even fraud are voidable at the option of the innocent party.  See 1 Restatement (Second) of Contracts §7, and Comment

				, No. 059401368CV, 1995 WL 479645, *3 (Tex. App.Dallas, Aug. 14, 1995) (unpublished).  The employer also invokes the doctrine of equitable estoppel.  As a rule, equitable estoppel bars a party from shirking the burdens of a voidable transaction for as long as she retains the benefits received under it.  See,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">234</a> (1933)
 (citing state case law from Indiana and New York).  Applying these principles, the employer claims the employee ratified the ineffective release (or faces estoppel) by retaining all the sums paid in consideration of it.  The employer, then, relies not upon the execution of the release but upon a later, distinct ratification of its terms.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				These general rules may not be as unified as the employer asserts.  See generally Annot., 76 A. L. R. 344 (1932) (collecting cases supporting and contradicting these rules); Annot., 134 A. L. R. 6 (1941) (same).  And in equity, a person suing to rescind a contract, as a rule, is not required to restore the consideration at the very outset of the litigation.  See 3 Restatement (Second) of Contracts,

				 (1936); D. Dobbs, Law of Remedies §4.8, p. 294 (1973).  Even if the employers statement of the general rule requiring tender back before one files suit were correct, it would be unavailing.  The rule cited is based simply on the course of negotiation of the parties and the alleged later ratification.  The authorities cited do not consider the question raised by statutory standards for releases and a statutory declaration making non-conforming releases ineffective.  It is the latter question we confront here.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In 1990, Congress amended the ADEA by passing the OWBPA.  The OWBPA provides: An individual may not waive any right or claim under [the ADEA] unless the waiver is knowing and voluntary… . [A] waiver may not be considered knowing and voluntary unless at a minimum it satisfies certain enumerated requirements, including the three listed above.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/29/626.html#f_1" class="subref" title="subref">29 U. S. C. §626(f)(1)</a>.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The statutory command is clear: An employee may not waive an ADEA claim unless the waiver or release satisfies the OWBPAs requirements.  The policy of the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act is likewise clear from its title: It is designed to protect the rights and benefits of older workers.  The OWBPA implements Congress policy via a strict, unqualified statutory stricture on waivers, and we are bound to take Congress at its word.  Congress imposed specific duties on employers who seek releases of certain claims created by statute.  Congress delineated these duties with precision and without qualification: An employee may not waive an ADEA claim unless the employer complies with the statute.  Courts cannot with ease presume ratification of that which Congress forbids.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The OWBPA sets up its own regime for assessing the effect of ADEA waivers, separate and apart from contract law.  The statute creates a series of prerequisites for knowing and voluntary waivers and imposes affirmative duties of disclosure and waiting periods.  The OWBPA governs the effect under federal law of waivers or releases on ADEA claims and incorporates no exceptions or qualifications.  The text of the OWBPA forecloses the employers defense, notwithstanding how general contract principles would apply to non-ADEA claims.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The rule proposed by the employer would frustrate the statutes practical operation as well as its formal command.  In many instances a discharged employee likely will have spent the monies received and will lack the means to tender their return.  These realities might tempt employers to risk noncompliance with the OWBPAs waiver provisions, knowing it will be difficult to repay the monies and relying on ratification.  We ought not to open the door to an evasion of the statute by this device.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Oubres cause of action arises under the ADEA, and the release can have no effect on her ADEA claim unless it complies with the OWBPA.  In this case, both sides concede the release the employee signed did not comply with the requirements of the OWBPA.  Since Oubres release did not comply with the OWBPAs stringent safeguards, it is unenforceable against her insofar as it purports to waive or release her ADEA claim.  As a statutory matter, the release cannot bar her ADEA suit, irrespective of the validity of the contract as to other claims.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In further proceedings in this or other cases, courts may need to inquire whether the employer has claims for restitution, recoupment, or setoff against the employee, and these questions may be complex where a release is effective as to some claims but not as to ADEA claims.  We need not decide those issues here, however.  It suffices to hold that the release cannot bar the ADEA claim because it does not conform to the statute.  Nor did the employees mere retention of monies amount to a ratification equivalent to a valid release of her ADEA claims, since the retention did not comply with the OWBPA any more than the original release did.  The statute governs the effect of the release on ADEA claims, and the employer cannot invoke the employees failure to tender back as a way of excusing its own failure to comply.

				The statutory command is clear: An employee may not waive an ADEA claim unless the waiver or release satisfies the OWBPAs requirements.  The policy of the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act is likewise clear from its title: It is designed to protect the rights and benefits of older workers.  The OWBPA implements Congress policy via a strict, unqualified statutory stricture on waivers, and we are bound to take Congress at its word.  Congress imposed specific duties on employers who seek releases of certain claims created by statute.  Congress delineated these duties with precision and without qualification: An employee may not waive an ADEA claim unless the employer complies with the statute.  Courts cannot with ease presume ratification of that which Congress forbids.

				Oubres cause of action arises under the ADEA, and the release can have no effect on her ADEA claim unless it complies with the OWBPA.  In this case, both sides concede the release the employee signed did not comply with the requirements of the OWBPA.  Since Oubres release did not comply with the OWBPAs stringent safeguards, it is unenforceable against her insofar as it purports to waive or release her ADEA claim.  As a statutory matter, the release cannot bar her ADEA suit, irrespective of the validity of the contract as to other claims.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In further proceedings in this or other cases, courts may need to inquire whether the employer has claims for restitution, recoupment, or setoff against the employee, and these questions may be complex where a release is effective as to some claims but not as to ADEA claims.  We need not decide those issues here, however.  It suffices to hold that the release cannot bar the ADEA claim because it does not conform to the statute.  Nor did the employees mere retention of monies amount to a ratification equivalent to a valid release of her ADEA claims, since the retention did not comply with the OWBPA any more than the original release did.  The statute governs the effect of the release on ADEA claims, and the employer cannot invoke the employees failure to tender back as a way of excusing its own failure to comply.

				An employee, as part of a termination agreement, signed a release of all claims against her employer.  In consideration, she received severance pay in installments.  The release, however, did not comply with specific federal statutory requirements for a release of claims under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA),

				  After receiving the last payment, the employee brought suit under the ADEA.  The employer claims the employee ratified and validated the nonconforming release by retaining the monies paid to secure it.  The employer also insists the release bars the action unless, as a precondition to filing suit, the employee tenders back the monies received.  We disagree and rule that, as the release did not comply with the statute, it cannot bar the ADEA claim.

				Petitioner Dolores Oubre worked as a scheduler at a power plant in Killona, Louisiana, run by her employer, respondent Entergy Operations, Inc.  In 1994, she received a poor performance rating.  Oubres supervisor met with her on January 17, 1995, and gave her the option of either improving her performance during the coming year or accepting a voluntary arrangement for her severance.  She received a packet of information about the severance agreement and had 14 days to consider her options, during which she consulted with attorneys.  On January 31, Oubre decided to accept.  She signed a release, in which she agree[d] to waive, settle, release, and discharge any and all claims, demands, damages, actions, or causes of action … that I may have against Entergy … .  App. 61.  In exchange, she received six installment payments over the next four months, totaling $6,258.

In procuring the release, Entergy did not comply with the OWBPA in at least three respects: (1) Entergy did not give Oubre enough time to consider her options.  (2) Entergy did not give Oubre seven days after she signed the release to change her mind.  And (3) the release made no specific reference to claims under the ADEA.

				Oubre filed a charge of age discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which dismissed her charge on the merits but issued a right-to-sue letter.  She filed this suit against Entergy in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, alleging constructive discharge on the basis of her age in violation of the ADEA and state law.  Oubre has not offered or tried to return the $6,258 to Entergy, nor is it clear she has the means to do so.  Entergy moved for summary judgment, claiming Oubre had ratified the defective release by failing to return or offer to return the monies she had received.  The District Court agreed and entered summary judgment for Entergy.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, 112 F. 3d 787 (CA5 1996)

				The employer rests its case upon general principles of state contract jurisprudence.  As the employer recites the rule, contracts tainted by mistake, duress, or even fraud are voidable at the option of the innocent party.  See 1 Restatement (Second) of Contracts §7, and Comment 
				<em>
					b
				</em>
				 (1979); 
				<em>
					e.g., Ellerin
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>

				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Dreiling
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Home State Life Ins. Co.
				</em>
				, 213 Kan. 137, 147148, 515 P. 2d 757, 766767 (1973).  If she fails to do so within a reasonable time after learning of her rights, the employer contends, she ratifies the contract and so makes it binding.  Restatement (Second) of Contracts, 
				<em>

				</em>
				, No. 059401368CV, 1995 WL 479645, *3 (Tex. App.Dallas, Aug. 14, 1995) (unpublished).  The employer also invokes the doctrine of equitable estoppel.  As a rule, equitable estoppel bars a party from shirking the burdens of a voidable transaction for as long as she retains the benefits received under it.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Buffum
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Peter Barceloux Co.,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">234</a> (1933)
 (citing state case law from Indiana and New York).  Applying these principles, the employer claims the employee ratified the ineffective release (or faces estoppel) by retaining all the sums paid in consideration of it.  The employer, then, relies not upon the execution of the release but upon a later, distinct ratification of its terms.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				These general rules may not be as unified as the employer asserts.  See generally Annot., 76 A. L. R. 344 (1932) (collecting cases supporting and contradicting these rules); Annot., 134 A. L. R. 6 (1941) (same).  And in equity, a person suing to rescind a contract, as a rule, is not required to restore the consideration at the very outset of the litigation.  See 3 Restatement (Second) of Contracts, 
				<em>
					supra,
				</em>
				 §384, and Comment 
				<em>
					b
				</em>
				; Restatement of Restitution §65, Comment 
				<em>
					d
				</em>
				 (1936); D. Dobbs, Law of Remedies §4.8, p. 294 (1973).  Even if the employers statement of the general rule requiring tender back before one files suit were correct, it would be unavailing.  The rule cited is based simply on the course of negotiation of the parties and the alleged later ratification.  The authorities cited do not consider the question raised by statutory standards for releases and a statutory declaration making non-conforming releases ineffective.  It is the latter question we confront here.

				An employee, as part of a termination agreement, signed a release of all claims against her employer.  In consideration, she received severance pay in installments.

				Petitioner Dolores Oubre worked as a scheduler at a power plant in Killona, Louisiana, run by her employer, respondent Entergy Operations, Inc.  In 1994, she received a poor performance rating.  Oubres supervisor met with her on January 17, 1995, and gave her the option of either improving her performance during the coming year or accepting a voluntary arrangement for her severance.  She received a packet of information about the severance agreement and had 14 days to consider her options, during which she consulted with attorneys.  On January 31, Oubre decided to accept.  She signed a release, in which she agree[d] to waive, settle, release, and discharge any and all claims, demands, damages, actions, or causes of action … that I may have against Entergy … .  App. 61.  In exchange, she received six installment payments over the next four months, totaling $6,258.

In procuring the release, Entergy did not comply with the OWBPA in at least three respects: (1) Entergy did not give Oubre enough time to consider her options.  (2) Entergy did not give Oubre seven days after she signed the release to change her mind.  And (3) the release made no specific reference to claims under the ADEA.

				Oubre filed a charge of age discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which dismissed her charge on the merits but issued a right-to-sue letter.  She filed this suit against Entergy in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, alleging constructive discharge on the basis of her age in violation of the ADEA and state law.  Oubre has not offered or tried to return the $6,258 to Entergy, nor is it clear she has the means to do so.  Entergy moved for summary judgment, claiming Oubre had ratified the defective release by failing to return or offer to return the monies she had received.  The District Court agreed and entered summary judgment for Entergy.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, 112 F. 3d 787 (CA5 1996)

				The employer rests its case upon general principles of state contract jurisprudence.  As the employer recites the rule, contracts tainted by mistake, duress, or even fraud are voidable at the option of the innocent party.  See 1 Restatement (Second) of Contracts §7, and Comment

 (citing state case law from Indiana and New York).  Applying these principles, the employer claims the employee ratified the ineffective release (or faces estoppel) by retaining all the sums paid in consideration of it.  The employer, then, relies not upon the execution of the release but upon a later, distinct ratification of its terms.

				These general rules may not be as unified as the employer asserts.  See generally Annot., 76 A. L. R. 344 (1932) (collecting cases supporting and contradicting these rules); Annot., 134 A. L. R. 6 (1941) (same).  And in equity, a person suing to rescind a contract, as a rule, is not required to restore the consideration at the very outset of the litigation.

The rule cited is based simply on the course of negotiation of the parties and the alleged later ratification.  The authorities cited do not consider the question raised by statutory standards for releases and a statutory declaration making non-conforming releases ineffective.  It is the latter question we confront here.

				In 1990, Congress amended the ADEA by passing the OWBPA.  The OWBPA provides: An individual may not waive any right or claim under [the ADEA] unless the waiver is knowing and voluntary… . [A] waiver may not be considered knowing and voluntary unless at a minimum it satisfies certain enumerated requirements, including the three listed above.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The statutory command is clear: An employee may not waive an ADEA claim unless the waiver or release satisfies the OWBPAs requirements.  The policy of the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act is likewise clear from its title: It is designed to protect the rights and benefits of older workers.  The OWBPA implements Congress policy via a strict, unqualified statutory stricture on waivers, and we are bound to take Congress at its word.  Congress imposed specific duties on employers who seek releases of certain claims created by statute.  Congress delineated these duties with precision and without qualification: An employee may not waive an ADEA claim unless the employer complies with the statute.  Courts cannot with ease presume ratification of that which Congress forbids.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The OWBPA sets up its own regime for assessing the effect of ADEA waivers, separate and apart from contract law.  The statute creates a series of prerequisites for knowing and voluntary waivers and imposes affirmative duties of disclosure and waiting periods.  The OWBPA governs the effect under federal law of waivers or releases on ADEA claims and incorporates no exceptions or qualifications.  The text of the OWBPA forecloses the employers defense, notwithstanding how general contract principles would apply to non-ADEA claims.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The rule proposed by the employer would frustrate the statutes practical operation as well as its formal command.  In many instances a discharged employee likely will have spent the monies received and will lack the means to tender their return.  These realities might tempt employers to risk noncompliance with the OWBPAs waiver provisions, knowing it will be difficult to repay the monies and relying on ratification.  We ought not to open the door to an evasion of the statute by this device.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Oubres cause of action arises under the ADEA, and the release can have no effect on her ADEA claim unless it complies with the OWBPA.  In this case, both sides concede the release the employee signed did not comply with the requirements of the OWBPA.  Since Oubres release did not comply with the OWBPAs stringent safeguards, it is unenforceable against her insofar as it purports to waive or release her ADEA claim.  As a statutory matter, the release cannot bar her ADEA suit, irrespective of the validity of the contract as to other claims.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In further proceedings in this or other cases, courts may need to inquire whether the employer has claims for restitution, recoupment, or setoff against the employee, and these questions may be complex where a release is effective as to some claims but not as to ADEA claims.  We need not decide those issues here, however.  It suffices to hold that the release cannot bar the ADEA claim because it does not conform to the statute.  Nor did the employees mere retention of monies amount to a ratification equivalent to a valid release of her ADEA claims, since the retention did not comply with the OWBPA any more than the original release did.  The statute governs the effect of the release on ADEA claims, and the employer cannot invoke the employees failure to tender back as a way of excusing its own failure to comply.

The text of the OWBPA forecloses the employers defense, notwithstanding how general contract principles would apply to non-ADEA claims.

				The rule proposed by the employer would frustrate the statutes practical operation as well as its formal command.  In many instances a discharged employee likely will have spent the monies received and will lack the means to tender their return.  These realities might tempt employers to risk noncompliance with the OWBPAs waiver provisions, knowing it will be difficult to repay the monies and relying on ratification.  We ought not to open the door to an evasion of the statute by this device.

				Oubres cause of action arises under the ADEA, and the release can have no effect on her ADEA claim unless it complies with the OWBPA.  In this case, both sides concede the release the employee signed did not comply with the requirements of the OWBPA.  Since Oubres release did not comply with the OWBPAs stringent safeguards, it is unenforceable against her insofar as it purports to waive or release her ADEA claim.  As a statutory matter, the release cannot bar her ADEA suit, irrespective of the validity of the contract as to other claims.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In further proceedings in this or other cases, courts may need to inquire whether the employer has claims for restitution, recoupment, or setoff against the employee, and these questions may be complex where a release is effective as to some claims but not as to ADEA claims.  We need not decide those issues here, however.  It suffices to hold that the release cannot bar the ADEA claim because it does not conform to the statute.  Nor did the employees mere retention of monies amount to a ratification equivalent to a valid release of her ADEA claims, since the retention did not comply with the OWBPA any more than the original release did.  The statute governs the effect of the release on ADEA claims, and the employer cannot invoke the employees failure to tender back as a way of excusing its own failure to comply.

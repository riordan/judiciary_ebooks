				In the wake of 
				<em>
					Miranda

				 v. 
				<em>

				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/384/436" class="subref" title="subref">384 U. S. 436</a>, in which the Court held that certain warnings must be given before a suspects statement made during custodial interrogation could be admitted in evidence, 
				<em>
					id.,

				at 479, Congress enacted 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/3501.html" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. §3501</a>, which in essence makes the admissibility of such statements turn solely on whether they were made voluntarily.  Petitioner, under indictment for bank robbery and related federal crimes, moved to suppress a statement he had made to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, on the ground he had not received 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings before being interrogated.  The District Court granted his motion, and the Government took an interlocutory appeal.  In reversing, the Fourth Circuit acknowledged that petitioner had not received 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings, but held that §3501 was satisfied because his statement was voluntary.  It concluded that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 was not a constitutional holding, and that, therefore, Congress could by statute have the final say on the admissibility question.

					Held:

            <em>
					 
				</em>
				(a) 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, being a constitutional decision of this Court, may not be in effect overruled by an Act of Congress.  Given §3501s express designation of voluntariness as the touchstone of admissibility, its omission of any warning requirement, and its instruction for trial courts to consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding the giving of the confession, this Court agrees with the Fourth Circuit that Congress intended §3501 to overrule 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				.  The law is clear as to whether Congress has constitutional authority to do so.  This Court has supervisory authority over the federal courts to prescribe binding rules of evidence and procedure.  
				<em>
					Carlisle 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/517/416" class="subref" title="subref">517 U. S. 416</a>.  While Congress has ultimate authority to modify or set aside any such rules that are not constitutionally required, 
				<em>
					e.g., Palermo
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					United States,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/360/343" class="subref" title="subref">360 U. S. 343</a>, it may not supersede this Courts decisions interpreting and applying the Constitution, see, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					City of Boerne 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					Flores
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/521/507" class="subref" title="subref">521 U. S. 507</a>.  That 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 announced a constitutional rule is demonstrated, first and foremost, by the fact that both 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 and two of its companion cases applied its rule to proceedings in state courts, and that the Court has consistently done so ever since.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Stansbury 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					California
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/511/318" class="subref" title="subref">511 U. S. 318</a>
            <em>
					(per curiam)
				</em>
				.  The Court does not hold supervisory power over the state courts, 
				<em>
					e.g., Smith 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					Phillips
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/455/209" class="subref" title="subref">455 U. S. 209</a>, as to which its authority is limited to enforcing the commands of the Constitution, 
				<em>
					e.g., MuMin 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					Virginia
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/500/415" class="subref" title="subref">500 U. S. 415</a>.  The conclusion that 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				is constitutionally based is also supported by the fact that that case is replete with statements indicating that the majority thought it was announcing a constitutional rule, see, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 384 U. S., at 445.  Although 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 invited legislative action to protect the constitutional right against coerced self-incrimination, it stated that any legislative alternative must be at least as effective in appraising accused persons of their right of silence and in assuring a continuous opportunity to exercise it.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 467.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				A contrary conclusion is not required by the fact that the Court has subsequently made exceptions from the 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				rule, see, 
				<em>
					e.g., New York
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Quarles
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/467/649" class="subref" title="subref">467 U. S. 649</a>.  No constitutional rule is immutable, and the sort of refinements made by such cases are merely a normal part of constitutional law.  
				<em>
					Oregon
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Elstad
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/470/298" class="subref" title="subref">470 U. S. 298</a>in which the Court, in refusing to apply the traditional fruits doctrine developed in 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> cases, stated that Mirandas exclusionary rule serves the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> and sweeps more broadly than that Amendment itselfdoes not prove that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is a nonconstitutional decision, but simply recognizes the fact that unreasonable searches under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> are different from unwarned interrogation under the Fifth.   Finally, although the Court agrees with the court-appointed 
				<em>
					amicus curiae
				</em>
				 that there are more remedies available for abusive police conduct than there were when 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 was decided
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, a suit under 
				<em>
					Bivens 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					Six Unknown Named Agents
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/403/388" class="subref" title="subref">403 U. S. 388</a>it does not agree that such additional measures supplement §3501s protections sufficiently to create an adequate substitute for the 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				warnings. 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 requires procedures that will warn a suspect in custody of his right to remain silent and assure him that the exercise of that right will be honored, see, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 384 U. S., at 467, while §3501 explicitly eschews a requirement of preinterrogation warnings in favor of an approach that looks to the administration of such warnings as only one factor in determining the voluntariness of a suspects confession. Section 3501, therefore, cannot be sustained if 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is to remain the law.  Pp. 212.  
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				(b) This Court declines to overrule 
				<em>
					Miranda.
				</em>
				 Whether or not this Court would agree with 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s reasoning and its rule in the first instance, 
				<em>
					stare decisis
				</em>
				 weighs heavily against overruling it now.  Even in constitutional cases, 
				<em>
					stare decisis
				</em>
				 carries such persuasive force that the Court has always required a departure from precedent to be supported by some special justification.  
				<em>
					E.g., United States 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					International Business Machines Corp
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/517/843" class="subref" title="subref">517 U. S. 843</a>.  There is no such justification here.  
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 has become embedded in routine police practice to the point where the warnings have become part of our national culture.  See 
				<em>
					Mitchell 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/526/314" class="subref" title="subref">526 U. S. 314</a>.  While the Court has overruled its precedents when subsequent cases have undermined their doctrinal underpinnings, that has not happened to 
				<em>
					Miranda.
				</em>
				  If anything, subsequent cases have reduced 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s impact on legitimate law enforcement while reaffirming the decisions core ruling.  The rules disadvantage is that it may result in a guilty defendant going free.  But experience suggests that §3501s totality-of-the-circumstances test is more difficult than 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 for officers to conform to, and for courts to apply consistently.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Haynes
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Washington,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/373/503" class="subref" title="subref">373 U. S. 503</a>.  The requirement that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings be given does not dispense with the voluntariness inquiry, but cases in which a defendant can make a colorable argument that a self-incriminating statement was compelled despite officers adherence to 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 are rare.  Pp. 1214.

				Those to whom judicial decisions are an unconnected series of judgments that produce either favored or disfavored results will doubtless greet todays decision as a paragon of moderation, since it declines to overrule
				<em>
					 Miranda
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Arizona,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/384/436" class="subref" title="subref">384 U. S. 436</a> (1966)
.  Those who understand the judicial process will appreciate that todays decision is not a reaffirmation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, but a radical revision of the most significant element of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 (as of all cases): the rationale that gives it a permanent place in our jurisprudence.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>
					Marbury
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Madison
				</em>
				, 1 Cranch 137 (1803), held that an Act of Congress will not be enforced by the courts if what it prescribes violates the Constitution of the United States.  That was the basis on which 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 was decided.  One will search todays opinion in vain, however, for a statement (surely simple enough to make) that what 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/3501.html" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. §3501</a> prescribesthe use at trial of a voluntary confession, even when a 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warning or its equivalent has failed to be givenviolates the Constitution.  The reason the statement does not appear is not only (and perhaps not so much) that it would be absurd, inasmuch as §3501 excludes from trial precisely what the Constitution excludes from trial, viz., compelled confessions; but also that Justices whose votes are needed to compose todays majority are on record as believing that a violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 a violation of the Constitution.  See 
				<em>
					Davis
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					United States,
				</em>

 (opinion of the Court by 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Rehnquist
				</span>
				, J.).  And so, to justify todays agreed-upon result, the Court must adopt a significant 
				<em>
					new
				</em>
				, if not entirely comprehensible, principle of constitutional law.  As the Court chooses to describe that principle, statutes of Congress can be disregarded, not only when what they prescribe violates the Constitution, but when what they prescribe contradicts a decision of this Court that announced a constitutional rule, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 7.  As I shall discuss in some detail, the only thing that can possibly mean in the context of this case is that this Court has the power, not merely to apply the Constitution but to expand it, imposing what it regards as useful prophylactic restrictions upon Congress and the States.  That is an immense and frightening antidemocratic power, and it does not exist.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It takes only a small step to bring todays opinion out of the realm of power-judging and into the mainstream of legal reasoning: The Court need only go beyond its carefully couched iterations that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is a constitutional decision, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 8, that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is constitutionally based, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 10, that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 has constitutional underpinnings, 
				<em>
					ante, 
				</em>
				at 10, n. 5, and come out and say quite clearly: We reaffirm today that custodial interrogation that is not preceded by 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings or their equivalent violates the Constitution of the United States.  It cannot say that, because a majority of the Court does not believe it.  The Court therefore acts in plain violation of the Constitution when it denies effect to this Act of Congress.

				Early in this Nations history, this Court established the sound proposition that constitutional government in a system of separated powers requires judges to regard as inoperative any legislative act, even of Congress itself, that is repugnant to the Constitution.

        <p class="bodytext">
				So if a law be in opposition to the constitution; if both the law and the constitution apply to a particular case, so that the court must either decide that case conformably to the law, disregarding the constitution; or conformably to the constitution, disregarding the law; the court must determine which of these conflicting rules governs the case.

The power we recognized in 
				<em>
					Marbury
				</em>
				 will thus permit us, indeed require us, to disregar[d] §3501, a duly enacted statute governing the admissibility of evidence in the federal courts, only if it be in opposition to the constitutionhere, assertedly, the dictates of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a>.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It was once possible to characterize the so-called 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 rule as resting (however implausibly) upon the proposition that what the statute here before us permits
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				the admission at trial of un-
				<em>
					Mirandized
				</em>
				 confessions
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				violates the Constitution.  That is the fairest reading of the 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				case itself.  The Court began by announcing that the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> privilege against self-incrimination applied in the context of extrajudicial custodial interrogation, see 384 U. S., at 460467itself a doubtful proposition as a matter both of history and precedent, see

					id

				., at, at 510511 (Harlan, J., dissenting) (characterizing the Courts conclusion that the Fifth
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				Amendment privilege, rather than the Due Process
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				Clause, governed stationhouse confessions as a 
				<em>
					trompe loeil
				</em>
				).  Having extended the privilege into the confines of the station house, the Court liberally sprinkled throughout its sprawling 60-page opinion suggestions that, because of the compulsion inherent in custodial interrogation, the privilege was violated by any statement thus obtained that did not conform to the rules set forth in 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, or some functional equivalent.  See 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 458 (Unless adequate protective devices are employed to dispel the compulsion 
				<em>
					inherent
				</em>
				 in custodial surroundings, 
				<em>
					no
				</em>
				 statement obtained from the defendant can truly be the product of his free choice) (emphases added); 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 461 (An individual swept from familiar surroundings into police custody, surrounded by antagonistic forces, and subjected to the techniques of persuasion described above cannot be otherwise than under compulsion to speak); 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 467 (We have concluded that without proper safeguards the process of in-custody interrogation … contains inherently compelling pressures which work to undermine the individuals will to resist and to compel him to speak where he would not otherwise do so freely);

				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, if read as an explication of what the Constitution 
				<em>
					requires
				</em>
				, is preposterous.  There is, for example, simply no basis in reason for concluding that a response to the very first question asked, by a suspect who already 
				<em>
					knows
				</em>
				 all of the rights described in the 
				<em>

				</em>
				 warning, is anything other than a volitional act.  See 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra, 
				</em>
				at 533534 (White, J., dissenting).  And even if one assumes that the elimination of compulsion absolutely requires informing even the most knowledgeable suspect of his right to remain silent, it cannot conceivably require the right to have 
				<em>
					counsel
				</em>
				 present.  There is a world of difference, which the Court recognized under the traditional voluntariness test but ignored in 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, between compelling a suspect to incriminate himself and preventing him from foolishly doing so of his own accord.  Only the latter (which is 
				<em>
					not 
				</em>
				required by the Constitution) could explain the Courts inclusion of a right to counsel and the requirement that it, too, be knowingly and intelligently waived.  Counsels presence is not required to tell the suspect that he 
				<em>
					need 
				</em>
				not speak; the interrogators can do that.  The only good reason for having counsel there is that he can be counted on to advise the suspect that he 
				<em>
					should 
				</em>
				not speak.  See

				Preventing foolish (rather than compelled) confessions is likewise the only conceivable basis for the rules (suggested in 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, see 384 U. S., at 444445, 473474), that courts must exclude any confession elicited by questioning conducted, without interruption, after the suspect has indicated a desire to stand on his right to remain silent, see 
				<em>
					Michigan

				 v.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">484</a>485 (1981)
.  Nonthreatening attempts to persuade the suspect to reconsider that initial decision are not, without more, enough to render a change of heart the product of anything other than the suspects free will.  Thus, what is most remarkable about the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 decisionand what made it unacceptable as a matter of straightforward constitutional interpretation in the 
				<em>
					Marbury
				</em>
				 traditionis its palpable hostility toward the act of confession

				<em>
					Miranda

				warningsthe police demanded to know where the gun was.  The defendant nodded in the direction of some empty cartons and responded that the gun is over there.  The Court held that both the unwarned statementthe gun is over thereand the recovered weapon were admissible in the prosecutions case in chief under a public safety exception to the prophylactic rules enunciated in

				, 492 U. S., at 203, it is simply no longer possible for the Court to conclude, even if it wanted to, that a violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s rules is a violation of the Constitution.  But as I explained at the outset, that is what is required before the Court may disregard a law of Congress governing the admissibility of evidence in federal court.  The Court today insists that the 
				<em>
					decision
				</em>
				 in 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is a constitutional one, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1, 8; that it has constitutional underpinnings
				<em>
					,
				</em>
            <em>
					ante, 
				</em>
				at 10, n. 5; a constitutional basis and a constitutional origin, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 9, n. 3; that it was constitutionally based, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 10; and that it announced a constitutional rule, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 7, 9, 11, 14.  It is fine to play these word games; but what makes a decision constitutional in the only sense relevant herein the sense that renders it impervious to supersession by congressional legislation such as §3501is the determination that the Constitution 
				<em>
					requires
				</em>
				 the result that the decision announces and the statute ignores.  By disregarding congressional action that concededly does not violate the Constitution, the Court flagrantly offends fundamental principles of separation of powers, and arrogates to itself prerogatives reserved to the representatives of the people.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court seeks to avoid this conclusion in two ways: First, by misdescribing these post-
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 cases as mere dicta.  The Court concedes only that there is language in some of our opinions that supports the view that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s protections are not constitutionally required.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 8.  It is not a matter of 
				<em>
					language
				</em>
				; it is a matter of 
				<em>
					holdings
				</em>
				.  The proposition that failure to comply with 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s rules does not establish a constitutional
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				violation was central to the 
				<em>
					holdings
				</em>
				 of 
				<em>
					Tucker
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Hass
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Quarles
				</em>
				, and Elstad.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The second way the Court seeks to avoid the impact of these cases is simply to disclaim responsibility for reasoned decisionmaking.  It says:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				These decisions illustrate the principlenot that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is not a constitutional rulebut that no constitutional rule is immutable.  No court laying down a general rule can possibly foresee the various circumstances in which counsel will seek to apply it, and the sort of modifications represented by these cases are as much a normal part of constitutional law as the original decision.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 11.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
The issue, however, is not whether court rules are mutable; they assuredly are.  It is not whether, in the light of various circumstances, they can be modifi[ed]; they assuredly can.  The issue is whether, 
				<em>
					as mutated and modified
				</em>
				, they must 
				<em>
					make sense
				</em>
				.  The requirement that they do so is the only thing that prevents this Court from being some sort of nine-headed Caesar, giving thumbs-up or thumbs-down to whatever outcome, case by case, suits or offends its collective fancy.  And if confessions procured in violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 are confessions compelled in violation of the Constitution, the post-
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 decisions I have discussed do not make sense.  The only reasoned basis for their outcome was that a violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 a violation of the Constitution.  If, for example, as the Court acknowledges was the holding of 
				<em>
					Elstad
				</em>
				, the traditional fruits doctrine developed in 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> cases (that the fruits of evidence obtained unconstitutionally must be excluded from trial) does 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 apply to the fruits of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 violations, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 11; and if the reason for the difference is 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 violations are not constitutional violations (which is plainly and flatly what 
				<em>
					Elstad
				</em>
				 said); then the Court must come up with some 
				<em>
					other
				</em>
				 explanation for the difference.  (That will take quite a bit of doing, by the way, since it is 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 clear on the face of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> that evidence obtained in violation of that guarantee must be excluded from trial, whereas it 
				<em>
					is
				</em>
				 clear on the face of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> that unconstitutionally compelled confessions cannot be used.)  To say simply that unreasonable searches under the

				Finally, the Court asserts that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 must be a constitutional decision announcing a constitutional rule, and thus immune to congressional modification, because we have since its inception applied it to the States.  If this argument is meant as an invocation of 
				<em>
					stare decisis
				</em>
				, it fails because, though it is true that our cases applying 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 against the States must be reconsidered if 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is not required by the Constitution, it is likewise true that our cases (discussed above) based on the principle that 
				<em>

				</em>
				 is
				<em>
					 not
				</em>
				 required by the Constitution will have to be reconsidered if it 
				<em>
					is
				</em>
				.  So the 
				<em>
					stare decisis
				</em>
				 argument is a wash.  If, on the other hand, the argument is meant as an appeal to logic rather than 
				<em>
					stare decisis
				</em>
				, it is a classic example of begging the question: Congresss attempt to set aside 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, since it represents an assertion that violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is not a violation of the Constitution, 
				<em>
					also
				</em>
				 represents an assertion that the Court has no power to impose

				 on the States.  To answer this assertionnot by showing why violation of 
				<em>

            <em>
					is
				</em>
				 a violation of the Constitutionbut by asserting that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
            <em>
					does
				</em>
				 apply against the States, is to assume precisely the point at issue.  In my view, our continued application of the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 code to the States despite our consistent statements that running afoul of its dictates does not necessarilyor even usuallyresult in an actual constitutional violation, represents not the source of  
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s salvation but rather evidence of its ultimate illegitimacy.  See generally J. Grano, Confessions, Truth, and the Law 173198 (1993); Grano, Prophylactic Rules in Criminal Procedure: A Question of Article III Legitimacy, 80 Nw. U. L. Rev. 100 (1985).  As 
				<span class="smallcaps">

				There was available to the Court a means of reconciling the established proposition that a violation of 
				<em>

				</em>
				 does not itself offend the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> with the Courts assertion of a right to ignore the present statute.  That means of reconciliation was argued strenuously by both petitioner and the United States, who were evidently more concerned than the Court is with maintaining the coherence of our jurisprudence.

				Petitioner and the United States contend that there is nothing at all exceptional, much less unconstitutional, about the Courts adopting prophylactic rules to buttress constitutional rights, and enforcing them against Congress and the States.  Indeed, the United States argues that [p]rophylactic rules are now and have been for many years a feature of this Courts constitutional adjudication.  Brief for United States 47.  That statement is not wholly inaccurate, if by many years one means since the mid-1960s.  However, in their zeal to validate what is in my view a lawless practice, the United States and petitioner greatly overstate the frequency with which we have engaged in it.  For instance, petitioner cites several cases in which the Court quite simply exercised its traditional judicial power to define the scope of constitutional protections and, relatedly, the circumstances in which they are violated.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/395/711" class="subref" title="subref">395 U. S. 711</a> (1969)
.  There, the Court concluded that due process would be offended were a judge vindictively to resentence with added severity a defendant who had successfully appealed his original conviction.  Rather than simply announce that vindictive sentencing violates the Due Process Clause, the Court went on to hold that [i]n order to assure the absence of such a [vindictive] motivation, … the reasons for [imposing the increased sentence] must affirmatively appear and must be based upon objective information concerning identifiable conduct on the part of the defendant occurring after the time of the original sentencing proceeding.

				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 when deprived (as it has been) of its original (implausible) pretension to announcement of what the Constitution itself required.  That is, although the Due Process Clause may well prohibit punishment based on judicial vindictiveness, the Constitution by no means vests in the courts any general power to prescribe particular devices in order to assure the absence of such a motivation,  395 U. S., at 741 (Black, J., dissenting).  Justice Black surely had the right idea when he derided the Courts requirement as pure legislation if there ever was legislation,

				The foregoing demonstrates that, petitioners and the United States suggestions to the contrary notwithstanding, what the Court did in 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				(assuming, as later cases hold, that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 went beyond what the Constitution actually requires) is in fact extraordinary.  That the Court has, on rare and recent occasion, repeated the mistake does not transform error into truth, but illustrates the potential for future mischief that the error entails.  Where the Constitution has wished to lodge in one of the branches of the Federal Government some limited power to supplement its guarantees, it has said so.  See Amdt. 14, §5 (The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article).  The power with which the Court would endow itself under a prophylactic justification for 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 goes far beyond what it has permitted Congress to do under authority of that text.  Whereas we have insisted that congressional action under §5 of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a> must be congruent with, and proportional to, a 
				<em>
					constitutional violation
				</em>
				, see 
				<em>
					City of Boerne
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Flores,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">520</a> (1997)
, the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 nontextual power to embellish confers authority to prescribe preventive measures against not only constitutionally prohibited compelled confessions, but also (as discussed earlier) foolhardy ones.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I applaud, therefore, the refusal of the Justices in the majority to enunciate this boundless doctrine of judicial empowerment as a means of rendering todays decision rational.  In nonetheless joining the Courts judgment, however, they overlook two truisms: that actions speak louder than silence, and that (in judge-made law at least) logic will out.  Since there is in fact no other principle that can reconcile todays judgment with the post-
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 cases that the Court refuses to abandon, what todays decision will stand for, whether the Justices can bring themselves to say it or not, is the power of the Supreme Court to write a prophylactic, extraconstitutional Constitution, binding on Congress and the States.

				Thus, while I agree with the Court that §3501 cannot be upheld without also concluding that

				 represents an illegitimate exercise of our authority to review state-court judgments, I do not share the Courts hesitation in reaching that conclusion.  For while the Court is also correct that the doctrine of

				Neither am I persuaded by the argument for retaining

				<em>

The task of determining whether a defendant is in custody has proved to be a slippery one.  And the supposedly bright lines that separate interrogation from spontaneous declaration, the exercise of a right from waiver, and the adequate warning from the inadequate, likewise have turned out to be rather dim and ill defined.  The totality-of-the-circumstances approach, on the other hand, permits each fact to be taken into account without resort to formal and dispositive labels.  By dispensing with the difficulty of producing a yes-or-no answer to questions that are often better answered in shades and degrees,

And I see much to be gained by reaffirming for the people the wonderful reality that they govern themselveswhich means that [t]he powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution that the people adopted, nor prohibited … to the States by that Constitution, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people, U. S. Const., Amdt. 10.

				Todays judgment converts 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				from a milestone of judicial overreaching into the very Cheops Pyramid (or perhaps the Sphinx would be a better analogue) of judicial arrogance.  In imposing its Court-made code upon the States, the original opinion at least 
				<em>
					asserted
				</em>
				 that it was demanded by the Constitution.  Todays decision does not pretend that it isand yet 
				<em>
					still
				</em>
				 asserts the right to impose it against the will of the peoples representatives in Congress.  Far from believing that 
				<em>
					stare decisis
				</em>
				 compels this result, I believe we cannot allow to remain on the books even a celebrated decision
				<em>
					especially
				</em>
				 a celebrated decisionthat has come to stand for the proposition that the Supreme Court has power to impose extraconstitutional constraints upon Congress and the States.  This is not the system that was established by the Framers, or that would be established by any sane supporter of government by the people.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I dissent from todays decision, and, until §3501 is repealed, will continue to apply it in all cases where there has been a sustainable finding that the defendants confession was voluntary.

In Mitchell, moreover, the constitutional underpinnings of the earlier rule had not been demolished by subsequent cases.

				Those to whom judicial decisions are an unconnected series of judgments that produce either favored or disfavored results will doubtless greet todays decision as a paragon of moderation, since it declines to overrule
				<em>
					 Miranda

				<em>

				, but a radical revision of the most significant element of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 (as of all cases): the rationale that gives it a permanent place in our jurisprudence.

            <em>
					Marbury
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Madison
				</em>
				, 1 Cranch 137 (1803), held that an Act of Congress will not be enforced by the courts if what it prescribes violates the Constitution of the United States.  That was the basis on which 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 was decided.  One will search todays opinion in vain, however, for a statement (surely simple enough to make) that what 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/3501.html" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. §3501</a> prescribesthe use at trial of a voluntary confession, even when a 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warning or its equivalent has failed to be givenviolates the Constitution.  The reason the statement does not appear is not only (and perhaps not so much) that it would be absurd, inasmuch as §3501 excludes from trial precisely what the Constitution excludes from trial, viz., compelled confessions; but also that Justices whose votes are needed to compose todays majority are on record as believing that a violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 a violation of the Constitution.  See 
				<em>
					Davis
				</em>
				 v.

				<em>
					new
				</em>
				, if not entirely comprehensible, principle of constitutional law.  As the Court chooses to describe that principle, statutes of Congress can be disregarded, not only when what they prescribe violates the Constitution, but when what they prescribe contradicts a decision of this Court that announced a constitutional rule, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 7.  As I shall discuss in some detail, the only thing that can possibly mean in the context of this case is that this Court has the power, not merely to apply the Constitution but to expand it, imposing what it regards as useful prophylactic restrictions upon Congress and the States.  That is an immense and frightening antidemocratic power, and it does not exist.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It takes only a small step to bring todays opinion out of the realm of power-judging and into the mainstream of legal reasoning: The Court need only go beyond its carefully couched iterations that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is a constitutional decision, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 8, that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is constitutionally based, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 10, that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 has constitutional underpinnings, 
				<em>
					ante, 
				</em>
				at 10, n. 5, and come out and say quite clearly: We reaffirm today that custodial interrogation that is not preceded by 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings or their equivalent violates the Constitution of the United States.  It cannot say that, because a majority of the Court does not believe it.  The Court therefore acts in plain violation of the Constitution when it denies effect to this Act of Congress.

				Early in this Nations history, this Court established the sound proposition that constitutional government in a system of separated powers requires judges to regard as inoperative any legislative act, even of Congress itself, that is repugnant to the Constitution.

        <p class="bodytext">
				So if a law be in opposition to the constitution; if both the law and the constitution apply to a particular case, so that the court must either decide that case conformably to the law, disregarding the constitution; or conformably to the constitution, disregarding the law; the court must determine which of these conflicting rules governs the case.

The power we recognized in 
				<em>
					Marbury
				</em>
				 will thus permit us, indeed require us, to disregar[d] §3501, a duly enacted statute governing the admissibility of evidence in the federal courts, only if it be in opposition to the constitutionhere, assertedly, the dictates of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a>.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It was once possible to characterize the so-called 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 rule as resting (however implausibly) upon the proposition that what the statute here before us permits
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				the admission at trial of un-
				<em>
					Mirandized
				</em>
				 confessions
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				violates the Constitution.  That is the fairest reading of the 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				case itself.  The Court began by announcing that the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> privilege against self-incrimination applied in the context of extrajudicial custodial interrogation, see 384 U. S., at 460467itself a doubtful proposition as a matter both of history and precedent, see 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at, at 510511 (Harlan, J., dissenting) (characterizing the Courts conclusion that the Fifth
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				Amendment privilege, rather than the Due Process
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				Clause, governed stationhouse confessions as a 
				<em>
					trompe loeil
				</em>
				).  Having extended the privilege into the confines of the station house, the Court liberally sprinkled throughout its sprawling 60-page opinion suggestions that, because of the compulsion inherent in custodial interrogation, the privilege was violated by any statement thus obtained that did not conform to the rules set forth in 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, or some functional equivalent.  See 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 458 (Unless adequate protective devices are employed to dispel the compulsion 
				<em>
					inherent
				</em>
				 in custodial surroundings, 
				<em>
					no
				</em>
				 statement obtained from the defendant can truly be the product of his free choice) (emphases added); 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 461 (An individual swept from familiar surroundings into police custody, surrounded by antagonistic forces, and subjected to the techniques of persuasion described above cannot be otherwise than under compulsion to speak); 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 467 (We have concluded that without proper safeguards the process of in-custody interrogation … contains inherently compelling pressures which work to undermine the individuals will to resist and to compel him to speak where he would not otherwise do so freely); 
				<em>

				The dissenters, for their part, also understood

				So understood, 
				<em>

				 was objectionable for innumerable reasons, not least the fact that cases spanning more than 70 years had rejected its core premise that, absent the warnings and an effective waiver of the right to remain silent and of the (thitherto unknown) right to have an attorney present, a statement obtained pursuant to custodial interrogation was necessarily the product of compulsion.  See

 (same).  Moreover, history and precedent aside, the decision in 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, if read as an explication of what the Constitution 
				<em>
					requires
				</em>
				, is preposterous.  There is, for example, simply no basis in reason for concluding that a response to the very first question asked, by a suspect who already 
				<em>
					knows
				</em>
				 all of the rights described in the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warning, is anything other than a volitional act.  See 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra, 
				</em>
				at 533534 (White, J., dissenting).  And even if one assumes that the elimination of compulsion absolutely requires informing even the most knowledgeable suspect of his right to remain silent, it cannot conceivably require the right to have 
				<em>
					counsel
				</em>
				 present.  There is a world of difference, which the Court recognized under the traditional voluntariness test but ignored in 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, between compelling a suspect to incriminate himself and preventing him from foolishly doing so of his own accord.  Only the latter (which is 
				<em>
					not 
				</em>
				required by the Constitution) could explain the Courts inclusion of a right to counsel and the requirement that it, too, be knowingly and intelligently waived.  Counsels presence is not required to tell the suspect that he 
				<em>
					need 
				</em>
				not speak; the interrogators can do that.  The only good reason for having counsel there is that he can be counted on to advise the suspect that he 
				<em>
					should 
				</em>
				not speak.  See 
				<em>
					Watts

				<em>
					Indiana

				<span class="softbreak"></span>

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Preventing foolish (rather than compelled) confessions is likewise the only conceivable basis for the rules (suggested in 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, see 384 U. S., at 444445, 473474), that courts must exclude any confession elicited by questioning conducted, without interruption, after the suspect has indicated a desire to stand on his right to remain silent, see 
				<em>
					Michigan
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Mosley,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/423/96" class="subref" title="subref">423 U. S. 96</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">105</a>106 (1975)
, or initiated by police after the suspect has expressed a desire to have counsel present, see 
				<em>
					Edwards
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Arizona,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/451/477" class="subref" title="subref">451 U. S. 477</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">484</a>485 (1981)
.  Nonthreatening attempts to persuade the suspect to reconsider that initial decision are not, without more, enough to render a change of heart the product of anything other than the suspects free will.  Thus, what is most remarkable about the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 decisionand what made it unacceptable as a matter of straightforward constitutional interpretation in the 
				<em>
					Marbury
				</em>
				 traditionis its palpable hostility toward the act of confession 
				<em>
					per se
				</em>
				, rather than toward what the Constitution abhors, 
				<em>
					compelled
				</em>
				 confession.  See 
				<em>
					United States

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">187</a> (1977)
 ([F]ar from being prohibited by the Constitution, admissions of guilt by wrongdoers, if not coerced, are inherently desirable).  The Constitution is not, unlike the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 majority, offended by a criminals commendable qualm of conscience or fortunate fit of stupidity.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Minnick

				 v.

				For these reasons, and others more than adequately developed in the

				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				that a violation of the

				<em>
					necessarily
				</em>
				 amounts to a violation of the privilege against compelled self-incrimination can claim no support in history, precedent, or common sense, and as a result would at least presumptively be worth reconsidering even at this late date.  But that is unnecessary, since the Court has (thankfully) long since abandoned the notion that failure to comply with

				As the Court today acknowledges, since

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>, but rather only prophylactic rules that go beyond the right against compelled self-incrimination.  Of course the seeds of this prophylactic interpretation of

				<em>

				<em>

				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				warningsthe police demanded to know where the gun was.  The defendant nodded in the direction of some empty cartons and responded that the gun is over there.  The Court held that both the unwarned statementthe gun is over thereand the recovered weapon were admissible in the prosecutions case in chief under a public safety exception to the prophylactic rules enunciated in 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				.  467 U. S., at 653.  It explicitly acknowledged that if the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings were an imperative of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> itself, such an exigency exception would be impossible, since the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a>s bar on compelled self-incrimination is absolute, and its  strictures, unlike the Fourths are not removed by showing reasonableness,  467 U.

				<em>
					Eagan
				</em>
				, 492 U. S., at 203, it is simply no longer possible for the Court to conclude, even if it wanted to, that a violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s rules is a violation of the Constitution.  But as I explained at the outset, that is what is required before the Court may disregard a law of Congress governing the admissibility of evidence in federal court.  The Court today insists that the 
				<em>
					decision
				</em>
				 in 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is a constitutional one, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1, 8; that it has constitutional underpinnings
				<em>
					,
				</em>
            <em>
					ante, 
				</em>
				at 10, n. 5; a constitutional basis and a constitutional origin, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 9, n. 3; that it was constitutionally based, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 10; and that it announced a constitutional rule, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 7, 9, 11, 14.  It is fine to play these word games; but what makes a decision constitutional in the only sense relevant herein the sense that renders it impervious to supersession by congressional legislation such as §3501is the determination that the Constitution 
				<em>
					requires
				</em>
				 the result that the decision announces and the statute ignores.  By disregarding congressional action that concededly does not violate the Constitution, the Court flagrantly offends fundamental principles of separation of powers, and arrogates to itself prerogatives reserved to the representatives of the people.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court seeks to avoid this conclusion in two ways: First, by misdescribing these post-
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 cases as mere dicta.  The Court concedes only that there is language in some of our opinions that supports the view that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s protections are not constitutionally required.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 8.  It is not a matter of 
				<em>
					language
				</em>
				; it is a matter of 
				<em>
					holdings
				</em>
				.  The proposition that failure to comply with 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s rules does not establish a constitutional
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				violation was central to the 
				<em>
					holdings
				</em>
				 of 
				<em>
					Tucker
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Hass
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Quarles
				</em>
				, and Elstad.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The second way the Court seeks to avoid the impact of these cases is simply to disclaim responsibility for reasoned decisionmaking.  It says:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				These decisions illustrate the principlenot that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is not a constitutional rulebut that no constitutional rule is immutable.  No court laying down a general rule can possibly foresee the various circumstances in which counsel will seek to apply it, and the sort of modifications represented by these cases are as much a normal part of constitutional law as the original decision.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 11.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
The issue, however, is not whether court rules are mutable; they assuredly are.  It is not whether, in the light of various circumstances, they can be modifi[ed]; they assuredly can.  The issue is whether, 
				<em>
					as mutated and modified
				</em>
				, they must 
				<em>
					make sense
				</em>
				.  The requirement that they do so is the only thing that prevents this Court from being some sort of nine-headed Caesar, giving thumbs-up or thumbs-down to whatever outcome, case by case, suits or offends its collective fancy.  And if confessions procured in violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 are confessions compelled in violation of the Constitution, the post-
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 decisions I have discussed do not make sense.  The only reasoned basis for their outcome was that a violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 a violation of the Constitution.  If, for example, as the Court acknowledges was the holding of 
				<em>
					Elstad
				</em>
				, the traditional fruits doctrine developed in 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> cases (that the fruits of evidence obtained unconstitutionally must be excluded from trial) does 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 apply to the fruits of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 violations, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 11; and if the reason for the difference is 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 violations are not constitutional violations (which is plainly and flatly what 
				<em>
					Elstad
				</em>
				 said); then the Court must come up with some 
				<em>
					other
				</em>
				 explanation for the difference.  (That will take quite a bit of doing, by the way, since it is 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 clear on the face of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> that evidence obtained in violation of that guarantee must be excluded from trial, whereas it 
				<em>
					is
				</em>
				 clear on the face of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> that unconstitutionally compelled confessions cannot be used.)  To say simply that unreasonable searches under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> are different from unwarned interrogation under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a>, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1112, is true but supremely unhelpful.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Finally, the Court asserts that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 must be a constitutional decision announcing a constitutional rule, and thus immune to congressional modification, because we have since its inception applied it to the States.  If this argument is meant as an invocation of 
				<em>
					stare decisis
				</em>
				, it fails because, though it is true that our cases applying 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 against the States must be reconsidered if 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is not required by the Constitution, it is likewise true that our cases (discussed above) based on the principle that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is
				<em>
					 not
				</em>
				 required by the Constitution will have to be reconsidered if it 
				<em>
					is
				</em>
				.  So the 
				<em>
					stare decisis
				</em>
				 argument is a wash.  If, on the other hand, the argument is meant as an appeal to logic rather than 
				<em>
					stare decisis
				</em>
				, it is a classic example of begging the question: Congresss attempt to set aside 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, since it represents an assertion that violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is not a violation of the Constitution, 
				<em>
					also
				</em>
				 represents an assertion that the Court has no power to impose 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 on the States.  To answer this assertionnot by showing why violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
            <em>
					is
				</em>
				 a violation of the Constitutionbut by asserting that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
            <em>
					does
				</em>
				 apply against the States, is to assume precisely the point at issue.  In my view, our continued application of the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 code to the States despite our consistent statements that running afoul of its dictates does not necessarilyor even usuallyresult in an actual constitutional violation, represents not the source of  
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s salvation but rather evidence of its ultimate illegitimacy.  See generally J. Grano, Confessions, Truth, and the Law 173198 (1993); Grano, Prophylactic Rules in Criminal Procedure: A Question of Article III Legitimacy, 80 Nw. U. L. Rev. 100 (1985).  As 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice
				</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">
					Stevens 
				</span>
				has elsewhere explained, [t]his Courts power to require state courts to exclude probative self-incriminatory statements rests entirely on the premise that the use of such evidence violates the Federal Constitution. … If the Court does not accept that premise, it must regard the holding in the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 case itself, as well as all of the federal jurisprudence that has evolved from that decision, as nothing
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				more than an illegitimate exercise of raw judicial power.

				There was available to the Court a means of reconciling the established proposition that a violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 does not itself offend the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> with the Courts assertion of a right to ignore the present statute.  That means of reconciliation was argued strenuously by both petitioner and the United States, who were evidently more concerned than the Court is with maintaining the coherence of our jurisprudence.  It is not mentioned in the Courts opinion because, I assume, a majority of the Justices intent on reversing believes that incoherence is the lesser evil.  They may be right.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Petitioner and the United States contend that there is nothing at all exceptional, much less unconstitutional, about the Courts adopting prophylactic rules to buttress constitutional rights, and enforcing them against Congress and the States.  Indeed, the United States argues that [p]rophylactic rules are now and have been for many years a feature of this Courts constitutional adjudication.  Brief for United States 47.  That statement is not wholly inaccurate, if by many years one means since the mid-1960s.  However, in their zeal to validate what is in my view a lawless practice, the United States and petitioner greatly overstate the frequency with which we have engaged in it.  For instance, petitioner cites several cases in which the Court quite simply exercised its traditional judicial power to define the scope of constitutional protections and, relatedly, the circumstances in which they are violated.

That decision was based, not upon the theory that this was desirable protection beyond what the Confrontation Clause technically required; but rather upon the self-evident proposition that the inability to cross-examine an available witness whose damaging out-of-court testimony is introduced violates the Confrontation Clause, combined with the conclusion that in these circumstances a mere jury instruction can never be relied upon to prevent the testimony from being damaging, see

				Petitioner and the United States are right on target, however, in characterizing the Courts actions in a case decided within a few years of 
				<em>
					Miranda, North Carolina 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					Pearce
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/395/711" class="subref" title="subref">395 U. S. 711</a> (1969)
.  There, the Court concluded that due process would be offended were a judge vindictively to resentence with added severity a defendant who had successfully appealed his original conviction.  Rather than simply announce that vindictive sentencing violates the Due Process Clause, the Court went on to hold that [i]n order to assure the absence of such a [vindictive] motivation, … the reasons for [imposing the increased sentence] must affirmatively appear and must be based upon objective information concerning identifiable conduct on the part of the defendant occurring after the time of the original sentencing proceeding.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 726.  The Court later explicitly acknowledged 
				<em>
					Pearce
				</em>
				s prophylactic character, see 
				<em>
					Michigan

				 v. 
				<em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">53</a> (1973)
.  It is true, therefore, that the case exhibits the same fundamental flaw as does 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 when deprived (as it has been) of its original (implausible) pretension to announcement of what the Constitution itself required.  That is, although the Due Process Clause may well prohibit punishment based on judicial vindictiveness, the Constitution by no means vests in the courts any general power to prescribe particular devices in order to assure the absence of such a motivation,  395 U. S., at 741 (Black, J., dissenting).  Justice Black surely had the right idea when he derided the Courts requirement as pure legislation if there ever was legislation, 
				<em>
					ibid
				</em>
				., although in truth 
				<em>
					Pearce
				</em>
				s rule pales as a legislative achievement when compared to the detailed code promulgated in 
				<em>

				The foregoing demonstrates that, petitioners and the United States suggestions to the contrary notwithstanding, what the Court did in 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				(assuming, as later cases hold, that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 went beyond what the Constitution actually requires) is in fact extraordinary.  That the Court has, on rare and recent occasion, repeated the mistake does not transform error into truth, but illustrates the potential for future mischief that the error entails.  Where the Constitution has wished to lodge in one of the branches of the Federal Government some limited power to supplement its guarantees, it has said so.  See Amdt. 14, §5 (The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article).  The power with which the Court would endow itself under a prophylactic justification for 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 goes far beyond what it has permitted Congress to do under authority of that text.  Whereas we have insisted that congressional action under §5 of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a> must be congruent with, and proportional to, a 
				<em>
					constitutional violation
				</em>
				, see 
				<em>
					City of Boerne
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Flores,
				</em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">520</a> (1997)
, the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 nontextual power to embellish confers authority to prescribe preventive measures against not only constitutionally prohibited compelled confessions, but also (as discussed earlier) foolhardy ones.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I applaud, therefore, the refusal of the Justices in the majority to enunciate this boundless doctrine of judicial empowerment as a means of rendering todays decision rational.  In nonetheless joining the Courts judgment, however, they overlook two truisms: that actions speak louder than silence, and that (in judge-made law at least) logic will out.  Since there is in fact no other principle that can reconcile todays judgment with the post-
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 cases that the Court refuses to abandon, what todays decision will stand for, whether the Justices can bring themselves to say it or not, is the power of the Supreme Court to write a prophylactic, extraconstitutional Constitution, binding on Congress and the States.

				Thus, while I agree with the Court that §3501 cannot be upheld without also concluding that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 represents an illegitimate exercise of our authority to review state-court judgments, I do not share the Courts hesitation in reaching that conclusion.  For while the Court is also correct that the doctrine of 
				<em>

				</em>
				 demands some special justification for a departure from longstanding precedenteven precedent of the constitutional variety
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				that criterion is more than met here.  To repeat

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				In cases where statutory precedents have been overruled, the primary reason for the Courts shift in position has been the intervening development of the law, through either the growth of judicial doctrine or further action taken by Congress.

				Neither am I persuaded by the argument for retaining 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				that touts its supposed workability as compared with the totality-of-the-circumstances test it purported to replace.  
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s proponents cite

				<em>

				.  It is not immediately apparent, however, that the judicial burden has been eased by the bright-line rules adopted in 
				<em>

				.  In fact, in the 34 years since

				 creates as many close questions as it resolves.  The task of determining whether a defendant is in custody has proved to be a slippery one.  And the supposedly bright lines that separate interrogation from spontaneous declaration, the exercise of a right from waiver, and the adequate warning from the inadequate, likewise have turned out to be rather dim and ill defined.  The totality-of-the-circumstances approach, on the other hand, permits each fact to be taken into account without resort to formal and dispositive labels.  By dispensing with the difficulty of producing a yes-or-no answer to questions that are often better answered in shades and degrees,

				But even were I to agree that the old totality-of-the-circumstances test was more cumbersome, it is simply not true that

				Finally, I am not convinced by petitioners argument that

As far as I am aware, the public is not under the illusion that we are infallible.  I see little harm in admitting that we made a mistake in taking away from the people the ability to decide for themselves what protections (beyond those required by the Constitution) are reasonably affordable in the criminal investigatory process.  And I see much to be gained by reaffirming for the people the wonderful reality that they govern themselveswhich means that [t]he powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution that the people adopted, nor prohibited … to the States by that Constitution, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people, U. S. Const., Amdt. 10.

				Todays judgment converts

In Mitchell, moreover, the constitutional underpinnings of the earlier rule had not been demolished by subsequent cases.

            <em>
					Marbury
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Madison
				</em>
				, 1 Cranch 137 (1803), held that an Act of Congress will not be enforced by the courts if what it prescribes violates the Constitution of the United States.  That was the basis on which 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 was decided.  One will search todays opinion in vain, however, for a statement (surely simple enough to make) that what 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/3501.html" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. §3501</a> prescribesthe use at trial of a voluntary confession, even when a 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warning or its equivalent has failed to be givenviolates the Constitution.  The reason the statement does not appear is not only (and perhaps not so much) that it would be absurd, inasmuch as §3501 excludes from trial precisely what the Constitution excludes from trial, viz., compelled confessions; but also that Justices whose votes are needed to compose todays majority are on record as believing that a violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 a violation of the Constitution.  See

				<em>
					new
				</em>
				, if not entirely comprehensible, principle of constitutional law.  As the Court chooses to describe that principle, statutes of Congress can be disregarded, not only when what they prescribe violates the Constitution, but when what they prescribe contradicts a decision of this Court that announced a constitutional rule, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 7.  As I shall discuss in some detail, the only thing that can possibly mean in the context of this case is that this Court has the power, not merely to apply the Constitution but to expand it, imposing what it regards as useful prophylactic restrictions upon Congress and the States.  That is an immense and frightening antidemocratic power, and it does not exist.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It takes only a small step to bring todays opinion out of the realm of power-judging and into the mainstream of legal reasoning: The Court need only go beyond its carefully couched iterations that 
				<em>
					Miranda

				 is a constitutional decision, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>

				<em>

				at 10, n. 5, and come out and say quite clearly: We reaffirm today that custodial interrogation that is not preceded by 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings or their equivalent violates the Constitution of the United States.  It cannot say that, because a majority of the Court does not believe it.  The Court therefore acts in plain violation of the Constitution when it denies effect to this Act of Congress.

				It was once possible to characterize the so-called 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 rule as resting (however implausibly) upon the proposition that what the statute here before us permits
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				the admission at trial of un-
				<em>
					Mirandized
				</em>
				 confessions
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				violates the Constitution.  That is the fairest reading of the 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				case itself.  The Court began by announcing that the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> privilege against self-incrimination applied in the context of extrajudicial custodial interrogation, see 384 U. S., at 460467itself a doubtful proposition as a matter both of history and precedent, see 
				<em>
					id

				., at, at 510511 (Harlan, J., dissenting) (characterizing the Courts conclusion that the Fifth
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				Amendment privilege, rather than the Due Process
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				Clause, governed stationhouse confessions as a 
				<em>
					trompe loeil
				</em>
				).  Having extended the privilege into the confines of the station house, the Court liberally sprinkled throughout its sprawling 60-page opinion suggestions that, because of the compulsion inherent in custodial interrogation, the privilege was violated by any statement thus obtained that did not conform to the rules set forth in 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, or some functional equivalent.  See 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 458 (Unless adequate protective devices are employed to dispel the compulsion 
				<em>
					inherent
				</em>

				So understood,

				 was objectionable for innumerable reasons, not least the fact that cases spanning more than 70 years had rejected its core premise that, absent the warnings and an effective waiver of the right to remain silent and of the (thitherto unknown) right to have an attorney present, a statement obtained pursuant to custodial interrogation was necessarily the product of compulsion.

				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, if read as an explication of what the Constitution 
				<em>
					requires
				</em>
				, is preposterous.  There is, for example, simply no basis in reason for concluding that a response to the very first question asked, by a suspect who already 
				<em>
					knows
				</em>
				 all of the rights described in the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warning, is anything other than a volitional act.  See 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra, 
				</em>
				at 533534 (White, J., dissenting).  And even if one assumes that the elimination of compulsion absolutely requires informing even the most knowledgeable suspect of his right to remain silent, it cannot conceivably require the right to have 
				<em>
					counsel
				</em>
				 present.  There is a world of difference, which the Court recognized under the traditional voluntariness test but ignored in 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, between compelling a suspect to incriminate himself and preventing him from foolishly doing so of his own accord.  Only the latter (which is 
				<em>
					not 
				</em>
				required by the Constitution) could explain the Courts inclusion of a right to counsel and the requirement that it, too, be knowingly and intelligently waived.  Counsels presence is not required to tell the suspect that he 
				<em>
					need 
				</em>
				not speak; the interrogators can do that.  The only good reason for having counsel there is that he can be counted on to advise the suspect that he 
				<em>
					should 
				</em>
				not speak.  See

				Preventing foolish (rather than compelled) confessions is likewise the only conceivable basis for the rules (suggested in 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, see 384 U. S., at 444445, 473474), that courts must exclude any confession elicited by questioning conducted, without interruption, after the suspect has indicated a desire to stand on his right to remain silent, see 
				<em>
					Michigan
				</em>
				 v.

					Mosley,

				<em>
					Edwards

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">484</a>485 (1981)
.  Nonthreatening attempts to persuade the suspect to reconsider that initial decision are not, without more, enough to render a change of heart the product of anything other than the suspects free will.  Thus, what is most remarkable about the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 decisionand what made it unacceptable as a matter of straightforward constitutional interpretation in the 
				<em>
					Marbury
				</em>
				 traditionis its palpable hostility toward the act of confession 
				<em>
					per se
				</em>
				, rather than toward what the Constitution abhors, 
				<em>
					compelled
				</em>
				 confession.  See 
				<em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">187</a> (1977)
 ([F]ar from being prohibited by the Constitution, admissions of guilt by wrongdoers, if not coerced, are inherently desirable).  The Constitution is not, unlike the 
				<em>

				For these reasons, and others more than adequately developed in the

				that a violation of the

				</em>
				 amounts to a violation of the privilege against compelled self-incrimination can claim no support in history, precedent, or common sense, and as a result would at least presumptively be worth reconsidering even at this late date.

				As the Court today acknowledges, since

				 we have explicitly, and repeatedly, interpreted that decision as having announced, not the circumstances in which custodial interrogation runs afoul of the Fifth or 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>, but rather only prophylactic rules that go beyond the right against compelled self-incrimination.  Of course the seeds of this prophylactic interpretation of

				<em>
					Miranda

The defendant nodded in the direction of some empty cartons and responded that the gun is over there.  The Court held that both the unwarned statementthe gun is over thereand the recovered weapon were admissible in the prosecutions case in chief under a public safety exception to the prophylactic rules enunciated in

				</em>
				s rules is a violation of the Constitution.  But as I explained at the outset, that is what is required before the Court may disregard a law of Congress governing the admissibility of evidence in federal court.  The Court today insists that the 
				<em>
					decision
				</em>
				 in 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is a constitutional one, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1, 8; that it has constitutional underpinnings

				at 10, n. 5; a constitutional basis and a constitutional origin,

				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 10; and that it announced a constitutional rule, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 7, 9, 11, 14.  It is fine to play these word games; but what makes a decision constitutional in the only sense relevant herein the sense that renders it impervious to supersession by congressional legislation such as §3501is the determination that the Constitution 
				<em>
					requires
				</em>
				 the result that the decision announces and the statute ignores.  By disregarding congressional action that concededly does not violate the Constitution, the Court flagrantly offends fundamental principles of separation of powers, and arrogates to itself prerogatives reserved to the representatives of the people.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court seeks to avoid this conclusion in two ways: First, by misdescribing these post-
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 cases as mere dicta.  The Court concedes only that there is language in some of our opinions that supports the view that

				<em>
					Ante

				; it is a matter of

					holdings

				.  The proposition that failure to comply with 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s rules does not establish a constitutional
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				violation was central to the 
				<em>
					holdings

				 of 
				<em>
					Tucker

				<em>

				, 
				<em>
					Quarles
				</em>
				, and Elstad.

				 is not a constitutional rulebut that no constitutional rule is immutable.  No court laying down a general rule can possibly foresee the various circumstances in which counsel will seek to apply it, and the sort of modifications represented by these cases are as much a normal part of constitutional law as the original decision.

The issue, however, is not whether court rules are mutable; they assuredly are.  It is not whether, in the light of various circumstances, they can be modifi[ed]; they assuredly can.  The issue is whether, 
				<em>
					as mutated and modified
				</em>
				, they must 
				<em>
					make sense
				</em>
				.  The requirement that they do so is the only thing that prevents this Court from being some sort of nine-headed Caesar, giving thumbs-up or thumbs-down to whatever outcome, case by case, suits or offends its collective fancy.  And if confessions procured in violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 are confessions compelled in violation of the Constitution, the post-
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 decisions I have discussed do not make sense.  The only reasoned basis for their outcome was that a violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 a violation of the Constitution.  If, for example, as the Court acknowledges was the holding of 
				<em>
					Elstad
				</em>
				, the traditional fruits doctrine developed in 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> cases (that the fruits of evidence obtained unconstitutionally must be excluded from trial) does 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 apply to the fruits of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 violations, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 11; and if the reason for the difference is 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 violations are not constitutional violations (which is plainly and flatly what 
				<em>
					Elstad
				</em>
				 said); then the Court must come up with some 
				<em>
					other
				</em>
				 explanation for the difference.  (That will take quite a bit of doing, by the way, since it is 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 clear on the face of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> that evidence obtained in violation of that guarantee must be excluded from trial, whereas it 
				<em>
					is
				</em>
				 clear on the face of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> that unconstitutionally compelled confessions cannot be used.)  To say simply that unreasonable searches under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> are different from unwarned interrogation under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a>, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1112, is true but supremely unhelpful.

				Finally, the Court asserts that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 must be a constitutional decision announcing a constitutional rule, and thus immune to congressional modification, because we have since its inception applied it to the States.  If this argument is meant as an invocation of 
				<em>
					stare decisis
				</em>
				, it fails because, though it is true that our cases applying 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 against the States must be reconsidered if 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is not required by the Constitution, it is likewise true that our cases (discussed above) based on the principle that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is
				<em>
					 not
				</em>
				 required by the Constitution will have to be reconsidered if it 
				<em>
					is
				</em>
				.  So the 
				<em>
					stare decisis
				</em>
				 argument is a wash.  If, on the other hand, the argument is meant as an appeal to logic rather than 
				<em>
					stare decisis
				</em>
				, it is a classic example of begging the question: Congresss attempt to set aside 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, since it represents an assertion that violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is not a violation of the Constitution, 
				<em>
					also
				</em>
				 represents an assertion that the Court has no power to impose 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 on the States.  To answer this assertionnot by showing why violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
            <em>
					is
				</em>
				 a violation of the Constitutionbut by asserting that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
            <em>
					does
				</em>
				 apply against the States, is to assume precisely the point at issue.  In my view, our continued application of the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 code to the States despite our consistent statements that running afoul of its dictates does not necessarilyor even usuallyresult in an actual constitutional violation, represents not the source of  
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s salvation but rather evidence of its ultimate illegitimacy.  See generally J. Grano, Confessions, Truth, and the Law 173198 (1993); Grano, Prophylactic Rules in Criminal Procedure: A Question of Article III Legitimacy, 80 Nw. U. L. Rev. 100 (1985).  As 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice
				</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">
					Stevens 
				</span>
				has elsewhere explained, [t]his Courts power to require state courts to exclude probative self-incriminatory statements rests entirely on the premise that the use of such evidence violates the Federal Constitution. … If the Court does not accept that premise, it must regard the holding in the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 case itself, as well as all of the federal jurisprudence that has evolved from that decision, as nothing
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				more than an illegitimate exercise of raw judicial power.

				There was available to the Court a means of reconciling the established proposition that a violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 does not itself offend the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> with the Courts assertion of a right to ignore the present statute.  That means of reconciliation was argued strenuously by both petitioner and the United States, who were evidently more concerned than the Court is with maintaining the coherence of our jurisprudence.  It is not mentioned in the Courts opinion because, I assume, a majority of the Justices intent on reversing believes that incoherence is the lesser evil.  They may be right.

				Petitioner and the United States contend that there is nothing at all exceptional, much less unconstitutional, about the Courts adopting prophylactic rules to buttress constitutional rights, and enforcing them against Congress and the States.  Indeed, the United States argues that [p]rophylactic rules are now and have been for many years a feature of this Courts constitutional adjudication.  Brief for United States 47.  That statement is not wholly inaccurate, if by many years one means since the mid-1960s.  However, in their zeal to validate what is in my view a lawless practice, the United States and petitioner greatly overstate the frequency with which we have engaged in it.  For instance, petitioner cites several cases in which the Court quite simply exercised its traditional judicial power to define the scope of constitutional protections and, relatedly, the circumstances in which they are violated.

That decision was based, not upon the theory that this was desirable protection beyond what the Confrontation Clause technically required; but rather upon the self-evident proposition that the inability to cross-examine an available witness whose damaging out-of-court testimony is introduced violates the Confrontation Clause, combined with the conclusion that in these circumstances a mere jury instruction can never be relied upon to prevent the testimony from being damaging, see

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/395/711" class="subref" title="subref">395 U. S. 711</a> (1969)
.  There, the Court concluded that due process would be offended were a judge vindictively to resentence with added severity a defendant who had successfully appealed his original conviction.  Rather than simply announce that vindictive sentencing violates the Due Process Clause, the Court went on to hold that [i]n order to assure the absence of such a [vindictive] motivation, … the reasons for [imposing the increased sentence] must affirmatively appear and must be based upon objective information concerning identifiable conduct on the part of the defendant occurring after the time of the original sentencing proceeding.

				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 when deprived (as it has been) of its original (implausible) pretension to announcement of what the Constitution itself required.  That is, although the Due Process Clause may well prohibit punishment based on judicial vindictiveness, the Constitution by no means vests in the courts any general power to prescribe particular devices in order to assure the absence of such a motivation,  395 U. S., at 741 (Black, J., dissenting).  Justice Black surely had the right idea when he derided the Courts requirement as pure legislation if there ever was legislation,

				The foregoing demonstrates that, petitioners and the United States suggestions to the contrary notwithstanding, what the Court did in 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				(assuming, as later cases hold, that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 went beyond what the Constitution actually requires) is in fact extraordinary.  That the Court has, on rare and recent occasion, repeated the mistake does not transform error into truth, but illustrates the potential for future mischief that the error entails.  Where the Constitution has wished to lodge in one of the branches of the Federal Government some limited power to supplement its guarantees, it has said so.  See Amdt. 14, §5 (The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article).  The power with which the Court would endow itself under a prophylactic justification for 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 goes far beyond what it has permitted Congress to do under authority of that text.  Whereas we have insisted that congressional action under §5 of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a> must be congruent with, and proportional to, a 
				<em>
					constitutional violation
				</em>
				, see 
				<em>
					City of Boerne
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Flores,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">520</a> (1997)
, the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 nontextual power to embellish confers authority to prescribe preventive measures against not only constitutionally prohibited compelled confessions, but also (as discussed earlier) foolhardy ones.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I applaud, therefore, the refusal of the Justices in the majority to enunciate this boundless doctrine of judicial empowerment as a means of rendering todays decision rational.  In nonetheless joining the Courts judgment, however, they overlook two truisms: that actions speak louder than silence, and that (in judge-made law at least) logic will out.  Since there is in fact no other principle that can reconcile todays judgment with the post-
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 cases that the Court refuses to abandon, what todays decision will stand for, whether the Justices can bring themselves to say it or not, is the power of the Supreme Court to write a prophylactic, extraconstitutional Constitution, binding on Congress and the States.

				Thus, while I agree with the Court that §3501 cannot be upheld without also concluding that

				 represents an illegitimate exercise of our authority to review state-court judgments, I do not share the Courts hesitation in reaching that conclusion.  For while the Court is also correct that the doctrine of

				Neither am I persuaded by the argument for retaining

				, for all its alleged brightness, is not without its difficulties; and voluntariness is not without its strengths… . 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 creates as many close questions as it resolves.  The task of determining whether a defendant is in custody has proved to be a slippery one.  And the supposedly bright lines that separate interrogation from spontaneous declaration, the exercise of a right from waiver, and the adequate warning from the inadequate, likewise have turned out to be rather dim and ill defined.  The totality-of-the-circumstances approach, on the other hand, permits each fact to be taken into account without resort to formal and dispositive labels.  By dispensing with the difficulty of producing a yes-or-no answer to questions that are often better answered in shades and degrees, 
				<em>
					the voluntariness inquiry often can make judicial decisionmaking easier rather than more onerous
				</em>

				But even were I to agree that the old totality-of-the-circumstances test was more cumbersome, it is simply not true that

				 has banished it from the law and replaced it with a new test.  Under the current regime, which the Court today retains in its entirety, courts are frequently called upon to undertake 
				<em>
					both

				the

				 standard, and as such continues to govern the admissibility for impeachment purposes of statements taken in violation of

				Finally, I am not convinced by petitioners argument that 
				<em>

				 should be preserved because the decision occupies a special place in the publics consciousness.  Brief for Petitioner 44.  As far as I am aware, the public is not under the illusion that we are infallible.  I see little harm in admitting that we made a mistake in taking away from the people the ability to decide for themselves what protections (beyond those required by the Constitution) are reasonably affordable in the criminal investigatory process.  And I see much to be gained by reaffirming for the people the wonderful reality that they govern themselveswhich means that [t]he powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution that the people adopted, nor prohibited … to the States by that Constitution, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people, U. S. Const., Amdt. 10.

				Todays judgment converts 
				<em>

				from a milestone of judicial overreaching into the very Cheops Pyramid (or perhaps the Sphinx would be a better analogue) of judicial arrogance.  In imposing its Court-made code upon the States, the original opinion at least

				 a celebrated decisionthat has come to stand for the proposition that the Supreme Court has power to impose extraconstitutional constraints upon Congress and the States.  This is not the system that was established by the Framers, or that would be established by any sane supporter of government by the people.

In Mitchell, moreover, the constitutional underpinnings of the earlier rule had not been demolished by subsequent cases.

				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 (as of all cases): the rationale that gives it a permanent place in our jurisprudence.

            <em>
					Marbury
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Madison
				</em>
				, 1 Cranch 137 (1803), held that an Act of Congress will not be enforced by the courts if what it prescribes violates the Constitution of the United States.  That was the basis on which 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 was decided.  One will search todays opinion in vain, however, for a statement (surely simple enough to make) that what 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/3501.html" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. §3501</a> prescribesthe use at trial of a voluntary confession, even when a 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warning or its equivalent has failed to be givenviolates the Constitution.  The reason the statement does not appear is not only (and perhaps not so much) that it would be absurd, inasmuch as §3501 excludes from trial precisely what the Constitution excludes from trial, viz., compelled confessions; but also that Justices whose votes are needed to compose todays majority are on record as believing that a violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 a violation of the Constitution.  See 
				<em>
					Davis

				<em>
					new
				</em>
				, if not entirely comprehensible, principle of constitutional law.  As the Court chooses to describe that principle, statutes of Congress can be disregarded, not only when what they prescribe violates the Constitution, but when what they prescribe contradicts a decision of this Court that announced a constitutional rule, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 7.  As I shall discuss in some detail, the only thing that can possibly mean in the context of this case is that this Court has the power, not merely to apply the Constitution but to expand it, imposing what it regards as useful prophylactic restrictions upon Congress and the States.  That is an immense and frightening antidemocratic power, and it does not exist.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It takes only a small step to bring todays opinion out of the realm of power-judging and into the mainstream of legal reasoning: The Court need only go beyond its carefully couched iterations that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is a constitutional decision, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 8, that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is constitutionally based, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 10, that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 has constitutional underpinnings, 
				<em>
					ante, 
				</em>
				at 10, n. 5, and come out and say quite clearly: We reaffirm today that custodial interrogation that is not preceded by 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings or their equivalent violates the Constitution of the United States.  It cannot say that, because a majority of the Court does not believe it.  The Court therefore acts in plain violation of the Constitution when it denies effect to this Act of Congress.

				So if a law be in opposition to the constitution; if both the law and the constitution apply to a particular case, so that the court must either decide that case conformably to the law, disregarding the constitution; or conformably to the constitution, disregarding the law; the court must determine which of these conflicting rules governs the case.

The power we recognized in 
				<em>
					Marbury
				</em>
				 will thus permit us, indeed require us, to disregar[d] §3501, a duly enacted statute governing the admissibility of evidence in the federal courts, only if it be in opposition to the constitutionhere, assertedly, the dictates of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a>.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It was once possible to characterize the so-called 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 rule as resting (however implausibly) upon the proposition that what the statute here before us permits
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				the admission at trial of un-
				<em>
					Mirandized
				</em>
				 confessions
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				violates the Constitution.  That is the fairest reading of the 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				case itself.  The Court began by announcing that the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> privilege against self-incrimination applied in the context of extrajudicial custodial interrogation, see 384 U. S., at 460467itself a doubtful proposition as a matter both of history and precedent, see 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at, at 510511 (Harlan, J., dissenting) (characterizing the Courts conclusion that the Fifth
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				Amendment privilege, rather than the Due Process
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				Clause, governed stationhouse confessions as a 
				<em>
					trompe loeil
				</em>
				).  Having extended the privilege into the confines of the station house, the Court liberally sprinkled throughout its sprawling 60-page opinion suggestions that, because of the compulsion inherent in custodial interrogation, the privilege was violated by any statement thus obtained that did not conform to the rules set forth in 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, or some functional equivalent.  See 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 458 (Unless adequate protective devices are employed to dispel the compulsion 
				<em>
					inherent
				</em>
				 in custodial surroundings, 
				<em>
					no
				</em>
				 statement obtained from the defendant can truly be the product of his free choice) (emphases added); 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 461 (An individual swept from familiar surroundings into police custody, surrounded by antagonistic forces, and subjected to the techniques of persuasion described above cannot be otherwise than under compulsion to speak); 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 467 (We have concluded that without proper safeguards the process of in-custody interrogation … contains inherently compelling pressures which work to undermine the individuals will to resist and to compel him to speak where he would not otherwise do so freely);

				The dissenters, for their part, also understood

				So understood,

				 was objectionable for innumerable reasons, not least the fact that cases spanning more than 70 years had rejected its core premise that, absent the warnings and an effective waiver of the right to remain silent and of the (thitherto unknown) right to have an attorney present, a statement obtained pursuant to custodial interrogation was necessarily the product of compulsion.  See

				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, if read as an explication of what the Constitution 
				<em>
					requires
				</em>
				, is preposterous.  There is, for example, simply no basis in reason for concluding that a response to the very first question asked, by a suspect who already 
				<em>
					knows
				</em>
				 all of the rights described in the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warning, is anything other than a volitional act.  See 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra, 
				</em>
				at 533534 (White, J., dissenting).  And even if one assumes that the elimination of compulsion absolutely requires informing even the most knowledgeable suspect of his right to remain silent, it cannot conceivably require the right to have 
				<em>
					counsel
				</em>
				 present.  There is a world of difference, which the Court recognized under the traditional voluntariness test but ignored in 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, between compelling a suspect to incriminate himself and preventing him from foolishly doing so of his own accord.  Only the latter (which is 
				<em>
					not 
				</em>
				required by the Constitution) could explain the Courts inclusion of a right to counsel and the requirement that it, too, be knowingly and intelligently waived.  Counsels presence is not required to tell the suspect that he 
				<em>
					need 
				</em>
				not speak; the interrogators can do that.  The only good reason for having counsel there is that he can be counted on to advise the suspect that he 
				<em>
					should 
				</em>
				not speak.  See 
				<em>
					Watts

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Preventing foolish (rather than compelled) confessions is likewise the only conceivable basis for the rules (suggested in 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, see 384 U. S., at 444445, 473474), that courts must exclude any confession elicited by questioning conducted, without interruption, after the suspect has indicated a desire to stand on his right to remain silent, see 
				<em>
					Michigan
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Mosley,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/423/96" class="subref" title="subref">423 U. S. 96</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">105</a>106 (1975)
, or initiated by police after the suspect has expressed a desire to have counsel present, see 
				<em>
					Edwards
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Arizona,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/451/477" class="subref" title="subref">451 U. S. 477</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">484</a>485 (1981)
.  Nonthreatening attempts to persuade the suspect to reconsider that initial decision are not, without more, enough to render a change of heart the product of anything other than the suspects free will.  Thus, what is most remarkable about the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 decisionand what made it unacceptable as a matter of straightforward constitutional interpretation in the 
				<em>
					Marbury
				</em>
				 traditionis its palpable hostility toward the act of confession 
				<em>
					per se
				</em>
				, rather than toward what the Constitution abhors, 
				<em>
					compelled
				</em>
				 confession.  See 
				<em>
					United States

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">187</a> (1977)
 ([F]ar from being prohibited by the Constitution, admissions of guilt by wrongdoers, if not coerced, are inherently desirable).  The Constitution is not, unlike the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 majority, offended by a criminals commendable qualm of conscience or fortunate fit of stupidity.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Minnick
				</em>
				 v.

				For these reasons, and others more than adequately developed in the

				that a violation of the

				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				warningsthe police demanded to know where the gun was.  The defendant nodded in the direction of some empty cartons and responded that the gun is over there.  The Court held that both the unwarned statementthe gun is over thereand the recovered weapon were admissible in the prosecutions case in chief under a public safety exception to the prophylactic rules enunciated in

				<em>
					Eagan
				</em>
				, 492 U. S., at 203, it is simply no longer possible for the Court to conclude, even if it wanted to, that a violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s rules is a violation of the Constitution.  But as I explained at the outset, that is what is required before the Court may disregard a law of Congress governing the admissibility of evidence in federal court.  The Court today insists that the 
				<em>
					decision
				</em>
				 in 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is a constitutional one, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1, 8; that it has constitutional underpinnings
				<em>
					,
				</em>
            <em>
					ante, 
				</em>
				at 10, n. 5; a constitutional basis and a constitutional origin, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 9, n. 3; that it was constitutionally based, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 10; and that it announced a constitutional rule, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 7, 9, 11, 14.  It is fine to play these word games; but what makes a decision constitutional in the only sense relevant herein the sense that renders it impervious to supersession by congressional legislation such as §3501is the determination that the Constitution 
				<em>
					requires
				</em>
				 the result that the decision announces and the statute ignores.  By disregarding congressional action that concededly does not violate the Constitution, the Court flagrantly offends fundamental principles of separation of powers, and arrogates to itself prerogatives reserved to the representatives of the people.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court seeks to avoid this conclusion in two ways: First, by misdescribing these post-
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 cases as mere dicta.  The Court concedes only that there is language in some of our opinions that supports the view that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s protections are not constitutionally required.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 8.  It is not a matter of 
				<em>
					language
				</em>
				; it is a matter of 
				<em>
					holdings
				</em>
				.  The proposition that failure to comply with 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s rules does not establish a constitutional
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				violation was central to the 
				<em>
					holdings
				</em>
				 of 
				<em>
					Tucker
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Hass
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Quarles
				</em>
				, and Elstad.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The second way the Court seeks to avoid the impact of these cases is simply to disclaim responsibility for reasoned decisionmaking.  It says:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				These decisions illustrate the principlenot that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is not a constitutional rulebut that no constitutional rule is immutable.  No court laying down a general rule can possibly foresee the various circumstances in which counsel will seek to apply it, and the sort of modifications represented by these cases are as much a normal part of constitutional law as the original decision.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 11.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
The issue, however, is not whether court rules are mutable; they assuredly are.  It is not whether, in the light of various circumstances, they can be modifi[ed]; they assuredly can.  The issue is whether, 
				<em>
					as mutated and modified
				</em>
				, they must 
				<em>
					make sense
				</em>
				.  The requirement that they do so is the only thing that prevents this Court from being some sort of nine-headed Caesar, giving thumbs-up or thumbs-down to whatever outcome, case by case, suits or offends its collective fancy.  And if confessions procured in violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 are confessions compelled in violation of the Constitution, the post-
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 decisions I have discussed do not make sense.  The only reasoned basis for their outcome was that a violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 a violation of the Constitution.  If, for example, as the Court acknowledges was the holding of 
				<em>
					Elstad
				</em>
				, the traditional fruits doctrine developed in 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> cases (that the fruits of evidence obtained unconstitutionally must be excluded from trial) does 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 apply to the fruits of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 violations, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 11; and if the reason for the difference is 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 violations are not constitutional violations (which is plainly and flatly what 
				<em>
					Elstad
				</em>
				 said); then the Court must come up with some 
				<em>
					other
				</em>
				 explanation for the difference.  (That will take quite a bit of doing, by the way, since it is 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 clear on the face of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> that evidence obtained in violation of that guarantee must be excluded from trial, whereas it 
				<em>
					is
				</em>
				 clear on the face of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> that unconstitutionally compelled confessions cannot be used.)  To say simply that unreasonable searches under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> are different from unwarned interrogation under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a>, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1112, is true but supremely unhelpful.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Finally, the Court asserts that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 must be a constitutional decision announcing a constitutional rule, and thus immune to congressional modification, because we have since its inception applied it to the States.  If this argument is meant as an invocation of 
				<em>
					stare decisis
				</em>
				, it fails because, though it is true that our cases applying 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 against the States must be reconsidered if 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is not required by the Constitution, it is likewise true that our cases (discussed above) based on the principle that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is
				<em>
					 not
				</em>
				 required by the Constitution will have to be reconsidered if it 
				<em>
					is
				</em>
				.  So the 
				<em>
					stare decisis
				</em>
				 argument is a wash.  If, on the other hand, the argument is meant as an appeal to logic rather than 
				<em>
					stare decisis
				</em>
				, it is a classic example of begging the question: Congresss attempt to set aside 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, since it represents an assertion that violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is not a violation of the Constitution, 
				<em>
					also
				</em>
				 represents an assertion that the Court has no power to impose 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 on the States.  To answer this assertionnot by showing why violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
            <em>
					is
				</em>
				 a violation of the Constitutionbut by asserting that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
            <em>
					does
				</em>
				 apply against the States, is to assume precisely the point at issue.  In my view, our continued application of the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 code to the States despite our consistent statements that running afoul of its dictates does not necessarilyor even usuallyresult in an actual constitutional violation, represents not the source of  
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s salvation but rather evidence of its ultimate illegitimacy.  See generally J. Grano, Confessions, Truth, and the Law 173198 (1993); Grano, Prophylactic Rules in Criminal Procedure: A Question of Article III Legitimacy, 80 Nw. U. L. Rev. 100 (1985).  As 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice
				</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">
					Stevens 
				</span>
				has elsewhere explained, [t]his Courts power to require state courts to exclude probative self-incriminatory statements rests entirely on the premise that the use of such evidence violates the Federal Constitution. … If the Court does not accept that premise, it must regard the holding in the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 case itself, as well as all of the federal jurisprudence that has evolved from that decision, as nothing
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				more than an illegitimate exercise of raw judicial power.

				There was available to the Court a means of reconciling the established proposition that a violation of 
				<em>

				</em>
				 does not itself offend the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> with the Courts assertion of a right to ignore the present statute.  That means of reconciliation was argued strenuously by both petitioner and the United States, who were evidently more concerned than the Court is with maintaining the coherence of our jurisprudence.  It is not mentioned in the Courts opinion because, I assume, a majority of the Justices intent on reversing believes that incoherence is the lesser evil.  They may be right.

				Petitioner and the United States contend that there is nothing at all exceptional, much less unconstitutional, about the Courts adopting prophylactic rules to buttress constitutional rights, and enforcing them against Congress and the States.  Indeed, the United States argues that [p]rophylactic rules are now and have been for many years a feature of this Courts constitutional adjudication.  Brief for United States 47.  That statement is not wholly inaccurate, if by many years one means since the mid-1960s.  However, in their zeal to validate what is in my view a lawless practice, the United States and petitioner greatly overstate the frequency with which we have engaged in it.  For instance, petitioner cites several cases in which the Court quite simply exercised its traditional judicial power to define the scope of constitutional protections and, relatedly, the circumstances in which they are violated.

That decision was based, not upon the theory that this was desirable protection beyond what the Confrontation Clause technically required; but rather upon the self-evident proposition that the inability to cross-examine an available witness whose damaging out-of-court testimony is introduced violates the Confrontation Clause, combined with the conclusion that in these circumstances a mere jury instruction can never be relied upon to prevent the testimony from being damaging, see

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/395/711" class="subref" title="subref">395 U. S. 711</a> (1969)
.  There, the Court concluded that due process would be offended were a judge vindictively to resentence with added severity a defendant who had successfully appealed his original conviction.  Rather than simply announce that vindictive sentencing violates the Due Process Clause, the Court went on to hold that [i]n order to assure the absence of such a [vindictive] motivation, … the reasons for [imposing the increased sentence] must affirmatively appear and must be based upon objective information concerning identifiable conduct on the part of the defendant occurring after the time of the original sentencing proceeding.

				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 when deprived (as it has been) of its original (implausible) pretension to announcement of what the Constitution itself required.  That is, although the Due Process Clause may well prohibit punishment based on judicial vindictiveness, the Constitution by no means vests in the courts any general power to prescribe particular devices in order to assure the absence of such a motivation,  395 U. S., at 741 (Black, J., dissenting).  Justice Black surely had the right idea when he derided the Courts requirement as pure legislation if there ever was legislation, 
				<em>

				The foregoing demonstrates that, petitioners and the United States suggestions to the contrary notwithstanding, what the Court did in 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				(assuming, as later cases hold, that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 went beyond what the Constitution actually requires) is in fact extraordinary.  That the Court has, on rare and recent occasion, repeated the mistake does not transform error into truth, but illustrates the potential for future mischief that the error entails.  Where the Constitution has wished to lodge in one of the branches of the Federal Government some limited power to supplement its guarantees, it has said so.  See Amdt. 14, §5 (The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article).  The power with which the Court would endow itself under a prophylactic justification for 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 goes far beyond what it has permitted Congress to do under authority of that text.  Whereas we have insisted that congressional action under §5 of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a> must be congruent with, and proportional to, a 
				<em>
					constitutional violation
				</em>
				, see 
				<em>
					City of Boerne
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Flores,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">520</a> (1997)
, the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 nontextual power to embellish confers authority to prescribe preventive measures against not only constitutionally prohibited compelled confessions, but also (as discussed earlier) foolhardy ones.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I applaud, therefore, the refusal of the Justices in the majority to enunciate this boundless doctrine of judicial empowerment as a means of rendering todays decision rational.  In nonetheless joining the Courts judgment, however, they overlook two truisms: that actions speak louder than silence, and that (in judge-made law at least) logic will out.  Since there is in fact no other principle that can reconcile todays judgment with the post-
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 cases that the Court refuses to abandon, what todays decision will stand for, whether the Justices can bring themselves to say it or not, is the power of the Supreme Court to write a prophylactic, extraconstitutional Constitution, binding on Congress and the States.

				Thus, while I agree with the Court that §3501 cannot be upheld without also concluding that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 represents an illegitimate exercise of our authority to review state-court judgments, I do not share the Courts hesitation in reaching that conclusion.  For while the Court is also correct that the doctrine of 
				<em>
					stare decisis
				</em>
				 demands some special justification for a departure from longstanding precedenteven precedent of the constitutional variety
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				that criterion is more than met here.  To repeat

				 in mind:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				In cases where statutory precedents have been overruled, the primary reason for the Courts shift in position has been the intervening development of the law, through either the growth of judicial doctrine or further action taken by Congress.

				Neither am I persuaded by the argument for retaining 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				that touts its supposed workability as compared with the totality-of-the-circumstances test it purported to replace.  
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s proponents cite 
				<em>

				 the fact that the Court was called upon to make difficult and subtle distinctions in applying the voluntariness test in some 30-odd due process coerced confessions cases in the 30 years between

				<em>

				.  It is not immediately apparent, however, that the judicial burden has been eased by the bright-line rules adopted in 
				<em>

				.  In fact, in the 34 years since 
				<em>
					Miranda

				Moreover, it is not clear why the Court thinks that the totality-of-the-circumstances test … is more difficult than

				 creates as many close questions as it resolves.  The task of determining whether a defendant is in custody has proved to be a slippery one.  And the supposedly bright lines that separate interrogation from spontaneous declaration, the exercise of a right from waiver, and the adequate warning from the inadequate, likewise have turned out to be rather dim and ill defined.  The totality-of-the-circumstances approach, on the other hand, permits each fact to be taken into account without resort to formal and dispositive labels.  By dispensing with the difficulty of producing a yes-or-no answer to questions that are often better answered in shades and degrees, 
				<em>

				But even were I to agree that the old totality-of-the-circumstances test was more cumbersome, it is simply not true that

				Finally, I am not convinced by petitioners argument that

				 should be preserved because the decision occupies a special place in the publics consciousness.  Brief for Petitioner 44.  As far as I am aware, the public is not under the illusion that we are infallible.  I see little harm in admitting that we made a mistake in taking away from the people the ability to decide for themselves what protections (beyond those required by the Constitution) are reasonably affordable in the criminal investigatory process.  And I see much to be gained by reaffirming for the people the wonderful reality that they govern themselveswhich means that [t]he powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution that the people adopted, nor prohibited … to the States by that Constitution, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people, U. S. Const., Amdt. 10.

				Todays judgment converts

In Mitchell, moreover, the constitutional underpinnings of the earlier rule had not been demolished by subsequent cases.

				 was decided.  One will search todays opinion in vain, however, for a statement (surely simple enough to make) that what 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/3501.html" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. §3501</a> prescribesthe use at trial of a voluntary confession, even when a

				 warning or its equivalent has failed to be givenviolates the Constitution.  The reason the statement does not appear is not only (and perhaps not so much) that it would be absurd, inasmuch as §3501 excludes from trial precisely what the Constitution excludes from trial, viz., compelled confessions; but also that Justices whose votes are needed to compose todays majority are on record as believing that a violation of

As I shall discuss in some detail, the only thing that can possibly mean in the context of this case is that this Court has the power, not merely to apply the Constitution but to expand it, imposing what it regards as useful prophylactic restrictions upon Congress and the States.  That is an immense and frightening antidemocratic power, and it does not exist.

				It takes only a small step to bring todays opinion out of the realm of power-judging and into the mainstream of legal reasoning: The Court need only go beyond its carefully couched iterations that 
				<em>

				</em>
				 is a constitutional decision, 
				<em>

				, at 8, that 
				<em>

				at 10, n. 5, and come out and say quite clearly: We reaffirm today that custodial interrogation that is not preceded by 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings or their equivalent violates the Constitution of the United States.  It cannot say that, because a majority of the Court does not believe it.  The Court therefore acts in plain violation of the Constitution when it denies effect to this Act of Congress.

				It was once possible to characterize the so-called

				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				the admission at trial of un-

				</em>
				 confessions
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				violates the Constitution.  That is the fairest reading of the

				case itself.  The Court began by announcing that the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> privilege against self-incrimination applied in the context of extrajudicial custodial interrogation, see 384 U. S., at 460467itself a doubtful proposition as a matter both of history and precedent, see

				Amendment privilege, rather than the Due Process

				<em>
					trompe loeil
				</em>
				).  Having extended the privilege into the confines of the station house, the Court liberally sprinkled throughout its sprawling 60-page opinion suggestions that, because of the compulsion inherent in custodial interrogation, the privilege was violated by any statement thus obtained that did not conform to the rules set forth in 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, or some functional equivalent.  See

				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, if read as an explication of what the Constitution 
				<em>
					requires
				</em>
				, is preposterous.  There is, for example, simply no basis in reason for concluding that a response to the very first question asked, by a suspect who already 
				<em>
					knows
				</em>
				 all of the rights described in the 
				<em>

				</em>
				 warning, is anything other than a volitional act.  See 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra, 
				</em>
				at 533534 (White, J., dissenting).  And even if one assumes that the elimination of compulsion absolutely requires informing even the most knowledgeable suspect of his right to remain silent, it cannot conceivably require the right to have 
				<em>
					counsel
				</em>
				 present.  There is a world of difference, which the Court recognized under the traditional voluntariness test but ignored in 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, between compelling a suspect to incriminate himself and preventing him from foolishly doing so of his own accord.  Only the latter (which is 
				<em>
					not 
				</em>
				required by the Constitution) could explain the Courts inclusion of a right to counsel and the requirement that it, too, be knowingly and intelligently waived.  Counsels presence is not required to tell the suspect that he 
				<em>
					need 
				</em>
				not speak; the interrogators can do that.  The only good reason for having counsel there is that he can be counted on to advise the suspect that he 
				<em>
					should 
				</em>
				not speak.  See

				Preventing foolish (rather than compelled) confessions is likewise the only conceivable basis for the rules (suggested in 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, see 384 U. S., at 444445, 473474), that courts must exclude any confession elicited by questioning conducted, without interruption, after the suspect has indicated a desire to stand on his right to remain silent, see 
				<em>
					Michigan

				 v.

				<em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">484</a>485 (1981)
.  Nonthreatening attempts to persuade the suspect to reconsider that initial decision are not, without more, enough to render a change of heart the product of anything other than the suspects free will.  Thus, what is most remarkable about the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 decisionand what made it unacceptable as a matter of straightforward constitutional interpretation in the 
				<em>
					Marbury
				</em>
				 traditionis its palpable hostility toward the act of confession 
				<em>
					per se
				</em>
				, rather than toward what the Constitution abhors, 
				<em>
					compelled

				 confession.  See 
				<em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">187</a> (1977)
 ([F]ar from being prohibited by the Constitution, admissions of guilt by wrongdoers, if not coerced, are inherently desirable).  The Constitution is not, unlike the

				For these reasons, and others more than adequately developed in the

				that a violation of the

				As the Court today acknowledges, since

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>, but rather only prophylactic rules that go beyond the right against compelled self-incrimination.  Of course the seeds of this prophylactic interpretation of

				<em>

				 at 10; and that it announced a constitutional rule, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 7, 9, 11, 14.  It is fine to play these word games; but what makes a decision constitutional in the only sense relevant herein the sense that renders it impervious to supersession by congressional legislation such as §3501is the determination that the Constitution 
				<em>
					requires
				</em>
				 the result that the decision announces and the statute ignores.  By disregarding congressional action that concededly does not violate the Constitution, the Court flagrantly offends fundamental principles of separation of powers, and arrogates to itself prerogatives reserved to the representatives of the people.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court seeks to avoid this conclusion in two ways: First, by misdescribing these post-
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 cases as mere dicta.  The Court concedes only that there is language in some of our opinions that supports the view that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s protections are not constitutionally required.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 8.  It is not a matter of 
				<em>
					language
				</em>
				; it is a matter of 
				<em>
					holdings
				</em>
				.  The proposition that failure to comply with 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s rules does not establish a constitutional
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				violation was central to the 
				<em>
					holdings
				</em>
				 of 
				<em>
					Tucker
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Hass
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Quarles
				</em>
				, and Elstad.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The second way the Court seeks to avoid the impact of these cases is simply to disclaim responsibility for reasoned decisionmaking.  It says:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				These decisions illustrate the principlenot that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is not a constitutional rulebut that no constitutional rule is immutable.  No court laying down a general rule can possibly foresee the various circumstances in which counsel will seek to apply it, and the sort of modifications represented by these cases are as much a normal part of constitutional law as the original decision.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 11.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
The issue, however, is not whether court rules are mutable; they assuredly are.  It is not whether, in the light of various circumstances, they can be modifi[ed]; they assuredly can.  The issue is whether, 
				<em>
					as mutated and modified
				</em>
				, they must 
				<em>
					make sense
				</em>
				.  The requirement that they do so is the only thing that prevents this Court from being some sort of nine-headed Caesar, giving thumbs-up or thumbs-down to whatever outcome, case by case, suits or offends its collective fancy.  And if confessions procured in violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 are confessions compelled in violation of the Constitution, the post-
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 decisions I have discussed do not make sense.  The only reasoned basis for their outcome was that a violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 a violation of the Constitution.  If, for example, as the Court acknowledges was the holding of 
				<em>
					Elstad
				</em>
				, the traditional fruits doctrine developed in 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> cases (that the fruits of evidence obtained unconstitutionally must be excluded from trial) does 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 apply to the fruits of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 violations, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 11; and if the reason for the difference is 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 violations are not constitutional violations (which is plainly and flatly what 
				<em>
					Elstad
				</em>
				 said); then the Court must come up with some 
				<em>
					other
				</em>
				 explanation for the difference.  (That will take quite a bit of doing, by the way, since it is 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 clear on the face of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> that evidence obtained in violation of that guarantee must be excluded from trial, whereas it 
				<em>
					is
				</em>
				 clear on the face of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> that unconstitutionally compelled confessions cannot be used.)  To say simply that unreasonable searches under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> are different from unwarned interrogation under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a>, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1112, is true but supremely unhelpful.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Finally, the Court asserts that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 must be a constitutional decision announcing a constitutional rule, and thus immune to congressional modification, because we have since its inception applied it to the States.  If this argument is meant as an invocation of 
				<em>
					stare decisis
				</em>
				, it fails because, though it is true that our cases applying 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 against the States must be reconsidered if 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is not required by the Constitution, it is likewise true that our cases (discussed above) based on the principle that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is
				<em>
					 not
				</em>
				 required by the Constitution will have to be reconsidered if it 
				<em>
					is
				</em>
				.  So the 
				<em>
					stare decisis
				</em>
				 argument is a wash.  If, on the other hand, the argument is meant as an appeal to logic rather than 
				<em>
					stare decisis
				</em>
				, it is a classic example of begging the question: Congresss attempt to set aside 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, since it represents an assertion that violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is not a violation of the Constitution, 
				<em>
					also
				</em>
				 represents an assertion that the Court has no power to impose 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 on the States.  To answer this assertionnot by showing why violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
            <em>
					is
				</em>
				 a violation of the Constitutionbut by asserting that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
            <em>
					does
				</em>
				 apply against the States, is to assume precisely the point at issue.  In my view, our continued application of the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 code to the States despite our consistent statements that running afoul of its dictates does not necessarilyor even usuallyresult in an actual constitutional violation, represents not the source of  
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s salvation but rather evidence of its ultimate illegitimacy.  See generally J. Grano, Confessions, Truth, and the Law 173198 (1993); Grano, Prophylactic Rules in Criminal Procedure: A Question of Article III Legitimacy, 80 Nw. U. L. Rev. 100 (1985).  As 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice
				</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">
					Stevens 
				</span>
				has elsewhere explained, [t]his Courts power to require state courts to exclude probative self-incriminatory statements rests entirely on the premise that the use of such evidence violates the Federal Constitution. … If the Court does not accept that premise, it must regard the holding in the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 case itself, as well as all of the federal jurisprudence that has evolved from that decision, as nothing
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				more than an illegitimate exercise of raw judicial power.

				There was available to the Court a means of reconciling the established proposition that a violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 does not itself offend the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> with the Courts assertion of a right to ignore the present statute.  That means of reconciliation was argued strenuously by both petitioner and the United States, who were evidently more concerned than the Court is with maintaining the coherence of our jurisprudence.  It is not mentioned in the Courts opinion because, I assume, a majority of the Justices intent on reversing believes that incoherence is the lesser evil.  They may be right.

				Petitioner and the United States contend that there is nothing at all exceptional, much less unconstitutional, about the Courts adopting prophylactic rules to buttress constitutional rights, and enforcing them against Congress and the States.  Indeed, the United States argues that [p]rophylactic rules are now and have been for many years a feature of this Courts constitutional adjudication.  Brief for United States 47.  That statement is not wholly inaccurate, if by many years one means since the mid-1960s.  However, in their zeal to validate what is in my view a lawless practice, the United States and petitioner greatly overstate the frequency with which we have engaged in it.  For instance, petitioner cites several cases in which the Court quite simply exercised its traditional judicial power to define the scope of constitutional protections and, relatedly, the circumstances in which they are violated.

That decision was based, not upon the theory that this was desirable protection beyond what the Confrontation Clause technically required; but rather upon the self-evident proposition that the inability to cross-examine an available witness whose damaging out-of-court testimony is introduced violates the Confrontation Clause, combined with the conclusion that in these circumstances a mere jury instruction can never be relied upon to prevent the testimony from being damaging, see

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/395/711" class="subref" title="subref">395 U. S. 711</a> (1969)
.  There, the Court concluded that due process would be offended were a judge vindictively to resentence with added severity a defendant who had successfully appealed his original conviction.  Rather than simply announce that vindictive sentencing violates the Due Process Clause, the Court went on to hold that [i]n order to assure the absence of such a [vindictive] motivation, … the reasons for [imposing the increased sentence] must affirmatively appear and must be based upon objective information concerning identifiable conduct on the part of the defendant occurring after the time of the original sentencing proceeding.

				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 when deprived (as it has been) of its original (implausible) pretension to announcement of what the Constitution itself required.  That is, although the Due Process Clause may well prohibit punishment based on judicial vindictiveness, the Constitution by no means vests in the courts any general power to prescribe particular devices in order to assure the absence of such a motivation,  395 U. S., at 741 (Black, J., dissenting).  Justice Black surely had the right idea when he derided the Courts requirement as pure legislation if there ever was legislation,

				The foregoing demonstrates that, petitioners and the United States suggestions to the contrary notwithstanding, what the Court did in 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				(assuming, as later cases hold, that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 went beyond what the Constitution actually requires) is in fact extraordinary.  That the Court has, on rare and recent occasion, repeated the mistake does not transform error into truth, but illustrates the potential for future mischief that the error entails.  Where the Constitution has wished to lodge in one of the branches of the Federal Government some limited power to supplement its guarantees, it has said so.  See Amdt. 14, §5 (The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article).  The power with which the Court would endow itself under a prophylactic justification for 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 goes far beyond what it has permitted Congress to do under authority of that text.  Whereas we have insisted that congressional action under §5 of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a> must be congruent with, and proportional to, a 
				<em>
					constitutional violation

				, see 
				<em>
					City of Boerne

				<em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">520</a> (1997)
, the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 nontextual power to embellish confers authority to prescribe preventive measures against not only constitutionally prohibited compelled confessions, but also (as discussed earlier) foolhardy ones.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I applaud, therefore, the refusal of the Justices in the majority to enunciate this boundless doctrine of judicial empowerment as a means of rendering todays decision rational.  In nonetheless joining the Courts judgment, however, they overlook two truisms: that actions speak louder than silence, and that (in judge-made law at least) logic will out.  Since there is in fact no other principle that can reconcile todays judgment with the post-
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 cases that the Court refuses to abandon, what todays decision will stand for, whether the Justices can bring themselves to say it or not, is the power of the Supreme Court to write a prophylactic, extraconstitutional Constitution, binding on Congress and the States.

				Thus, while I agree with the Court that §3501 cannot be upheld without also concluding that

The task of determining whether a defendant is in custody has proved to be a slippery one.  And the supposedly bright lines that separate interrogation from spontaneous declaration, the exercise of a right from waiver, and the adequate warning from the inadequate, likewise have turned out to be rather dim and ill defined.  The totality-of-the-circumstances approach, on the other hand, permits each fact to be taken into account without resort to formal and dispositive labels.  By dispensing with the difficulty of producing a yes-or-no answer to questions that are often better answered in shades and degrees,

As far as I am aware, the public is not under the illusion that we are infallible.  I see little harm in admitting that we made a mistake in taking away from the people the ability to decide for themselves what protections (beyond those required by the Constitution) are reasonably affordable in the criminal investigatory process.  And I see much to be gained by reaffirming for the people the wonderful reality that they govern themselveswhich means that [t]he powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution that the people adopted, nor prohibited … to the States by that Constitution, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people, U.

				Todays judgment converts

In Mitchell, moreover, the constitutional underpinnings of the earlier rule had not been demolished by subsequent cases.

				Those to whom judicial decisions are an unconnected series of judgments that produce either favored or disfavored results will doubtless greet todays decision as a paragon of moderation, since it declines to overrule

				<em>
					Miranda

				, but a radical revision of the most significant element of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 (as of all cases): the rationale that gives it a permanent place in our jurisprudence.

        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>
					Marbury
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Madison
				</em>
				, 1 Cranch 137 (1803), held that an Act of Congress will not be enforced by the courts if what it prescribes violates the Constitution of the United States.  That was the basis on which 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 was decided.  One will search todays opinion in vain, however, for a statement (surely simple enough to make) that what 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/3501.html" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. §3501</a> prescribesthe use at trial of a voluntary confession, even when a 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warning or its equivalent has failed to be givenviolates the Constitution.  The reason the statement does not appear is not only (and perhaps not so much) that it would be absurd, inasmuch as §3501 excludes from trial precisely what the Constitution excludes from trial, viz., compelled confessions; but also that Justices whose votes are needed to compose todays majority are on record as believing that a violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 a violation of the Constitution.  See 
				<em>
					Davis
				</em>
				 v.

				<em>
					new
				</em>
				, if not entirely comprehensible, principle of constitutional law.  As the Court chooses to describe that principle, statutes of Congress can be disregarded, not only when what they prescribe violates the Constitution, but when what they prescribe contradicts a decision of this Court that announced a constitutional rule, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 7.  As I shall discuss in some detail, the only thing that can possibly mean in the context of this case is that this Court has the power, not merely to apply the Constitution but to expand it, imposing what it regards as useful prophylactic restrictions upon Congress and the States.  That is an immense and frightening antidemocratic power, and it does not exist.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It takes only a small step to bring todays opinion out of the realm of power-judging and into the mainstream of legal reasoning: The Court need only go beyond its carefully couched iterations that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is a constitutional decision, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 8, that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is constitutionally based, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 10, that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 has constitutional underpinnings, 
				<em>
					ante, 
				</em>
				at 10, n. 5, and come out and say quite clearly: We reaffirm today that custodial interrogation that is not preceded by 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings or their equivalent violates the Constitution of the United States.  It cannot say that, because a majority of the Court does not believe it.  The Court therefore acts in plain violation of the Constitution when it denies effect to this Act of Congress.

        <p class="bodytext">
				So if a law be in opposition to the constitution; if both the law and the constitution apply to a particular case, so that the court must either decide that case conformably to the law, disregarding the constitution; or conformably to the constitution, disregarding the law; the court must determine which of these conflicting rules governs the case.

The power we recognized in

				 will thus permit us, indeed require us, to disregar[d] §3501, a duly enacted statute governing the admissibility of evidence in the federal courts, only if it be in opposition to the constitutionhere, assertedly, the dictates of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a>.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It was once possible to characterize the so-called 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 rule as resting (however implausibly) upon the proposition that what the statute here before us permits
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				the admission at trial of un-
				<em>
					Mirandized
				</em>
				 confessions
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				violates the Constitution.  That is the fairest reading of the 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				case itself.  The Court began by announcing that the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> privilege against self-incrimination applied in the context of extrajudicial custodial interrogation, see 384 U. S., at 460467itself a doubtful proposition as a matter both of history and precedent, see 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at, at 510511 (Harlan, J., dissenting) (characterizing the Courts conclusion that the Fifth
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				Amendment privilege, rather than the Due Process
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				Clause, governed stationhouse confessions as a 
				<em>
					trompe loeil
				</em>
				).  Having extended the privilege into the confines of the station house, the Court liberally sprinkled throughout its sprawling 60-page opinion suggestions that, because of the compulsion inherent in custodial interrogation, the privilege was violated by any statement thus obtained that did not conform to the rules set forth in 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, or some functional equivalent.  See 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 458 (Unless adequate protective devices are employed to dispel the compulsion 
				<em>
					inherent
				</em>
				 in custodial surroundings, 
				<em>
					no
				</em>
				 statement obtained from the defendant can truly be the product of his free choice) (emphases added); 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 461 (An individual swept from familiar surroundings into police custody, surrounded by antagonistic forces, and subjected to the techniques of persuasion described above cannot be otherwise than under compulsion to speak); 
				<em>

				So understood,

				 was objectionable for innumerable reasons, not least the fact that cases spanning more than 70 years had rejected its core premise that, absent the warnings and an effective waiver of the right to remain silent and of the (thitherto unknown) right to have an attorney present, a statement obtained pursuant to custodial interrogation was necessarily the product of compulsion.

				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, if read as an explication of what the Constitution 
				<em>
					requires
				</em>
				, is preposterous.  There is, for example, simply no basis in reason for concluding that a response to the very first question asked, by a suspect who already 
				<em>
					knows
				</em>
				 all of the rights described in the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warning, is anything other than a volitional act.  See 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra, 
				</em>
				at 533534 (White, J., dissenting).  And even if one assumes that the elimination of compulsion absolutely requires informing even the most knowledgeable suspect of his right to remain silent, it cannot conceivably require the right to have 
				<em>
					counsel
				</em>
				 present.  There is a world of difference, which the Court recognized under the traditional voluntariness test but ignored in 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, between compelling a suspect to incriminate himself and preventing him from foolishly doing so of his own accord.  Only the latter (which is 
				<em>
					not 
				</em>
				required by the Constitution) could explain the Courts inclusion of a right to counsel and the requirement that it, too, be knowingly and intelligently waived.  Counsels presence is not required to tell the suspect that he 
				<em>
					need 
				</em>
				not speak; the interrogators can do that.  The only good reason for having counsel there is that he can be counted on to advise the suspect that he 
				<em>
					should 
				</em>
				not speak.  See

				Preventing foolish (rather than compelled) confessions is likewise the only conceivable basis for the rules (suggested in 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, see 384 U. S., at 444445, 473474), that courts must exclude any confession elicited by questioning conducted, without interruption, after the suspect has indicated a desire to stand on his right to remain silent, see 
				<em>
					Michigan
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Mosley,

				<em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">484</a>485 (1981)
.  Nonthreatening attempts to persuade the suspect to reconsider that initial decision are not, without more, enough to render a change of heart the product of anything other than the suspects free will.  Thus, what is most remarkable about the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 decisionand what made it unacceptable as a matter of straightforward constitutional interpretation in the 
				<em>
					Marbury
				</em>
				 traditionis its palpable hostility toward the act of confession

				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				warningsthe police demanded to know where the gun was.  The defendant nodded in the direction of some empty cartons and responded that the gun is over there.  The Court held that both the unwarned statementthe gun is over thereand the recovered weapon were admissible in the prosecutions case in chief under a public safety exception to the prophylactic rules enunciated in

					Eagan

				, 492 U. S., at 203, it is simply no longer possible for the Court to conclude, even if it wanted to, that a violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s rules is a violation of the Constitution.  But as I explained at the outset, that is what is required before the Court may disregard a law of Congress governing the admissibility of evidence in federal court.  The Court today insists that the 
				<em>
					decision
				</em>
				 in 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is a constitutional one, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1, 8; that it has constitutional underpinnings
				<em>
					,
				</em>
            <em>
					ante, 
				</em>
				at 10, n. 5; a constitutional basis and a constitutional origin, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 9, n. 3; that it was constitutionally based, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 10; and that it announced a constitutional rule, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 7, 9, 11, 14.  It is fine to play these word games; but what makes a decision constitutional in the only sense relevant herein the sense that renders it impervious to supersession by congressional legislation such as §3501is the determination that the Constitution 
				<em>
					requires
				</em>
				 the result that the decision announces and the statute ignores.  By disregarding congressional action that concededly does not violate the Constitution, the Court flagrantly offends fundamental principles of separation of powers, and arrogates to itself prerogatives reserved to the representatives of the people.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court seeks to avoid this conclusion in two ways: First, by misdescribing these post-
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 cases as mere dicta.  The Court concedes only that there is language in some of our opinions that supports the view that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s protections are not constitutionally required.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 8.  It is not a matter of 
				<em>
					language
				</em>
				; it is a matter of 
				<em>
					holdings
				</em>
				.  The proposition that failure to comply with 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s rules does not establish a constitutional
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				violation was central to the 
				<em>
					holdings
				</em>
				 of 
				<em>
					Tucker
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Hass
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Quarles
				</em>
				, and Elstad.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The second way the Court seeks to avoid the impact of these cases is simply to disclaim responsibility for reasoned decisionmaking.  It says:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				These decisions illustrate the principlenot that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is not a constitutional rulebut that no constitutional rule is immutable.  No court laying down a general rule can possibly foresee the various circumstances in which counsel will seek to apply it, and the sort of modifications represented by these cases are as much a normal part of constitutional law as the original decision.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 11.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
The issue, however, is not whether court rules are mutable; they assuredly are.  It is not whether, in the light of various circumstances, they can be modifi[ed]; they assuredly can.  The issue is whether, 
				<em>
					as mutated and modified
				</em>
				, they must 
				<em>
					make sense
				</em>
				.  The requirement that they do so is the only thing that prevents this Court from being some sort of nine-headed Caesar, giving thumbs-up or thumbs-down to whatever outcome, case by case, suits or offends its collective fancy.  And if confessions procured in violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 are confessions compelled in violation of the Constitution, the post-
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 decisions I have discussed do not make sense.  The only reasoned basis for their outcome was that a violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 a violation of the Constitution.  If, for example, as the Court acknowledges was the holding of 
				<em>
					Elstad
				</em>
				, the traditional fruits doctrine developed in 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> cases (that the fruits of evidence obtained unconstitutionally must be excluded from trial) does 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 apply to the fruits of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 violations, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 11; and if the reason for the difference is 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 violations are not constitutional violations (which is plainly and flatly what 
				<em>
					Elstad
				</em>
				 said); then the Court must come up with some 
				<em>
					other
				</em>
				 explanation for the difference.  (That will take quite a bit of doing, by the way, since it is 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 clear on the face of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> that evidence obtained in violation of that guarantee must be excluded from trial, whereas it 
				<em>
					is
				</em>
				 clear on the face of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> that unconstitutionally compelled confessions cannot be used.)  To say simply that unreasonable searches under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> are different from unwarned interrogation under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a>, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1112, is true but supremely unhelpful.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Finally, the Court asserts that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 must be a constitutional decision announcing a constitutional rule, and thus immune to congressional modification, because we have since its inception applied it to the States.  If this argument is meant as an invocation of 
				<em>
					stare decisis
				</em>
				, it fails because, though it is true that our cases applying 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 against the States must be reconsidered if 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is not required by the Constitution, it is likewise true that our cases (discussed above) based on the principle that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is
				<em>
					 not
				</em>
				 required by the Constitution will have to be reconsidered if it 
				<em>
					is
				</em>
				.  So the 
				<em>
					stare decisis
				</em>
				 argument is a wash.  If, on the other hand, the argument is meant as an appeal to logic rather than 
				<em>
					stare decisis
				</em>
				, it is a classic example of begging the question: Congresss attempt to set aside 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, since it represents an assertion that violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is not a violation of the Constitution, 
				<em>
					also
				</em>
				 represents an assertion that the Court has no power to impose 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 on the States.  To answer this assertionnot by showing why violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
            <em>
					is
				</em>
				 a violation of the Constitutionbut by asserting that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
            <em>
					does
				</em>
				 apply against the States, is to assume precisely the point at issue.  In my view, our continued application of the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 code to the States despite our consistent statements that running afoul of its dictates does not necessarilyor even usuallyresult in an actual constitutional violation, represents not the source of  
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s salvation but rather evidence of its ultimate illegitimacy.  See generally J. Grano, Confessions, Truth, and the Law 173198 (1993); Grano, Prophylactic Rules in Criminal Procedure: A Question of Article III Legitimacy, 80 Nw. U. L. Rev. 100 (1985).  As 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice
				</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">
					Stevens 
				</span>
				has elsewhere explained, [t]his Courts power to require state courts to exclude probative self-incriminatory statements rests entirely on the premise that the use of such evidence violates the Federal Constitution. … If the Court does not accept that premise, it must regard the holding in the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 case itself, as well as all of the federal jurisprudence that has evolved from that decision, as nothing
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				more than an illegitimate exercise of raw judicial power.

				There was available to the Court a means of reconciling the established proposition that a violation of

				</em>
				 does not itself offend the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> with the Courts assertion of a right to ignore the present statute.  That means of reconciliation was argued strenuously by both petitioner and the United States, who were evidently more concerned than the Court is with maintaining the coherence of our jurisprudence.  It is not mentioned in the Courts opinion because, I assume, a majority of the Justices intent on reversing believes that incoherence is the lesser evil.  They may be right.

				Petitioner and the United States contend that there is nothing at all exceptional, much less unconstitutional, about the Courts adopting prophylactic rules to buttress constitutional rights, and enforcing them against Congress and the States.  Indeed, the United States argues that [p]rophylactic rules are now and have been for many years a feature of this Courts constitutional adjudication.  Brief for United States 47.  That statement is not wholly inaccurate, if by many years one means since the mid-1960s.  However, in their zeal to validate what is in my view a lawless practice, the United States and petitioner greatly overstate the frequency with which we have engaged in it.  For instance, petitioner cites several cases in which the Court quite simply exercised its traditional judicial power to define the scope of constitutional protections and, relatedly, the circumstances in which they are violated.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/395/711" class="subref" title="subref">395 U. S. 711</a> (1969)
.  There, the Court concluded that due process would be offended were a judge vindictively to resentence with added severity a defendant who had successfully appealed his original conviction.  Rather than simply announce that vindictive sentencing violates the Due Process Clause, the Court went on to hold that [i]n order to assure the absence of such a [vindictive] motivation, … the reasons for [imposing the increased sentence] must affirmatively appear and must be based upon objective information concerning identifiable conduct on the part of the defendant occurring after the time of the original sentencing proceeding.

				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 when deprived (as it has been) of its original (implausible) pretension to announcement of what the Constitution itself required.  That is, although the Due Process Clause may well prohibit punishment based on judicial vindictiveness, the Constitution by no means vests in the courts any general power to prescribe particular devices in order to assure the absence of such a motivation,  395 U. S., at 741 (Black, J., dissenting).  Justice Black surely had the right idea when he derided the Courts requirement as pure legislation if there ever was legislation,

				The foregoing demonstrates that, petitioners and the United States suggestions to the contrary notwithstanding, what the Court did in 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				(assuming, as later cases hold, that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 went beyond what the Constitution actually requires) is in fact extraordinary.  That the Court has, on rare and recent occasion, repeated the mistake does not transform error into truth, but illustrates the potential for future mischief that the error entails.  Where the Constitution has wished to lodge in one of the branches of the Federal Government some limited power to supplement its guarantees, it has said so.  See Amdt. 14, §5 (The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article).  The power with which the Court would endow itself under a prophylactic justification for 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 goes far beyond what it has permitted Congress to do under authority of that text.  Whereas we have insisted that congressional action under §5 of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a> must be congruent with, and proportional to, a 
				<em>
					constitutional violation
				</em>
				, see 
				<em>
					City of Boerne
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Flores,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">520</a> (1997)
, the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 nontextual power to embellish confers authority to prescribe preventive measures against not only constitutionally prohibited compelled confessions, but also (as discussed earlier) foolhardy ones.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I applaud, therefore, the refusal of the Justices in the majority to enunciate this boundless doctrine of judicial empowerment as a means of rendering todays decision rational.  In nonetheless joining the Courts judgment, however, they overlook two truisms: that actions speak louder than silence, and that (in judge-made law at least) logic will out.  Since there is in fact no other principle that can reconcile todays judgment with the post-
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 cases that the Court refuses to abandon, what todays decision will stand for, whether the Justices can bring themselves to say it or not, is the power of the Supreme Court to write a prophylactic, extraconstitutional Constitution, binding on Congress and the States.

				Thus, while I agree with the Court that §3501 cannot be upheld without also concluding that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 represents an illegitimate exercise of our authority to review state-court judgments, I do not share the Courts hesitation in reaching that conclusion.  For while the Court is also correct that the doctrine of 
				<em>

				</em>
				 demands some special justification for a departure from longstanding precedenteven precedent of the constitutional variety
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				that criterion is more than met here.  To repeat

        <p class="bodytext">
				In cases where statutory precedents have been overruled, the primary reason for the Courts shift in position has been the intervening development of the law, through either the growth of judicial doctrine or further action taken by Congress.

				Neither am I persuaded by the argument for retaining 
				<em>

				</em>
				that touts its supposed workability as compared with the totality-of-the-circumstances test it purported to replace.  
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s proponents cite 
				<em>

				<em>

				.  It is not immediately apparent, however, that the judicial burden has been eased by the bright-line rules adopted in 
				<em>

				.  In fact, in the 34 years since 
				<em>
					Miranda

				Moreover, it is not clear why the Court thinks that the totality-of-the-circumstances test … is more difficult than

				 creates as many close questions as it resolves.  The task of determining whether a defendant is in custody has proved to be a slippery one.  And the supposedly bright lines that separate interrogation from spontaneous declaration, the exercise of a right from waiver, and the adequate warning from the inadequate, likewise have turned out to be rather dim and ill defined.  The totality-of-the-circumstances approach, on the other hand, permits each fact to be taken into account without resort to formal and dispositive labels.  By dispensing with the difficulty of producing a yes-or-no answer to questions that are often better answered in shades and degrees, 
				<em>
					the voluntariness inquiry often can make judicial decisionmaking easier rather than more onerous

				But even were I to agree that the old totality-of-the-circumstances test was more cumbersome, it is simply not true that

				 has banished it from the law and replaced it with a new test.  Under the current regime, which the Court today retains in its entirety, courts are frequently called upon to undertake 
				<em>

				Finally, I am not convinced by petitioners argument that

As far as I am aware, the public is not under the illusion that we are infallible.  I see little harm in admitting that we made a mistake in taking away from the people the ability to decide for themselves what protections (beyond those required by the Constitution) are reasonably affordable in the criminal investigatory process.  And I see much to be gained by reaffirming for the people the wonderful reality that they govern themselveswhich means that [t]he powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution that the people adopted, nor prohibited … to the States by that Constitution, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people, U.

In Mitchell, moreover, the constitutional underpinnings of the earlier rule had not been demolished by subsequent cases.

The reason the statement does not appear is not only (and perhaps not so much) that it would be absurd, inasmuch as §3501 excludes from trial precisely what the Constitution excludes from trial, viz., compelled confessions; but also that Justices whose votes are needed to compose todays majority are on record as believing that a violation of

				, if not entirely comprehensible, principle of constitutional law.  As the Court chooses to describe that principle, statutes of Congress can be disregarded, not only when what they prescribe violates the Constitution, but when what they prescribe contradicts a decision of this Court that announced a constitutional rule, 
				<em>

				</em>
				, at 7.  As I shall discuss in some detail, the only thing that can possibly mean in the context of this case is that this Court has the power, not merely to apply the Constitution but to expand it, imposing what it regards as useful prophylactic restrictions upon Congress and the States.  That is an immense and frightening antidemocratic power, and it does not exist.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It takes only a small step to bring todays opinion out of the realm of power-judging and into the mainstream of legal reasoning: The Court need only go beyond its carefully couched iterations that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is a constitutional decision, 
				<em>

				</em>
				, at 8, that 
				<em>

				 has constitutional underpinnings,

				</em>
				at 10, n. 5, and come out and say quite clearly: We reaffirm today that custodial interrogation that is not preceded by 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings or their equivalent violates the Constitution of the United States.  It cannot say that, because a majority of the Court does not believe it.  The Court therefore acts in plain violation of the Constitution when it denies effect to this Act of Congress.

				It was once possible to characterize the so-called

				 rule as resting (however implausibly) upon the proposition that what the statute here before us permits
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				the admission at trial of un-
				<em>
					Mirandized
				</em>
				 confessions
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				violates the Constitution.  That is the fairest reading of the 
				<em>

				case itself.  The Court began by announcing that the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> privilege against self-incrimination applied in the context of extrajudicial custodial interrogation, see 384 U. S., at 460467itself a doubtful proposition as a matter both of history and precedent, see

				Amendment privilege, rather than the Due Process
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				Clause, governed stationhouse confessions as a 
				<em>
					trompe loeil
				</em>
				).  Having extended the privilege into the confines of the station house, the Court liberally sprinkled throughout its sprawling 60-page opinion suggestions that, because of the compulsion inherent in custodial interrogation, the privilege was violated by any statement thus obtained that did not conform to the rules set forth in 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, or some functional equivalent.  See 
				<em>

				</em>
				at 458 (Unless adequate protective devices are employed to dispel the compulsion

				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, if read as an explication of what the Constitution 
				<em>
					requires
				</em>
				, is preposterous.  There is, for example, simply no basis in reason for concluding that a response to the very first question asked, by a suspect who already 
				<em>
					knows
				</em>
				 all of the rights described in the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warning, is anything other than a volitional act.  See 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra, 
				</em>
				at 533534 (White, J., dissenting).  And even if one assumes that the elimination of compulsion absolutely requires informing even the most knowledgeable suspect of his right to remain silent, it cannot conceivably require the right to have 
				<em>
					counsel
				</em>
				 present.  There is a world of difference, which the Court recognized under the traditional voluntariness test but ignored in 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, between compelling a suspect to incriminate himself and preventing him from foolishly doing so of his own accord.  Only the latter (which is 
				<em>
					not 
				</em>
				required by the Constitution) could explain the Courts inclusion of a right to counsel and the requirement that it, too, be knowingly and intelligently waived.  Counsels presence is not required to tell the suspect that he 
				<em>
					need 
				</em>
				not speak; the interrogators can do that.  The only good reason for having counsel there is that he can be counted on to advise the suspect that he 
				<em>
					should 
				</em>
				not speak.  See

				Preventing foolish (rather than compelled) confessions is likewise the only conceivable basis for the rules (suggested in 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, see 384 U. S., at 444445, 473474), that courts must exclude any confession elicited by questioning conducted, without interruption, after the suspect has indicated a desire to stand on his right to remain silent, see 
				<em>
					Michigan

				 v.

				<em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">484</a>485 (1981)
.  Nonthreatening attempts to persuade the suspect to reconsider that initial decision are not, without more, enough to render a change of heart the product of anything other than the suspects free will.  Thus, what is most remarkable about the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 decisionand what made it unacceptable as a matter of straightforward constitutional interpretation in the 
				<em>
					Marbury
				</em>
				 traditionis its palpable hostility toward the act of confession 
				<em>
					per se
				</em>
				, rather than toward what the Constitution abhors, 
				<em>
					compelled

				 confession.  See 
				<em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">187</a> (1977)
 ([F]ar from being prohibited by the Constitution, admissions of guilt by wrongdoers, if not coerced, are inherently desirable).  The Constitution is not, unlike the 
				<em>

				For these reasons, and others more than adequately developed in the

				that a violation of the

				<em>

				</em>
				 amounts to a violation of the privilege against compelled self-incrimination can claim no support in history, precedent, or common sense, and as a result would at least presumptively be worth reconsidering even at this late date.  But that is unnecessary, since the Court has (thankfully) long since abandoned the notion that failure to comply with

				As the Court today acknowledges, since

				 we have explicitly, and repeatedly, interpreted that decision as having announced, not the circumstances in which custodial interrogation runs afoul of the Fifth or 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>, but rather only prophylactic rules that go beyond the right against compelled self-incrimination.  Of course the seeds of this prophylactic interpretation of

				<em>
					Eagan
				</em>
				, 492 U. S., at 203, it is simply no longer possible for the Court to conclude, even if it wanted to, that a violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s rules is a violation of the Constitution.  But as I explained at the outset, that is what is required before the Court may disregard a law of Congress governing the admissibility of evidence in federal court.  The Court today insists that the 
				<em>
					decision
				</em>
				 in 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is a constitutional one, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1, 8; that it has constitutional underpinnings
				<em>
					,
				</em>
            <em>
					ante, 
				</em>
				at 10, n. 5; a constitutional basis and a constitutional origin, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 9, n. 3; that it was constitutionally based, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 10; and that it announced a constitutional rule, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 7, 9, 11, 14.  It is fine to play these word games; but what makes a decision constitutional in the only sense relevant herein the sense that renders it impervious to supersession by congressional legislation such as §3501is the determination that the Constitution 
				<em>
					requires
				</em>
				 the result that the decision announces and the statute ignores.  By disregarding congressional action that concededly does not violate the Constitution, the Court flagrantly offends fundamental principles of separation of powers, and arrogates to itself prerogatives reserved to the representatives of the people.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court seeks to avoid this conclusion in two ways: First, by misdescribing these post-
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 cases as mere dicta.  The Court concedes only that there is language in some of our opinions that supports the view that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s protections are not constitutionally required.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 8.  It is not a matter of 
				<em>
					language
				</em>
				; it is a matter of 
				<em>
					holdings
				</em>
				.  The proposition that failure to comply with 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s rules does not establish a constitutional
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				violation was central to the 
				<em>
					holdings
				</em>
				 of 
				<em>
					Tucker
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Hass
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Quarles
				</em>
				, and Elstad.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The second way the Court seeks to avoid the impact of these cases is simply to disclaim responsibility for reasoned decisionmaking.  It says:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				These decisions illustrate the principlenot that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is not a constitutional rulebut that no constitutional rule is immutable.  No court laying down a general rule can possibly foresee the various circumstances in which counsel will seek to apply it, and the sort of modifications represented by these cases are as much a normal part of constitutional law as the original decision.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 11.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
The issue, however, is not whether court rules are mutable; they assuredly are.  It is not whether, in the light of various circumstances, they can be modifi[ed]; they assuredly can.  The issue is whether, 
				<em>
					as mutated and modified
				</em>
				, they must 
				<em>
					make sense
				</em>
				.  The requirement that they do so is the only thing that prevents this Court from being some sort of nine-headed Caesar, giving thumbs-up or thumbs-down to whatever outcome, case by case, suits or offends its collective fancy.  And if confessions procured in violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 are confessions compelled in violation of the Constitution, the post-
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 decisions I have discussed do not make sense.  The only reasoned basis for their outcome was that a violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 a violation of the Constitution.  If, for example, as the Court acknowledges was the holding of 
				<em>
					Elstad
				</em>
				, the traditional fruits doctrine developed in 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> cases (that the fruits of evidence obtained unconstitutionally must be excluded from trial) does 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 apply to the fruits of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 violations, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 11; and if the reason for the difference is 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 violations are not constitutional violations (which is plainly and flatly what 
				<em>
					Elstad
				</em>
				 said); then the Court must come up with some 
				<em>
					other
				</em>
				 explanation for the difference.  (That will take quite a bit of doing, by the way, since it is 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 clear on the face of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> that evidence obtained in violation of that guarantee must be excluded from trial, whereas it 
				<em>
					is
				</em>
				 clear on the face of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> that unconstitutionally compelled confessions cannot be used.)  To say simply that unreasonable searches under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> are different from unwarned interrogation under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a>, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1112, is true but supremely unhelpful.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Finally, the Court asserts that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 must be a constitutional decision announcing a constitutional rule, and thus immune to congressional modification, because we have since its inception applied it to the States.  If this argument is meant as an invocation of 
				<em>
					stare decisis
				</em>
				, it fails because, though it is true that our cases applying 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 against the States must be reconsidered if 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is not required by the Constitution, it is likewise true that our cases (discussed above) based on the principle that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is
				<em>
					 not
				</em>
				 required by the Constitution will have to be reconsidered if it 
				<em>
					is
				</em>
				.  So the 
				<em>
					stare decisis
				</em>
				 argument is a wash.  If, on the other hand, the argument is meant as an appeal to logic rather than 
				<em>
					stare decisis
				</em>
				, it is a classic example of begging the question: Congresss attempt to set aside 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, since it represents an assertion that violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is not a violation of the Constitution, 
				<em>
					also
				</em>
				 represents an assertion that the Court has no power to impose 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 on the States.  To answer this assertionnot by showing why violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
            <em>
					is
				</em>
				 a violation of the Constitutionbut by asserting that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
            <em>
					does
				</em>
				 apply against the States, is to assume precisely the point at issue.  In my view, our continued application of the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 code to the States despite our consistent statements that running afoul of its dictates does not necessarilyor even usuallyresult in an actual constitutional violation, represents not the source of  
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s salvation but rather evidence of its ultimate illegitimacy.  See generally J. Grano, Confessions, Truth, and the Law 173198 (1993); Grano, Prophylactic Rules in Criminal Procedure: A Question of Article III Legitimacy, 80 Nw. U. L. Rev. 100 (1985).  As 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice
				</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">
					Stevens 
				</span>
				has elsewhere explained, [t]his Courts power to require state courts to exclude probative self-incriminatory statements rests entirely on the premise that the use of such evidence violates the Federal Constitution. … If the Court does not accept that premise, it must regard the holding in the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 case itself, as well as all of the federal jurisprudence that has evolved from that decision, as nothing
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				more than an illegitimate exercise of raw judicial power.

				There was available to the Court a means of reconciling the established proposition that a violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 does not itself offend the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> with the Courts assertion of a right to ignore the present statute.  That means of reconciliation was argued strenuously by both petitioner and the United States, who were evidently more concerned than the Court is with maintaining the coherence of our jurisprudence.  It is not mentioned in the Courts opinion because, I assume, a majority of the Justices intent on reversing believes that incoherence is the lesser evil.  They may be right.

				Petitioner and the United States contend that there is nothing at all exceptional, much less unconstitutional, about the Courts adopting prophylactic rules to buttress constitutional rights, and enforcing them against Congress and the States.  Indeed, the United States argues that [p]rophylactic rules are now and have been for many years a feature of this Courts constitutional adjudication.  Brief for United States 47.  That statement is not wholly inaccurate, if by many years one means since the mid-1960s.  However, in their zeal to validate what is in my view a lawless practice, the United States and petitioner greatly overstate the frequency with which we have engaged in it.  For instance, petitioner cites several cases in which the Court quite simply exercised its traditional judicial power to define the scope of constitutional protections and, relatedly, the circumstances in which they are violated.

That decision was based, not upon the theory that this was desirable protection beyond what the Confrontation Clause technically required; but rather upon the self-evident proposition that the inability to cross-examine an available witness whose damaging out-of-court testimony is introduced violates the Confrontation Clause, combined with the conclusion that in these circumstances a mere jury instruction can never be relied upon to prevent the testimony from being damaging, see

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/395/711" class="subref" title="subref">395 U. S. 711</a> (1969)
.  There, the Court concluded that due process would be offended were a judge vindictively to resentence with added severity a defendant who had successfully appealed his original conviction.  Rather than simply announce that vindictive sentencing violates the Due Process Clause, the Court went on to hold that [i]n order to assure the absence of such a [vindictive] motivation, … the reasons for [imposing the increased sentence] must affirmatively appear and must be based upon objective information concerning identifiable conduct on the part of the defendant occurring after the time of the original sentencing proceeding.

				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 when deprived (as it has been) of its original (implausible) pretension to announcement of what the Constitution itself required.  That is, although the Due Process Clause may well prohibit punishment based on judicial vindictiveness, the Constitution by no means vests in the courts any general power to prescribe particular devices in order to assure the absence of such a motivation,  395 U.

				The foregoing demonstrates that, petitioners and the United States suggestions to the contrary notwithstanding, what the Court did in 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				(assuming, as later cases hold, that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 went beyond what the Constitution actually requires) is in fact extraordinary.  That the Court has, on rare and recent occasion, repeated the mistake does not transform error into truth, but illustrates the potential for future mischief that the error entails.  Where the Constitution has wished to lodge in one of the branches of the Federal Government some limited power to supplement its guarantees, it has said so.  See Amdt. 14, §5 (The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article).  The power with which the Court would endow itself under a prophylactic justification for 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 goes far beyond what it has permitted Congress to do under authority of that text.  Whereas we have insisted that congressional action under §5 of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a> must be congruent with, and proportional to, a 
				<em>
					constitutional violation

				, see 
				<em>
					City of Boerne
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Flores,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">520</a> (1997)
, the 
				<em>
					Miranda

				 nontextual power to embellish confers authority to prescribe preventive measures against not only constitutionally prohibited compelled confessions, but also (as discussed earlier) foolhardy ones.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I applaud, therefore, the refusal of the Justices in the majority to enunciate this boundless doctrine of judicial empowerment as a means of rendering todays decision rational.  In nonetheless joining the Courts judgment, however, they overlook two truisms: that actions speak louder than silence, and that (in judge-made law at least) logic will out.  Since there is in fact no other principle that can reconcile todays judgment with the post-
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 cases that the Court refuses to abandon, what todays decision will stand for, whether the Justices can bring themselves to say it or not, is the power of the Supreme Court to write a prophylactic, extraconstitutional Constitution, binding on Congress and the States.

				Thus, while I agree with the Court that §3501 cannot be upheld without also concluding that

				In cases where statutory precedents have been overruled, the primary reason for the Courts shift in position has been the intervening development of the law, through either the growth of judicial doctrine or further action taken by Congress.

The task of determining whether a defendant is in custody has proved to be a slippery one.  And the supposedly bright lines that separate interrogation from spontaneous declaration, the exercise of a right from waiver, and the adequate warning from the inadequate, likewise have turned out to be rather dim and ill defined.  The totality-of-the-circumstances approach, on the other hand, permits each fact to be taken into account without resort to formal and dispositive labels.  By dispensing with the difficulty of producing a yes-or-no answer to questions that are often better answered in shades and degrees,

As far as I am aware, the public is not under the illusion that we are infallible.  I see little harm in admitting that we made a mistake in taking away from the people the ability to decide for themselves what protections (beyond those required by the Constitution) are reasonably affordable in the criminal investigatory process.  And I see much to be gained by reaffirming for the people the wonderful reality that they govern themselveswhich means that [t]he powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution that the people adopted, nor prohibited … to the States by that Constitution, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people, U.

				Todays judgment converts

In Mitchell, moreover, the constitutional underpinnings of the earlier rule had not been demolished by subsequent cases.

				Those to whom judicial decisions are an unconnected series of judgments that produce either favored or disfavored results will doubtless greet todays decision as a paragon of moderation, since it declines to overrule

				<em>
					Miranda

				, but a radical revision of the most significant element of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 (as of all cases): the rationale that gives it a permanent place in our jurisprudence.

        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>
					Marbury
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Madison
				</em>
				, 1 Cranch 137 (1803), held that an Act of Congress will not be enforced by the courts if what it prescribes violates the Constitution of the United States.  That was the basis on which 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 was decided.  One will search todays opinion in vain, however, for a statement (surely simple enough to make) that what 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/3501.html" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. §3501</a> prescribesthe use at trial of a voluntary confession, even when a 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warning or its equivalent has failed to be givenviolates the Constitution.  The reason the statement does not appear is not only (and perhaps not so much) that it would be absurd, inasmuch as §3501 excludes from trial precisely what the Constitution excludes from trial, viz., compelled confessions; but also that Justices whose votes are needed to compose todays majority are on record as believing that a violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 a violation of the Constitution.  See 
				<em>
					Davis
				</em>
				 v.

				<em>
					new
				</em>
				, if not entirely comprehensible, principle of constitutional law.  As the Court chooses to describe that principle, statutes of Congress can be disregarded, not only when what they prescribe violates the Constitution, but when what they prescribe contradicts a decision of this Court that announced a constitutional rule, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 7.  As I shall discuss in some detail, the only thing that can possibly mean in the context of this case is that this Court has the power, not merely to apply the Constitution but to expand it, imposing what it regards as useful prophylactic restrictions upon Congress and the States.  That is an immense and frightening antidemocratic power, and it does not exist.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It takes only a small step to bring todays opinion out of the realm of power-judging and into the mainstream of legal reasoning: The Court need only go beyond its carefully couched iterations that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is a constitutional decision, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 8, that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is constitutionally based, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 10, that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 has constitutional underpinnings, 
				<em>
					ante, 
				</em>
				at 10, n. 5, and come out and say quite clearly: We reaffirm today that custodial interrogation that is not preceded by 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings or their equivalent violates the Constitution of the United States.  It cannot say that, because a majority of the Court does not believe it.  The Court therefore acts in plain violation of the Constitution when it denies effect to this Act of Congress.

				So if a law be in opposition to the constitution; if both the law and the constitution apply to a particular case, so that the court must either decide that case conformably to the law, disregarding the constitution; or conformably to the constitution, disregarding the law; the court must determine which of these conflicting rules governs the case.

The power we recognized in

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It was once possible to characterize the so-called 
				<em>

				</em>
				 rule as resting (however implausibly) upon the proposition that what the statute here before us permits
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				the admission at trial of un-
				<em>
					Mirandized
				</em>
				 confessions
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				violates the Constitution.  That is the fairest reading of the 
				<em>

				</em>
				case itself.  The Court began by announcing that the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> privilege against self-incrimination applied in the context of extrajudicial custodial interrogation, see 384 U. S., at 460467itself a doubtful proposition as a matter both of history and precedent, see 
				<em>
					id

				., at, at 510511 (Harlan, J., dissenting) (characterizing the Courts conclusion that the Fifth

				Amendment privilege, rather than the Due Process
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				Clause, governed stationhouse confessions as a 
				<em>
					trompe loeil
				</em>
				).  Having extended the privilege into the confines of the station house, the Court liberally sprinkled throughout its sprawling 60-page opinion suggestions that, because of the compulsion inherent in custodial interrogation, the privilege was violated by any statement thus obtained that did not conform to the rules set forth in 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, or some functional equivalent.  See 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 458 (Unless adequate protective devices are employed to dispel the compulsion 
				<em>
					inherent

				 in custodial surroundings, 
				<em>
					no
				</em>
				 statement obtained from the defendant can truly be the product of his free choice) (emphases added); 
				<em>

				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, if read as an explication of what the Constitution 
				<em>
					requires
				</em>
				, is preposterous.  There is, for example, simply no basis in reason for concluding that a response to the very first question asked, by a suspect who already 
				<em>
					knows
				</em>
				 all of the rights described in the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warning, is anything other than a volitional act.  See 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra, 
				</em>
				at 533534 (White, J., dissenting).  And even if one assumes that the elimination of compulsion absolutely requires informing even the most knowledgeable suspect of his right to remain silent, it cannot conceivably require the right to have 
				<em>
					counsel
				</em>
				 present.  There is a world of difference, which the Court recognized under the traditional voluntariness test but ignored in 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, between compelling a suspect to incriminate himself and preventing him from foolishly doing so of his own accord.  Only the latter (which is 
				<em>
					not 
				</em>
				required by the Constitution) could explain the Courts inclusion of a right to counsel and the requirement that it, too, be knowingly and intelligently waived.  Counsels presence is not required to tell the suspect that he 
				<em>
					need 
				</em>
				not speak; the interrogators can do that.  The only good reason for having counsel there is that he can be counted on to advise the suspect that he 
				<em>
					should 
				</em>
				not speak.  See

				Preventing foolish (rather than compelled) confessions is likewise the only conceivable basis for the rules (suggested in

				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 decisionand what made it unacceptable as a matter of straightforward constitutional interpretation in the 
				<em>

				As the Court today acknowledges, since

				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				warningsthe police demanded to know where the gun was.  The defendant nodded in the direction of some empty cartons and responded that the gun is over there.  The Court held that both the unwarned statementthe gun is over thereand the recovered weapon were admissible in the prosecutions case in chief under a public safety exception to the prophylactic rules enunciated in

				<em>
					Eagan
				</em>
				, 492 U. S., at 203, it is simply no longer possible for the Court to conclude, even if it wanted to, that a violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s rules is a violation of the Constitution.  But as I explained at the outset, that is what is required before the Court may disregard a law of Congress governing the admissibility of evidence in federal court.  The Court today insists that the 
				<em>
					decision
				</em>
				 in 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is a constitutional one, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1, 8; that it has constitutional underpinnings
				<em>
					,
				</em>
            <em>
					ante, 
				</em>
				at 10, n. 5; a constitutional basis and a constitutional origin, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 9, n. 3; that it was constitutionally based, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 10; and that it announced a constitutional rule, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 7, 9, 11, 14.  It is fine to play these word games; but what makes a decision constitutional in the only sense relevant herein the sense that renders it impervious to supersession by congressional legislation such as §3501is the determination that the Constitution 
				<em>
					requires
				</em>
				 the result that the decision announces and the statute ignores.  By disregarding congressional action that concededly does not violate the Constitution, the Court flagrantly offends fundamental principles of separation of powers, and arrogates to itself prerogatives reserved to the representatives of the people.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court seeks to avoid this conclusion in two ways: First, by misdescribing these post-
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 cases as mere dicta.  The Court concedes only that there is language in some of our opinions that supports the view that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s protections are not constitutionally required.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 8.  It is not a matter of 
				<em>
					language
				</em>
				; it is a matter of 
				<em>
					holdings
				</em>
				.  The proposition that failure to comply with 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s rules does not establish a constitutional
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				violation was central to the 
				<em>
					holdings
				</em>
				 of 
				<em>
					Tucker
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Hass
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Quarles
				</em>
				, and Elstad.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The second way the Court seeks to avoid the impact of these cases is simply to disclaim responsibility for reasoned decisionmaking.  It says:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				These decisions illustrate the principlenot that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is not a constitutional rulebut that no constitutional rule is immutable.  No court laying down a general rule can possibly foresee the various circumstances in which counsel will seek to apply it, and the sort of modifications represented by these cases are as much a normal part of constitutional law as the original decision.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 11.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
The issue, however, is not whether court rules are mutable; they assuredly are.  It is not whether, in the light of various circumstances, they can be modifi[ed]; they assuredly can.  The issue is whether, 
				<em>
					as mutated and modified
				</em>
				, they must 
				<em>
					make sense
				</em>
				.  The requirement that they do so is the only thing that prevents this Court from being some sort of nine-headed Caesar, giving thumbs-up or thumbs-down to whatever outcome, case by case, suits or offends its collective fancy.  And if confessions procured in violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 are confessions compelled in violation of the Constitution, the post-
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 decisions I have discussed do not make sense.  The only reasoned basis for their outcome was that a violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 a violation of the Constitution.  If, for example, as the Court acknowledges was the holding of 
				<em>
					Elstad
				</em>
				, the traditional fruits doctrine developed in 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> cases (that the fruits of evidence obtained unconstitutionally must be excluded from trial) does 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 apply to the fruits of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 violations, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 11; and if the reason for the difference is 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 violations are not constitutional violations (which is plainly and flatly what 
				<em>
					Elstad
				</em>
				 said); then the Court must come up with some 
				<em>
					other
				</em>
				 explanation for the difference.  (That will take quite a bit of doing, by the way, since it is 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 clear on the face of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> that evidence obtained in violation of that guarantee must be excluded from trial, whereas it 
				<em>
					is
				</em>
				 clear on the face of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> that unconstitutionally compelled confessions cannot be used.)  To say simply that unreasonable searches under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> are different from unwarned interrogation under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a>, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1112, is true but supremely unhelpful.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Finally, the Court asserts that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 must be a constitutional decision announcing a constitutional rule, and thus immune to congressional modification, because we have since its inception applied it to the States.  If this argument is meant as an invocation of 
				<em>
					stare decisis
				</em>
				, it fails because, though it is true that our cases applying 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 against the States must be reconsidered if 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is not required by the Constitution, it is likewise true that our cases (discussed above) based on the principle that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is
				<em>
					 not
				</em>
				 required by the Constitution will have to be reconsidered if it 
				<em>
					is
				</em>
				.  So the 
				<em>
					stare decisis
				</em>
				 argument is a wash.  If, on the other hand, the argument is meant as an appeal to logic rather than 
				<em>
					stare decisis
				</em>
				, it is a classic example of begging the question: Congresss attempt to set aside 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, since it represents an assertion that violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is not a violation of the Constitution, 
				<em>
					also
				</em>
				 represents an assertion that the Court has no power to impose 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 on the States.  To answer this assertionnot by showing why violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
            <em>
					is
				</em>
				 a violation of the Constitutionbut by asserting that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
            <em>
					does
				</em>
				 apply against the States, is to assume precisely the point at issue.  In my view, our continued application of the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 code to the States despite our consistent statements that running afoul of its dictates does not necessarilyor even usuallyresult in an actual constitutional violation, represents not the source of  
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s salvation but rather evidence of its ultimate illegitimacy.  See generally J. Grano, Confessions, Truth, and the Law 173198 (1993); Grano, Prophylactic Rules in Criminal Procedure: A Question of Article III Legitimacy, 80 Nw. U. L. Rev. 100 (1985).  As 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice
				</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">
					Stevens 
				</span>
				has elsewhere explained, [t]his Courts power to require state courts to exclude probative self-incriminatory statements rests entirely on the premise that the use of such evidence violates the Federal Constitution. … If the Court does not accept that premise, it must regard the holding in the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 case itself, as well as all of the federal jurisprudence that has evolved from that decision, as nothing
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				more than an illegitimate exercise of raw judicial power.

				There was available to the Court a means of reconciling the established proposition that a violation of 
				<em>

				</em>
				 does not itself offend the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> with the Courts assertion of a right to ignore the present statute.  That means of reconciliation was argued strenuously by both petitioner and the United States, who were evidently more concerned than the Court is with maintaining the coherence of our jurisprudence.  It is not mentioned in the Courts opinion because, I assume, a majority of the Justices intent on reversing believes that incoherence is the lesser evil.  They may be right.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Petitioner and the United States contend that there is nothing at all exceptional, much less unconstitutional, about the Courts adopting prophylactic rules to buttress constitutional rights, and enforcing them against Congress and the States.  Indeed, the United States argues that [p]rophylactic rules are now and have been for many years a feature of this Courts constitutional adjudication.  Brief for United States 47.  That statement is not wholly inaccurate, if by many years one means since the mid-1960s.  However, in their zeal to validate what is in my view a lawless practice, the United States and petitioner greatly overstate the frequency with which we have engaged in it.  For instance, petitioner cites several cases in which the Court quite simply exercised its traditional judicial power to define the scope of constitutional protections and, relatedly, the circumstances in which they are violated.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/395/711" class="subref" title="subref">395 U. S. 711</a> (1969)
.  There, the Court concluded that due process would be offended were a judge vindictively to resentence with added severity a defendant who had successfully appealed his original conviction.  Rather than simply announce that vindictive sentencing violates the Due Process Clause, the Court went on to hold that [i]n order to assure the absence of such a [vindictive] motivation, … the reasons for [imposing the increased sentence] must affirmatively appear and must be based upon objective information concerning identifiable conduct on the part of the defendant occurring after the time of the original sentencing proceeding.

				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 when deprived (as it has been) of its original (implausible) pretension to announcement of what the Constitution itself required.  That is, although the Due Process Clause may well prohibit punishment based on judicial vindictiveness, the Constitution by no means vests in the courts any general power to prescribe particular devices in order to assure the absence of such a motivation,  395 U. S., at 741 (Black, J., dissenting).  Justice Black surely had the right idea when he derided the Courts requirement as pure legislation if there ever was legislation,

				The foregoing demonstrates that, petitioners and the United States suggestions to the contrary notwithstanding, what the Court did in 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				(assuming, as later cases hold, that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 went beyond what the Constitution actually requires) is in fact extraordinary.  That the Court has, on rare and recent occasion, repeated the mistake does not transform error into truth, but illustrates the potential for future mischief that the error entails.  Where the Constitution has wished to lodge in one of the branches of the Federal Government some limited power to supplement its guarantees, it has said so.  See Amdt. 14, §5 (The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article).  The power with which the Court would endow itself under a prophylactic justification for 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 goes far beyond what it has permitted Congress to do under authority of that text.  Whereas we have insisted that congressional action under §5 of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a> must be congruent with, and proportional to, a 
				<em>
					constitutional violation
				</em>
				, see 
				<em>
					City of Boerne
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Flores,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">520</a> (1997)
, the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 nontextual power to embellish confers authority to prescribe preventive measures against not only constitutionally prohibited compelled confessions, but also (as discussed earlier) foolhardy ones.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I applaud, therefore, the refusal of the Justices in the majority to enunciate this boundless doctrine of judicial empowerment as a means of rendering todays decision rational.  In nonetheless joining the Courts judgment, however, they overlook two truisms: that actions speak louder than silence, and that (in judge-made law at least) logic will out.  Since there is in fact no other principle that can reconcile todays judgment with the post-
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 cases that the Court refuses to abandon, what todays decision will stand for, whether the Justices can bring themselves to say it or not, is the power of the Supreme Court to write a prophylactic, extraconstitutional Constitution, binding on Congress and the States.

				Thus, while I agree with the Court that §3501 cannot be upheld without also concluding that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 represents an illegitimate exercise of our authority to review state-court judgments, I do not share the Courts hesitation in reaching that conclusion.  For while the Court is also correct that the doctrine of 
				<em>

				</em>
				 demands some special justification for a departure from longstanding precedenteven precedent of the constitutional variety
				<span class="softbreak"></span>

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				In cases where statutory precedents have been overruled, the primary reason for the Courts shift in position has been the intervening development of the law, through either the growth of judicial doctrine or further action taken by Congress.

				Neither am I persuaded by the argument for retaining 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				that touts its supposed workability as compared with the totality-of-the-circumstances test it purported to replace.  
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s proponents cite 
				<em>

				 the fact that the Court was called upon to make difficult and subtle distinctions in applying the voluntariness test in some 30-odd due process coerced confessions cases in the 30 years between

				<em>

				.  It is not immediately apparent, however, that the judicial burden has been eased by the bright-line rules adopted in 
				<em>

				.  In fact, in the 34 years since 
				<em>
					Miranda

				Moreover, it is not clear why the Court thinks that the totality-of-the-circumstances test … is more difficult than

				 creates as many close questions as it resolves.  The task of determining whether a defendant is in custody has proved to be a slippery one.  And the supposedly bright lines that separate interrogation from spontaneous declaration, the exercise of a right from waiver, and the adequate warning from the inadequate, likewise have turned out to be rather dim and ill defined.  The totality-of-the-circumstances approach, on the other hand, permits each fact to be taken into account without resort to formal and dispositive labels.  By dispensing with the difficulty of producing a yes-or-no answer to questions that are often better answered in shades and degrees, 
				<em>

				But even were I to agree that the old totality-of-the-circumstances test was more cumbersome, it is simply not true that

				Finally, I am not convinced by petitioners argument that

As far as I am aware, the public is not under the illusion that we are infallible.  I see little harm in admitting that we made a mistake in taking away from the people the ability to decide for themselves what protections (beyond those required by the Constitution) are reasonably affordable in the criminal investigatory process.  And I see much to be gained by reaffirming for the people the wonderful reality that they govern themselveswhich means that [t]he powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution that the people adopted, nor prohibited … to the States by that Constitution, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people, U.

				<em>

            <em>

				 v. 
				<em>

				, 1 Cranch 137 (1803), held that an Act of Congress will not be enforced by the courts if what it prescribes violates the Constitution of the United States.  That was the basis on which 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 was decided.  One will search todays opinion in vain, however, for a statement (surely simple enough to make) that what 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/3501.html" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. §3501</a> prescribesthe use at trial of a voluntary confession, even when a

				 warning or its equivalent has failed to be givenviolates the Constitution.  The reason the statement does not appear is not only (and perhaps not so much) that it would be absurd, inasmuch as §3501 excludes from trial precisely what the Constitution excludes from trial, viz., compelled confessions; but also that Justices whose votes are needed to compose todays majority are on record as believing that a violation of 
				<em>

				 is 
				<em>

				, if not entirely comprehensible, principle of constitutional law.  As the Court chooses to describe that principle, statutes of Congress can be disregarded, not only when what they prescribe violates the Constitution, but when what they prescribe contradicts a decision of this Court that announced a constitutional rule, 
				<em>

				</em>
				, at 7.  As I shall discuss in some detail, the only thing that can possibly mean in the context of this case is that this Court has the power, not merely to apply the Constitution but to expand it, imposing what it regards as useful prophylactic restrictions upon Congress and the States.  That is an immense and frightening antidemocratic power, and it does not exist.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It takes only a small step to bring todays opinion out of the realm of power-judging and into the mainstream of legal reasoning: The Court need only go beyond its carefully couched iterations that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is a constitutional decision, 
				<em>

				</em>
				, at 8, that 
				<em>

				 has constitutional underpinnings, 
				<em>

				</em>
				at 10, n. 5, and come out and say quite clearly: We reaffirm today that custodial interrogation that is not preceded by 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings or their equivalent violates the Constitution of the United States.  It cannot say that, because a majority of the Court does not believe it.  The Court therefore acts in plain violation of the Constitution when it denies effect to this Act of Congress.

				It was once possible to characterize the so-called

				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				violates the Constitution.  That is the fairest reading of the

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> privilege against self-incrimination applied in the context of extrajudicial custodial interrogation, see 384 U. S., at 460467itself a doubtful proposition as a matter both of history and precedent, see

				).  Having extended the privilege into the confines of the station house, the Court liberally sprinkled throughout its sprawling 60-page opinion suggestions that, because of the compulsion inherent in custodial interrogation, the privilege was violated by any statement thus obtained that did not conform to the rules set forth in 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, or some functional equivalent.  See

				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, if read as an explication of what the Constitution 
				<em>
					requires
				</em>
				, is preposterous.  There is, for example, simply no basis in reason for concluding that a response to the very first question asked, by a suspect who already 
				<em>
					knows
				</em>
				 all of the rights described in the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warning, is anything other than a volitional act.  See 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra, 
				</em>
				at 533534 (White, J., dissenting).  And even if one assumes that the elimination of compulsion absolutely requires informing even the most knowledgeable suspect of his right to remain silent, it cannot conceivably require the right to have 
				<em>
					counsel
				</em>
				 present.  There is a world of difference, which the Court recognized under the traditional voluntariness test but ignored in 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, between compelling a suspect to incriminate himself and preventing him from foolishly doing so of his own accord.  Only the latter (which is 
				<em>
					not 
				</em>
				required by the Constitution) could explain the Courts inclusion of a right to counsel and the requirement that it, too, be knowingly and intelligently waived.  Counsels presence is not required to tell the suspect that he 
				<em>
					need 
				</em>
				not speak; the interrogators can do that.  The only good reason for having counsel there is that he can be counted on to advise the suspect that he 
				<em>
					should 
				</em>
				not speak.  See

				Preventing foolish (rather than compelled) confessions is likewise the only conceivable basis for the rules (suggested in 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, see 384 U. S., at 444445, 473474), that courts must exclude any confession elicited by questioning conducted, without interruption, after the suspect has indicated a desire to stand on his right to remain silent, see 
				<em>
					Michigan
				</em>
				 v.

				<em>
					Edwards

				 v.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">484</a>485 (1981)
.  Nonthreatening attempts to persuade the suspect to reconsider that initial decision are not, without more, enough to render a change of heart the product of anything other than the suspects free will.  Thus, what is most remarkable about the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 decisionand what made it unacceptable as a matter of straightforward constitutional interpretation in the 
				<em>
					Marbury
				</em>
				 traditionis its palpable hostility toward the act of confession 
				<em>
					per se
				</em>
				, rather than toward what the Constitution abhors, 
				<em>
					compelled
				</em>
				 confession.  See 
				<em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">187</a> (1977)
 ([F]ar from being prohibited by the Constitution, admissions of guilt by wrongdoers, if not coerced, are inherently desirable).  The Constitution is not, unlike the 
				<em>

				<em>

The defendant nodded in the direction of some empty cartons and responded that the gun is over there.  The Court held that both the unwarned statementthe gun is over thereand the recovered weapon were admissible in the prosecutions case in chief under a public safety exception to the prophylactic rules enunciated in 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				.  467 U. S., at 653.  It explicitly acknowledged that if the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings were an imperative of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> itself, such an exigency exception would be impossible, since the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a>s bar on compelled self-incrimination is absolute, and its  strictures, unlike the Fourths are not removed by showing reasonableness,  467 U. S., at 653, n. 3.  (For the latter reason, the Court found it necessary to note that respondent did not claim that [his] statements were actually compelled by police conduct which overcame his will to resist,

				The next year, the Court again declined to apply the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine to a

				<em>
					Eagan
				</em>
				, 492 U. S., at 203, it is simply no longer possible for the Court to conclude, even if it wanted to, that a violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s rules is a violation of the Constitution.  But as I explained at the outset, that is what is required before the Court may disregard a law of Congress governing the admissibility of evidence in federal court.  The Court today insists that the 
				<em>
					decision
				</em>
				 in 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is a constitutional one, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1, 8; that it has constitutional underpinnings
				<em>
					,
				</em>
            <em>
					ante, 
				</em>
				at 10, n. 5; a constitutional basis and a constitutional origin, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 9, n. 3; that it was constitutionally based, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 10; and that it announced a constitutional rule, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 7, 9, 11, 14.  It is fine to play these word games; but what makes a decision constitutional in the only sense relevant herein the sense that renders it impervious to supersession by congressional legislation such as §3501is the determination that the Constitution 
				<em>
					requires
				</em>
				 the result that the decision announces and the statute ignores.  By disregarding congressional action that concededly does not violate the Constitution, the Court flagrantly offends fundamental principles of separation of powers, and arrogates to itself prerogatives reserved to the representatives of the people.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court seeks to avoid this conclusion in two ways: First, by misdescribing these post-
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 cases as mere dicta.  The Court concedes only that there is language in some of our opinions that supports the view that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s protections are not constitutionally required.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 8.  It is not a matter of 
				<em>
					language
				</em>
				; it is a matter of 
				<em>
					holdings
				</em>
				.  The proposition that failure to comply with 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s rules does not establish a constitutional
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				violation was central to the 
				<em>
					holdings
				</em>
				 of 
				<em>
					Tucker
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Hass
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Quarles
				</em>
				, and Elstad.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The second way the Court seeks to avoid the impact of these cases is simply to disclaim responsibility for reasoned decisionmaking.  It says:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				These decisions illustrate the principlenot that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is not a constitutional rulebut that no constitutional rule is immutable.  No court laying down a general rule can possibly foresee the various circumstances in which counsel will seek to apply it, and the sort of modifications represented by these cases are as much a normal part of constitutional law as the original decision.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 11.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
The issue, however, is not whether court rules are mutable; they assuredly are.  It is not whether, in the light of various circumstances, they can be modifi[ed]; they assuredly can.  The issue is whether, 
				<em>
					as mutated and modified
				</em>
				, they must 
				<em>
					make sense
				</em>
				.  The requirement that they do so is the only thing that prevents this Court from being some sort of nine-headed Caesar, giving thumbs-up or thumbs-down to whatever outcome, case by case, suits or offends its collective fancy.  And if confessions procured in violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 are confessions compelled in violation of the Constitution, the post-
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 decisions I have discussed do not make sense.  The only reasoned basis for their outcome was that a violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 a violation of the Constitution.  If, for example, as the Court acknowledges was the holding of 
				<em>
					Elstad
				</em>
				, the traditional fruits doctrine developed in 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> cases (that the fruits of evidence obtained unconstitutionally must be excluded from trial) does 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 apply to the fruits of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 violations, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 11; and if the reason for the difference is 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 violations are not constitutional violations (which is plainly and flatly what 
				<em>
					Elstad
				</em>
				 said); then the Court must come up with some 
				<em>
					other
				</em>
				 explanation for the difference.  (That will take quite a bit of doing, by the way, since it is 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 clear on the face of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> that evidence obtained in violation of that guarantee must be excluded from trial, whereas it 
				<em>
					is
				</em>
				 clear on the face of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> that unconstitutionally compelled confessions cannot be used.)  To say simply that unreasonable searches under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> are different from unwarned interrogation under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a>, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1112, is true but supremely unhelpful.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Finally, the Court asserts that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 must be a constitutional decision announcing a constitutional rule, and thus immune to congressional modification, because we have since its inception applied it to the States.  If this argument is meant as an invocation of 
				<em>
					stare decisis
				</em>
				, it fails because, though it is true that our cases applying 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 against the States must be reconsidered if 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is not required by the Constitution, it is likewise true that our cases (discussed above) based on the principle that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is
				<em>
					 not
				</em>
				 required by the Constitution will have to be reconsidered if it 
				<em>
					is
				</em>
				.  So the 
				<em>
					stare decisis
				</em>
				 argument is a wash.  If, on the other hand, the argument is meant as an appeal to logic rather than 
				<em>
					stare decisis
				</em>
				, it is a classic example of begging the question: Congresss attempt to set aside 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, since it represents an assertion that violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is not a violation of the Constitution, 
				<em>
					also
				</em>
				 represents an assertion that the Court has no power to impose 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 on the States.  To answer this assertionnot by showing why violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
            <em>
					is
				</em>
				 a violation of the Constitutionbut by asserting that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
            <em>
					does
				</em>
				 apply against the States, is to assume precisely the point at issue.  In my view, our continued application of the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 code to the States despite our consistent statements that running afoul of its dictates does not necessarilyor even usuallyresult in an actual constitutional violation, represents not the source of  
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s salvation but rather evidence of its ultimate illegitimacy.  See generally J. Grano, Confessions, Truth, and the Law 173198 (1993); Grano, Prophylactic Rules in Criminal Procedure: A Question of Article III Legitimacy, 80 Nw. U. L. Rev. 100 (1985).  As 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice
				</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">
					Stevens 
				</span>
				has elsewhere explained, [t]his Courts power to require state courts to exclude probative self-incriminatory statements rests entirely on the premise that the use of such evidence violates the Federal Constitution. … If the Court does not accept that premise, it must regard the holding in the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 case itself, as well as all of the federal jurisprudence that has evolved from that decision, as nothing
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				more than an illegitimate exercise of raw judicial power.

				There was available to the Court a means of reconciling the established proposition that a violation of

				</em>
				 does not itself offend the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> with the Courts assertion of a right to ignore the present statute.  That means of reconciliation was argued strenuously by both petitioner and the United States, who were evidently more concerned than the Court is with maintaining the coherence of our jurisprudence.  It is not mentioned in the Courts opinion because, I assume, a majority of the Justices intent on reversing believes that incoherence is the lesser evil.  They may be right.

				Petitioner and the United States contend that there is nothing at all exceptional, much less unconstitutional, about the Courts adopting prophylactic rules to buttress constitutional rights, and enforcing them against Congress and the States.  Indeed, the United States argues that [p]rophylactic rules are now and have been for many years a feature of this Courts constitutional adjudication.  Brief for United States 47.  That statement is not wholly inaccurate, if by many years one means since the mid-1960s.  However, in their zeal to validate what is in my view a lawless practice, the United States and petitioner greatly overstate the frequency with which we have engaged in it.  For instance, petitioner cites several cases in which the Court quite simply exercised its traditional judicial power to define the scope of constitutional protections and, relatedly, the circumstances in which they are violated.

That decision was based, not upon the theory that this was desirable protection beyond what the Confrontation Clause technically required; but rather upon the self-evident proposition that the inability to cross-examine an available witness whose damaging out-of-court testimony is introduced violates the Confrontation Clause, combined with the conclusion that in these circumstances a mere jury instruction can never be relied upon to prevent the testimony from being damaging, see

.  There, the Court concluded that due process would be offended were a judge vindictively to resentence with added severity a defendant who had successfully appealed his original conviction.  Rather than simply announce that vindictive sentencing violates the Due Process Clause, the Court went on to hold that [i]n order to assure the absence of such a [vindictive] motivation, … the reasons for [imposing the increased sentence] must affirmatively appear and must be based upon objective information concerning identifiable conduct on the part of the defendant occurring after the time of the original sentencing proceeding.

				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 when deprived (as it has been) of its original (implausible) pretension to announcement of what the Constitution itself required.  That is, although the Due Process Clause may well prohibit punishment based on judicial vindictiveness, the Constitution by no means vests in the courts any general power to prescribe particular devices in order to assure the absence of such a motivation,  395 U.

				The foregoing demonstrates that, petitioners and the United States suggestions to the contrary notwithstanding, what the Court did in 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				(assuming, as later cases hold, that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 went beyond what the Constitution actually requires) is in fact extraordinary.  That the Court has, on rare and recent occasion, repeated the mistake does not transform error into truth, but illustrates the potential for future mischief that the error entails.  Where the Constitution has wished to lodge in one of the branches of the Federal Government some limited power to supplement its guarantees, it has said so.  See Amdt. 14, §5 (The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article).  The power with which the Court would endow itself under a prophylactic justification for 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 goes far beyond what it has permitted Congress to do under authority of that text.  Whereas we have insisted that congressional action under §5 of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a> must be congruent with, and proportional to, a 
				<em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">520</a> (1997)
, the 
				<em>

				 nontextual power to embellish confers authority to prescribe preventive measures against not only constitutionally prohibited compelled confessions, but also (as discussed earlier) foolhardy ones.

				I applaud, therefore, the refusal of the Justices in the majority to enunciate this boundless doctrine of judicial empowerment as a means of rendering todays decision rational.  In nonetheless joining the Courts judgment, however, they overlook two truisms: that actions speak louder than silence, and that (in judge-made law at least) logic will out.  Since there is in fact no other principle that can reconcile todays judgment with the post-
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 cases that the Court refuses to abandon, what todays decision will stand for, whether the Justices can bring themselves to say it or not, is the power of the Supreme Court to write a prophylactic, extraconstitutional Constitution, binding on Congress and the States.

				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				that criterion is more than met here.  To repeat

				In cases where statutory precedents have been overruled, the primary reason for the Courts shift in position has been the intervening development of the law, through either the growth of judicial doctrine or further action taken by Congress.

The task of determining whether a defendant is in custody has proved to be a slippery one.  And the supposedly bright lines that separate interrogation from spontaneous declaration, the exercise of a right from waiver, and the adequate warning from the inadequate, likewise have turned out to be rather dim and ill defined.  The totality-of-the-circumstances approach, on the other hand, permits each fact to be taken into account without resort to formal and dispositive labels.  By dispensing with the difficulty of producing a yes-or-no answer to questions that are often better answered in shades and degrees,

				Finally, I am not convinced by petitioners argument that

As far as I am aware, the public is not under the illusion that we are infallible.  I see little harm in admitting that we made a mistake in taking away from the people the ability to decide for themselves what protections (beyond those required by the Constitution) are reasonably affordable in the criminal investigatory process.  And I see much to be gained by reaffirming for the people the wonderful reality that they govern themselveswhich means that [t]he powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution that the people adopted, nor prohibited … to the States by that Constitution, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people, U.

				Todays judgment converts

				from a milestone of judicial overreaching into the very Cheops Pyramid (or perhaps the Sphinx would be a better analogue) of judicial arrogance.  In imposing its Court-made code upon the States, the original opinion at least

In Mitchell, moreover, the constitutional underpinnings of the earlier rule had not been demolished by subsequent cases.

				Those to whom judicial decisions are an unconnected series of judgments that produce either favored or disfavored results will doubtless greet todays decision as a paragon of moderation, since it declines to overrule

				<em>
					Miranda

				, but a radical revision of the most significant element of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 (as of all cases): the rationale that gives it a permanent place in our jurisprudence.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>
					Marbury
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Madison
				</em>
				, 1 Cranch 137 (1803), held that an Act of Congress will not be enforced by the courts if what it prescribes violates the Constitution of the United States.  That was the basis on which 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 was decided.  One will search todays opinion in vain, however, for a statement (surely simple enough to make) that what 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/3501.html" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. §3501</a> prescribesthe use at trial of a voluntary confession, even when a 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warning or its equivalent has failed to be givenviolates the Constitution.  The reason the statement does not appear is not only (and perhaps not so much) that it would be absurd, inasmuch as §3501 excludes from trial precisely what the Constitution excludes from trial, viz., compelled confessions; but also that Justices whose votes are needed to compose todays majority are on record as believing that a violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 a violation of the Constitution.  See 
				<em>
					Davis
				</em>
				 v.

				<em>
					new
				</em>
				, if not entirely comprehensible, principle of constitutional law.  As the Court chooses to describe that principle, statutes of Congress can be disregarded, not only when what they prescribe violates the Constitution, but when what they prescribe contradicts a decision of this Court that announced a constitutional rule, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 7.  As I shall discuss in some detail, the only thing that can possibly mean in the context of this case is that this Court has the power, not merely to apply the Constitution but to expand it, imposing what it regards as useful prophylactic restrictions upon Congress and the States.  That is an immense and frightening antidemocratic power, and it does not exist.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It takes only a small step to bring todays opinion out of the realm of power-judging and into the mainstream of legal reasoning: The Court need only go beyond its carefully couched iterations that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is a constitutional decision, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 8, that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is constitutionally based, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 10, that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 has constitutional underpinnings, 
				<em>
					ante, 
				</em>
				at 10, n. 5, and come out and say quite clearly: We reaffirm today that custodial interrogation that is not preceded by 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings or their equivalent violates the Constitution of the United States.  It cannot say that, because a majority of the Court does not believe it.  The Court therefore acts in plain violation of the Constitution when it denies effect to this Act of Congress.

				So if a law be in opposition to the constitution; if both the law and the constitution apply to a particular case, so that the court must either decide that case conformably to the law, disregarding the constitution; or conformably to the constitution, disregarding the law; the court must determine which of these conflicting rules governs the case.

				It was once possible to characterize the so-called

				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				the admission at trial of un-

				 confessions
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				violates the Constitution.  That is the fairest reading of the

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> privilege against self-incrimination applied in the context of extrajudicial custodial interrogation, see 384 U. S., at 460467itself a doubtful proposition as a matter both of history and precedent, see

				</em>
				).  Having extended the privilege into the confines of the station house, the Court liberally sprinkled throughout its sprawling 60-page opinion suggestions that, because of the compulsion inherent in custodial interrogation, the privilege was violated by any statement thus obtained that did not conform to the rules set forth in 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, or some functional equivalent.  See

				</em>
				 all of the rights described in the

				</em>
				 warning, is anything other than a volitional act.  See 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra, 
				</em>
				at 533534 (White, J., dissenting).  And even if one assumes that the elimination of compulsion absolutely requires informing even the most knowledgeable suspect of his right to remain silent, it cannot conceivably require the right to have 
				<em>
					counsel
				</em>
				 present.  There is a world of difference, which the Court recognized under the traditional voluntariness test but ignored in 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, between compelling a suspect to incriminate himself and preventing him from foolishly doing so of his own accord.  Only the latter (which is 
				<em>
					not 
				</em>
				required by the Constitution) could explain the Courts inclusion of a right to counsel and the requirement that it, too, be knowingly and intelligently waived.  Counsels presence is not required to tell the suspect that he 
				<em>
					need 
				</em>
				not speak; the interrogators can do that.  The only good reason for having counsel there is that he can be counted on to advise the suspect that he 
				<em>
					should

				not speak.  See

				Preventing foolish (rather than compelled) confessions is likewise the only conceivable basis for the rules (suggested in 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, see 384 U. S., at 444445, 473474), that courts must exclude any confession elicited by questioning conducted, without interruption, after the suspect has indicated a desire to stand on his right to remain silent, see

				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 decisionand what made it unacceptable as a matter of straightforward constitutional interpretation in the 
				<em>
					Marbury
				</em>
				 traditionis its palpable hostility toward the act of confession

				<em>
					Miranda

The defendant nodded in the direction of some empty cartons and responded that the gun is over there.  The Court held that both the unwarned statementthe gun is over thereand the recovered weapon were admissible in the prosecutions case in chief under a public safety exception to the prophylactic rules enunciated in

				<em>
					Eagan

				, 492 U. S., at 203, it is simply no longer possible for the Court to conclude, even if it wanted to, that a violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s rules is a violation of the Constitution.  But as I explained at the outset, that is what is required before the Court may disregard a law of Congress governing the admissibility of evidence in federal court.  The Court today insists that the 
				<em>
					decision
				</em>
				 in 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is a constitutional one, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1, 8; that it has constitutional underpinnings
				<em>
					,
				</em>
            <em>
					ante, 
				</em>
				at 10, n. 5; a constitutional basis and a constitutional origin, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 9, n. 3; that it was constitutionally based, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 10; and that it announced a constitutional rule, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 7, 9, 11, 14.  It is fine to play these word games; but what makes a decision constitutional in the only sense relevant herein the sense that renders it impervious to supersession by congressional legislation such as §3501is the determination that the Constitution 
				<em>
					requires
				</em>
				 the result that the decision announces and the statute ignores.  By disregarding congressional action that concededly does not violate the Constitution, the Court flagrantly offends fundamental principles of separation of powers, and arrogates to itself prerogatives reserved to the representatives of the people.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court seeks to avoid this conclusion in two ways: First, by misdescribing these post-
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 cases as mere dicta.  The Court concedes only that there is language in some of our opinions that supports the view that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s protections are not constitutionally required.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 8.  It is not a matter of 
				<em>
					language
				</em>
				; it is a matter of 
				<em>
					holdings
				</em>
				.  The proposition that failure to comply with 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s rules does not establish a constitutional
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				violation was central to the 
				<em>
					holdings
				</em>
				 of 
				<em>
					Tucker
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Hass
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Quarles
				</em>
				, and Elstad.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The second way the Court seeks to avoid the impact of these cases is simply to disclaim responsibility for reasoned decisionmaking.  It says:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				These decisions illustrate the principlenot that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is not a constitutional rulebut that no constitutional rule is immutable.  No court laying down a general rule can possibly foresee the various circumstances in which counsel will seek to apply it, and the sort of modifications represented by these cases are as much a normal part of constitutional law as the original decision.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 11.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
The issue, however, is not whether court rules are mutable; they assuredly are.  It is not whether, in the light of various circumstances, they can be modifi[ed]; they assuredly can.  The issue is whether, 
				<em>
					as mutated and modified
				</em>
				, they must 
				<em>
					make sense
				</em>
				.  The requirement that they do so is the only thing that prevents this Court from being some sort of nine-headed Caesar, giving thumbs-up or thumbs-down to whatever outcome, case by case, suits or offends its collective fancy.  And if confessions procured in violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 are confessions compelled in violation of the Constitution, the post-
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 decisions I have discussed do not make sense.  The only reasoned basis for their outcome was that a violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 a violation of the Constitution.  If, for example, as the Court acknowledges was the holding of 
				<em>
					Elstad
				</em>
				, the traditional fruits doctrine developed in 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> cases (that the fruits of evidence obtained unconstitutionally must be excluded from trial) does 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 apply to the fruits of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 violations, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 11; and if the reason for the difference is 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 violations are not constitutional violations (which is plainly and flatly what 
				<em>
					Elstad
				</em>
				 said); then the Court must come up with some 
				<em>
					other
				</em>
				 explanation for the difference.  (That will take quite a bit of doing, by the way, since it is 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 clear on the face of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> that evidence obtained in violation of that guarantee must be excluded from trial, whereas it 
				<em>
					is
				</em>
				 clear on the face of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> that unconstitutionally compelled confessions cannot be used.)  To say simply that unreasonable searches under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> are different from unwarned interrogation under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a>, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1112, is true but supremely unhelpful.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Finally, the Court asserts that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 must be a constitutional decision announcing a constitutional rule, and thus immune to congressional modification, because we have since its inception applied it to the States.  If this argument is meant as an invocation of 
				<em>
					stare decisis
				</em>
				, it fails because, though it is true that our cases applying 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 against the States must be reconsidered if 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is not required by the Constitution, it is likewise true that our cases (discussed above) based on the principle that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is
				<em>
					 not
				</em>
				 required by the Constitution will have to be reconsidered if it 
				<em>
					is
				</em>
				.  So the 
				<em>
					stare decisis
				</em>
				 argument is a wash.  If, on the other hand, the argument is meant as an appeal to logic rather than 
				<em>
					stare decisis
				</em>
				, it is a classic example of begging the question: Congresss attempt to set aside 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, since it represents an assertion that violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is not a violation of the Constitution, 
				<em>
					also
				</em>
				 represents an assertion that the Court has no power to impose 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 on the States.  To answer this assertionnot by showing why violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
            <em>
					is
				</em>
				 a violation of the Constitutionbut by asserting that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
            <em>
					does
				</em>
				 apply against the States, is to assume precisely the point at issue.  In my view, our continued application of the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 code to the States despite our consistent statements that running afoul of its dictates does not necessarilyor even usuallyresult in an actual constitutional violation, represents not the source of  
				<em>

				There was available to the Court a means of reconciling the established proposition that a violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 does not itself offend the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> with the Courts assertion of a right to ignore the present statute.  That means of reconciliation was argued strenuously by both petitioner and the United States, who were evidently more concerned than the Court is with maintaining the coherence of our jurisprudence.  It is not mentioned in the Courts opinion because, I assume, a majority of the Justices intent on reversing believes that incoherence is the lesser evil.  They may be right.

				Petitioner and the United States contend that there is nothing at all exceptional, much less unconstitutional, about the Courts adopting prophylactic rules to buttress constitutional rights, and enforcing them against Congress and the States.  Indeed, the United States argues that [p]rophylactic rules are now and have been for many years a feature of this Courts constitutional adjudication.  Brief for United States 47.  That statement is not wholly inaccurate, if by many years one means since the mid-1960s.  However, in their zeal to validate what is in my view a lawless practice, the United States and petitioner greatly overstate the frequency with which we have engaged in it.  For instance, petitioner cites several cases in which the Court quite simply exercised its traditional judicial power to define the scope of constitutional protections and, relatedly, the circumstances in which they are violated.

That decision was based, not upon the theory that this was desirable protection beyond what the Confrontation Clause technically required; but rather upon the self-evident proposition that the inability to cross-examine an available witness whose damaging out-of-court testimony is introduced violates the Confrontation Clause, combined with the conclusion that in these circumstances a mere jury instruction can never be relied upon to prevent the testimony from being damaging, see

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/395/711" class="subref" title="subref">395 U. S. 711</a> (1969)
.  There, the Court concluded that due process would be offended were a judge vindictively to resentence with added severity a defendant who had successfully appealed his original conviction.  Rather than simply announce that vindictive sentencing violates the Due Process Clause, the Court went on to hold that [i]n order to assure the absence of such a [vindictive] motivation, … the reasons for [imposing the increased sentence] must affirmatively appear and must be based upon objective information concerning identifiable conduct on the part of the defendant occurring after the time of the original sentencing proceeding.

				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 when deprived (as it has been) of its original (implausible) pretension to announcement of what the Constitution itself required.  That is, although the Due Process Clause may well prohibit punishment based on judicial vindictiveness, the Constitution by no means vests in the courts any general power to prescribe particular devices in order to assure the absence of such a motivation,  395 U. S., at 741 (Black, J., dissenting).  Justice Black surely had the right idea when he derided the Courts requirement as pure legislation if there ever was legislation,

				The foregoing demonstrates that, petitioners and the United States suggestions to the contrary notwithstanding, what the Court did in 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				(assuming, as later cases hold, that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 went beyond what the Constitution actually requires) is in fact extraordinary.  That the Court has, on rare and recent occasion, repeated the mistake does not transform error into truth, but illustrates the potential for future mischief that the error entails.  Where the Constitution has wished to lodge in one of the branches of the Federal Government some limited power to supplement its guarantees, it has said so.  See Amdt. 14, §5 (The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article).  The power with which the Court would endow itself under a prophylactic justification for 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 goes far beyond what it has permitted Congress to do under authority of that text.  Whereas we have insisted that congressional action under §5 of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a> must be congruent with, and proportional to, a 
				<em>
					constitutional violation
				</em>
				, see 
				<em>
					City of Boerne
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Flores,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">520</a> (1997)
, the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 nontextual power to embellish confers authority to prescribe preventive measures against not only constitutionally prohibited compelled confessions, but also (as discussed earlier) foolhardy ones.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I applaud, therefore, the refusal of the Justices in the majority to enunciate this boundless doctrine of judicial empowerment as a means of rendering todays decision rational.  In nonetheless joining the Courts judgment, however, they overlook two truisms: that actions speak louder than silence, and that (in judge-made law at least) logic will out.  Since there is in fact no other principle that can reconcile todays judgment with the post-
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 cases that the Court refuses to abandon, what todays decision will stand for, whether the Justices can bring themselves to say it or not, is the power of the Supreme Court to write a prophylactic, extraconstitutional Constitution, binding on Congress and the States.

				Thus, while I agree with the Court that §3501 cannot be upheld without also concluding that 
				<em>

				</em>
				 represents an illegitimate exercise of our authority to review state-court judgments, I do not share the Courts hesitation in reaching that conclusion.  For while the Court is also correct that the doctrine of

				<span class="softbreak"></span>

        <p class="bodytext">

				Neither am I persuaded by the argument for retaining

				that touts its supposed workability as compared with the totality-of-the-circumstances test it purported to replace.  
				<em>

				s proponents cite

The task of determining whether a defendant is in custody has proved to be a slippery one.  And the supposedly bright lines that separate interrogation from spontaneous declaration, the exercise of a right from waiver, and the adequate warning from the inadequate, likewise have turned out to be rather dim and ill defined.  The totality-of-the-circumstances approach, on the other hand, permits each fact to be taken into account without resort to formal and dispositive labels.  By dispensing with the difficulty of producing a yes-or-no answer to questions that are often better answered in shades and degrees,

				Finally, I am not convinced by petitioners argument that

As far as I am aware, the public is not under the illusion that we are infallible.  I see little harm in admitting that we made a mistake in taking away from the people the ability to decide for themselves what protections (beyond those required by the Constitution) are reasonably affordable in the criminal investigatory process.  And I see much to be gained by reaffirming for the people the wonderful reality that they govern themselveswhich means that [t]he powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution that the people adopted, nor prohibited … to the States by that Constitution, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people, U.

In Mitchell, moreover, the constitutional underpinnings of the earlier rule had not been demolished by subsequent cases.

				Those to whom judicial decisions are an unconnected series of judgments that produce either favored or disfavored results will doubtless greet todays decision as a paragon of moderation, since it declines to overrule
				<em>
					 Miranda
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Arizona,

				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, but a radical revision of the most significant element of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 (as of all cases): the rationale that gives it a permanent place in our jurisprudence.

        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>
					Marbury
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Madison
				</em>
				, 1 Cranch 137 (1803), held that an Act of Congress will not be enforced by the courts if what it prescribes violates the Constitution of the United States.  That was the basis on which 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 was decided.  One will search todays opinion in vain, however, for a statement (surely simple enough to make) that what 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/3501.html" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. §3501</a> prescribesthe use at trial of a voluntary confession, even when a 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warning or its equivalent has failed to be givenviolates the Constitution.  The reason the statement does not appear is not only (and perhaps not so much) that it would be absurd, inasmuch as §3501 excludes from trial precisely what the Constitution excludes from trial, viz., compelled confessions; but also that Justices whose votes are needed to compose todays majority are on record as believing that a violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 a violation of the Constitution.  See 
				<em>
					Davis

				<em>
					new
				</em>
				, if not entirely comprehensible, principle of constitutional law.  As the Court chooses to describe that principle, statutes of Congress can be disregarded, not only when what they prescribe violates the Constitution, but when what they prescribe contradicts a decision of this Court that announced a constitutional rule, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 7.  As I shall discuss in some detail, the only thing that can possibly mean in the context of this case is that this Court has the power, not merely to apply the Constitution but to expand it, imposing what it regards as useful prophylactic restrictions upon Congress and the States.  That is an immense and frightening antidemocratic power, and it does not exist.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It takes only a small step to bring todays opinion out of the realm of power-judging and into the mainstream of legal reasoning: The Court need only go beyond its carefully couched iterations that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is a constitutional decision, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 8, that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is constitutionally based, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 10, that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 has constitutional underpinnings, 
				<em>
					ante, 
				</em>
				at 10, n. 5, and come out and say quite clearly: We reaffirm today that custodial interrogation that is not preceded by 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings or their equivalent violates the Constitution of the United States.  It cannot say that, because a majority of the Court does not believe it.  The Court therefore acts in plain violation of the Constitution when it denies effect to this Act of Congress.

				So if a law be in opposition to the constitution; if both the law and the constitution apply to a particular case, so that the court must either decide that case conformably to the law, disregarding the constitution; or conformably to the constitution, disregarding the law; the court must determine which of these conflicting rules governs the case.

The power we recognized in

				 will thus permit us, indeed require us, to disregar[d] §3501, a duly enacted statute governing the admissibility of evidence in the federal courts, only if it be in opposition to the constitutionhere, assertedly, the dictates of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a>.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It was once possible to characterize the so-called 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 rule as resting (however implausibly) upon the proposition that what the statute here before us permits
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				the admission at trial of un-
				<em>
					Mirandized
				</em>
				 confessions
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				violates the Constitution.  That is the fairest reading of the 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				case itself.  The Court began by announcing that the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> privilege against self-incrimination applied in the context of extrajudicial custodial interrogation, see 384 U. S., at 460467itself a doubtful proposition as a matter both of history and precedent, see 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at, at 510511 (Harlan, J., dissenting) (characterizing the Courts conclusion that the Fifth
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				Amendment privilege, rather than the Due Process
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				Clause, governed stationhouse confessions as a 
				<em>
					trompe loeil
				</em>
				).  Having extended the privilege into the confines of the station house, the Court liberally sprinkled throughout its sprawling 60-page opinion suggestions that, because of the compulsion inherent in custodial interrogation, the privilege was violated by any statement thus obtained that did not conform to the rules set forth in 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, or some functional equivalent.  See 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 458 (Unless adequate protective devices are employed to dispel the compulsion 
				<em>
					inherent
				</em>
				 in custodial surroundings, 
				<em>
					no
				</em>
				 statement obtained from the defendant can truly be the product of his free choice) (emphases added); 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 461 (An individual swept from familiar surroundings into police custody, surrounded by antagonistic forces, and subjected to the techniques of persuasion described above cannot be otherwise than under compulsion to speak); 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 467 (We have concluded that without proper safeguards the process of in-custody interrogation … contains inherently compelling pressures which work to undermine the individuals will to resist and to compel him to speak where he would not otherwise do so freely);

				The dissenters, for their part, also understood

				So understood,

				 was objectionable for innumerable reasons, not least the fact that cases spanning more than 70 years had rejected its core premise that, absent the warnings and an effective waiver of the right to remain silent and of the (thitherto unknown) right to have an attorney present, a statement obtained pursuant to custodial interrogation was necessarily the product of compulsion.  See

 (same).  Moreover, history and precedent aside, the decision in 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, if read as an explication of what the Constitution 
				<em>
					requires
				</em>
				, is preposterous.  There is, for example, simply no basis in reason for concluding that a response to the very first question asked, by a suspect who already 
				<em>
					knows
				</em>
				 all of the rights described in the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warning, is anything other than a volitional act.  See 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra, 
				</em>
				at 533534 (White, J., dissenting).  And even if one assumes that the elimination of compulsion absolutely requires informing even the most knowledgeable suspect of his right to remain silent, it cannot conceivably require the right to have 
				<em>
					counsel
				</em>
				 present.  There is a world of difference, which the Court recognized under the traditional voluntariness test but ignored in 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, between compelling a suspect to incriminate himself and preventing him from foolishly doing so of his own accord.  Only the latter (which is 
				<em>
					not 
				</em>
				required by the Constitution) could explain the Courts inclusion of a right to counsel and the requirement that it, too, be knowingly and intelligently waived.  Counsels presence is not required to tell the suspect that he 
				<em>
					need 
				</em>
				not speak; the interrogators can do that.  The only good reason for having counsel there is that he can be counted on to advise the suspect that he 
				<em>
					should 
				</em>
				not speak.  See 
				<em>
					Watts

					Indiana

				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				tain terms to make no statement to police under any circumstances).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Preventing foolish (rather than compelled) confessions is likewise the only conceivable basis for the rules (suggested in 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, see 384 U. S., at 444445, 473474), that courts must exclude any confession elicited by questioning conducted, without interruption, after the suspect has indicated a desire to stand on his right to remain silent, see 
				<em>
					Michigan
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Mosley,
				</em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">105</a>106 (1975)
, or initiated by police after the suspect has expressed a desire to have counsel present, see 
				<em>
					Edwards
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Arizona,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/451/477" class="subref" title="subref">451 U. S. 477</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">484</a>485 (1981)
.  Nonthreatening attempts to persuade the suspect to reconsider that initial decision are not, without more, enough to render a change of heart the product of anything other than the suspects free will.  Thus, what is most remarkable about the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 decisionand what made it unacceptable as a matter of straightforward constitutional interpretation in the 
				<em>
					Marbury
				</em>
				 traditionis its palpable hostility toward the act of confession 
				<em>
					per se
				</em>
				, rather than toward what the Constitution abhors, 
				<em>
					compelled
				</em>
				 confession.  See 
				<em>
					United States

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">187</a> (1977)
 ([F]ar from being prohibited by the Constitution, admissions of guilt by wrongdoers, if not coerced, are inherently desirable).  The Constitution is not, unlike the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 majority, offended by a criminals commendable qualm of conscience or fortunate fit of stupidity.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Minnick

				For these reasons, and others more than adequately developed in the

				that a violation of the

				<em>
					necessarily
				</em>
				 amounts to a violation of the privilege against compelled self-incrimination can claim no support in history, precedent, or common sense, and as a result would at least presumptively be worth reconsidering even at this late date.  But that is unnecessary, since the Court has (thankfully) long since abandoned the notion that failure to comply with

				As the Court today acknowledges, since

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>, but rather only prophylactic rules that go beyond the right against compelled self-incrimination.  Of course the seeds of this prophylactic interpretation of

				<em>

				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				warningsthe police demanded to know where the gun was.  The defendant nodded in the direction of some empty cartons and responded that the gun is over there.  The Court held that both the unwarned statementthe gun is over thereand the recovered weapon were admissible in the prosecutions case in chief under a public safety exception to the prophylactic rules enunciated in 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				.  467 U. S., at 653.  It explicitly acknowledged that if the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings were an imperative of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> itself, such an exigency exception would be impossible, since the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a>s bar on compelled self-incrimination is absolute, and its  strictures, unlike the Fourths are not removed by showing reasonableness,  467 U.

				<em>
					Eagan
				</em>
				, 492 U. S., at 203, it is simply no longer possible for the Court to conclude, even if it wanted to, that a violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s rules is a violation of the Constitution.  But as I explained at the outset, that is what is required before the Court may disregard a law of Congress governing the admissibility of evidence in federal court.  The Court today insists that the 
				<em>
					decision
				</em>
				 in 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is a constitutional one, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1, 8; that it has constitutional underpinnings
				<em>
					,
				</em>
            <em>
					ante, 
				</em>
				at 10, n. 5; a constitutional basis and a constitutional origin, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 9, n. 3; that it was constitutionally based, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 10; and that it announced a constitutional rule, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 7, 9, 11, 14.  It is fine to play these word games; but what makes a decision constitutional in the only sense relevant herein the sense that renders it impervious to supersession by congressional legislation such as §3501is the determination that the Constitution 
				<em>
					requires
				</em>
				 the result that the decision announces and the statute ignores.  By disregarding congressional action that concededly does not violate the Constitution, the Court flagrantly offends fundamental principles of separation of powers, and arrogates to itself prerogatives reserved to the representatives of the people.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court seeks to avoid this conclusion in two ways: First, by misdescribing these post-
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 cases as mere dicta.  The Court concedes only that there is language in some of our opinions that supports the view that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s protections are not constitutionally required.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 8.  It is not a matter of 
				<em>
					language
				</em>
				; it is a matter of 
				<em>
					holdings
				</em>
				.  The proposition that failure to comply with 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s rules does not establish a constitutional
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				violation was central to the 
				<em>
					holdings
				</em>
				 of 
				<em>
					Tucker
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Hass
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Quarles
				</em>
				, and Elstad.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The second way the Court seeks to avoid the impact of these cases is simply to disclaim responsibility for reasoned decisionmaking.  It says:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				These decisions illustrate the principlenot that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is not a constitutional rulebut that no constitutional rule is immutable.  No court laying down a general rule can possibly foresee the various circumstances in which counsel will seek to apply it, and the sort of modifications represented by these cases are as much a normal part of constitutional law as the original decision.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 11.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
The issue, however, is not whether court rules are mutable; they assuredly are.  It is not whether, in the light of various circumstances, they can be modifi[ed]; they assuredly can.  The issue is whether, 
				<em>
					as mutated and modified
				</em>
				, they must 
				<em>
					make sense
				</em>
				.  The requirement that they do so is the only thing that prevents this Court from being some sort of nine-headed Caesar, giving thumbs-up or thumbs-down to whatever outcome, case by case, suits or offends its collective fancy.  And if confessions procured in violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 are confessions compelled in violation of the Constitution, the post-
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 decisions I have discussed do not make sense.  The only reasoned basis for their outcome was that a violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 a violation of the Constitution.  If, for example, as the Court acknowledges was the holding of 
				<em>
					Elstad
				</em>
				, the traditional fruits doctrine developed in 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> cases (that the fruits of evidence obtained unconstitutionally must be excluded from trial) does 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 apply to the fruits of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 violations, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 11; and if the reason for the difference is 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 violations are not constitutional violations (which is plainly and flatly what 
				<em>
					Elstad
				</em>
				 said); then the Court must come up with some 
				<em>
					other
				</em>
				 explanation for the difference.  (That will take quite a bit of doing, by the way, since it is 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 clear on the face of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> that evidence obtained in violation of that guarantee must be excluded from trial, whereas it 
				<em>
					is
				</em>
				 clear on the face of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> that unconstitutionally compelled confessions cannot be used.)  To say simply that unreasonable searches under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> are different from unwarned interrogation under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a>, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1112, is true but supremely unhelpful.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Finally, the Court asserts that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 must be a constitutional decision announcing a constitutional rule, and thus immune to congressional modification, because we have since its inception applied it to the States.  If this argument is meant as an invocation of 
				<em>
					stare decisis
				</em>
				, it fails because, though it is true that our cases applying 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 against the States must be reconsidered if 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is not required by the Constitution, it is likewise true that our cases (discussed above) based on the principle that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is
				<em>
					 not
				</em>
				 required by the Constitution will have to be reconsidered if it 
				<em>
					is
				</em>
				.  So the 
				<em>
					stare decisis
				</em>
				 argument is a wash.  If, on the other hand, the argument is meant as an appeal to logic rather than 
				<em>
					stare decisis
				</em>
				, it is a classic example of begging the question: Congresss attempt to set aside 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, since it represents an assertion that violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is not a violation of the Constitution, 
				<em>
					also
				</em>
				 represents an assertion that the Court has no power to impose 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 on the States.  To answer this assertionnot by showing why violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
            <em>
					is
				</em>
				 a violation of the Constitutionbut by asserting that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
            <em>
					does
				</em>
				 apply against the States, is to assume precisely the point at issue.  In my view, our continued application of the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 code to the States despite our consistent statements that running afoul of its dictates does not necessarilyor even usuallyresult in an actual constitutional violation, represents not the source of  
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s salvation but rather evidence of its ultimate illegitimacy.  See generally J. Grano, Confessions, Truth, and the Law 173198 (1993); Grano, Prophylactic Rules in Criminal Procedure: A Question of Article III Legitimacy, 80 Nw. U. L. Rev. 100 (1985).  As 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice
				</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">
					Stevens 
				</span>
				has elsewhere explained, [t]his Courts power to require state courts to exclude probative self-incriminatory statements rests entirely on the premise that the use of such evidence violates the Federal Constitution. … If the Court does not accept that premise, it must regard the holding in the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 case itself, as well as all of the federal jurisprudence that has evolved from that decision, as nothing
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				more than an illegitimate exercise of raw judicial power.

				There was available to the Court a means of reconciling the established proposition that a violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 does not itself offend the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> with the Courts assertion of a right to ignore the present statute.  That means of reconciliation was argued strenuously by both petitioner and the United States, who were evidently more concerned than the Court is with maintaining the coherence of our jurisprudence.  It is not mentioned in the Courts opinion because, I assume, a majority of the Justices intent on reversing believes that incoherence is the lesser evil.  They may be right.

				Petitioner and the United States contend that there is nothing at all exceptional, much less unconstitutional, about the Courts adopting prophylactic rules to buttress constitutional rights, and enforcing them against Congress and the States.  Indeed, the United States argues that [p]rophylactic rules are now and have been for many years a feature of this Courts constitutional adjudication.  Brief for United States 47.  That statement is not wholly inaccurate, if by many years one means since the mid-1960s.  However, in their zeal to validate what is in my view a lawless practice, the United States and petitioner greatly overstate the frequency with which we have engaged in it.  For instance, petitioner cites several cases in which the Court quite simply exercised its traditional judicial power to define the scope of constitutional protections and, relatedly, the circumstances in which they are violated.

That decision was based, not upon the theory that this was desirable protection beyond what the Confrontation Clause technically required; but rather upon the self-evident proposition that the inability to cross-examine an available witness whose damaging out-of-court testimony is introduced violates the Confrontation Clause, combined with the conclusion that in these circumstances a mere jury instruction can never be relied upon to prevent the testimony from being damaging, see

				The foregoing demonstrates that, petitioners and the United States suggestions to the contrary notwithstanding, what the Court did in 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				(assuming, as later cases hold, that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 went beyond what the Constitution actually requires) is in fact extraordinary.  That the Court has, on rare and recent occasion, repeated the mistake does not transform error into truth, but illustrates the potential for future mischief that the error entails.  Where the Constitution has wished to lodge in one of the branches of the Federal Government some limited power to supplement its guarantees, it has said so.  See Amdt. 14, §5 (The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article).  The power with which the Court would endow itself under a prophylactic justification for 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 goes far beyond what it has permitted Congress to do under authority of that text.  Whereas we have insisted that congressional action under §5 of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a> must be congruent with, and proportional to, a 
				<em>
					constitutional violation
				</em>
				, see 
				<em>
					City of Boerne
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Flores,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/521/507" class="subref" title="subref">521 U. S. 507</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">520</a> (1997)
, the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 nontextual power to embellish confers authority to prescribe preventive measures against not only constitutionally prohibited compelled confessions, but also (as discussed earlier) foolhardy ones.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I applaud, therefore, the refusal of the Justices in the majority to enunciate this boundless doctrine of judicial empowerment as a means of rendering todays decision rational.  In nonetheless joining the Courts judgment, however, they overlook two truisms: that actions speak louder than silence, and that (in judge-made law at least) logic will out.  Since there is in fact no other principle that can reconcile todays judgment with the post-
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 cases that the Court refuses to abandon, what todays decision will stand for, whether the Justices can bring themselves to say it or not, is the power of the Supreme Court to write a prophylactic, extraconstitutional Constitution, binding on Congress and the States.

				Thus, while I agree with the Court that §3501 cannot be upheld without also concluding that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 represents an illegitimate exercise of our authority to review state-court judgments, I do not share the Courts hesitation in reaching that conclusion.  For while the Court is also correct that the doctrine of 
				<em>
					stare decisis
				</em>
				 demands some special justification for a departure from longstanding precedenteven precedent of the constitutional variety
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				that criterion is more than met here.  To repeat 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Stevens
				</span>
				 cogent observation, it is [o]bviou[s] that the Courts power to reverse Mirandas conviction rested

				 on the determination that a violation of the Federal Constitution had occurred.

				s] doctrinal underpinnings, 
				<em>

				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 in mind:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				In cases where statutory precedents have been overruled, the primary reason for the Courts shift in position has been the intervening development of the law, through either the growth of judicial doctrine or further action taken by Congress.

				Neither am I persuaded by the argument for retaining 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				that touts its supposed workability as compared with the totality-of-the-circumstances test it purported to replace.  
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s proponents cite 
				<em>
					ad nauseam
				</em>
				 the fact that the Court was called upon to make difficult and subtle distinctions in applying the voluntariness test in some 30-odd due process coerced confessions cases in the 30 years between

				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				.  It is not immediately apparent, however, that the judicial burden has been eased by the bright-line rules adopted in 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				.  In fact, in the 34 years since 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 was decided, this Court has been called upon to decide nearly 
				<em>

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Moreover, it is not clear why the Court thinks that the totality-of-the-circumstances test … is more difficult than

				 creates as many close questions as it resolves.  The task of determining whether a defendant is in custody has proved to be a slippery one.  And the supposedly bright lines that separate interrogation from spontaneous declaration, the exercise of a right from waiver, and the adequate warning from the inadequate, likewise have turned out to be rather dim and ill defined.  The totality-of-the-circumstances approach, on the other hand, permits each fact to be taken into account without resort to formal and dispositive labels.  By dispensing with the difficulty of producing a yes-or-no answer to questions that are often better answered in shades and degrees, 
				<em>

				But even were I to agree that the old totality-of-the-circumstances test was more cumbersome, it is simply not true that

				Finally, I am not convinced by petitioners argument that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 should be preserved because the decision occupies a special place in the publics consciousness.  Brief for Petitioner 44.  As far as I am aware, the public is not under the illusion that we are infallible.  I see little harm in admitting that we made a mistake in taking away from the people the ability to decide for themselves what protections (beyond those required by the Constitution) are reasonably affordable in the criminal investigatory process.  And I see much to be gained by reaffirming for the people the wonderful reality that they govern themselveswhich means that [t]he powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution that the people adopted, nor prohibited … to the States by that Constitution, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people, U. S. Const., Amdt. 10.

				Todays judgment converts

				from a milestone of judicial overreaching into the very Cheops Pyramid (or perhaps the Sphinx would be a better analogue) of judicial arrogance.  In imposing its Court-made code upon the States, the original opinion at least

In Mitchell, moreover, the constitutional underpinnings of the earlier rule had not been demolished by subsequent cases.

            <em>
					Marbury
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Madison
				</em>
				, 1 Cranch 137 (1803), held that an Act of Congress will not be enforced by the courts if what it prescribes violates the Constitution of the United States.  That was the basis on which 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 was decided.  One will search todays opinion in vain, however, for a statement (surely simple enough to make) that what 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/3501.html" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. §3501</a> prescribesthe use at trial of a voluntary confession, even when a 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warning or its equivalent has failed to be givenviolates the Constitution.  The reason the statement does not appear is not only (and perhaps not so much) that it would be absurd, inasmuch as §3501 excludes from trial precisely what the Constitution excludes from trial, viz., compelled confessions; but also that Justices whose votes are needed to compose todays majority are on record as believing that a violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 a violation of the Constitution.  See 
				<em>

				<em>
					new
				</em>
				, if not entirely comprehensible, principle of constitutional law.  As the Court chooses to describe that principle, statutes of Congress can be disregarded, not only when what they prescribe violates the Constitution, but when what they prescribe contradicts a decision of this Court that announced a constitutional rule, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 7.  As I shall discuss in some detail, the only thing that can possibly mean in the context of this case is that this Court has the power, not merely to apply the Constitution but to expand it, imposing what it regards as useful prophylactic restrictions upon Congress and the States.  That is an immense and frightening antidemocratic power, and it does not exist.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It takes only a small step to bring todays opinion out of the realm of power-judging and into the mainstream of legal reasoning: The Court need only go beyond its carefully couched iterations that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is a constitutional decision, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 8, that 
				<em>
					Miranda

				</em>
				 has constitutional underpinnings, 
				<em>
					ante, 
				</em>
				at 10, n. 5, and come out and say quite clearly: We reaffirm today that custodial interrogation that is not preceded by 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings or their equivalent violates the Constitution of the United States.  It cannot say that, because a majority of the Court does not believe it.  The Court therefore acts in plain violation of the Constitution when it denies effect to this Act of Congress.

				So if a law be in opposition to the constitution; if both the law and the constitution apply to a particular case, so that the court must either decide that case conformably to the law, disregarding the constitution; or conformably to the constitution, disregarding the law; the court must determine which of these conflicting rules governs the case.

				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, if read as an explication of what the Constitution 
				<em>
					requires
				</em>
				, is preposterous.  There is, for example, simply no basis in reason for concluding that a response to the very first question asked, by a suspect who already 
				<em>
					knows
				</em>
				 all of the rights described in the 
				<em>

				</em>
				 warning, is anything other than a volitional act.  See 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra, 
				</em>
				at 533534 (White, J., dissenting).  And even if one assumes that the elimination of compulsion absolutely requires informing even the most knowledgeable suspect of his right to remain silent, it cannot conceivably require the right to have 
				<em>
					counsel
				</em>
				 present.  There is a world of difference, which the Court recognized under the traditional voluntariness test but ignored in 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, between compelling a suspect to incriminate himself and preventing him from foolishly doing so of his own accord.  Only the latter (which is 
				<em>
					not 
				</em>
				required by the Constitution) could explain the Courts inclusion of a right to counsel and the requirement that it, too, be knowingly and intelligently waived.  Counsels presence is not required to tell the suspect that he 
				<em>
					need 
				</em>
				not speak; the interrogators can do that.  The only good reason for having counsel there is that he can be counted on to advise the suspect that he 
				<em>
					should 
				</em>
				not speak.  See

				Preventing foolish (rather than compelled) confessions is likewise the only conceivable basis for the rules (suggested in 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, see 384 U. S., at 444445, 473474), that courts must exclude any confession elicited by questioning conducted, without interruption, after the suspect has indicated a desire to stand on his right to remain silent, see 
				<em>
					Michigan

				 v.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">484</a>485 (1981)
.  Nonthreatening attempts to persuade the suspect to reconsider that initial decision are not, without more, enough to render a change of heart the product of anything other than the suspects free will.  Thus, what is most remarkable about the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 decisionand what made it unacceptable as a matter of straightforward constitutional interpretation in the 
				<em>
					Marbury
				</em>
				 traditionis its palpable hostility toward the act of confession

				<em>
					Miranda

The defendant nodded in the direction of some empty cartons and responded that the gun is over there.  The Court held that both the unwarned statementthe gun is over thereand the recovered weapon were admissible in the prosecutions case in chief under a public safety exception to the prophylactic rules enunciated in

				, 492 U. S., at 203, it is simply no longer possible for the Court to conclude, even if it wanted to, that a violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s rules is a violation of the Constitution.  But as I explained at the outset, that is what is required before the Court may disregard a law of Congress governing the admissibility of evidence in federal court.  The Court today insists that the 
				<em>
					decision
				</em>
				 in 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is a constitutional one, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1, 8; that it has constitutional underpinnings
				<em>
					,
				</em>
            <em>
					ante, 
				</em>
				at 10, n. 5; a constitutional basis and a constitutional origin, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 9, n. 3; that it was constitutionally based, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 10; and that it announced a constitutional rule, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 7, 9, 11, 14.  It is fine to play these word games; but what makes a decision constitutional in the only sense relevant herein the sense that renders it impervious to supersession by congressional legislation such as §3501is the determination that the Constitution 
				<em>
					requires
				</em>
				 the result that the decision announces and the statute ignores.  By disregarding congressional action that concededly does not violate the Constitution, the Court flagrantly offends fundamental principles of separation of powers, and arrogates to itself prerogatives reserved to the representatives of the people.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court seeks to avoid this conclusion in two ways: First, by misdescribing these post-
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 cases as mere dicta.  The Court concedes only that there is language in some of our opinions that supports the view that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s protections are not constitutionally required.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 8.  It is not a matter of 
				<em>
					language
				</em>
				; it is a matter of 
				<em>
					holdings
				</em>
				.  The proposition that failure to comply with 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s rules does not establish a constitutional
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				violation was central to the 
				<em>
					holdings
				</em>
				 of 
				<em>
					Tucker
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Hass
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Quarles
				</em>
				, and Elstad.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The second way the Court seeks to avoid the impact of these cases is simply to disclaim responsibility for reasoned decisionmaking.  It says:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				These decisions illustrate the principlenot that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is not a constitutional rulebut that no constitutional rule is immutable.  No court laying down a general rule can possibly foresee the various circumstances in which counsel will seek to apply it, and the sort of modifications represented by these cases are as much a normal part of constitutional law as the original decision.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 11.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
The issue, however, is not whether court rules are mutable; they assuredly are.  It is not whether, in the light of various circumstances, they can be modifi[ed]; they assuredly can.  The issue is whether, 
				<em>
					as mutated and modified
				</em>
				, they must 
				<em>
					make sense
				</em>
				.  The requirement that they do so is the only thing that prevents this Court from being some sort of nine-headed Caesar, giving thumbs-up or thumbs-down to whatever outcome, case by case, suits or offends its collective fancy.  And if confessions procured in violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 are confessions compelled in violation of the Constitution, the post-
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 decisions I have discussed do not make sense.  The only reasoned basis for their outcome was that a violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 a violation of the Constitution.  If, for example, as the Court acknowledges was the holding of 
				<em>
					Elstad
				</em>
				, the traditional fruits doctrine developed in 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> cases (that the fruits of evidence obtained unconstitutionally must be excluded from trial) does 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 apply to the fruits of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 violations, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 11; and if the reason for the difference is 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 violations are not constitutional violations (which is plainly and flatly what 
				<em>
					Elstad
				</em>
				 said); then the Court must come up with some 
				<em>
					other
				</em>
				 explanation for the difference.  (That will take quite a bit of doing, by the way, since it is 
				<em>
					not

				Finally, the Court asserts that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 must be a constitutional decision announcing a constitutional rule, and thus immune to congressional modification, because we have since its inception applied it to the States.  If this argument is meant as an invocation of 
				<em>
					stare decisis
				</em>
				, it fails because, though it is true that our cases applying 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 against the States must be reconsidered if 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is not required by the Constitution, it is likewise true that our cases (discussed above) based on the principle that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is
				<em>
					 not
				</em>
				 required by the Constitution will have to be reconsidered if it 
				<em>
					is
				</em>
				.  So the 
				<em>
					stare decisis
				</em>
				 argument is a wash.  If, on the other hand, the argument is meant as an appeal to logic rather than 
				<em>
					stare decisis
				</em>
				, it is a classic example of begging the question: Congresss attempt to set aside 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, since it represents an assertion that violation of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 is not a violation of the Constitution, 
				<em>
					also
				</em>
				 represents an assertion that the Court has no power to impose 
				<em>

				</em>
				 on the States.  To answer this assertionnot by showing why violation of 
				<em>

				</em>
            <em>
					is
				</em>
				 a violation of the Constitutionbut by asserting that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
            <em>
					does
				</em>
				 apply against the States, is to assume precisely the point at issue.  In my view, our continued application of the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 code to the States despite our consistent statements that running afoul of its dictates does not necessarilyor even usuallyresult in an actual constitutional violation, represents not the source of  
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s salvation but rather evidence of its ultimate illegitimacy.  See generally J. Grano, Confessions, Truth, and the Law 173198 (1993); Grano, Prophylactic Rules in Criminal Procedure: A Question of Article III Legitimacy, 80 Nw. U. L. Rev. 100 (1985).  As

				There was available to the Court a means of reconciling the established proposition that a violation of 
				<em>

				 does not itself offend the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> with the Courts assertion of a right to ignore the present statute.  That means of reconciliation was argued strenuously by both petitioner and the United States, who were evidently more concerned than the Court is with maintaining the coherence of our jurisprudence.

				Petitioner and the United States contend that there is nothing at all exceptional, much less unconstitutional, about the Courts adopting prophylactic rules to buttress constitutional rights, and enforcing them against Congress and the States.  Indeed, the United States argues that [p]rophylactic rules are now and have been for many years a feature of this Courts constitutional adjudication.  Brief for United States 47.  That statement is not wholly inaccurate, if by many years one means since the mid-1960s.  However, in their zeal to validate what is in my view a lawless practice, the United States and petitioner greatly overstate the frequency with which we have engaged in it.  For instance, petitioner cites several cases in which the Court quite simply exercised its traditional judicial power to define the scope of constitutional protections and, relatedly, the circumstances in which they are violated.

That decision was based, not upon the theory that this was desirable protection beyond what the Confrontation Clause technically required; but rather upon the self-evident proposition that the inability to cross-examine an available witness whose damaging out-of-court testimony is introduced violates the Confrontation Clause, combined with the conclusion that in these circumstances a mere jury instruction can never be relied upon to prevent the testimony from being damaging, see

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/395/711" class="subref" title="subref">395 U. S. 711</a> (1969)
.  There, the Court concluded that due process would be offended were a judge vindictively to resentence with added severity a defendant who had successfully appealed his original conviction.  Rather than simply announce that vindictive sentencing violates the Due Process Clause, the Court went on to hold that [i]n order to assure the absence of such a [vindictive] motivation, … the reasons for [imposing the increased sentence] must affirmatively appear and must be based upon objective information concerning identifiable conduct on the part of the defendant occurring after the time of the original sentencing proceeding.

				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 when deprived (as it has been) of its original (implausible) pretension to announcement of what the Constitution itself required.  That is, although the Due Process Clause may well prohibit punishment based on judicial vindictiveness, the Constitution by no means vests in the courts any general power to prescribe particular devices in order to assure the absence of such a motivation,  395 U. S., at 741 (Black, J., dissenting).  Justice Black surely had the right idea when he derided the Courts requirement as pure legislation if there ever was legislation,

				The foregoing demonstrates that, petitioners and the United States suggestions to the contrary notwithstanding, what the Court did in 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				(assuming, as later cases hold, that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 went beyond what the Constitution actually requires) is in fact extraordinary.  That the Court has, on rare and recent occasion, repeated the mistake does not transform error into truth, but illustrates the potential for future mischief that the error entails.  Where the Constitution has wished to lodge in one of the branches of the Federal Government some limited power to supplement its guarantees, it has said so.  See Amdt. 14, §5 (The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article).  The power with which the Court would endow itself under a prophylactic justification for 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 goes far beyond what it has permitted Congress to do under authority of that text.  Whereas we have insisted that congressional action under §5 of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a> must be congruent with, and proportional to, a 
				<em>
					constitutional violation
				</em>
				, see 
				<em>
					City of Boerne
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Flores,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">520</a> (1997)
, the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 nontextual power to embellish confers authority to prescribe preventive measures against not only constitutionally prohibited compelled confessions, but also (as discussed earlier) foolhardy ones.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I applaud, therefore, the refusal of the Justices in the majority to enunciate this boundless doctrine of judicial empowerment as a means of rendering todays decision rational.  In nonetheless joining the Courts judgment, however, they overlook two truisms: that actions speak louder than silence, and that (in judge-made law at least) logic will out.  Since there is in fact no other principle that can reconcile todays judgment with the post-
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 cases that the Court refuses to abandon, what todays decision will stand for, whether the Justices can bring themselves to say it or not, is the power of the Supreme Court to write a prophylactic, extraconstitutional Constitution, binding on Congress and the States.

				Thus, while I agree with the Court that §3501 cannot be upheld without also concluding that

				 represents an illegitimate exercise of our authority to review state-court judgments, I do not share the Courts hesitation in reaching that conclusion.  For while the Court is also correct that the doctrine of

				<span class="softbreak"></span>

				Neither am I persuaded by the argument for retaining

				that touts its supposed workability as compared with the totality-of-the-circumstances test it purported to replace.  
				<em>

				s proponents cite

The task of determining whether a defendant is in custody has proved to be a slippery one.  And the supposedly bright lines that separate interrogation from spontaneous declaration, the exercise of a right from waiver, and the adequate warning from the inadequate, likewise have turned out to be rather dim and ill defined.  The totality-of-the-circumstances approach, on the other hand, permits each fact to be taken into account without resort to formal and dispositive labels.  By dispensing with the difficulty of producing a yes-or-no answer to questions that are often better answered in shades and degrees,

				 should be preserved because the decision occupies a special place in the publics consciousness.  Brief for Petitioner 44.  As far as I am aware, the public is not under the illusion that we are infallible.  I see little harm in admitting that we made a mistake in taking away from the people the ability to decide for themselves what protections (beyond those required by the Constitution) are reasonably affordable in the criminal investigatory process.  And I see much to be gained by reaffirming for the people the wonderful reality that they govern themselveswhich means that [t]he powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution that the people adopted, nor prohibited … to the States by that Constitution, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people, U. S. Const., Amdt. 10.

				Todays judgment converts 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				from a milestone of judicial overreaching into the very Cheops Pyramid (or perhaps the Sphinx would be a better analogue) of judicial arrogance.  In imposing its Court-made code upon the States, the original opinion at least 
				<em>
					asserted
				</em>
				 that it was demanded by the Constitution.  Todays decision does not pretend that it isand yet 
				<em>
					still
				</em>
				 asserts the right to impose it against the will of the peoples representatives in Congress.  Far from believing that 
				<em>
					stare decisis
				</em>
				 compels this result, I believe we cannot allow to remain on the books even a celebrated decision
				<em>
					especially
				</em>
				 a celebrated decisionthat has come to stand for the proposition that the Supreme Court has power to impose extraconstitutional constraints upon Congress and the States.  This is not the system that was established by the Framers, or that would be established by any sane supporter of government by the people.

				I dissent from todays decision, and, until §3501 is repealed, will continue to apply it in all cases where there has been a sustainable finding that the defendants confession was voluntary.

						 As for Michigan v. Jackson, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/475/625" class="subref" title="subref">475 U. S. 625</a> (1986)
, upon which petitioner and the United States also rely, in that case we extended to the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a>, postindictment, context the Miranda-based prophylactic rule of Edwards v. Arizona, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/451/477" class="subref" title="subref">451 U. S. 477</a> (1981)
, that the police cannot initiate interrogation after counsel has been requested.  I think it less a separate instance of claimed judicial power to impose constitutional prophylaxis than a direct, logic-driven consequence of Miranda itself.

						 The Court cites my dissenting opinion in Mitchell v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/526/314" class="subref" title="subref">526 U. S. 314</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">331</a>332 (1999)
, for the proposition that the fact that a rule has found wide acceptance in the legal culture is adequate reason not to overrule it.  Ante, at 13.  But the legal culture is not the same as the publics consciousness; and unlike the rule at issue in Mitchell (prohibiting comment on a defendants refusal to testify) Miranda has been continually criticized by lawyers, law enforcement officials, and scholars since its pronouncement (not to mention by Congress, as §3501 shows).  In Mitchell, moreover, the constitutional underpinnings of the earlier rule had not been demolished by subsequent cases.

        <p class="bodytext">    Daniel Siebert was convicted and sentenced to death in the State of Alabama for the murder of Linda Jarman.

On August 25, 1992, Siebert filed a petition for postconviction relief in Alabama state court.

            </a>  The Alabama Supreme Court denied certiorari on September 15, 2000.  Siebert did not seek review in this Court.  On September 14, 2001, Siebert filed a petition for a federal writ of habeas corpus, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2254.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2254</a>, in the District Court for the Northern District of Alabama.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) established a 1-year statute of limitations for filing a federal habeas petition.  §2244(d)(1).  The limitations period is tolled, however, while a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending.  §2244(d)(2).  Because Sieberts direct appeal became final before AEDPA became effective, the 1-year limitations period began to run from April 24, 1996, AEDPAs effective date.  See <em>Carey</em> v. <em>Saffold</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/536/214" class="subref" title="subref">536 U. S. 214</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">217</a> (2002)
.  Thus, absent tolling, Sieberts federal habeas petition would be untimely by over four years.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The District Court dismissed Sieberts habeas petition as untimely, reasoning that an application for state postconviction relief is not properly filed if it was rejected by the state court on statute-of-limitations grounds.  The Court of Appeals reversed, however, holding that Sieberts state postconviction petition was properly filed within the meaning of §2244(d)(2), because the state time bar was not jurisdictional and the Alabama courts therefore had discretion in enforcing it.  See <em>Siebert</em> v. <em>Campbell</em>, 334 F. 3d 1018, 1030 (CA11 2003) <em>(per curiam)</em>.  The Court of Appeals accordingly remanded to the District Court to consider the merits of Sieberts petition.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    While Sieberts habeas petition was pending on remand in the District Court, we decided <em>Pace</em> v. <em>DiGuglielmo</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/544/408" class="subref" title="subref">544 U. S. 408</a> (2005)
.  In <em>Pace</em>, we held that a state postconviction petition rejected by the state court as untimely is not properly filed within the meaning of §2244(d)(2).  <em>Id.</em>, at 414, 417.  Relying on <em>Pace</em>, the District Court again found that Sieberts state postconviction petition was not properly filed, and dismissed his federal habeas petition as untimely.  The Court of Appeals, however, reversed and remanded.  In a one-paragraph opinion, the court distinguished <em>Pace</em> on the ground that Rule 32.2(c), unlike the statute of limitations at issue in <em>Pace</em>, operate[s] as an affirmative defense.  480 F. 3d 1089, 1090 (CA11 2007).  Thus, the court found its prior holdingthat Sieberts state postconviction petition was properly filed because the state court rejected it on a nonjurisdictional groundstood as the law of the case.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court of Appeals carve-out of time limits that operate as affirmative defenses is inconsistent with our holding in <em>Pace</em>.  Although the Pennsylvania statute of limitations at issue in <em>Pace</em> happens to have been a jurisdictional time bar under state law, see <em>Commonwealth</em> v. <em>Banks</em>, 556 Pa. 1, 56, 726 A. 2d 374, 376 (1999), the jurisdictional nature of the time limit was not the basis for our decision.  Rather, we built upon a distinction that we had earlier articulated in <em>Artuz</em> v. <em>Bennett</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/531/4" class="subref" title="subref">531 U. S. 4</a> (2000)
, between postconviction petitions rejected on the basis of  filing conditions, which are not properly filed under §2244(d)(2), and those rejected on the basis of procedural bars [that] go to the ability to obtain relief, which are.  <em>Pace</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 417 (citing <em>Artuz</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 1011).  We found that statutes of limitations are filing conditions because they go to the very initiation of a petition and a courts ability to consider that petition.  <em>Pace</em>, 544 U. S., at 417.  Thus, we held that time limits, <em>no matter their form</em>, are filing conditions, and that a state postconviction petition is therefore not properly filed if it was rejected by the state court as untimely.  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In short, our holding in <em>Pace</em> turned not on the nature of the particular time limit relied upon by the state court, but rather on the fact that time limits generally establish conditions to filing a petition for state postconviction relief.  Whether a time limit is jurisdictional, an affirmative defense, or something in between, it is a condition to filing, <em>Artuz</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 9it places a limit on how long a prisoner can wait before filing a postconviction petition.  The fact that Alabamas Rule 32.2(c) is an affirmative defense that can be waived (or is subject to equitable tolling) renders it no less a filing requirement than a jurisdictional time bar would be; it only makes it a less stringent one.  Indeed, in <em>Pace</em> we cited the very statute at issue in this case as an example of such a filing requirement.  See 544 U. S., at 417, n. 7 (citing 2 Ala. Rule Crim. Proc. 32.2(c) (20042005)).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Excluding from <em>Pace</em>s scope those time limits that operate as affirmative defenses would leave a gaping hole in what we plainly meant to be a general rule, as statutes of limitations are often affirmative defenses.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(c); <em>Kirkland</em> v. <em>State</em>, 143 Idaho 544, 546, 149 P. 3d 819, 821 (2006) (The statute of limitations for petitions for post-conviction relief is not jurisdictional.  It is an affirmative defense that may be waived if it is not pleaded by the defendant  (quoting <em>Cole</em> v. <em>State</em>, 135 Idaho 107, 110, 15 P. 3d 820, 823 (2000); citation omitted)); <em>People</em> v. <em>Boclair</em>, 202 Ill. 2d 89, 101, 789 N. E. 2d 734, 742 (2002) (holding that time bar for filing postconviction petition is an affirmative defense and can be raised, waived, or forfeited, by the State).  What is more, whether a time limit is jurisdictional or an affirmative defense is often a disputed question, as the interpretive history of Rule 32.2(c) itself illustrates, see <em>Ex parte Ward</em>, No. 1051818, 2007 WL 1576054, *6 (Ala., June 1, 2007) (noting confusion in the Alabama lower courts over whether Rule 32.2(c) is jurisdictional).  Under the Court of Appeals approach, federal habeas courts would have to delve into the intricacies of state procedural law in deciding whether a postconviction petition rejected by the state courts as untimely was nonetheless properly filed under §2244(d)(2).  Our decision in <em>Pace</em> precludes such an approach.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    We therefore reiterate now what we held in <em>Pace</em>: When a postconviction petition is untimely under state law, that [is] the end of the matter for purposes of §2244(d)(2).  544 U. S., at 414 (quoting <em>Carey</em>, 536 U. S., at 226; alteration in original).  Because Sieberts petition for state postconviction relief was rejected as untimely by the Alabama courts, it was not properly filed under §2244(d)(2).  Accordingly, he was not entitled to tolling of AEDPAs 1-year statute of limitations.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The petition for certiorari is granted.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>
        <p class="CASCTG-right">It is so ordered.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    While Sieberts habeas petition was pending on remand in the District Court, we decided <em>Pace</em> v. <em>DiGuglielmo</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/544/408" class="subref" title="subref">544 U. S. 408</a> (2005)
.  In <em>Pace</em>, we held that a state postconviction petition rejected by the state court as untimely is not properly filed within the meaning of §2244(d)(2).  <em>Id.</em>, at 414, 417.  Relying on <em>Pace</em>, the District Court again found that Sieberts state postconviction petition was not properly filed, and dismissed his federal habeas petition as untimely.  The Court of Appeals, however, reversed and remanded.  In a one-paragraph opinion, the court distinguished <em>Pace</em> on the ground that Rule 32.2(c), unlike the statute of limitations at issue in <em>Pace</em>, operate[s] as an affirmative defense.  480 F. 3d 1089, 1090 (CA11 2007).  Thus, the court found its prior holdingthat Sieberts state postconviction petition was properly filed because the state court rejected it on a nonjurisdictional groundstood as the law of the case.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court of Appeals carve-out of time limits that operate as affirmative defenses is inconsistent with our holding in <em>Pace</em>.  Although the Pennsylvania statute of limitations at issue in <em>Pace</em> happens to have been a jurisdictional time bar under state law, see <em>Commonwealth</em> v. <em>Banks</em>, 556 Pa. 1, 56, 726 A. 2d 374, 376 (1999), the jurisdictional nature of the time limit was not the basis for our decision.  Rather, we built upon a distinction that we had earlier articulated in <em>Artuz</em> v. <em>Bennett</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/531/4" class="subref" title="subref">531 U. S. 4</a> (2000)
, between postconviction petitions rejected on the basis of  filing conditions, which are not properly filed under §2244(d)(2), and those rejected on the basis of procedural bars [that] go to the ability to obtain relief, which are.  <em>Pace</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 417 (citing <em>Artuz</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 1011).  We found that statutes of limitations are filing conditions because they go to the very initiation of a petition and a courts ability to consider that petition.  <em>Pace</em>, 544 U. S., at 417.  Thus, we held that time limits, <em>no matter their form</em>, are filing conditions, and that a state postconviction petition is therefore not properly filed if it was rejected by the state court as untimely.  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In short, our holding in <em>Pace</em> turned not on the nature of the particular time limit relied upon by the state court, but rather on the fact that time limits generally establish conditions to filing a petition for state postconviction relief.  Whether a time limit is jurisdictional, an affirmative defense, or something in between, it is a condition to filing, <em>Artuz</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 9it places a limit on how long a prisoner can wait before filing a postconviction petition.  The fact that Alabamas Rule 32.2(c) is an affirmative defense that can be waived (or is subject to equitable tolling) renders it no less a filing requirement than a jurisdictional time bar would be; it only makes it a less stringent one.  Indeed, in <em>Pace</em> we cited the very statute at issue in this case as an example of such a filing requirement.  See 544 U. S., at 417, n. 7 (citing 2 Ala. Rule Crim. Proc. 32.2(c) (20042005)).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Excluding from <em>Pace</em>s scope those time limits that operate as affirmative defenses would leave a gaping hole in what we plainly meant to be a general rule, as statutes of limitations are often affirmative defenses.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(c); <em>Kirkland</em> v. <em>State</em>, 143 Idaho 544, 546, 149 P. 3d 819, 821 (2006) (The statute of limitations for petitions for post-conviction relief is not jurisdictional.  It is an affirmative defense that may be waived if it is not pleaded by the defendant  (quoting <em>Cole</em> v. <em>State</em>, 135 Idaho 107, 110, 15 P. 3d 820, 823 (2000); citation omitted)); <em>People</em> v. <em>Boclair</em>, 202 Ill. 2d 89, 101, 789 N. E. 2d 734, 742 (2002) (holding that time bar for filing postconviction petition is an affirmative defense and can be raised, waived, or forfeited, by the State).  What is more, whether a time limit is jurisdictional or an affirmative defense is often a disputed question, as the interpretive history of Rule 32.2(c) itself illustrates, see <em>Ex parte Ward</em>, No. 1051818, 2007 WL 1576054, *6 (Ala., June 1, 2007) (noting confusion in the Alabama lower courts over whether Rule 32.2(c) is jurisdictional).  Under the Court of Appeals approach, federal habeas courts would have to delve into the intricacies of state procedural law in deciding whether a postconviction petition rejected by the state courts as untimely was nonetheless properly filed under §2244(d)(2).  Our decision in <em>Pace</em> precludes such an approach.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    We therefore reiterate now what we held in <em>Pace</em>: When a postconviction petition is untimely under state law, that [is] the end of the matter for purposes of §2244(d)(2).  544 U. S., at 414 (quoting <em>Carey</em>, 536 U. S., at 226; alteration in original).  Because Sieberts petition for state postconviction relief was rejected as untimely by the Alabama courts, it was not properly filed under §2244(d)(2).  Accordingly, he was not entitled to tolling of AEDPAs 1-year statute of limitations.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The petition for certiorari is granted.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>

            </a>  The Alabama Supreme Court denied certiorari on September 15, 2000.  Siebert did not seek review in this Court.  On September 14, 2001, Siebert filed a petition for a federal writ of habeas corpus, see

        <p class="bodytext">    The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) established a 1-year statute of limitations for filing a federal habeas petition.  §2244(d)(1).  The limitations period is tolled, however, while a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending.  §2244(d)(2).  Because Sieberts direct appeal became final before AEDPA became effective, the 1-year limitations period began to run from April 24, 1996, AEDPAs effective date.

Proc. 8(c); <em>Kirkland</em> v. <em>State</em>, 143 Idaho 544, 546, 149 P. 3d 819, 821 (2006) (The statute of limitations for petitions for post-conviction relief is not jurisdictional.  It is an affirmative defense that may be waived if it is not pleaded by the defendant  (quoting <em>Cole</em> v. <em>State</em>, 135 Idaho 107, 110, 15 P. 3d 820, 823 (2000); citation omitted)); <em>People</em> v. <em>Boclair</em>, 202 Ill. 2d 89, 101, 789 N. E. 2d 734, 742 (2002) (holding that time bar for filing postconviction petition is an affirmative defense and can be raised, waived, or forfeited, by the State).  What is more, whether a time limit is jurisdictional or an affirmative defense is often a disputed question, as the interpretive history of Rule 32.2(c) itself illustrates, see <em>Ex parte Ward</em>, No. 1051818, 2007 WL 1576054, *6 (Ala., June 1, 2007) (noting confusion in the Alabama lower courts over whether Rule 32.2(c) is jurisdictional).  Under the Court of Appeals approach, federal habeas courts would have to delve into the intricacies of state procedural law in deciding whether a postconviction petition rejected by the state courts as untimely was nonetheless properly filed under §2244(d)(2).  Our decision in <em>Pace</em> precludes such an approach.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    We therefore reiterate now what we held in <em>Pace</em>: When a postconviction petition is untimely under state law, that [is] the end of the matter for purposes of §2244(d)(2).  544 U. S., at 414 (quoting <em>Carey</em>, 536 U. S., at 226; alteration in original).  Because Sieberts petition for state postconviction relief was rejected as untimely by the Alabama courts, it was not properly filed under §2244(d)(2).  Accordingly, he was not entitled to tolling of AEDPAs 1-year statute of limitations.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The petition for certiorari is granted.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>
        <p class="CASCTG-right">It is so ordered.</p>

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZPC-*" href="#ZPC-*ref">*</a>* At the time Sieberts petition was before the Alabama courts, Rule 32.2(c) provided that the court shall not entertain any petition, with certain exceptions not applicable here, unless the petition is filed … within two (2) years after the issuance of the certificate of judgment by the Court of Criminal Appeals.  The statute has since been amended to provide for a 1-year limitations period, but is otherwise unchanged.  See 1 Ala. Rule Crim. Proc. 32.2(c) (20072008).

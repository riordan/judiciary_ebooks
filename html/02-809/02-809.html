				A police officer stopped a car for speeding at 3:16 a.m.; searched the car, seizing $763 from the glove compartment and cocaine from behind the back-seat armrest; and arrested the cars three occupants after they denied ownership of the drugs and money.  Respondent Pringle, the front-seat passenger, was convicted of possession with intent to distribute cocaine and possession of cocaine, and was sentenced to 10 years incarceration without the possibility of parole.  The Maryland Court of Special Appeals affirmed, but the State Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, absent specific facts tending to show Pringles knowledge and dominion or control over the drugs, the mere finding of cocaine in the back armrest when Pringle was a front-seat passenger in a car being driven by its owner was insufficient to establish probable cause for an arrest for possession.

				In the early morning hours a passenger car occupied by three men was stopped for speeding by a police officer.  The officer, upon searching the car, seized $763 of rolled-up cash from the glove compartment and five glassine baggies of cocaine from between the back-seat armrest and the back seat.  After all three men denied ownership of the cocaine and money, the officer arrested each of them.  We hold that the officer had probable cause to arrest Pringleone of the three men.

				At 3:16 a.m. on August 7, 1999, a Baltimore County Police officer stopped a Nissan Maxima for speeding.  There were three occupants in the car: Donte Partlow, the driver and owner, respondent Pringle, the front-seat passenger, and Otis Smith, the back-seat passenger.  The officer asked Partlow for his license and registration.  When Partlow opened the glove compartment to retrieve the vehicle registration, the officer observed a large amount of rolled-up money in the glove compartment.  The officer returned to his patrol car with Partlows license and registration to check the computer system for outstanding violations.  The computer check did not reveal any violations.  The officer returned to the stopped car, had Partlow get out, and issued him an oral warning.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				After a second patrol car arrived, the officer asked Partlow if he had any weapons or narcotics in the vehicle.  Partlow indicated that he did not.  Partlow then consented to a search of the vehicle.  The search yielded $763 from the glove compartment and five plastic glassine baggies containing cocaine from behind the back-seat armrest.  When the officer began the search the armrest was in the upright position flat against the rear seat.  The officer pulled down the armrest and found the drugs, which had been placed between the armrest and the back seat of the car.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The officer questioned all three men about the ownership of the drugs and money, and told them that if no one admitted to ownership of the drugs he was going to arrest them all.  The men offered no information regarding the ownership of the drugs or money.  All three were placed under arrest and transported to the police station.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Later that morning, Pringle waived his rights under 
				<em>

, and gave an oral and written confession in which he acknowledged that the cocaine belonged to him, that he and his friends were going to a party, and that he intended to sell the cocaine or [u]se it for sex.  App. 26.  Pringle maintained that the other occupants of the car did not know about the drugs, and they were released.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The trial court denied Pringles motion to suppress his confession as the fruit of an illegal arrest, holding that the officer had probable cause to arrest Pringle.  A jury convicted Pringle of possession with intent to distribute cocaine and possession of cocaine.  He was sentenced to 10 years incarceration without the possibility of parole.  The Court of Special Appeals of Maryland affirmed.  141 Md. App. 292, 785 A. 2d 790 (2001).

				As early as 
				<em>

				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>

				 7 Cranch 339, 348 (1813), Chief Justice Marshall observed, in a closely related context: [T]he term probable cause, according to its usual acceptation, means less than evidence which would justify condemnation … .  It imports a seizure made under circumstances which warrant suspicion.  More recently, we said that the

				  Five plastic glassine baggies of cocaine were behind the back-seat armrest and accessible to all three men.  Upon questioning, the three men failed to offer any information with respect to the ownership of the cocaine or the money.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We think it an entirely reasonable inference from these facts that any or all three of the occupants had knowledge of, and exercised dominion and control over, the cocaine.  Thus a reasonable officer could conclude that there was probable cause to believe Pringle committed the crime of possession of cocaine, either solely or jointly.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Pringles attempt to characterize this case as a guilt-by-association case is unavailing.  His reliance on

, is misplaced.  In 
				<em>
					Ybarra
				</em>
				, police officers obtained a warrant to search a tavern and its bartender for evidence of possession of a controlled substance.  Upon entering the tavern, the officers conducted patdown searches of the customers present in the tavern, including Ybarra.  Inside a cigarette pack retrieved from Ybarras pocket, an officer found six tinfoil packets containing heroin.  We stated:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">

.  Where the standard is probable cause, a search or seizure of a person must be supported by probable cause particularized with respect to that person.  This requirement cannot be undercut or avoided by simply pointing to the fact that coincidentally there exists probable cause to search or seize another or to search the premises where the person may happen to be.  444 U.

				This case is quite different from

				.  Pringle and his two companions were in a relatively small automobile, not a public tavern.  In

, we noted that a car passengerunlike the unwitting tavern patron in 
				<em>
					Ybarra
				</em>
				will often be engaged in a common enterprise with the driver, and have the same interest in concealing the fruits or the evidence of their wrongdoing.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 304305.  Here we think it was reasonable for the officer to infer a common enterprise among the three men.  The quantity of drugs and cash in the car indicated the likelihood of drug dealing, an enterprise to which a dealer would be unlikely to admit an innocent person with the potential to furnish evidence against him.  
				    
				In 
				<em>
					Di Re
				</em>
				, a federal investigator had been told by an informant, Reed, that he was to receive counterfeit gasoline ration coupons from a certain Buttitta at a particular place.  The investigator went to the appointed place and saw Reed, the sole occupant of the rear seat of the car, holding gasoline ration coupons.  There were two other occupants in the car: Buttitta in the drivers seat and Di Re in the front passengers seat.  Reed informed the investigator that Buttitta had given him counterfeit coupons.  Thereupon, all three men were arrested and searched.  After noting that the officers had no information implicating Di Re and no information pointing to Di Res possession of coupons, unless presence in the car warranted that inference, we concluded that the officer lacked probable cause to believe that Di Re was involved in the crime.  332 U. S., at 592594.  We said [a]ny inference that everyone on the scene of a crime is a party to it must disappear if the Government informer singles out the guilty person.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 594.  No such singling out occurred in this case; none of the three men provided information with respect to the ownership of the cocaine or money.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We hold that the officer had probable cause to believe that Pringle had committed the crime of possession of a controlled substance.  Pringles arrest therefore did not contravene the Fourth and 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>s.  Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals of Maryland is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

				In the early morning hours a passenger car occupied by three men was stopped for speeding by a police officer.  The officer, upon searching the car, seized $763 of rolled-up cash from the glove compartment and five glassine baggies of cocaine from between the back-seat armrest and the back seat.  After all three men denied ownership of the cocaine and money, the officer arrested each of them.  We hold that the officer had probable cause to arrest Pringleone of the three men.

				At 3:16 a.m. on August 7, 1999, a Baltimore County Police officer stopped a Nissan Maxima for speeding.  There were three occupants in the car: Donte Partlow, the driver and owner, respondent Pringle, the front-seat passenger, and Otis Smith, the back-seat passenger.  The officer asked Partlow for his license and registration.  When Partlow opened the glove compartment to retrieve the vehicle registration, the officer observed a large amount of rolled-up money in the glove compartment.  The officer returned to his patrol car with Partlows license and registration to check the computer system for outstanding violations.  The computer check did not reveal any violations.  The officer returned to the stopped car, had Partlow get out, and issued him an oral warning.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				After a second patrol car arrived, the officer asked Partlow if he had any weapons or narcotics in the vehicle.  Partlow indicated that he did not.  Partlow then consented to a search of the vehicle.  The search yielded $763 from the glove compartment and five plastic glassine baggies containing cocaine from behind the back-seat armrest.  When the officer began the search the armrest was in the upright position flat against the rear seat.  The officer pulled down the armrest and found the drugs, which had been placed between the armrest and the back seat of the car.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The officer questioned all three men about the ownership of the drugs and money, and told them that if no one admitted to ownership of the drugs he was going to arrest them all.  The men offered no information regarding the ownership of the drugs or money.  All three were placed under arrest and transported to the police station.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Later that morning, Pringle waived his rights under 
				<em>

, and gave an oral and written confession in which he acknowledged that the cocaine belonged to him, that he and his friends were going to a party, and that he intended to sell the cocaine or [u]se it for sex.  App. 26.  Pringle maintained that the other occupants of the car did not know about the drugs, and they were released.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The trial court denied Pringles motion to suppress his confession as the fruit of an illegal arrest, holding that the officer had probable cause to arrest Pringle.  A jury convicted Pringle of possession with intent to distribute cocaine and possession of cocaine.  He was sentenced to 10 years incarceration without the possibility of parole.  The Court of Special Appeals of Maryland affirmed.  141 Md. App. 292, 785 A. 2d 790 (2001).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court of Appeals of Maryland, by divided vote, reversed, holding that, absent specific facts tending to show Pringles knowledge and dominion or control over the drugs, the mere finding of cocaine in the back armrest when [Pringle] was a front seat passenger in a car being driven by its owner is insufficient to establish probable cause for an arrest for possession.  370 Md. 525, 545, 805 A. 2d 1016, 1027 (2002).

				It is uncontested in the present case that the officer, upon recovering the five plastic glassine baggies containing suspected cocaine, had probable cause to believe a felony had been committed.  Md. Ann. Code, Art. 27, §287 (1996) (repealed 2002) (prohibiting possession of controlled dangerous substances).  The sole question is whether the officer had probable cause to believe that Pringle committed that crime.

				As early as 
				<em>

				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>

				</em>
				 7 Cranch 339, 348 (1813), Chief Justice Marshall observed, in a closely related context: [T]he term probable cause, according to its usual acceptation, means less than evidence which would justify condemnation … .  It imports a seizure made under circumstances which warrant suspicion.  More recently, we said that the

				  Five plastic glassine baggies of cocaine were behind the back-seat armrest and accessible to all three men.  Upon questioning, the three men failed to offer any information with respect to the ownership of the cocaine or the money.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We think it an entirely reasonable inference from these facts that any or all three of the occupants had knowledge of, and exercised dominion and control over, the cocaine.  Thus a reasonable officer could conclude that there was probable cause to believe Pringle committed the crime of possession of cocaine, either solely or jointly.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Pringles attempt to characterize this case as a guilt-by-association case is unavailing.  His reliance on

, is misplaced.  In 
				<em>
					Ybarra
				</em>
				, police officers obtained a warrant to search a tavern and its bartender for evidence of possession of a controlled substance.  Upon entering the tavern, the officers conducted patdown searches of the customers present in the tavern, including Ybarra.  Inside a cigarette pack retrieved from Ybarras pocket, an officer found six tinfoil packets containing heroin.  We stated:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				[A] persons mere propinquity to others independently suspected of criminal activity does not, without more, give rise to probable cause to search that person.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">62</a>63 (1968)
.  Where the standard is probable cause, a search or seizure of a person must be supported by probable cause particularized with respect to that person.  This requirement cannot be undercut or avoided by simply pointing to the fact that coincidentally there exists probable cause to search or seize another or to search the premises where the person may happen to be.  444 U. S., at 91.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">

				This case is quite different from

, we noted that a car passengerunlike the unwitting tavern patron in 
				<em>
					Ybarra
				</em>
				will often be engaged in a common enterprise with the driver, and have the same interest in concealing the fruits or the evidence of their wrongdoing.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 304305.  Here we think it was reasonable for the officer to infer a common enterprise among the three men.  The quantity of drugs and cash in the car indicated the likelihood of drug dealing, an enterprise to which a dealer would be unlikely to admit an innocent person with the potential to furnish evidence against him.  
				    
				In 
				<em>
					Di Re
				</em>
				, a federal investigator had been told by an informant, Reed, that he was to receive counterfeit gasoline ration coupons from a certain Buttitta at a particular place.  The investigator went to the appointed place and saw Reed, the sole occupant of the rear seat of the car, holding gasoline ration coupons.  There were two other occupants in the car: Buttitta in the drivers seat and Di Re in the front passengers seat.  Reed informed the investigator that Buttitta had given him counterfeit coupons.  Thereupon, all three men were arrested and searched.  After noting that the officers had no information implicating Di Re and no information pointing to Di Res possession of coupons, unless presence in the car warranted that inference, we concluded that the officer lacked probable cause to believe that Di Re was involved in the crime.  332 U. S., at 592594.  We said [a]ny inference that everyone on the scene of a crime is a party to it must disappear if the Government informer singles out the guilty person.  
				<em>
					Id.

				, at 594.  No such singling out occurred in this case; none of the three men provided information with respect to the ownership of the cocaine or money.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We hold that the officer had probable cause to believe that Pringle had committed the crime of possession of a controlled substance.  Pringles arrest therefore did not contravene the Fourth and 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>s.  Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals of Maryland is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

				We think it an entirely reasonable inference from these facts that any or all three of the occupants had knowledge of, and exercised dominion and control over, the cocaine.

Upon entering the tavern, the officers conducted patdown searches of the customers present in the tavern, including Ybarra.

				will often be engaged in a common enterprise with the driver, and have the same interest in concealing the fruits or the evidence of their wrongdoing.  
				<em>
					Id.,

				 at 304305.  Here we think it was reasonable for the officer to infer a common enterprise among the three men.

				In

The investigator went to the appointed place and saw Reed, the sole occupant of the rear seat of the car, holding gasoline ration coupons.  There were two other occupants in the car: Buttitta in the drivers seat and Di Re in the front passengers seat.  Reed informed the investigator that Buttitta had given him counterfeit coupons.  Thereupon, all three men were arrested and searched.  After noting that the officers had no information implicating Di Re and no information pointing to Di Res possession of coupons, unless presence in the car warranted that inference, we concluded that the officer lacked probable cause to believe that Di Re was involved in the crime.  332 U. S., at 592594.  We said [a]ny inference that everyone on the scene of a crime is a party to it must disappear if the Government informer singles out the guilty person.

				In the early morning hours a passenger car occupied by three men was stopped for speeding by a police officer.  The officer, upon searching the car, seized $763 of rolled-up cash from the glove compartment and five glassine baggies of cocaine from between the back-seat armrest and the back seat.

				At 3:16 a.m. on August 7, 1999, a Baltimore County Police officer stopped a Nissan Maxima for speeding.  There were three occupants in the car: Donte Partlow, the driver and owner, respondent Pringle, the front-seat passenger, and Otis Smith, the back-seat passenger.  The officer asked Partlow for his license and registration.  When Partlow opened the glove compartment to retrieve the vehicle registration, the officer observed a large amount of rolled-up money in the glove compartment.  The officer returned to his patrol car with Partlows license and registration to check the computer system for outstanding violations.  The computer check did not reveal any violations.  The officer returned to the stopped car, had Partlow get out, and issued him an oral warning.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				After a second patrol car arrived, the officer asked Partlow if he had any weapons or narcotics in the vehicle.  Partlow indicated that he did not.  Partlow then consented to a search of the vehicle.  The search yielded $763 from the glove compartment and five plastic glassine baggies containing cocaine from behind the back-seat armrest.  When the officer began the search the armrest was in the upright position flat against the rear seat.  The officer pulled down the armrest and found the drugs, which had been placed between the armrest and the back seat of the car.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The officer questioned all three men about the ownership of the drugs and money, and told them that if no one admitted to ownership of the drugs he was going to arrest them all.

				We think it an entirely reasonable inference from these facts that any or all three of the occupants had knowledge of, and exercised dominion and control over, the cocaine.

Upon entering the tavern, the officers conducted patdown searches of the customers present in the tavern, including Ybarra.  Inside a cigarette pack retrieved from Ybarras pocket, an officer found six tinfoil packets containing heroin.  We stated:

				</em>
				will often be engaged in a common enterprise with the driver, and have the same interest in concealing the fruits or the evidence of their wrongdoing.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 304305.  Here we think it was reasonable for the officer to infer a common enterprise among the three men.  The quantity of drugs and cash in the car indicated the likelihood of drug dealing, an enterprise to which a dealer would be unlikely to admit an innocent person with the potential to furnish evidence against him.  
				    
				In 
				<em>
					Di Re
				</em>
				, a federal investigator had been told by an informant, Reed, that he was to receive counterfeit gasoline ration coupons from a certain Buttitta at a particular place.  The investigator went to the appointed place and saw Reed, the sole occupant of the rear seat of the car, holding gasoline ration coupons.  There were two other occupants in the car: Buttitta in the drivers seat and Di Re in the front passengers seat.  Reed informed the investigator that Buttitta had given him counterfeit coupons.  Thereupon, all three men were arrested and searched.  After noting that the officers had no information implicating Di Re and no information pointing to Di Res possession of coupons, unless presence in the car warranted that inference, we concluded that the officer lacked probable cause to believe that Di Re was involved in the crime.  332 U. S., at 592594.  We said [a]ny inference that everyone on the scene of a crime is a party to it must disappear if the Government informer singles out the guilty person.

				In the early morning hours a passenger car occupied by three men was stopped for speeding by a police officer.  The officer, upon searching the car, seized $763 of rolled-up cash from the glove compartment and five glassine baggies of cocaine from between the back-seat armrest and the back seat.  After all three men denied ownership of the cocaine and money, the officer arrested each of them.  We hold that the officer had probable cause to arrest Pringleone of the three men.

				At 3:16 a.m. on August 7, 1999, a Baltimore County Police officer stopped a Nissan Maxima for speeding.  There were three occupants in the car: Donte Partlow, the driver and owner, respondent Pringle, the front-seat passenger, and Otis Smith, the back-seat passenger.  The officer asked Partlow for his license and registration.  When Partlow opened the glove compartment to retrieve the vehicle registration, the officer observed a large amount of rolled-up money in the glove compartment.  The officer returned to his patrol car with Partlows license and registration to check the computer system for outstanding violations.  The computer check did not reveal any violations.  The officer returned to the stopped car, had Partlow get out, and issued him an oral warning.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				After a second patrol car arrived, the officer asked Partlow if he had any weapons or narcotics in the vehicle.  Partlow indicated that he did not.  Partlow then consented to a search of the vehicle.  The search yielded $763 from the glove compartment and five plastic glassine baggies containing cocaine from behind the back-seat armrest.  When the officer began the search the armrest was in the upright position flat against the rear seat.  The officer pulled down the armrest and found the drugs, which had been placed between the armrest and the back seat of the car.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The officer questioned all three men about the ownership of the drugs and money, and told them that if no one admitted to ownership of the drugs he was going to arrest them all.  The men offered no information regarding the ownership of the drugs or money.  All three were placed under arrest and transported to the police station.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Later that morning, Pringle waived his rights under 
				<em>
					Miranda

, and gave an oral and written confession in which he acknowledged that the cocaine belonged to him, that he and his friends were going to a party, and that he intended to sell the cocaine or [u]se it for sex.  App. 26.  Pringle maintained that the other occupants of the car did not know about the drugs, and they were released.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The trial court denied Pringles motion to suppress his confession as the fruit of an illegal arrest, holding that the officer had probable cause to arrest Pringle.  A jury convicted Pringle of possession with intent to distribute cocaine and possession of cocaine.  He was sentenced to 10 years incarceration without the possibility of parole.  The Court of Special Appeals of Maryland affirmed.  141 Md. App. 292, 785 A. 2d 790 (2001).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court of Appeals of Maryland, by divided vote, reversed, holding that, absent specific facts tending to show Pringles knowledge and dominion or control over the drugs, the mere finding of cocaine in the back armrest when [Pringle] was a front seat passenger in a car being driven by its owner is insufficient to establish probable cause for an arrest for possession.  370 Md. 525, 545, 805 A. 2d 1016, 1027 (2002).

				In this case, Pringle was one of three men riding in a Nissan Maxima at 3:16 a.m.  There was $763 of rolled-up cash in the glove compartment directly in front of Pringle.

				  Five plastic glassine baggies of cocaine were behind the back-seat armrest and accessible to all three men.  Upon questioning, the three men failed to offer any information with respect to the ownership of the cocaine or the money.

				We think it an entirely reasonable inference from these facts that any or all three of the occupants had knowledge of, and exercised dominion and control over, the cocaine.  Thus a reasonable officer could conclude that there was probable cause to believe Pringle committed the crime of possession of cocaine, either solely or jointly.

, is misplaced.  In 
				<em>
					Ybarra
				</em>
				, police officers obtained a warrant to search a tavern and its bartender for evidence of possession of a controlled substance.  Upon entering the tavern, the officers conducted patdown searches of the customers present in the tavern, including Ybarra.  Inside a cigarette pack retrieved from Ybarras pocket, an officer found six tinfoil packets containing heroin.  We stated:

        <p class="bodytext">

.  Where the standard is probable cause, a search or seizure of a person must be supported by probable cause particularized with respect to that person.  This requirement cannot be undercut or avoided by simply pointing to the fact that coincidentally there exists probable cause to search or seize another or to search the premises where the person may happen to be.  444 U.

				</em>
				will often be engaged in a common enterprise with the driver, and have the same interest in concealing the fruits or the evidence of their wrongdoing.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 304305.  Here we think it was reasonable for the officer to infer a common enterprise among the three men.  The quantity of drugs and cash in the car indicated the likelihood of drug dealing, an enterprise to which a dealer would be unlikely to admit an innocent person with the potential to furnish evidence against him.  
				    
				In 
				<em>
					Di Re
				</em>
				, a federal investigator had been told by an informant, Reed, that he was to receive counterfeit gasoline ration coupons from a certain Buttitta at a particular place.  The investigator went to the appointed place and saw Reed, the sole occupant of the rear seat of the car, holding gasoline ration coupons.  There were two other occupants in the car: Buttitta in the drivers seat and Di Re in the front passengers seat.  Reed informed the investigator that Buttitta had given him counterfeit coupons.  Thereupon, all three men were arrested and searched.  After noting that the officers had no information implicating Di Re and no information pointing to Di Res possession of coupons, unless presence in the car warranted that inference, we concluded that the officer lacked probable cause to believe that Di Re was involved in the crime.  332 U. S., at 592594.  We said [a]ny inference that everyone on the scene of a crime is a party to it must disappear if the Government informer singles out the guilty person.

						 The Court of Appeals of Maryland dismissed the $763 seized from the glove compartment as a factor in the probable-cause determination, stating that [m]oney, without more, is innocuous.  370 Md. 524, 546, 805 A. 2d 1016, 1028 (2002).  The courts consideration of the money in isolation, rather than as a factor in the totality of the circumstances, is mistaken in light of our precedents.  See, e.g., Illinois v. Gates,

 (Probable cause exists where the facts and circumstances within their [the officers] knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information [are] sufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that an offense has been or is being committed).  We think it is abundantly clear from the facts that this case involves more than money alone.

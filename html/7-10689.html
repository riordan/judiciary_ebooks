        <p class="bodytext">    James Eric Moore was convicted of one count of possessing cocaine base with intent to distribute, a violation of

Given the quantity of crack cocaine, the presentence report calculated that Moores sentencing range under the United States Sentencing Guidelines was 151 to 188 months.  At sentencing, Moore asked the District Court to impose a below-Guidelines sentence in light of our decision in <em>United States</em> v. <em>Booker</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/543/220" class="subref" title="subref">543 U. S. 220</a> (2005)
, and the Guidelines disparate treatment of similar amounts of crack and powder cocaine.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The District Court refused, saying:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">With regard to the crack and powder cocaine difference, that is the law.  Im applying the law as it currently stands.  If that is going to be changed, that is a congressional matter.  Congress is the one who looks at the guidelines and decides whether or not they should be put inin force… . It isnt the judges.  Its the lawmakers, and I have taken an oath to apply the law, and thats what I will do in this sentencing.  App. C to Pet. for Cert. 5556.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
The District Court sentenced Moore to 188 months of imprisonment and six years of supervised release.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Moore appealed, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed his conviction and sentence.  <em>United States </em>v. <em>Moore</em>, 470 F. 3d 767 (2006).  In response to his claim that the District Court should have considered the crack/powder disparity, the Court of Appeals held that the district court was correct in concluding that neither <em>Booker</em> nor [18 U. S. C.] §3553(a) authorizes district courts to reject the powder cocaine to crack cocaine quantity ratio mandated by Congress and reflected in the Guidelines.  <em>Id.,</em> at 770 (quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Spears</em>, 469 F. 3d 1166, 1176 (CA8 2006) (en banc)).  Moore filed a petition for certiorari with this Court.  Pet. for Cert. in <em>Moore</em> v. <em>United States</em>, No. 069749.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    While Moores certiorari petition was pending, this Court issued its opinion in <em>Kimbrough</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 552 U.

We granted Moores petition, vacated the judgment, and remanded the case to the Eighth Circuit for further consideration in light of <em>Kimbrough</em>.  <em>Moore</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 552 U. S. ___ (2008).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    On remand, without new briefing, the Eighth Circuit affirmed again.  518 F. 3d 577 (2008).  This time, the Court of Appeals concluded that [a]s there was then no circuit authority to the contrary, we presume the district court was aware that <em>Booker</em> granted it discretion to vary downward based upon the impact of the crack cocaine guidelines on this defendant, but elected not to exercise that discretion.  <em>Id</em>., at 580.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Proceeding <em>pro se</em>, Moore again petitioned for certiorari, arguing that the Eighth Circuits new characterization of the transcript is wrong, and that it is clear that the district court thought judges had no discre[t]ion to reject the Guidelines ratio.  Pet. for Cert. 7.  The United States agrees that the Eighth Circuit erred, see Brief for United States 9, and so do we.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    When the District Court said that [i]t isnt the judges but Congress that looks at the [G]uidelines and decides whether or not they should be put … in force, the court showed that it did not think it had the discretion later upheld by <em>Kimbrough</em>.  App. C to Pet. for Cert. 56.  The Eighth Circuits first decision recognized this, describing the District Court as concluding (correctly under circuit precedent) that it was not authorize[d] . . . to reject the crack/powder disparity.  <em>Moore,</em> 470 F. 3d, at 770 (internal quotation marks omitted).  In light of the District Courts comments at sentencing, the Court of Appeals should have remanded the case to the District Court for resentencing under <em>Kimbrough</em>.  We express no views on how the District Court should exercise its discretion at resentencing.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to proceed <em>in</em>

        <p class="bodytext">With regard to the crack and powder cocaine difference, that is the law.  Im applying the law as it currently stands.  If that is going to be changed, that is a congressional matter.  Congress is the one who looks at the guidelines and decides whether or not they should be put inin force… . It isnt the judges.  Its the lawmakers, and I have taken an oath to apply the law, and thats what I will do in this sentencing.  App. C to Pet. for Cert. 5556.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
The District Court sentenced Moore to 188 months of imprisonment and six years of supervised release.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Moore appealed, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed his conviction and sentence.  <em>United States </em>v. <em>Moore</em>, 470 F. 3d 767 (2006).  In response to his claim that the District Court should have considered the crack/powder disparity, the Court of Appeals held that the district court was correct in concluding that neither <em>Booker</em> nor [18 U. S. C.] §3553(a) authorizes district courts to reject the powder cocaine to crack cocaine quantity ratio mandated by Congress and reflected in the Guidelines.  <em>Id.,</em> at 770 (quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Spears</em>, 469 F. 3d 1166, 1176 (CA8 2006) (en banc)).  Moore filed a petition for certiorari with this Court.  Pet. for Cert. in <em>Moore</em> v. <em>United States</em>, No. 069749.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    While Moores certiorari petition was pending, this Court issued its opinion in <em>Kimbrough</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 552 U. S. ___ (2007), concluding that a judge may consider the disparity between the Guidelines treatment of crack and powder cocaine offenses when applying 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/3553.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. §3553(a)</a>, even in a mine-run case.  <em>Id.,</em> at ___, ___ (slip op., at 2, 21).  We granted Moores petition, vacated the judgment, and remanded the case to the Eighth Circuit for further consideration in light of <em>Kimbrough</em>.  <em>Moore</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 552 U. S. ___ (2008).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    On remand, without new briefing, the Eighth Circuit affirmed again.  518 F. 3d 577 (2008).  This time, the Court of Appeals concluded that [a]s there was then no circuit authority to the contrary, we presume the district court was aware that <em>Booker</em> granted it discretion to vary downward based upon the impact of the crack cocaine guidelines on this defendant, but elected not to exercise that discretion.  <em>Id</em>., at 580.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Proceeding <em>pro se</em>, Moore again petitioned for certiorari, arguing that the Eighth Circuits new characterization of the transcript is wrong, and that it is clear that the district court thought judges had no discre[t]ion to reject the Guidelines ratio.  Pet. for Cert. 7.  The United States agrees that the Eighth Circuit erred, see Brief for United States 9, and so do we.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    When the District Court said that [i]t isnt the judges but Congress that looks at the [G]uidelines and decides whether or not they should be put … in force, the court showed that it did not think it had the discretion later upheld by <em>Kimbrough</em>.  App. C to Pet. for Cert. 56.  The Eighth Circuits first decision recognized this, describing the District Court as concluding (correctly under circuit precedent) that it was not authorize[d] . . . to reject the crack/powder disparity.  <em>Moore,</em> 470 F. 3d, at 770 (internal quotation marks omitted).  In light of the District Courts comments at sentencing, the Court of Appeals should have remanded the case to the District Court for resentencing under <em>Kimbrough</em>.  We express no views on how the District Court should exercise its discretion at resentencing.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to proceed <em>in</em>
            <em>forma pauperis </em>are granted.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>
        <p class="CASCTG-right">It is so ordered.</p>

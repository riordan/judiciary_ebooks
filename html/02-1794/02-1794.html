				At the international border in southern California, customs officials seized 37 kilograms of marijuana from respondents gas tank by removing and disassembling the tank.  After respondent was indicted on federal drug charges, he moved to suppress the drugs recovered from the gas tank, relying on a Ninth Circuit panel decision holding that a gas tanks removal requires reasonable suspicion under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>.  The District Court granted the motion, and the Ninth Circuit summarily affirmed.

The panel took routine, fashioned a new balancing test, and extended it to vehicle searches.  But the reasons that might support a suspicion requirement in the case of highly intrusive searches of persons simply do not carry over to vehicles.  Complex balancing tests to determine what is a routine vehicle search, as opposed to a more intrusive search of a person, have no place in border searches of vehicles.  The Governments interest in preventing the entry of unwanted persons and effects is at its zenith at the international border.

Thus, the Governments authority to conduct suspicionless inspections at the border includes the authority to remove, disassemble, and reassemble a vehicles fuel tank.  Pp. 27.

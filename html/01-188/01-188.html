				 Congress enacted a cost-saving measure in 1990 that requires drug companies to pay rebates to States on their Medicaid purchases.  Over the last several years, state legislatures have enacted supplemental rebate programs to achieve additional cost savings on Medicaid purchases as well as for purchases made by other needy citizens.  The Maine Rx program, enacted in 2000, is primarily intended to provide discounted prescription drugs to Maines uninsured citizens but its coverage is open to all residents of the State.  Under the program, Maine will attempt to negotiate rebates with drug manufacturers to fund the reduced price for drugs offered to Maine Rx participants.  If a drug company does not enter into a rebate agreement, its Medicaid sales will be subjected to a prior authorization procedure.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In this case, an association of nonresident drug manufacturers has challenged the constitutionality of the Maine Rx Program, claiming that the program is pre-empted by the federal Medicaid statute and that it violates the negative Commerce Clause.  The association has not alleged that the program denies Medicaid patients meaningful access to prescription drugs or that it has excluded any drugs from access to the market in Maine.  Instead, it contends that the program imposes a significant burden on Medicaid recipients by requiring prior authorization in certain circumstances without serving any valid Medicaid purpose, and that the program effectively regulates out-of-state commerce.  The District Court sustained both challenges and entered a preliminary injunction preventing implementation of the statute.  The Court of Appeals reversed, and we granted certiorari because the questions presented are of national importance.

				  The program authorizes federal financial assistance to States that choose to reimburse certain costs of medical treatment for needy persons.

				  Under plans approved by the Secretary, some States designed and administered their own formularies, listing the drugs that they would cover.

				Congress effectively ratified the Secretarys practice of approving state plans containing prior authorization requirements when it created its rebate program in an amendment contained in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA 1990).

				  The new program had two basic parts.  First, it imposed a general requirement that, in order to qualify for Medicaid payments, drug companies must enter into agreements either with the Secretary or, if authorized by the Secretary, with individual States, to provide rebates on their Medicaid sales of outpatient prescription drugs.
				<a name="ZO-9ref" href="#ZO-9" class="">

            </a>
				  The rebate on a single source drug or an innovator multiple source drug is the difference between the manufacturers average price and its best price, or 15.1% of the average manufacturer price, whichever is greater.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/1396r-8.html#c_1" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §§1396r8(c)(1)</a>, (2).  The rebate for other drugs is 11.1% of the average manufacturer price.  See §1396r8(c)(3).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, once a drug manufacturer enters into a rebate agreement, the law requires the State to provide coverage for that drug under its plan unless the State complies with one of the exclusion or restriction provisions in the Medicaid Act.  See §1396r8(d).  For example, a State may exclude coverage of drugs such as [a]gents … used for cosmetic purposes or hair growth.  §1396r8(d)(2)(C).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Most relevant to this case, Congress allowed States, as a condition of coverage or payment for a covered outpatient drug, §1396r8(d)(5), to require approval of the drug before it is dispensed.  Thus, under OBRA 1990, except for a narrow category of new drugs,

				In 2000, the Maine Legislature established the Maine Rx Program to reduce prescription drug prices for residents of the State.  Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 22, §2681 (West Supp. 2002).  The statute provides that the State [shall] act as a pharmacy benefit manager in order to make prescription drugs more affordable for qualified Maine residents, thereby increasing the overall health of Maine residents, promoting healthy communities and protecting the public health and welfare.  §2681(1).  The program is intended to enable individuals to buy drugs from retail pharmacies at a discount roughly equal to the rebate on Medicaid purchases.  See §2681(4).

The Commissioner is directed to use his best efforts to obtain a rebate that is at least equal to the rebate calculated under the federal program created pursuant to OBRA 1990.  See §2681(4).  Rebates are to be paid into a fund administered by the Commissioner, and then distributed to participating pharmacies to compensate them for selling at discounted prices.  §2681(6).

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				For those manufacturers that do not enter into rebate agreements, there are two consequences: First, their nonparticipation is information that the Department of Human Services must release to health care providers and the public.  §2681(7).  Second, and more importantly for our purposes, the department shall impose prior authorization requirements in the Medicaid program under this Title, as permitted by law, for the dispensing of prescription drugs provided by those [nonparticipating] manufacturers and labelers.  Ibid.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The statute authorizes the department to adopt implementing rules.  §2681(14).  The rules that have been proposed would limit access to the program to individuals who do not have a comparable or superior prescription drug benefit plan.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Four of the affidavits describe the nature of the association and the companies methods of distribution, emphasizing the fact that, with the exception of sales to two resident distributors, all of their prescription drug sales occur outside of Maine.

				  Three of them comment on the operation of prior authorization programs administered by private managed care organizations, describing their actual and potential adverse impact on both manufacturers and patients.  Thus, one executive stated: Imposition of a prior authorization [(PA)] requirement with respect to a particular drug severely curtails access to the drug for covered patients and sharply reduces the drugs market share and sales, as the PA causes a shift of patients to competing drugs of other manufacturers that are not subject to a PA.  Because a PA imposes additional procedural burdens on physicians prescribing the manufacturers drug and retail pharmacies dispensing it, the effect of a PA is to diminish the manufacturers goodwill that helped foster demand for its drug over competing drugs produced by other manufacturers, and to shift physician and patient loyalty to those competing drugs, perhaps permanently.

				  Another affidavit described how prior authorization by a managed care organization in Nevada had sharply reduced the market share of four of SmithKlines drugs.  For example, the market share of Augmentin, a drug used to treat bacterial infections, declined from 49% to 18% in the six months after the program was imposed.

				  In the third affidavit, Dr. Howell of SmithKline Beecham Corporation expressed the opinion that prior authorization had never been required in one program for the purpose of influencing the manufacturers pricing behavior in another program, and that such use without regard to safety or efficacy, will lead to drugs being prescribed that are less safe and efficacious.

				Respondents opposition to the motion was supported by Concannons own affidavit and the affidavits of two doctors.  They do not dispute the factual assertions concerning the impact of prior authorization on the drug companies market shares, but instead comment on the benefits of prior authorization for patients.  The States Medicaid Medical Director, Dr. Clifford, explained that [p]hysicians in Maine are already well acquainted with the extensive prior authorization programs of the four HMO/Insurance programs which collectively cover nearly half the states residents and that the State had taken steps to ensure that physicians will always be able to prescribe the safest and most efficacious drugs for their Medicaid patients.

, the court first held that Maine had no power to regulate the prices paid to drug manufacturers in transactions that occur out of the State.  Recognizing that some of their sales were made to two distributors in Maine, the court further held that the Medicaid Act pre-empted Maines Rx Program insofar as it threatened to impose a prior authorization requirement on nonparticipating manufacturers.  In so holding, the court assumed for the purpose of the decision that the  Department of Human Services will not deny a single Medicaid recipient access to the safest and most efficacious prescription drug therapy indicated for their individual medical circumstances. 

				  In that courts view, pre-emption was nevertheless required because Maine can point to no

				  In the District Courts view, the fact that the alteration served purposes outside the scope of the Medicaid program and created an obstacle to the administration of the federal program was sufficient to establish pre-emption: No matter how modest an obstacle the new prior authorization amounts to (the parties disagree on the severity of the obstacle), it is an obstacledrugs on the list must be approved by the state Medicaid Medical Director before they can be dispensed … .

				The Court of Appeals disagreed with the District Courts analysis of the pre-emption issue for three reasons.  First, since the federal statute expressly authorizes use of prior authorization, it found no conflict between the Maine Act and Medicaids structure and purpose.  249 F. 3d 66, 75 (CA1 2001).  In its view, as long as there is compliance with the federal 24- and 72-hour conditions, the States motivation for imposing the requirement is irrelevant.  Second, given the absence of an actual conflict, the court found that the mere fact that Maine Rx fails to directly
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				advance the purpose of the federal program is an insufficient basis for inflicting the strong medicine of preemption on a state statute.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 76.  Third, the court further stated that, assuming the relevance of the States motivation, the Maine Rx Program furthers Medicaids aim of providing medical services to those whose income and resources are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical services, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/1396.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §1396</a>, even if the individuals covered by the Maine Rx Program are not poor enough to qualify for Medicaid.  
				<em>

				</em>
				  Moreover, the court held that there is evidence that making prescription drugs more accessible to the uninsured may keep some of them off Medicaid thereby minimizing the States Medicaid expenditures.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court of Appeals also reviewed the affidavits and concluded that they fall short of establishing that the Act will inflict inevitable or even probable harm on Medicaid patients, and thus were insufficient to support a pre-emption-based facial challenge.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 78.  The Court did, however, express concern that the prior authorization requirement might affect the quality of medical care for Medicaid recipients in subtle ways, such as inconveniencing prescribing physicians.  It therefore expressly preserved petitioners right to renew its pre-emption challenge after implementation of the program should there be evidence that Medicaid recipients are harmed by the prior authorization requirement as applied. 

				  While the petition for certiorari was pending, the United States filed a brief recommending that we deny review, in part because further proceedings may clarify the issues.  Its brief cautioned against the adoption of a rule prohibiting prior authorization programs whenever they operate in part to benefit a non-Medicaid population, and suggested that a program tailored to benefit needy persons who are not Medicaid-eligible might advance Medicaid-related goals.

				  That brief, however, as well as the Federal Governments brief filed after we granted review, expressed the opinion that, because Maines program was adopted without the Secretarys approval and was open to all Maine residents regardless of financial need, it was not tailored to achieve Medicaid-related goals and was therefore invalid.  Like the interlocutory judicial rulings in this case, we assume that a more complete understanding of all the relevant facts might lead to a modification of the views expressed in those briefs.  In all events, we must confront the issues without the benefit of either a complete record or any dispositive ruling by the Secretary.

				The issue we confront is, of course, quite different from the question that would be presented if the Secretary, after a hearing, had held that the Maine Rx Program was an impermissible amendment of its Medicaid Plan.  In such event, the Secretarys ruling would be presumptively valid.  As the case comes to us, however, the question is whether there is a probability that Maines program was pre-empted by the mere existence of the federal statute.  We start therefore with a presumption that the state statute is valid, see

				The centerpiece of petitioners attack on Maines Rx Program is its allegedly unique use of a threat to impose a prior authorization requirement on Medicaid sales to coerce manufacturers into reducing their prices on sales to non-Medicaid recipients.  Petitioner argues, and the District Court held, that the potential interference with the delivery of Medicaid benefits without any benefit to the federal program is prohibited by the federal statute.  In accepting this argument, the District Court relied heavily on the fact that Maine had failed to identify any 
				<em>
					Medicaid
				</em>
				 purpose in its new authorization requirement.  It appears that Maine had argued before the District Court that such a purpose was unnecessary because the federal statute expressly authorizes what it has done.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In this Court, petitioner argues that it could not have been an abuse of discretion for the District Court to decide the case on the assumption that the program will serve no Medicaid purpose, even if that assumption is erroneous, given that the State, insisting that no such purpose was necessary, offered no Medicaid purpose in its opposition to the motion for a temporary injunction.  To the extent that petitioner is relying on a waiver theory, such reliance is inappropriate because the State never represented that there was no Medicaid purpose served by its program; it simply argued that it did not need to offer one.  Regardless of the legal position taken by the State, petitioner bore the burden of establishing, by a clear showing, a probability of success on the merits.  See 
				<em>

				 (requiring movant to demonstrate a substantial likelihood of success on the merits).  Accordingly, it was petitioners burden to show that there was no Medicaid-related goal or purpose served by Maine Rx.  Given that burden, if the program on its face clearly serves some Medicaid-related goals, it would follow that the District Courts evaluation rested on an erroneous predicate.  We are persuaded that there are three such goals plainly present in the Maine Rx Program.

				The Court of Appeals identified two Medicaid-related interests that will be served if the program is successful and rebates become available on sales to uninsured individuals.  First, the program will provide medical benefits to persons who can be described as medically needy even if they do not qualify for AFDC or SSI benefits.  There is some factual dispute concerning the extent to which the program will also benefit nonneedy persons, but even if the program is more inclusive than the Secretary thinks it should be, the potential benefits for nonneedy persons would not nullify the benefits that would be provided to the neediest segment of the uninsured population.

				  Second, there is the possibility that, by enabling some borderline aged and infirm persons better access to prescription drugs earlier, Medicaid expenses will be reduced.  If members of this borderline group are not able to purchase necessary prescription medicine, their conditions may worsen, causing further financial hardship and thus making it more likely that they will end up in the Medicaid program and require more expensive treatment.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				A third rather obvious Medicaid purpose will be fostered whenever it is necessary to impose the prior authorization requirement on a manufacturer that refuses to participate.  As the record demonstrates, private managed care organizations typically require prior authorization both to protect patients from inappropriate prescriptions and

Maines interest in protecting the health of its uninsured residents also provides a plainly permissible justification for a prior authorization requirement that is assumed to have only a minimal impact on Medicaid recipients access to prescription drugs.  The Medicaid Act contains no categorical prohibition against reliance on state interests unrelated to the Medicaid program itself when a State is fashioning the particular contours of its own program.

				at 413.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
The mere fact that the New York program imposed a nonfederal obstacle to continued eligibility for benefits did not provide a sufficient basis for pre-emption, but we left open questions concerning possible conflicts with the federal program for resolution in further proceedings.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 422423.  Similarly, in this case, the mere fact that prior authorization may impose a modest impediment to access to prescription drugs provided at government expense does not provide a sufficient basis for pre-emption of the entire Maine Rx Program.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				At this stage of the proceeding, the severity of any impediment that Maines program may impose on a Medicaid patients access to the drug of her choice is a matter of conjecture.  To the extent that drug manufacturers agree to participate in the program, there will be no impediment.  To the extent that the manufacturers refuse, the Drug Utilization Review Committee will determine whether it is clinically appropriate to subject those drugs to prior authorization.  If the committee determines prior authorization is required, that requirement may result in the delivery of a less expensive drug than a physician first prescribed, but on the present record we cannot conclude that a significant number of patients medical needs
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				indeed, any patients medical needswill be adversely
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				affected.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The record does demonstrate that prior authorization may well have a significant adverse impact on the manufacturers of brand name prescription drugs and that it will impose some administrative costs on physicians.  The impact on manufacturers is not relevant because any transfer of business to less expensive products will produce savings for the Medicaid program.  The impact on doctors may be significant if it produces an administrative burden that affects the quality of their treatment of patients, but no such effect has been proved.  Moreover, given doctors familiarity with the extensive use of prior authorization in the private sector, any such effect seems unlikely.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We therefore agree with the Court of Appeals resolution of the pre-emption issue based on the record before us.  We again reiterate that the question whether the Secretarys approval must be sought before Maine Rx Program may go into effect is not before us.  Along these same lines, we offer no view as to whether it would be appropriate for the Secretary to disapprove this program if Maine had asked the Secretary to review it.  We also offer no view as to whether it would be proper for the Secretary to disallow funding for the Maine Medicaid program if Maine fails to seek approval from the Secretary of its Maine Rx Program.

				Whereas petitioners pre-emption challenge focused on the effects of the prior authorization requirement that would follow a manufacturers refusal to participate in the Rx Program, its Commerce Clause challenge focuses on the effects of the rebate agreements that will follow manufacturer compliance with the program.  As we understand the challenge, the alleged harm to interstate commerce would be the same regardless of whether manufacturer compliance is completely voluntary or the product of coercion.  Petitioner argues, first, that the rebate requirement constitutes impermissible extraterritorial regulation, and second, that it discriminates against interstate commerce in order to subsidize in-state retail sales.

, we reviewed the constitutionality of a Massachusetts pricing order that imposed an assessment on all fluid milk sold by dealers to Massachusetts retailers and distributed the proceeds to Massachusetts dairy farmers.  Because two-thirds of the assessed milk was produced by out-of-state farmers while the entire fund was used to benefit in-state farmers, the order effectively imposed a tax on out-of-state producers to subsidize production by their in-state competitors.  We concluded that the program was invalid because it had a discriminatory effect analogous to a protective tariff that taxes goods imported from neighboring states but does not tax similar products produced locally.

				, however, the Maine Rx Program will not impose a disparate burden on any competitors.

						 The new Florida law … exempts certain Medicaid-eligible drugs from a prior authorization requirement.  If a drug is not on the preferred list, the prescribing doctor must call a state pharmacist to obtain approval of its use.  In the course of this procedure, the pharmacist informs the doctor of the availability of other drugs (usually on the preferred drug list) that allegedly have comparable therapeutic value but are less expensive.  The actual phone calls tend to be relatively brief (usually less than 10 minutes in length), and approval of the prescribing doctors first-choice drug is guaranteed in 100 percent of all cases, provided only that he or she make the telephone call.  During the first three months of the program, approximately 55 percent of all these calls have resulted in a change of the prescription to a drug on the preferred drug list.  Naturally, because this procedure may tend to promote less profitable drugs at the expense of more profitable ones, it is not favored by the pharmaceutical manufacturers that brought this lawsuit.  304 F. 3d, at 1198.

				 Congress enacted a cost-saving measure in 1990 that requires drug companies to pay rebates to States on their Medicaid purchases.  Over the last several years, state legislatures have enacted supplemental rebate programs to achieve additional cost savings on Medicaid purchases as well as for purchases made by other needy citizens.  The Maine Rx program, enacted in 2000, is primarily intended to provide discounted prescription drugs to Maines uninsured citizens but its coverage is open to all residents of the State.  Under the program, Maine will attempt to negotiate rebates with drug manufacturers to fund the reduced price for drugs offered to Maine Rx participants.  If a drug company does not enter into a rebate agreement, its Medicaid sales will be subjected to a prior authorization procedure.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In this case, an association of nonresident drug manufacturers has challenged the constitutionality of the Maine Rx Program, claiming that the program is pre-empted by the federal Medicaid statute and that it violates the negative Commerce Clause.  The association has not alleged that the program denies Medicaid patients meaningful access to prescription drugs or that it has excluded any drugs from access to the market in Maine.  Instead, it contends that the program imposes a significant burden on Medicaid recipients by requiring prior authorization in certain circumstances without serving any valid Medicaid purpose, and that the program effectively regulates out-of-state commerce.  The District Court sustained both challenges and entered a preliminary injunction preventing implementation of the statute.  The Court of Appeals reversed, and we granted certiorari because the questions presented are of national importance.

				Congress effectively ratified the Secretarys practice of approving state plans containing prior authorization requirements when it created its rebate program in an amendment contained in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA 1990).

				  The new program had two basic parts.  First, it imposed a general requirement that, in order to qualify for Medicaid payments, drug companies must enter into agreements either with the Secretary or, if authorized by the Secretary, with individual States, to provide rebates on their Medicaid sales of outpatient prescription drugs.
				<a name="ZO-9ref" href="#ZO-9" class="">

            </a>
				  The rebate on a single source drug or an innovator multiple source drug is the difference between the manufacturers average price and its best price, or 15.1% of the average manufacturer price, whichever is greater.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/1396r-8.html#c_1" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §§1396r8(c)(1)</a>, (2).  The rebate for other drugs is 11.1% of the average manufacturer price.  See §1396r8(c)(3).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, once a drug manufacturer enters into a rebate agreement, the law requires the State to provide coverage for that drug under its plan unless the State complies with one of the exclusion or restriction provisions in the Medicaid Act.  See §1396r8(d).  For example, a State may exclude coverage of drugs such as [a]gents … used for cosmetic purposes or hair growth.  §1396r8(d)(2)(C).

				Most relevant to this case, Congress allowed States, as a condition of coverage or payment for a covered outpatient drug, §1396r8(d)(5), to require approval of the drug before it is dispensed.  Thus, under OBRA 1990, except for a narrow category of new drugs,

				In 2000, the Maine Legislature established the Maine Rx Program to reduce prescription drug prices for residents of the State.  Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 22, §2681 (West Supp. 2002).  The statute provides that the State [shall] act as a pharmacy benefit manager in order to make prescription drugs more affordable for qualified Maine residents, thereby increasing the overall health of Maine residents, promoting healthy communities and protecting the public health and welfare.  §2681(1).  The program is intended to enable individuals to buy drugs from retail pharmacies at a discount roughly equal to the rebate on Medicaid purchases.  See §2681(4).

The Commissioner is directed to use his best efforts to obtain a rebate that is at least equal to the rebate calculated under the federal program created pursuant to OBRA 1990.  See §2681(4).  Rebates are to be paid into a fund administered by the Commissioner, and then distributed to participating pharmacies to compensate them for selling at discounted prices.  §2681(6).

				For those manufacturers that do not enter into rebate agreements, there are two consequences: First, their nonparticipation is information that the Department of Human Services must release to health care providers and the public.  §2681(7).  Second, and more importantly for our purposes, the department shall impose prior authorization requirements in the Medicaid program under this Title, as permitted by law, for the dispensing of prescription drugs provided by those [nonparticipating] manufacturers and labelers.  Ibid.

				  Three of them comment on the operation of prior authorization programs administered by private managed care organizations, describing their actual and potential adverse impact on both manufacturers and patients.  Thus, one executive stated: Imposition of a prior authorization [(PA)] requirement with respect to a particular drug severely curtails access to the drug for covered patients and sharply reduces the drugs market share and sales, as the PA causes a shift of patients to competing drugs of other manufacturers that are not subject to a PA.  Because a PA imposes additional procedural burdens on physicians prescribing the manufacturers drug and retail pharmacies dispensing it, the effect of a PA is to diminish the manufacturers goodwill that helped foster demand for its drug over competing drugs produced by other manufacturers, and to shift physician and patient loyalty to those competing drugs, perhaps permanently.

				  Another affidavit described how prior authorization by a managed care organization in Nevada had sharply reduced the market share of four of SmithKlines drugs.

				  In the third affidavit, Dr. Howell of SmithKline Beecham Corporation expressed the opinion that prior authorization had never been required in one program for the purpose of influencing the manufacturers pricing behavior in another program, and that such use without regard to safety or efficacy, will lead to drugs being prescribed that are less safe and efficacious.

				Respondents opposition to the motion was supported by Concannons own affidavit and the affidavits of two doctors.  They do not dispute the factual assertions concerning the impact of prior authorization on the drug companies market shares, but instead comment on the benefits of prior authorization for patients.  The States Medicaid Medical Director, Dr. Clifford, explained that [p]hysicians in Maine are already well acquainted with the extensive prior authorization programs of the four HMO/Insurance programs which collectively cover nearly half the states residents and that the State had taken steps to ensure that physicians will always be able to prescribe the safest and most efficacious drugs for their Medicaid patients.

, the court first held that Maine had no power to regulate the prices paid to drug manufacturers in transactions that occur out of the State.  Recognizing that some of their sales were made to two distributors in Maine, the court further held that the Medicaid Act pre-empted Maines Rx Program insofar as it threatened to impose a prior authorization requirement on nonparticipating manufacturers.  In so holding, the court assumed for the purpose of the decision that the  Department of Human Services will not deny a single Medicaid recipient access to the safest and most efficacious prescription drug therapy indicated for their individual medical circumstances. 

				  In that courts view, pre-emption was nevertheless required because Maine can point to no

				  In the District Courts view, the fact that the alteration served purposes outside the scope of the Medicaid program and created an obstacle to the administration of the federal program was sufficient to establish pre-emption: No matter how modest an obstacle the new prior authorization amounts to (the parties disagree on the severity of the obstacle), it is an obstacledrugs on the list must be approved by the state Medicaid Medical Director before they can be dispensed … .

				The Court of Appeals disagreed with the District Courts analysis of the pre-emption issue for three reasons.  First, since the federal statute expressly authorizes use of prior authorization, it found no conflict between the Maine Act and Medicaids structure and purpose.  249 F. 3d 66, 75 (CA1 2001).  In its view, as long as there is compliance with the federal 24- and 72-hour conditions, the States motivation for imposing the requirement is irrelevant.  Second, given the absence of an actual conflict, the court found that the mere fact that Maine Rx fails to directly
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				advance the purpose of the federal program is an insufficient basis for inflicting the strong medicine of preemption on a state statute.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 76.  Third, the court further stated that, assuming the relevance of the States motivation, the Maine Rx Program furthers Medicaids aim of providing medical services to those whose income and resources are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical services, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/1396.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §1396</a>, even if the individuals covered by the Maine Rx Program are not poor enough to qualify for Medicaid.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  Moreover, the court held that there is evidence that making prescription drugs more accessible to the uninsured may keep some of them off Medicaid thereby minimizing the States Medicaid expenditures.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court of Appeals also reviewed the affidavits and concluded that they fall short of establishing that the Act will inflict inevitable or even probable harm on Medicaid patients, and thus were insufficient to support a pre-emption-based facial challenge.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 78.  The Court did, however, express concern that the prior authorization requirement might affect the quality of medical care for Medicaid recipients in subtle ways, such as inconveniencing prescribing physicians.  It therefore expressly preserved petitioners right to renew its pre-emption challenge after implementation of the program should there be evidence that Medicaid recipients are harmed by the prior authorization requirement as applied. 

.  By no means will our answer to that question finally determine the validity of Maines Rx Program.  The District Court did not conduct an evidentiary hearing and did not resolve any factual disputes raised by the affidavits filed by the parties.

				  While the petition for certiorari was pending, the United States filed a brief recommending that we deny review, in part because further proceedings may clarify the issues.  Its brief cautioned against the adoption of a rule prohibiting prior authorization programs whenever they operate in part to benefit a non-Medicaid population, and suggested that a program tailored to benefit needy persons who are not Medicaid-eligible might advance Medicaid-related goals.

            </a>
				  That brief, however, as well as the Federal Governments brief filed after we granted review, expressed the opinion that, because Maines program was adopted without the Secretarys approval and was open to all Maine residents regardless of financial need, it was not tailored to achieve Medicaid-related goals and was therefore invalid.  Like the interlocutory judicial rulings in this case, we assume that a more complete understanding of all the relevant facts might lead to a modification of the views expressed in those briefs.  In all events, we must confront the issues without the benefit of either a complete record or any dispositive ruling by the Secretary.

				The issue we confront is, of course, quite different from the question that would be presented if the Secretary, after a hearing, had held that the Maine Rx Program was an impermissible amendment of its Medicaid Plan.  In such event, the Secretarys ruling would be presumptively valid.  As the case comes to us, however, the question is whether there is a probability that Maines program was pre-empted by the mere existence of the federal statute.  We start therefore with a presumption that the state statute is valid, see

				The centerpiece of petitioners attack on Maines Rx Program is its allegedly unique use of a threat to impose a prior authorization requirement on Medicaid sales to coerce manufacturers into reducing their prices on sales to non-Medicaid recipients.  Petitioner argues, and the District Court held, that the potential interference with the delivery of Medicaid benefits without any benefit to the federal program is prohibited by the federal statute.  In accepting this argument, the District Court relied heavily on the fact that Maine had failed to identify any 
				<em>
					Medicaid
				</em>
				 purpose in its new authorization requirement.  It appears that Maine had argued before the District Court that such a purpose was unnecessary because the federal statute expressly authorizes what it has done.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In this Court, petitioner argues that it could not have been an abuse of discretion for the District Court to decide the case on the assumption that the program will serve no Medicaid purpose, even if that assumption is erroneous, given that the State, insisting that no such purpose was necessary, offered no Medicaid purpose in its opposition to the motion for a temporary injunction.  To the extent that petitioner is relying on a waiver theory, such reliance is inappropriate because the State never represented that there was no Medicaid purpose served by its program; it simply argued that it did not need to offer one.  Regardless of the legal position taken by the State, petitioner bore the burden of establishing, by a clear showing, a probability of success on the merits.  See

				 (requiring movant to demonstrate a substantial likelihood of success on the merits).  Accordingly, it was petitioners burden to show that there was no Medicaid-related goal or purpose served by Maine Rx.  Given that burden, if the program on its face clearly serves some Medicaid-related goals, it would follow that the District Courts evaluation rested on an erroneous predicate.  We are persuaded that there are three such goals plainly present in the Maine Rx Program.

				The Court of Appeals identified two Medicaid-related interests that will be served if the program is successful and rebates become available on sales to uninsured individuals.  First, the program will provide medical benefits to persons who can be described as medically needy even if they do not qualify for AFDC or SSI benefits.  There is some factual dispute concerning the extent to which the program will also benefit nonneedy persons, but even if the program is more inclusive than the Secretary thinks it should be, the potential benefits for nonneedy persons would not nullify the benefits that would be provided to the neediest segment of the uninsured population.

				  Second, there is the possibility that, by enabling some borderline aged and infirm persons better access to prescription drugs earlier, Medicaid expenses will be reduced.  If members of this borderline group are not able to purchase necessary prescription medicine, their conditions may worsen, causing further financial hardship and thus making it more likely that they will end up in the Medicaid program and require more expensive treatment.

				A third rather obvious Medicaid purpose will be fostered whenever it is necessary to impose the prior authorization requirement on a manufacturer that refuses to participate.  As the record demonstrates, private managed care organizations typically require prior authorization both to protect patients from inappropriate prescriptions and

In that case, we rejected a challenge brought by a class of handicapped persons to a Tennessee cost-saving measure that reduced the number of annual days of inpatient hospital care for Medicaid patients from 20 to 14, emphasizing that the change did not deny beneficiaries meaningful access to medical services.

, despite accepting the plaintiffs submission that nontherapeutic abortions are both less dangerous and less expensive than childbirth, we held that Pennsylvanias interest in encouraging normal childbirth provided an adequate justification for its decision to exclude the abortion procedure from its Medicaid program.  Maines interest in protecting the health of its uninsured residents also provides a plainly permissible justification for a prior authorization requirement that is assumed to have only a minimal impact on Medicaid recipients access to prescription drugs.  The Medicaid Act contains no categorical prohibition against reliance on state interests unrelated to the Medicaid program itself when a State is fashioning the particular contours of its own program.  It retains the considerable latitude that characterizes optional participation in a jointly financed benefit program.

        <p class="bodytext">
				To the extent that the Work Rules embody New Yorks attempt to promote self-reliance and civic responsibility, to assure that limited state welfare funds be spent on behalf of those genuinely incapacitated and most in need, and to cope with the fiscal hardships enveloping many state and local governments, this Court should not lightly interfere.  The problems confronting our society in these areas are severe, and state governments, in cooperation with the Federal Government, must be allowed considerable latitude in attempting their resolution.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 413.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
The mere fact that the New York program imposed a nonfederal obstacle to continued eligibility for benefits did not provide a sufficient basis for pre-emption, but we left open questions concerning possible conflicts with the federal program for resolution in further proceedings.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 422423.  Similarly, in this case, the mere fact that prior authorization may impose a modest impediment to access to prescription drugs provided at government expense does not provide a sufficient basis for pre-emption of the entire Maine Rx Program.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				At this stage of the proceeding, the severity of any impediment that Maines program may impose on a Medicaid patients access to the drug of her choice is a matter of conjecture.  To the extent that drug manufacturers agree to participate in the program, there will be no impediment.  To the extent that the manufacturers refuse, the Drug Utilization Review Committee will determine whether it is clinically appropriate to subject those drugs to prior authorization.  If the committee determines prior authorization is required, that requirement may result in the delivery of a less expensive drug than a physician first prescribed, but on the present record we cannot conclude that a significant number of patients medical needs
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				indeed, any patients medical needswill be adversely
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				affected.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The record does demonstrate that prior authorization may well have a significant adverse impact on the manufacturers of brand name prescription drugs and that it will impose some administrative costs on physicians.  The impact on manufacturers is not relevant because any transfer of business to less expensive products will produce savings for the Medicaid program.  The impact on doctors may be significant if it produces an administrative burden that affects the quality of their treatment of patients, but no such effect has been proved.  Moreover, given doctors familiarity with the extensive use of prior authorization in the private sector, any such effect seems unlikely.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We therefore agree with the Court of Appeals resolution of the pre-emption issue based on the record before us.  We again reiterate that the question whether the Secretarys approval must be sought before Maine Rx Program may go into effect is not before us.  Along these same lines, we offer no view as to whether it would be appropriate for the Secretary to disapprove this program if Maine had asked the Secretary to review it.  We also offer no view as to whether it would be proper for the Secretary to disallow funding for the Maine Medicaid program if Maine fails to seek approval from the Secretary of its Maine Rx Program.

				 it appears that the Secretary is likely to take some action with respect to this program.  Until the Secretary does, however, we cannot predict at this preliminary stage the ultimate fate of the Maine Rx Program, and we limit our holding accordingly.

				Whereas petitioners pre-emption challenge focused on the effects of the prior authorization requirement that would follow a manufacturers refusal to participate in the Rx Program, its Commerce Clause challenge focuses on the effects of the rebate agreements that will follow manufacturer compliance with the program.  As we understand the challenge, the alleged harm to interstate commerce would be the same regardless of whether manufacturer compliance is completely voluntary or the product of coercion.  Petitioner argues, first, that the rebate requirement constitutes impermissible extraterritorial regulation, and second, that it discriminates against interstate commerce in order to subsidize in-state retail sales.  Neither argument is persuasive.

Petitioner argues that the reasoning in those cases applies to what it characterizes as Maines regulation of the terms of transactions that occur elsewhere.  But, as the Court of Appeals correctly stated, unlike price control or price affirmation statutes, the Maine Act does not regulate the price of any out-of-state transaction, either by its express terms or by its inevitable effect.  Maine does not insist that manufacturers sell their drugs to a wholesaler for a certain price.

, we reviewed the constitutionality of a Massachusetts pricing order that imposed an assessment on all fluid milk sold by dealers to Massachusetts retailers and distributed the proceeds to Massachusetts dairy farmers.  Because two-thirds of the assessed milk was produced by out-of-state farmers while the entire fund was used to benefit in-state farmers, the order effectively imposed a tax on out-of-state producers to subsidize production by their in-state competitors.  We concluded that the program was invalid because it had a discriminatory effect analogous to a protective tariff that taxes goods imported from neighboring states but does not tax similar products produced locally.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Petitioner argues that Maines Rx fund is similar because it would be created entirely from rebates paid by out-of-state manufacturers and would be used to subsidize sales by local pharmacists to local consumers.  Unlike the situation in 
				<em>
					West Lynn
				</em>
				, however, the Maine Rx Program will not impose a disparate burden on any competitors.  A manufacturer could not avoid its rebate obligation by opening production facilities in Maine and would receive no benefit from the rebates even if it did so; the payments to the local pharmacists provide no special benefit to competitors of rebate-paying manufacturers.  The rule that was applied in

						 The new Florida law … exempts certain Medicaid-eligible drugs from a prior authorization requirement.  If a drug is not on the preferred list, the prescribing doctor must call a state pharmacist to obtain approval of its use.  In the course of this procedure, the pharmacist informs the doctor of the availability of other drugs (usually on the preferred drug list) that allegedly have comparable therapeutic value but are less expensive.  The actual phone calls tend to be relatively brief (usually less than 10 minutes in length), and approval of the prescribing doctors first-choice drug is guaranteed in 100 percent of all cases, provided only that he or she make the telephone call.  During the first three months of the program, approximately 55 percent of all these calls have resulted in a change of the prescription to a drug on the preferred drug list.  Naturally, because this procedure may tend to promote less profitable drugs at the expense of more profitable ones, it is not favored by the pharmaceutical manufacturers that brought this lawsuit.  304 F. 3d, at 1198.

				 Congress enacted a cost-saving measure in 1990 that requires drug companies to pay rebates to States on their Medicaid purchases.  Over the last several years, state legislatures have enacted supplemental rebate programs to achieve additional cost savings on Medicaid purchases as well as for purchases made by other needy citizens.  The Maine Rx program, enacted in 2000, is primarily intended to provide discounted prescription drugs to Maines uninsured citizens but its coverage is open to all residents of the State.  Under the program, Maine will attempt to negotiate rebates with drug manufacturers to fund the reduced price for drugs offered to Maine Rx participants.  If a drug company does not enter into a rebate agreement, its Medicaid sales will be subjected to a prior authorization procedure.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In this case, an association of nonresident drug manufacturers has challenged the constitutionality of the Maine Rx Program, claiming that the program is pre-empted by the federal Medicaid statute and that it violates the negative Commerce Clause.  The association has not alleged that the program denies Medicaid patients meaningful access to prescription drugs or that it has excluded any drugs from access to the market in Maine.  Instead, it contends that the program imposes a significant burden on Medicaid recipients by requiring prior authorization in certain circumstances without serving any valid Medicaid purpose, and that the program effectively regulates out-of-state commerce.  The District Court sustained both challenges and entered a preliminary injunction preventing implementation of the statute.  The Court of Appeals reversed, and we granted certiorari because the questions presented are of national importance.

				Congress effectively ratified the Secretarys practice of approving state plans containing prior authorization requirements when it created its rebate program in an amendment contained in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA 1990).

				  The new program had two basic parts.  First, it imposed a general requirement that, in order to qualify for Medicaid payments, drug companies must enter into agreements either with the Secretary or, if authorized by the Secretary, with individual States, to provide rebates on their Medicaid sales of outpatient prescription drugs.
				<a name="ZO-9ref" href="#ZO-9" class="">

            </a>
				  The rebate on a single source drug or an innovator multiple source drug is the difference between the manufacturers average price and its best price, or 15.1% of the average manufacturer price, whichever is greater.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/1396r-8.html#c_1" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §§1396r8(c)(1)</a>, (2).  The rebate for other drugs is 11.1% of the average manufacturer price.  See §1396r8(c)(3).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, once a drug manufacturer enters into a rebate agreement, the law requires the State to provide coverage for that drug under its plan unless the State complies with one of the exclusion or restriction provisions in the Medicaid Act.  See §1396r8(d).  For example, a State may exclude coverage of drugs such as [a]gents … used for cosmetic purposes or hair growth.  §1396r8(d)(2)(C).

				Most relevant to this case, Congress allowed States, as a condition of coverage or payment for a covered outpatient drug, §1396r8(d)(5), to require approval of the drug before it is dispensed.  Thus, under OBRA 1990, except for a narrow category of new drugs,

				In 2000, the Maine Legislature established the Maine Rx Program to reduce prescription drug prices for residents of the State.  Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 22, §2681 (West Supp. 2002).  The statute provides that the State [shall] act as a pharmacy benefit manager in order to make prescription drugs more affordable for qualified Maine residents, thereby increasing the overall health of Maine residents, promoting healthy communities and protecting the public health and welfare.  §2681(1).

				For those manufacturers that do not enter into rebate agreements, there are two consequences: First, their nonparticipation is information that the Department of Human Services must release to health care providers and the public.  §2681(7).  Second, and more importantly for our purposes, the department shall impose prior authorization requirements in the Medicaid program under this Title, as permitted by law, for the dispensing of prescription drugs provided by those [nonparticipating] manufacturers and labelers.  Ibid.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">

				  Three of them comment on the operation of prior authorization programs administered by private managed care organizations, describing their actual and potential adverse impact on both manufacturers and patients.  Thus, one executive stated: Imposition of a prior authorization [(PA)] requirement with respect to a particular drug severely curtails access to the drug for covered patients and sharply reduces the drugs market share and sales, as the PA causes a shift of patients to competing drugs of other manufacturers that are not subject to a PA.  Because a PA imposes additional procedural burdens on physicians prescribing the manufacturers drug and retail pharmacies dispensing it, the effect of a PA is to diminish the manufacturers goodwill that helped foster demand for its drug over competing drugs produced by other manufacturers, and to shift physician and patient loyalty to those competing drugs, perhaps permanently.

				  In the third affidavit, Dr. Howell of SmithKline Beecham Corporation expressed the opinion that prior authorization had never been required in one program for the purpose of influencing the manufacturers pricing behavior in another program, and that such use without regard to safety or efficacy, will lead to drugs being prescribed that are less safe and efficacious.

				Respondents opposition to the motion was supported by Concannons own affidavit and the affidavits of two doctors.  They do not dispute the factual assertions concerning the impact of prior authorization on the drug companies market shares, but instead comment on the benefits of prior authorization for patients.  The States Medicaid Medical Director, Dr. Clifford, explained that [p]hysicians in Maine are already well acquainted with the extensive prior authorization programs of the four HMO/Insurance programs which collectively cover nearly half the states residents and that the State had taken steps to ensure that physicians will always be able to prescribe the safest and most efficacious drugs for their Medicaid patients.

, the court first held that Maine had no power to regulate the prices paid to drug manufacturers in transactions that occur out of the State.  Recognizing that some of their sales were made to two distributors in Maine, the court further held that the Medicaid Act pre-empted Maines Rx Program insofar as it threatened to impose a prior authorization requirement on nonparticipating manufacturers.  In so holding, the court assumed for the purpose of the decision that the  Department of Human Services will not deny a single Medicaid recipient access to the safest and most efficacious prescription drug therapy indicated for their individual medical circumstances. 

				  In the District Courts view, the fact that the alteration served purposes outside the scope of the Medicaid program and created an obstacle to the administration of the federal program was sufficient to establish pre-emption: No matter how modest an obstacle the new prior authorization amounts to (the parties disagree on the severity of the obstacle), it is an obstacledrugs on the list must be approved by the state Medicaid Medical Director before they can be dispensed … .

				The Court of Appeals disagreed with the District Courts analysis of the pre-emption issue for three reasons.  First, since the federal statute expressly authorizes use of prior authorization, it found no conflict between the Maine Act and Medicaids structure and purpose.  249 F. 3d 66, 75 (CA1 2001).  In its view, as long as there is compliance with the federal 24- and 72-hour conditions, the States motivation for imposing the requirement is irrelevant.  Second, given the absence of an actual conflict, the court found that the mere fact that Maine Rx fails to directly
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				advance the purpose of the federal program is an insufficient basis for inflicting the strong medicine of preemption on a state statute.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 76.  Third, the court further stated that, assuming the relevance of the States motivation, the Maine Rx Program furthers Medicaids aim of providing medical services to those whose income and resources are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical services, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/1396.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §1396</a>, even if the individuals covered by the Maine Rx Program are not poor enough to qualify for Medicaid.  
				<em>

				</em>
				  Moreover, the court held that there is evidence that making prescription drugs more accessible to the uninsured may keep some of them off Medicaid thereby minimizing the States Medicaid expenditures.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court of Appeals also reviewed the affidavits and concluded that they fall short of establishing that the Act will inflict inevitable or even probable harm on Medicaid patients, and thus were insufficient to support a pre-emption-based facial challenge.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 78.  The Court did, however, express concern that the prior authorization requirement might affect the quality of medical care for Medicaid recipients in subtle ways, such as inconveniencing prescribing physicians.  It therefore expressly preserved petitioners right to renew its pre-emption challenge after implementation of the program should there be evidence that Medicaid recipients are harmed by the prior authorization requirement as applied. 

.  By no means will our answer to that question finally determine the validity of Maines Rx Program.  The District Court did not conduct an evidentiary hearing and did not resolve any factual disputes raised by the affidavits filed by the parties.  Accordingly, no matter how we answer the question whether petitioners showing was sufficient to support the injunction, further proceedings in this case may lead to a contrary result.

				  While the petition for certiorari was pending, the United States filed a brief recommending that we deny review, in part because further proceedings may clarify the issues.  Its brief cautioned against the adoption of a rule prohibiting prior authorization programs whenever they operate in part to benefit a non-Medicaid population, and suggested that a program tailored to benefit needy persons who are not Medicaid-eligible might advance Medicaid-related goals.

            </a>
				  That brief, however, as well as the Federal Governments brief filed after we granted review, expressed the opinion that, because Maines program was adopted without the Secretarys approval and was open to all Maine residents regardless of financial need, it was not tailored to achieve Medicaid-related goals and was therefore invalid.  Like the interlocutory judicial rulings in this case, we assume that a more complete understanding of all the relevant facts might lead to a modification of the views expressed in those briefs.  In all events, we must confront the issues without the benefit of either a complete record or any dispositive ruling by the Secretary.

				The issue we confront is, of course, quite different from the question that would be presented if the Secretary, after a hearing, had held that the Maine Rx Program was an impermissible amendment of its Medicaid Plan.  In such event, the Secretarys ruling would be presumptively valid.  As the case comes to us, however, the question is whether there is a probability that Maines program was pre-empted by the mere existence of the federal statute.  We start therefore with a presumption that the state statute is valid, see

				The centerpiece of petitioners attack on Maines Rx Program is its allegedly unique use of a threat to impose a prior authorization requirement on Medicaid sales to coerce manufacturers into reducing their prices on sales to non-Medicaid recipients.  Petitioner argues, and the District Court held, that the potential interference with the delivery of Medicaid benefits without any benefit to the federal program is prohibited by the federal statute.  In accepting this argument, the District Court relied heavily on the fact that Maine had failed to identify any 
				<em>
					Medicaid
				</em>
				 purpose in its new authorization requirement.  It appears that Maine had argued before the District Court that such a purpose was unnecessary because the federal statute expressly authorizes what it has done.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In this Court, petitioner argues that it could not have been an abuse of discretion for the District Court to decide the case on the assumption that the program will serve no Medicaid purpose, even if that assumption is erroneous, given that the State, insisting that no such purpose was necessary, offered no Medicaid purpose in its opposition to the motion for a temporary injunction.  To the extent that petitioner is relying on a waiver theory, such reliance is inappropriate because the State never represented that there was no Medicaid purpose served by its program; it simply argued that it did not need to offer one.  Regardless of the legal position taken by the State, petitioner bore the burden of establishing, by a clear showing, a probability of success on the merits.  See

				 (requiring movant to demonstrate a substantial likelihood of success on the merits).  Accordingly, it was petitioners burden to show that there was no Medicaid-related goal or purpose served by Maine Rx.  Given that burden, if the program on its face clearly serves some Medicaid-related goals, it would follow that the District Courts evaluation rested on an erroneous predicate.  We are persuaded that there are three such goals plainly present in the Maine Rx Program.

				The Court of Appeals identified two Medicaid-related interests that will be served if the program is successful and rebates become available on sales to uninsured individuals.  First, the program will provide medical benefits to persons who can be described as medically needy even if they do not qualify for AFDC or SSI benefits.  There is some factual dispute concerning the extent to which the program will also benefit nonneedy persons, but even if the program is more inclusive than the Secretary thinks it should be, the potential benefits for nonneedy persons would not nullify the benefits that would be provided to the neediest segment of the uninsured population.

				  Second, there is the possibility that, by enabling some borderline aged and infirm persons better access to prescription drugs earlier, Medicaid expenses will be reduced.  If members of this borderline group are not able to purchase necessary prescription medicine, their conditions may worsen, causing further financial hardship and thus making it more likely that they will end up in the Medicaid program and require more expensive treatment.

				A third rather obvious Medicaid purpose will be fostered whenever it is necessary to impose the prior authorization requirement on a manufacturer that refuses to participate.  As the record demonstrates, private managed care organizations typically require prior authorization both to protect patients from inappropriate prescriptions and

, despite accepting the plaintiffs submission that nontherapeutic abortions are both less dangerous and less expensive than childbirth, we held that Pennsylvanias interest in encouraging normal childbirth provided an adequate justification for its decision to exclude the abortion procedure from its Medicaid program.  Maines interest in protecting the health of its uninsured residents also provides a plainly permissible justification for a prior authorization requirement that is assumed to have only a minimal impact on Medicaid recipients access to prescription drugs.  The Medicaid Act contains no categorical prohibition against reliance on state interests unrelated to the Medicaid program itself when a State is fashioning the particular contours of its own program.  It retains the considerable latitude that characterizes optional participation in a jointly financed benefit program.

				at 413.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
The mere fact that the New York program imposed a nonfederal obstacle to continued eligibility for benefits did not provide a sufficient basis for pre-emption, but we left open questions concerning possible conflicts with the federal program for resolution in further proceedings.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 422423.  Similarly, in this case, the mere fact that prior authorization may impose a modest impediment to access to prescription drugs provided at government expense does not provide a sufficient basis for pre-emption of the entire Maine Rx Program.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				At this stage of the proceeding, the severity of any impediment that Maines program may impose on a Medicaid patients access to the drug of her choice is a matter of conjecture.  To the extent that drug manufacturers agree to participate in the program, there will be no impediment.  To the extent that the manufacturers refuse, the Drug Utilization Review Committee will determine whether it is clinically appropriate to subject those drugs to prior authorization.  If the committee determines prior authorization is required, that requirement may result in the delivery of a less expensive drug than a physician first prescribed, but on the present record we cannot conclude that a significant number of patients medical needs
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				indeed, any patients medical needswill be adversely
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				affected.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The record does demonstrate that prior authorization may well have a significant adverse impact on the manufacturers of brand name prescription drugs and that it will impose some administrative costs on physicians.  The impact on manufacturers is not relevant because any transfer of business to less expensive products will produce savings for the Medicaid program.  The impact on doctors may be significant if it produces an administrative burden that affects the quality of their treatment of patients, but no such effect has been proved.  Moreover, given doctors familiarity with the extensive use of prior authorization in the private sector, any such effect seems unlikely.

				We therefore agree with the Court of Appeals resolution of the pre-emption issue based on the record before us.  We again reiterate that the question whether the Secretarys approval must be sought before Maine Rx Program may go into effect is not before us.  Along these same lines, we offer no view as to whether it would be appropriate for the Secretary to disapprove this program if Maine had asked the Secretary to review it.  We also offer no view as to whether it would be proper for the Secretary to disallow funding for the Maine Medicaid program if Maine fails to seek approval from the Secretary of its Maine Rx Program.

				Whereas petitioners pre-emption challenge focused on the effects of the prior authorization requirement that would follow a manufacturers refusal to participate in the Rx Program, its Commerce Clause challenge focuses on the effects of the rebate agreements that will follow manufacturer compliance with the program.  As we understand the challenge, the alleged harm to interstate commerce would be the same regardless of whether manufacturer compliance is completely voluntary or the product of coercion.  Petitioner argues, first, that the rebate requirement constitutes impermissible extraterritorial regulation, and second, that it discriminates against interstate commerce in order to subsidize in-state retail sales.

				, however, the Maine Rx Program will not impose a disparate burden on any competitors.  A manufacturer could not avoid its rebate obligation by opening production facilities in Maine and would receive no benefit from the rebates even if it did so; the payments to the local pharmacists provide no special benefit to competitors of rebate-paying manufacturers.

						 From 1980 to 1989, payments for Medicaid prescription drugs increased 179% while Medicaid expenditures for all services increased by only 134%.  Between 1982 and 1988, prescription drug costs increased at an average annual rate of 9.5 percent … , more than any other component of the health care sector.  M.

						 The new Florida law … exempts certain Medicaid-eligible drugs from a prior authorization requirement.  If a drug is not on the preferred list, the prescribing doctor must call a state pharmacist to obtain approval of its use.  In the course of this procedure, the pharmacist informs the doctor of the availability of other drugs (usually on the preferred drug list) that allegedly have comparable therapeutic value but are less expensive.  The actual phone calls tend to be relatively brief (usually less than 10 minutes in length), and approval of the prescribing doctors first-choice drug is guaranteed in 100 percent of all cases, provided only that he or she make the telephone call.  During the first three months of the program, approximately 55 percent of all these calls have resulted in a change of the prescription to a drug on the preferred drug list.  Naturally, because this procedure may tend to promote less profitable drugs at the expense of more profitable ones, it is not favored by the pharmaceutical manufacturers that brought this lawsuit.  304 F. 3d, at 1198.

				 Congress enacted a cost-saving measure in 1990 that requires drug companies to pay rebates to States on their Medicaid purchases.  Over the last several years, state legislatures have enacted supplemental rebate programs to achieve additional cost savings on Medicaid purchases as well as for purchases made by other needy citizens.  The Maine Rx program, enacted in 2000, is primarily intended to provide discounted prescription drugs to Maines uninsured citizens but its coverage is open to all residents of the State.  Under the program, Maine will attempt to negotiate rebates with drug manufacturers to fund the reduced price for drugs offered to Maine Rx participants.  If a drug company does not enter into a rebate agreement, its Medicaid sales will be subjected to a prior authorization procedure.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In this case, an association of nonresident drug manufacturers has challenged the constitutionality of the Maine Rx Program, claiming that the program is pre-empted by the federal Medicaid statute and that it violates the negative Commerce Clause.  The association has not alleged that the program denies Medicaid patients meaningful access to prescription drugs or that it has excluded any drugs from access to the market in Maine.  Instead, it contends that the program imposes a significant burden on Medicaid recipients by requiring prior authorization in certain circumstances without serving any valid Medicaid purpose, and that the program effectively regulates out-of-state commerce.  The District Court sustained both challenges and entered a preliminary injunction preventing implementation of the statute.  The Court of Appeals reversed, and we granted certiorari because the questions presented are of national importance.

				In 2000, the Maine Legislature established the Maine Rx Program to reduce prescription drug prices for residents of the State.  Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 22, §2681 (West Supp. 2002).  The statute provides that the State [shall] act as a pharmacy benefit manager in order to make prescription drugs more affordable for qualified Maine residents, thereby increasing the overall health of Maine residents, promoting healthy communities and protecting the public health and welfare.  §2681(1).  The program is intended to enable individuals to buy drugs from retail pharmacies at a discount roughly equal to the rebate on Medicaid purchases.  See §2681(4).

				  Three of them comment on the operation of prior authorization programs administered by private managed care organizations, describing their actual and potential adverse impact on both manufacturers and patients.  Thus, one executive stated: Imposition of a prior authorization [(PA)] requirement with respect to a particular drug severely curtails access to the drug for covered patients and sharply reduces the drugs market share and sales, as the PA causes a shift of patients to competing drugs of other manufacturers that are not subject to a PA.  Because a PA imposes additional procedural burdens on physicians prescribing the manufacturers drug and retail pharmacies dispensing it, the effect of a PA is to diminish the manufacturers goodwill that helped foster demand for its drug over competing drugs produced by other manufacturers, and to shift physician and patient loyalty to those competing drugs, perhaps permanently.

				  Another affidavit described how prior authorization by a managed care organization in Nevada had sharply reduced the market share of four of SmithKlines drugs.

				  In the third affidavit, Dr. Howell of SmithKline Beecham Corporation expressed the opinion that prior authorization had never been required in one program for the purpose of influencing the manufacturers pricing behavior in another program, and that such use without regard to safety or efficacy, will lead to drugs being prescribed that are less safe and efficacious.

				Respondents opposition to the motion was supported by Concannons own affidavit and the affidavits of two doctors.  They do not dispute the factual assertions concerning the impact of prior authorization on the drug companies market shares, but instead comment on the benefits of prior authorization for patients.  The States Medicaid Medical Director, Dr. Clifford, explained that [p]hysicians in Maine are already well acquainted with the extensive prior authorization programs of the four HMO/Insurance programs which collectively cover nearly half the states residents and that the State had taken steps to ensure that physicians will always be able to prescribe the safest and most efficacious drugs for their Medicaid patients.

, the court first held that Maine had no power to regulate the prices paid to drug manufacturers in transactions that occur out of the State.  Recognizing that some of their sales were made to two distributors in Maine, the court further held that the Medicaid Act pre-empted Maines Rx Program insofar as it threatened to impose a prior authorization requirement on nonparticipating manufacturers.  In so holding, the court assumed for the purpose of the decision that the  Department of Human Services will not deny a single Medicaid recipient access to the safest and most efficacious prescription drug therapy indicated for their individual medical circumstances. 

				  In that courts view, pre-emption was nevertheless required because Maine can point to no

				  In the District Courts view, the fact that the alteration served purposes outside the scope of the Medicaid program and created an obstacle to the administration of the federal program was sufficient to establish pre-emption: No matter how modest an obstacle the new prior authorization amounts to (the parties disagree on the severity of the obstacle), it is an obstacledrugs on the list must be approved by the state Medicaid Medical Director before they can be dispensed … .

				The Court of Appeals disagreed with the District Courts analysis of the pre-emption issue for three reasons.  First, since the federal statute expressly authorizes use of prior authorization, it found no conflict between the Maine Act and Medicaids structure and purpose.  249 F. 3d 66, 75 (CA1 2001).  In its view, as long as there is compliance with the federal 24- and 72-hour conditions, the States motivation for imposing the requirement is irrelevant.  Second, given the absence of an actual conflict, the court found that the mere fact that Maine Rx fails to directly
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				advance the purpose of the federal program is an insufficient basis for inflicting the strong medicine of preemption on a state statute.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 76.  Third, the court further stated that, assuming the relevance of the States motivation, the Maine Rx Program furthers Medicaids aim of providing medical services to those whose income and resources are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical services, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/1396.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §1396</a>, even if the individuals covered by the Maine Rx Program are not poor enough to qualify for Medicaid.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  Moreover, the court held that there is evidence that making prescription drugs more accessible to the uninsured may keep some of them off Medicaid thereby minimizing the States Medicaid expenditures.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court of Appeals also reviewed the affidavits and concluded that they fall short of establishing that the Act will inflict inevitable or even probable harm on Medicaid patients, and thus were insufficient to support a pre-emption-based facial challenge.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 78.  The Court did, however, express concern that the prior authorization requirement might affect the quality of medical care for Medicaid recipients in subtle ways, such as inconveniencing prescribing physicians.  It therefore expressly preserved petitioners right to renew its pre-emption challenge after implementation of the program should there be evidence that Medicaid recipients are harmed by the prior authorization requirement as applied. 

.  By no means will our answer to that question finally determine the validity of Maines Rx Program.

				  While the petition for certiorari was pending, the United States filed a brief recommending that we deny review, in part because further proceedings may clarify the issues.  Its brief cautioned against the adoption of a rule prohibiting prior authorization programs whenever they operate in part to benefit a non-Medicaid population, and suggested that a program tailored to benefit needy persons who are not Medicaid-eligible might advance Medicaid-related goals.

				  That brief, however, as well as the Federal Governments brief filed after we granted review, expressed the opinion that, because Maines program was adopted without the Secretarys approval and was open to all Maine residents regardless of financial need, it was not tailored to achieve Medicaid-related goals and was therefore invalid.  Like the interlocutory judicial rulings in this case, we assume that a more complete understanding of all the relevant facts might lead to a modification of the views expressed in those briefs.  In all events, we must confront the issues without the benefit of either a complete record or any dispositive ruling by the Secretary.

				The issue we confront is, of course, quite different from the question that would be presented if the Secretary, after a hearing, had held that the Maine Rx Program was an impermissible amendment of its Medicaid Plan.  In such event, the Secretarys ruling would be presumptively valid.  As the case comes to us, however, the question is whether there is a probability that Maines program was pre-empted by the mere existence of the federal statute.

				The centerpiece of petitioners attack on Maines Rx Program is its allegedly unique use of a threat to impose a prior authorization requirement on Medicaid sales to coerce manufacturers into reducing their prices on sales to non-Medicaid recipients.  Petitioner argues, and the District Court held, that the potential interference with the delivery of Medicaid benefits without any benefit to the federal program is prohibited by the federal statute.  In accepting this argument, the District Court relied heavily on the fact that Maine had failed to identify any 
				<em>
					Medicaid
				</em>
				 purpose in its new authorization requirement.  It appears that Maine had argued before the District Court that such a purpose was unnecessary because the federal statute expressly authorizes what it has done.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In this Court, petitioner argues that it could not have been an abuse of discretion for the District Court to decide the case on the assumption that the program will serve no Medicaid purpose, even if that assumption is erroneous, given that the State, insisting that no such purpose was necessary, offered no Medicaid purpose in its opposition to the motion for a temporary injunction.  To the extent that petitioner is relying on a waiver theory, such reliance is inappropriate because the State never represented that there was no Medicaid purpose served by its program; it simply argued that it did not need to offer one.  Regardless of the legal position taken by the State, petitioner bore the burden of establishing, by a clear showing, a probability of success on the merits.  See 
				<em>

				 (requiring movant to demonstrate a substantial likelihood of success on the merits).  Accordingly, it was petitioners burden to show that there was no Medicaid-related goal or purpose served by Maine Rx.  Given that burden, if the program on its face clearly serves some Medicaid-related goals, it would follow that the District Courts evaluation rested on an erroneous predicate.  We are persuaded that there are three such goals plainly present in the Maine Rx Program.

				The Court of Appeals identified two Medicaid-related interests that will be served if the program is successful and rebates become available on sales to uninsured individuals.  First, the program will provide medical benefits to persons who can be described as medically needy even if they do not qualify for AFDC or SSI benefits.  There is some factual dispute concerning the extent to which the program will also benefit nonneedy persons, but even if the program is more inclusive than the Secretary thinks it should be, the potential benefits for nonneedy persons would not nullify the benefits that would be provided to the neediest segment of the uninsured population.

				  Second, there is the possibility that, by enabling some borderline aged and infirm persons better access to prescription drugs earlier, Medicaid expenses will be reduced.  If members of this borderline group are not able to purchase necessary prescription medicine, their conditions may worsen, causing further financial hardship and thus making it more likely that they will end up in the Medicaid program and require more expensive treatment.

				A third rather obvious Medicaid purpose will be fostered whenever it is necessary to impose the prior authorization requirement on a manufacturer that refuses to participate.

				The fact that the Maine Rx Program may serve Medicaid-related purposes, both by providing benefits to needy persons and by curtailing the States Medicaid costs, would not provide a sufficient basis for upholding the program if it severely curtailed Medicaid recipients access to prescription drugs.

, despite accepting the plaintiffs submission that nontherapeutic abortions are both less dangerous and less expensive than childbirth, we held that Pennsylvanias interest in encouraging normal childbirth provided an adequate justification for its decision to exclude the abortion procedure from its Medicaid program.  Maines interest in protecting the health of its uninsured residents also provides a plainly permissible justification for a prior authorization requirement that is assumed to have only a minimal impact on Medicaid recipients access to prescription drugs.  The Medicaid Act contains no categorical prohibition against reliance on state interests unrelated to the Medicaid program itself when a State is fashioning the particular contours of its own program.  It retains the considerable latitude that characterizes optional participation in a jointly financed benefit program.

				To the extent that the Work Rules embody New Yorks attempt to promote self-reliance and civic responsibility, to assure that limited state welfare funds be spent on behalf of those genuinely incapacitated and most in need, and to cope with the fiscal hardships enveloping many state and local governments, this Court should not lightly interfere.

				<em>

				</em>
				at 413.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
The mere fact that the New York program imposed a nonfederal obstacle to continued eligibility for benefits did not provide a sufficient basis for pre-emption, but we left open questions concerning possible conflicts with the federal program for resolution in further proceedings.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 422423.  Similarly, in this case, the mere fact that prior authorization may impose a modest impediment to access to prescription drugs provided at government expense does not provide a sufficient basis for pre-emption of the entire Maine Rx Program.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				At this stage of the proceeding, the severity of any impediment that Maines program may impose on a Medicaid patients access to the drug of her choice is a matter of conjecture.  To the extent that drug manufacturers agree to participate in the program, there will be no impediment.  To the extent that the manufacturers refuse, the Drug Utilization Review Committee will determine whether it is clinically appropriate to subject those drugs to prior authorization.  If the committee determines prior authorization is required, that requirement may result in the delivery of a less expensive drug than a physician first prescribed, but on the present record we cannot conclude that a significant number of patients medical needs
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				indeed, any patients medical needswill be adversely
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				affected.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The record does demonstrate that prior authorization may well have a significant adverse impact on the manufacturers of brand name prescription drugs and that it will impose some administrative costs on physicians.  The impact on manufacturers is not relevant because any transfer of business to less expensive products will produce savings for the Medicaid program.  The impact on doctors may be significant if it produces an administrative burden that affects the quality of their treatment of patients, but no such effect has been proved.  Moreover, given doctors familiarity with the extensive use of prior authorization in the private sector, any such effect seems unlikely.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We therefore agree with the Court of Appeals resolution of the pre-emption issue based on the record before us.  We again reiterate that the question whether the Secretarys approval must be sought before Maine Rx Program may go into effect is not before us.  Along these same lines, we offer no view as to whether it would be appropriate for the Secretary to disapprove this program if Maine had asked the Secretary to review it.  We also offer no view as to whether it would be proper for the Secretary to disallow funding for the Maine Medicaid program if Maine fails to seek approval from the Secretary of its Maine Rx Program.

				Whereas petitioners pre-emption challenge focused on the effects of the prior authorization requirement that would follow a manufacturers refusal to participate in the Rx Program, its Commerce Clause challenge focuses on the effects of the rebate agreements that will follow manufacturer compliance with the program.  As we understand the challenge, the alleged harm to interstate commerce would be the same regardless of whether manufacturer compliance is completely voluntary or the product of coercion.  Petitioner argues, first, that the rebate requirement constitutes impermissible extraterritorial regulation, and second, that it discriminates against interstate commerce in order to subsidize in-state retail sales.

But, as the Court of Appeals correctly stated, unlike price control or price affirmation statutes, the Maine Act does not regulate the price of any out-of-state transaction, either by its express terms or by its inevitable effect.  Maine does not insist that manufacturers sell their drugs to a wholesaler for a certain price.

, we reviewed the constitutionality of a Massachusetts pricing order that imposed an assessment on all fluid milk sold by dealers to Massachusetts retailers and distributed the proceeds to Massachusetts dairy farmers.  Because two-thirds of the assessed milk was produced by out-of-state farmers while the entire fund was used to benefit in-state farmers, the order effectively imposed a tax on out-of-state producers to subsidize production by their in-state competitors.  We concluded that the program was invalid because it had a discriminatory effect analogous to a protective tariff that taxes goods imported from neighboring states but does not tax similar products produced locally.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Petitioner argues that Maines Rx fund is similar because it would be created entirely from rebates paid by out-of-state manufacturers and would be used to subsidize sales by local pharmacists to local consumers.  Unlike the situation in 
				<em>
					West Lynn
				</em>
				, however, the Maine Rx Program will not impose a disparate burden on any competitors.  A manufacturer could not avoid its rebate obligation by opening production facilities in Maine and would receive no benefit from the rebates even if it did so; the payments to the local pharmacists provide no special benefit to competitors of rebate-paying manufacturers.

						 The new Florida law … exempts certain Medicaid-eligible drugs from a prior authorization requirement.  If a drug is not on the preferred list, the prescribing doctor must call a state pharmacist to obtain approval of its use.  In the course of this procedure, the pharmacist informs the doctor of the availability of other drugs (usually on the preferred drug list) that allegedly have comparable therapeutic value but are less expensive.  The actual phone calls tend to be relatively brief (usually less than 10 minutes in length), and approval of the prescribing doctors first-choice drug is guaranteed in 100 percent of all cases, provided only that he or she make the telephone call.  During the first three months of the program, approximately 55 percent of all these calls have resulted in a change of the prescription to a drug on the preferred drug list.  Naturally, because this procedure may tend to promote less profitable drugs at the expense of more profitable ones, it is not favored by the pharmaceutical manufacturers that brought this lawsuit.  304 F. 3d, at 1198.

				 Congress enacted a cost-saving measure in 1990 that requires drug companies to pay rebates to States on their Medicaid purchases.  Over the last several years, state legislatures have enacted supplemental rebate programs to achieve additional cost savings on Medicaid purchases as well as for purchases made by other needy citizens.  The Maine Rx program, enacted in 2000, is primarily intended to provide discounted prescription drugs to Maines uninsured citizens but its coverage is open to all residents of the State.  Under the program, Maine will attempt to negotiate rebates with drug manufacturers to fund the reduced price for drugs offered to Maine Rx participants.  If a drug company does not enter into a rebate agreement, its Medicaid sales will be subjected to a prior authorization procedure.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In this case, an association of nonresident drug manufacturers has challenged the constitutionality of the Maine Rx Program, claiming that the program is pre-empted by the federal Medicaid statute and that it violates the negative Commerce Clause.  The association has not alleged that the program denies Medicaid patients meaningful access to prescription drugs or that it has excluded any drugs from access to the market in Maine.  Instead, it contends that the program imposes a significant burden on Medicaid recipients by requiring prior authorization in certain circumstances without serving any valid Medicaid purpose, and that the program effectively regulates out-of-state commerce.  The District Court sustained both challenges and entered a preliminary injunction preventing implementation of the statute.  The Court of Appeals reversed, and we granted certiorari because the questions presented are of national importance.

				Congress effectively ratified the Secretarys practice of approving state plans containing prior authorization requirements when it created its rebate program in an amendment contained in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA 1990).

				  The new program had two basic parts.  First, it imposed a general requirement that, in order to qualify for Medicaid payments, drug companies must enter into agreements either with the Secretary or, if authorized by the Secretary, with individual States, to provide rebates on their Medicaid sales of outpatient prescription drugs.
				<a name="ZO-9ref" href="#ZO-9" class="">

            </a>
				  The rebate on a single source drug or an innovator multiple source drug is the difference between the manufacturers average price and its best price, or 15.1% of the average manufacturer price, whichever is greater.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/1396r-8.html#c_1" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §§1396r8(c)(1)</a>, (2).  The rebate for other drugs is 11.1% of the average manufacturer price.  See §1396r8(c)(3).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, once a drug manufacturer enters into a rebate agreement, the law requires the State to provide coverage for that drug under its plan unless the State complies with one of the exclusion or restriction provisions in the Medicaid Act.  See §1396r8(d).  For example, a State may exclude coverage of drugs such as [a]gents … used for cosmetic purposes or hair growth.  §1396r8(d)(2)(C).

				Most relevant to this case, Congress allowed States, as a condition of coverage or payment for a covered outpatient drug, §1396r8(d)(5), to require approval of the drug before it is dispensed.  Thus, under OBRA 1990, except for a narrow category of new drugs,

				In 2000, the Maine Legislature established the Maine Rx Program to reduce prescription drug prices for residents of the State.  Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 22, §2681 (West Supp. 2002).  The statute provides that the State [shall] act as a pharmacy benefit manager in order to make prescription drugs more affordable for qualified Maine residents, thereby increasing the overall health of Maine residents, promoting healthy communities and protecting the public health and welfare.  §2681(1).

				For those manufacturers that do not enter into rebate agreements, there are two consequences: First, their nonparticipation is information that the Department of Human Services must release to health care providers and the public.  §2681(7).

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">

				  Three of them comment on the operation of prior authorization programs administered by private managed care organizations, describing their actual and potential adverse impact on both manufacturers and patients.  Thus, one executive stated: Imposition of a prior authorization [(PA)] requirement with respect to a particular drug severely curtails access to the drug for covered patients and sharply reduces the drugs market share and sales, as the PA causes a shift of patients to competing drugs of other manufacturers that are not subject to a PA.  Because a PA imposes additional procedural burdens on physicians prescribing the manufacturers drug and retail pharmacies dispensing it, the effect of a PA is to diminish the manufacturers goodwill that helped foster demand for its drug over competing drugs produced by other manufacturers, and to shift physician and patient loyalty to those competing drugs, perhaps permanently.

				Respondents opposition to the motion was supported by Concannons own affidavit and the affidavits of two doctors.  They do not dispute the factual assertions concerning the impact of prior authorization on the drug companies market shares, but instead comment on the benefits of prior authorization for patients.  The States Medicaid Medical Director, Dr. Clifford, explained that [p]hysicians in Maine are already well acquainted with the extensive prior authorization programs of the four HMO/Insurance programs which collectively cover nearly half the states residents and that the State had taken steps to ensure that physicians will always be able to prescribe the safest and most efficacious drugs for their Medicaid patients.

, the court first held that Maine had no power to regulate the prices paid to drug manufacturers in transactions that occur out of the State.  Recognizing that some of their sales were made to two distributors in Maine, the court further held that the Medicaid Act pre-empted Maines Rx Program insofar as it threatened to impose a prior authorization requirement on nonparticipating manufacturers.  In so holding, the court assumed for the purpose of the decision that the  Department of Human Services will not deny a single Medicaid recipient access to the safest and most efficacious prescription drug therapy indicated for their individual medical circumstances. 

				The Court of Appeals disagreed with the District Courts analysis of the pre-emption issue for three reasons.  First, since the federal statute expressly authorizes use of prior authorization, it found no conflict between the Maine Act and Medicaids structure and purpose.  249 F. 3d 66, 75 (CA1 2001).  In its view, as long as there is compliance with the federal 24- and 72-hour conditions, the States motivation for imposing the requirement is irrelevant.  Second, given the absence of an actual conflict, the court found that the mere fact that Maine Rx fails to directly
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				advance the purpose of the federal program is an insufficient basis for inflicting the strong medicine of preemption on a state statute.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 76.  Third, the court further stated that, assuming the relevance of the States motivation, the Maine Rx Program furthers Medicaids aim of providing medical services to those whose income and resources are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical services, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/1396.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §1396</a>, even if the individuals covered by the Maine Rx Program are not poor enough to qualify for Medicaid.  
				<em>

				</em>
				  Moreover, the court held that there is evidence that making prescription drugs more accessible to the uninsured may keep some of them off Medicaid thereby minimizing the States Medicaid expenditures.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court of Appeals also reviewed the affidavits and concluded that they fall short of establishing that the Act will inflict inevitable or even probable harm on Medicaid patients, and thus were insufficient to support a pre-emption-based facial challenge.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 78.  The Court did, however, express concern that the prior authorization requirement might affect the quality of medical care for Medicaid recipients in subtle ways, such as inconveniencing prescribing physicians.  It therefore expressly preserved petitioners right to renew its pre-emption challenge after implementation of the program should there be evidence that Medicaid recipients are harmed by the prior authorization requirement as applied. 

				  While the petition for certiorari was pending, the United States filed a brief recommending that we deny review, in part because further proceedings may clarify the issues.  Its brief cautioned against the adoption of a rule prohibiting prior authorization programs whenever they operate in part to benefit a non-Medicaid population, and suggested that a program tailored to benefit needy persons who are not Medicaid-eligible might advance Medicaid-related goals.

            </a>
				  That brief, however, as well as the Federal Governments brief filed after we granted review, expressed the opinion that, because Maines program was adopted without the Secretarys approval and was open to all Maine residents regardless of financial need, it was not tailored to achieve Medicaid-related goals and was therefore invalid.  Like the interlocutory judicial rulings in this case, we assume that a more complete understanding of all the relevant facts might lead to a modification of the views expressed in those briefs.  In all events, we must confront the issues without the benefit of either a complete record or any dispositive ruling by the Secretary.

				The issue we confront is, of course, quite different from the question that would be presented if the Secretary, after a hearing, had held that the Maine Rx Program was an impermissible amendment of its Medicaid Plan.  In such event, the Secretarys ruling would be presumptively valid.  As the case comes to us, however, the question is whether there is a probability that Maines program was pre-empted by the mere existence of the federal statute.  We start therefore with a presumption that the state statute is valid, see

				The centerpiece of petitioners attack on Maines Rx Program is its allegedly unique use of a threat to impose a prior authorization requirement on Medicaid sales to coerce manufacturers into reducing their prices on sales to non-Medicaid recipients.  Petitioner argues, and the District Court held, that the potential interference with the delivery of Medicaid benefits without any benefit to the federal program is prohibited by the federal statute.  In accepting this argument, the District Court relied heavily on the fact that Maine had failed to identify any 
				<em>
					Medicaid
				</em>
				 purpose in its new authorization requirement.  It appears that Maine had argued before the District Court that such a purpose was unnecessary because the federal statute expressly authorizes what it has done.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In this Court, petitioner argues that it could not have been an abuse of discretion for the District Court to decide the case on the assumption that the program will serve no Medicaid purpose, even if that assumption is erroneous, given that the State, insisting that no such purpose was necessary, offered no Medicaid purpose in its opposition to the motion for a temporary injunction.  To the extent that petitioner is relying on a waiver theory, such reliance is inappropriate because the State never represented that there was no Medicaid purpose served by its program; it simply argued that it did not need to offer one.  Regardless of the legal position taken by the State, petitioner bore the burden of establishing, by a clear showing, a probability of success on the merits.  See

				 (requiring movant to demonstrate a substantial likelihood of success on the merits).  Accordingly, it was petitioners burden to show that there was no Medicaid-related goal or purpose served by Maine Rx.  Given that burden, if the program on its face clearly serves some Medicaid-related goals, it would follow that the District Courts evaluation rested on an erroneous predicate.  We are persuaded that there are three such goals plainly present in the Maine Rx Program.

				The Court of Appeals identified two Medicaid-related interests that will be served if the program is successful and rebates become available on sales to uninsured individuals.  First, the program will provide medical benefits to persons who can be described as medically needy even if they do not qualify for AFDC or SSI benefits.  There is some factual dispute concerning the extent to which the program will also benefit nonneedy persons, but even if the program is more inclusive than the Secretary thinks it should be, the potential benefits for nonneedy persons would not nullify the benefits that would be provided to the neediest segment of the uninsured population.

				  Second, there is the possibility that, by enabling some borderline aged and infirm persons better access to prescription drugs earlier, Medicaid expenses will be reduced.  If members of this borderline group are not able to purchase necessary prescription medicine, their conditions may worsen, causing further financial hardship and thus making it more likely that they will end up in the Medicaid program and require more expensive treatment.

				A third rather obvious Medicaid purpose will be fostered whenever it is necessary to impose the prior authorization requirement on a manufacturer that refuses to participate.  As the record demonstrates, private managed care organizations typically require prior authorization both to protect patients from inappropriate prescriptions and

Maines interest in protecting the health of its uninsured residents also provides a plainly permissible justification for a prior authorization requirement that is assumed to have only a minimal impact on Medicaid recipients access to prescription drugs.  The Medicaid Act contains no categorical prohibition against reliance on state interests unrelated to the Medicaid program itself when a State is fashioning the particular contours of its own program.

				at 413.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
The mere fact that the New York program imposed a nonfederal obstacle to continued eligibility for benefits did not provide a sufficient basis for pre-emption, but we left open questions concerning possible conflicts with the federal program for resolution in further proceedings.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 422423.  Similarly, in this case, the mere fact that prior authorization may impose a modest impediment to access to prescription drugs provided at government expense does not provide a sufficient basis for pre-emption of the entire Maine Rx Program.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				At this stage of the proceeding, the severity of any impediment that Maines program may impose on a Medicaid patients access to the drug of her choice is a matter of conjecture.  To the extent that drug manufacturers agree to participate in the program, there will be no impediment.  To the extent that the manufacturers refuse, the Drug Utilization Review Committee will determine whether it is clinically appropriate to subject those drugs to prior authorization.  If the committee determines prior authorization is required, that requirement may result in the delivery of a less expensive drug than a physician first prescribed, but on the present record we cannot conclude that a significant number of patients medical needs
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				indeed, any patients medical needswill be adversely
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				affected.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The record does demonstrate that prior authorization may well have a significant adverse impact on the manufacturers of brand name prescription drugs and that it will impose some administrative costs on physicians.  The impact on manufacturers is not relevant because any transfer of business to less expensive products will produce savings for the Medicaid program.  The impact on doctors may be significant if it produces an administrative burden that affects the quality of their treatment of patients, but no such effect has been proved.  Moreover, given doctors familiarity with the extensive use of prior authorization in the private sector, any such effect seems unlikely.

				We therefore agree with the Court of Appeals resolution of the pre-emption issue based on the record before us.  We again reiterate that the question whether the Secretarys approval must be sought before Maine Rx Program may go into effect is not before us.  Along these same lines, we offer no view as to whether it would be appropriate for the Secretary to disapprove this program if Maine had asked the Secretary to review it.  We also offer no view as to whether it would be proper for the Secretary to disallow funding for the Maine Medicaid program if Maine fails to seek approval from the Secretary of its Maine Rx Program.

				Whereas petitioners pre-emption challenge focused on the effects of the prior authorization requirement that would follow a manufacturers refusal to participate in the Rx Program, its Commerce Clause challenge focuses on the effects of the rebate agreements that will follow manufacturer compliance with the program.  As we understand the challenge, the alleged harm to interstate commerce would be the same regardless of whether manufacturer compliance is completely voluntary or the product of coercion.  Petitioner argues, first, that the rebate requirement constitutes impermissible extraterritorial regulation, and second, that it discriminates against interstate commerce in order to subsidize in-state retail sales.

, that a Massachusetts price affirmation statute had the impermissible effect of regulating the price of beer sold in neighboring States.  Petitioner argues that the reasoning in those cases applies to what it characterizes as Maines regulation of the terms of transactions that occur elsewhere.  But, as the Court of Appeals correctly stated, unlike price control or price affirmation statutes, the Maine Act does not regulate the price of any out-of-state transaction, either by its express terms or by its inevitable effect.  Maine does not insist that manufacturers sell their drugs to a wholesaler for a certain price.  Similarly, Maine is not tying the price of its in-state products to out-of-state prices.  249 F. 3d, at 81

, we reviewed the constitutionality of a Massachusetts pricing order that imposed an assessment on all fluid milk sold by dealers to Massachusetts retailers and distributed the proceeds to Massachusetts dairy farmers.  Because two-thirds of the assessed milk was produced by out-of-state farmers while the entire fund was used to benefit in-state farmers, the order effectively imposed a tax on out-of-state producers to subsidize production by their in-state competitors.  We concluded that the program was invalid because it had a discriminatory effect analogous to a protective tariff that taxes goods imported from neighboring states but does not tax similar products produced locally.

				Petitioner argues that Maines Rx fund is similar because it would be created entirely from rebates paid by out-of-state manufacturers and would be used to subsidize sales by local pharmacists to local consumers.  Unlike the situation in 
				<em>

				, however, the Maine Rx Program will not impose a disparate burden on any competitors.  A manufacturer could not avoid its rebate obligation by opening production facilities in Maine and would receive no benefit from the rebates even if it did so; the payments to the local pharmacists provide no special benefit to competitors of rebate-paying manufacturers.

						 The new Florida law … exempts certain Medicaid-eligible drugs from a prior authorization requirement.  If a drug is not on the preferred list, the prescribing doctor must call a state pharmacist to obtain approval of its use.  In the course of this procedure, the pharmacist informs the doctor of the availability of other drugs (usually on the preferred drug list) that allegedly have comparable therapeutic value but are less expensive.  The actual phone calls tend to be relatively brief (usually less than 10 minutes in length), and approval of the prescribing doctors first-choice drug is guaranteed in 100 percent of all cases, provided only that he or she make the telephone call.  During the first three months of the program, approximately 55 percent of all these calls have resulted in a change of the prescription to a drug on the preferred drug list.

				I join Parts IIII and Part VI of the Courts opinion and Parts IV and VII of the pluralitys opinion.  I also agree with Part Vs conclusion.  The District Courts entry of a preliminary injunction rested upon a determination that federal Medicaid law pre-empted the Maine Rx program as long as Maines prior authorization program posed some obstacle,

				 14.  Yet the District Courts preliminary injunction nonetheless rests upon premises that subsequent developments have made clear are unrealistic.  For one thing, despite Maines initial failure to argue the matter, Maines program may further certain Medicaid-related objectives, at least to some degree.  
				<em>

				 at 1618 (plurality opinion).  For another, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (whose views are highly relevant to the question before us,

				<span class="softbreak"></span>

				</em>
				 at 14, n. 30 (plurality opinion); Letter from Theodore B. Olson, Solicitor General, to William K. Suter, Clerk of the Court (Jan. 10, 2003).  As a result, it is now apparent that proper determination of the pre-emption question will demand a more careful balancing of Medicaid-related harms and benefits than the District Court undertook.

 (finding a state law pre-empted where it would disturb and conflict with the balance embodied in [a] considered federal agency determination).  These post-entry considerations, along with the general importance of the pre-emption question, convince me that we should not overlook the District Courts technical misstatement of the proper legal standard, and that we should therefore affirm the Court of Appeals judgment vacating the injunction.

				By vacating the injunction, we shall also help ensure that the District Court takes account of the Secretarys views in further proceedings that may involve a renewed motion for a preliminary injunction.  It is important that the District Court do so.  The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) administers the Medicaid program.  Institutionally speaking, that agency is better able than a court to assemble relevant facts (
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 regarding harm caused to present Medicaid patients) and to make relevant predictions (
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 regarding furtherance of Medicaid-related goals).  And the law grants significant weight to any legal conclusion by the Secretary as to whether a program such as Maines is consistent with Medicaids objectives.  See,

				The Medicaid statute sets forth a method through which Maine may obtain those views.  A participating State must file a Medicaid plan with HHS and obtain HHS approval.

				In addition, the legal doctrine of primary jurisdiction permits a court itself to refer a question to the Secretary.

Rather, the question in each instance is whether a case raises issues of fact not within the conventional experience of judges, but within the purview of an agencys responsibilities; whether the limited functions of review by the judiciary are more rationally exercised, by preliminary resort to an agency better equipped than courts to resolve an issue in the first instance; or, in a word, whether preliminary reference of issues to the agency will promote that proper working relationship between court and agency that the primary jurisdiction doctrine seeks to facilitate.

 (finding a state law pre-empted where it would disturb and conflict with the balance embodied in [a] considered federal agency determination).  These post-entry considerations, along with the general importance of the pre-emption question, convince me that we should not overlook the District Courts technical misstatement of the proper legal standard, and that we should therefore affirm the Court of Appeals judgment vacating the injunction.

 (finding a state law pre-empted where it would disturb and conflict with the balance embodied in [a] considered federal agency determination).  These post-entry considerations, along with the general importance of the pre-emption question, convince me that we should not overlook the District Courts technical misstatement of the proper legal standard, and that we should therefore affirm the Court of Appeals judgment vacating the injunction.

				By vacating the injunction, we shall also help ensure that the District Court takes account of the Secretarys views in further proceedings that may involve a renewed motion for a preliminary injunction.  It is important that the District Court do so.  The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) administers the Medicaid program.  Institutionally speaking, that agency is better able than a court to assemble relevant facts (
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 regarding harm caused to present Medicaid patients) and to make relevant predictions (

Rather, the question in each instance is whether a case raises issues of fact not within the conventional experience of judges, but within the purview of an agencys responsibilities; whether the limited functions of review by the judiciary are more rationally exercised, by preliminary resort to an agency better equipped than courts to resolve an issue in the first instance; or, in a word, whether preliminary reference of issues to the agency will promote that proper working relationship between court and agency that the primary jurisdiction doctrine seeks to facilitate.

 (finding a state law pre-empted where it would disturb and conflict with the balance embodied in [a] considered federal agency determination).

				By vacating the injunction, we shall also help ensure that the District Court takes account of the Secretarys views in further proceedings that may involve a renewed motion for a preliminary injunction.  It is important that the District Court do so.  The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) administers the Medicaid program.  Institutionally speaking, that agency is better able than a court to assemble relevant facts (

Rather, the question in each instance is whether a case raises issues of fact not within the conventional experience of judges, but within the purview of an agencys responsibilities; whether the limited functions of review by the judiciary are more rationally exercised, by preliminary resort to an agency better equipped than courts to resolve an issue in the first instance; or, in a word, whether preliminary reference of issues to the agency will promote that proper working relationship between court and agency that the primary jurisdiction doctrine seeks to facilitate.

				By vacating the injunction, we shall also help ensure that the District Court takes account of the Secretarys views in further proceedings that may involve a renewed motion for a preliminary injunction.  It is important that the District Court do so.  The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) administers the Medicaid program.  Institutionally speaking, that agency is better able than a court to assemble relevant facts (
				<em>

Rather, the question in each instance is whether a case raises issues of fact not within the conventional experience of judges, but within the purview of an agencys responsibilities; whether the limited functions of review by the judiciary are more rationally exercised, by preliminary resort to an agency better equipped than courts to resolve an issue in the first instance; or, in a word, whether preliminary reference of issues to the agency will promote that proper working relationship between court and agency that the primary jurisdiction doctrine seeks to facilitate.

				By vacating the injunction, we shall also help ensure that the District Court takes account of the Secretarys views in further proceedings that may involve a renewed motion for a preliminary injunction.  It is important that the District Court do so.  The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) administers the Medicaid program.

				By vacating the injunction, we shall also help ensure that the District Court takes account of the Secretarys views in further proceedings that may involve a renewed motion for a preliminary injunction.

				I join Parts IIII and Part VI of the Courts opinion and Parts IV and VII of the pluralitys opinion.  I also agree with Part Vs conclusion.  The District Courts entry of a preliminary injunction rested upon a determination that federal Medicaid law pre-empted the Maine Rx program as long as Maines prior authorization program posed some obstacle, 
				<em>
					&lt;fs fs="5"&gt; &lt;fs fs="11"&gt;[n]o matter how modest,&lt;fs fs="5"&gt; &lt;fs fs="11"&gt;

				 to realizing federal Medicaid goals.

				</em>

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				To prevail, petitioner ultimately must demonstrate that Maines program would seriously compromise important federal interests.

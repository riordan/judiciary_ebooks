				In revising its employee pay plan, respondent City granted raises to all police officers and police dispatchers in an attempt to bring their starting salaries up to the regional average.  Officers with less than five years service received proportionately greater raises than those with more seniority, and most officers over 40 had more than five years of service.  Petitioners, a group of older officers, filed suit under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), claiming, 
				<em>
					inter alia, 
				</em>
				that they were adversely affected by the plan because of their age.  The District Court granted the City summary judgment.  Affirming, the Fifth Circuit ruled that disparate-impact claims are categorically unavailable under the ADEA, but it assumed that the facts alleged by petitioners would entitle them to relief under

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				1. The ADEA authorizes recovery in disparate-impact cases comparable to 
				<em>
					Griggs.
				</em>
				  Except for the substitution of age for race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, the language of ADEA §4(a)(2) and Title VII §703(a)(2) is identical.  Unlike Title VII, however, ADEA §4(f)(1) significantly narrows its coverage by permitting any otherwise prohibited action where the differentiation is based on reasonable factors other than age (hereinafter RFOA provision).  Pp. 24.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				2. Petitioners have not set forth a valid disparate-impact claim.  Two textual differences between the ADEA and Title VII make clear that the disparate-impact theorys scope is narrower under the ADEA than under Title VII.  One is the RFOA provision.  The other is the amendment to Title VII in the Civil Right Act of 1991, which modified this Courts 
				<em>
					Wards Cove Packing Co.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Atonio,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/490/642" class="subref" title="subref">490 U. S. 642</a>, holding that narrowly construed the scope of liability on a disparate-impact theory.  Because the relevant 1991 amendments expanded Title VIIs coverage but did not amend the ADEA or speak to age discrimination, 
				<em>
					Wards Cove
				</em>
				s pre-1991 interpretation of Title VIIs identical language remains applicable to the ADEA.  Congress decision to limit the ADEAs coverage by including the RFOA provision is consistent with the fact that age, unlike Title VIIs protected classifications, not uncommonly has relevance to an individuals capacity to engage in certain types of employment.  Here, petitioners have done little more than point out that the pay plan is relatively less generous to older workers than to younger ones.  They have not, as required by 
				<em>
					Wards Cove,
				</em>
				 identified any specific test, requirement, or practice within the pay plan that has an adverse impact on older workers.  Further, the record makes clear that the Citys plan was based on reasonable factors other than age.  The Citys explanation for the differential between older and younger workers was its perceived need to make junior officers salaries competitive with comparable positions in the market.  Thus, the disparate impact was attributable to the Citys decision to give raises based on seniority and position.  Reliance on these factors is unquestionably reasonable given the Citys goal.  Pp. 1114.

				Petitioners, police and public safety officers employed by the city of Jackson, Mississippi (hereinafter City), contend that salary increases received in 1999 violated the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) because they were less generous to officers over the age of 40 than to younger officers.

				On October 1, 1998, the City adopted a pay plan granting raises to all City employees.  The stated purpose of the plan was to attract and retain qualified people, provide incentive for performance, maintain competitiveness with other public sector agencies and ensure equitable compensation to all employees regardless of age, sex, race and/or disability.

				  On May 1, 1999, a revision of the plan, which was motivated, at least in part, by the Citys desire to bring the starting salaries of police officers up to the regional average, granted raises to all police officers and police dispatchers.  Those who had less than five years of tenure received proportionately greater raises when compared to their former pay than those with more seniority.  Although some officers over the age of 40 had less than five years of service, most of the older officers had more.

				Petitioners are a group of older officers who filed suit under the ADEA claiming both that the City deliberately discriminated against them because of their age (the disparate-treatment claim) and that they were adversely affected by the plan because of their age (the disparate-impact claim).  The District Court granted summary judgment to the City on both claims.  The Court of Appeals held that the ruling on the former claim was premature because petitioners were entitled to further discovery on the issue of intent, but it affirmed the dismissal of the disparate-impact claim.  351 F. 3d 183 (CA5 2003). Over one judges dissent, the majority concluded that disparate-impact claims are categorically unavailable under the ADEA.  Both the majority and the dissent assumed that the facts alleged by petitioners would entitle them to relief under the reasoning of Griggs.

				We granted the officers petition for certiorari, 541 U. S. ___ (2004), and now hold that the ADEA does authorize recovery in disparate-impact cases comparable to Griggs

				In determining whether the ADEA authorizes disparate-impact claims, we begin with the premise that when Congress uses the same language in two statutes having similar purposes, particularly when one is enacted shortly after the other, it is appropriate to presume that Congress intended that text to have the same meaning in both statutes.

				  Our unanimous interpretation of §703(a)(2) of the Title VII in 
				<em>
					Griggs
				</em>
				 is therefore a precedent of compelling importance.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In 
				<em>
					Griggs
				</em>
				, a case decided four years after the enactment of the ADEA, we considered whether §703 of Title VII prohibited an employer from requiring a high school education or passing of a standardized general intelligence test as a condition of employment in or transfer to jobs when (a) neither standard is shown to be significantly related to successful job performance, (b) both requirements operate to disqualify Negroes at a substantially higher rate than white applicants, and (c) the jobs in question formerly had been filled only by white employees as part of a longstanding practice of giving preference to whites.  401 U. S., at 425426.  Accepting the Court of Appeals conclusion that the employer had adopted the diploma and test requirements without any intent to discriminate, we held that good faith does not redeem employment procedures or testing mechanisms that operate as built-in headwinds for minority groups and are unrelated to measuring job capability.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 432.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We explained that Congress had directed the thrust of the Act to the 
				<em>
					consequences
				</em>
				 of employment practices, not simply the motivation.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  We relied on the fact that history is filled with examples of men and women who rendered highly effective performance without the conventional badges of accomplishment in terms of certificates, diplomas, or degrees.  Diplomas and tests are useful servants, but Congress has mandated the commonsense proposition that they are not to become masters of reality.

				at 433.  And we noted that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which had enforcement responsibility, had issued guidelines that accorded with our view.

				While our opinion in 
				<em>
					Griggs
				</em>
				 relied primarily on the purposes of the Act, buttressed by the fact that the EEOC had endorsed the same view, we have subsequently noted that our holding represented the better reading of the statutory text as well.  See

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">991</a> (1988)
.  Neither §703(a)(2) nor the comparable language in the ADEA simply prohibits actions that limit, segregate, or classify persons; rather the language prohibits such actions that deprive any individual of employment opportunities or 
				<em>
					otherwise adversely affect

				The Court of Appeals categorical rejection of disparate-impact liability, like Justice OConnor
				s, rested primarily on the RFOA provision and the majoritys analysis of legislative history.  As we have already explained, we think the history of the enactment of the ADEA, with particular reference to the Wirtz Report, supports the pre-
				<em>

				 consensus concerning disparate-impact liability.  And 
				<em>

It is, accordingly, in cases involving disparate-impact claims that the RFOA provision plays its principal role by precluding liability if the adverse impact was attributable to a nonage factor that was reasonable.  Rather than support an argument that disparate impact is unavailable under the ADEA, the RFOA provision actually supports the contrary conclusion.

				Finally, we note that both the Department of Labor, which initially drafted the legislation, and the EEOC, which is the agency charged by Congress with responsibility for implementing the statute, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/29/628.html" class="subref" title="subref">29 U. S. C. §628</a>, have consistently interpreted the ADEA to authorize relief on a disparate-impact theory.  The initial regulations, while not

				The text of the statute, as interpreted in

        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				Two textual differences between the ADEA and Title VII make it clear that even though both statutes authorize recovery on a disparate-impact theory, the scope of disparate-impact liability under ADEA is narrower than under Title VII.  The first is the RFOA provision, which we have already identified.  The second is the amendment to Title VII contained in the Civil Rights Act of 1991, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">105</a>Stat.
1071.  One of the purposes of that amendment was to modify the Courts holding in 
				<em>
					Wards Cove Packing Co.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Atonio,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/490/642" class="subref" title="subref">490 U. S. 642</a> (1989)
, a case in which we narrowly construed the employers exposure to liability on a disparate-impact theory.  See Civil Rights Act of 1991, §2, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">105</a>Stat.
1071.  While the relevant 1991 amendments expanded the coverage of Title VII, they did not amend the ADEA or speak to the subject of age discrimination.  Hence, 
				<em>
					Wards Cove
				</em>
				s
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				pre-1991 interpretation of Title VIIs identical language remains applicable to the ADEA.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Congress decision to limit the coverage of the ADEA by including the RFOA provision is consistent with the fact that age, unlike race or other classifications protected by Title VII, not uncommonly has relevance to an individuals capacity to engage in certain types of employment.  To be sure, Congress recognized that this is not always the case, and that society may perceive those differences to be larger or more consequential than they are in fact.  However, as Secretary Wirtz noted in his report, certain circumstances … unquestionably affect older workers more strongly, as a group, than they do younger workers.  Wirtz Report 28.  Thus, it is not surprising that certain employment criteria that are routinely used may be reasonable despite their adverse impact on older workers as a group.  Moreover, intentional discrimination on the basis of age has not occurred at the same levels as discrimination against those protected by Title VII.  While the ADEA reflects Congress intent to give older workers employment opportunities whenever possible, the RFOA provision reflects this historical difference.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Turning to the case before us, we initially note that petitioners have done little more than point out that the pay plan at issue is relatively less generous to older workers than to younger workers.  They have not identified any specific test, requirement, or practice within the pay plan that has an adverse impact on older workers.  As we held in 
				<em>
					Wards Cove
				</em>
				, it is not enough to simply allege that there is a disparate impact on workers, or point to a generalized policy that leads to such an impact.  Rather, the employee is  responsible for isolating and identifying the 
				<em>
					specific
				</em>
				 employment practices that are allegedly responsible for any observed statistical disparities.   490 U. S., at 656 (emphasis added) (quoting 
				<em>
					Watson, 
				</em>
				487 U. S., at 994).  Petitioners have failed to do so.  Their failure to identify the specific practice being challenged is the sort of omission that could result in employers being potentially liable for the myriad of innocent causes that may lead to statistical imbalances … .   490 U. S., at 657.  In this case not only did petitioners thus err by failing to identify the relevant practice, but it is also clear from the record that the Citys plan was based on reasonable factors other than age.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The plan divided each of five basic positionspolice officer, master police officer, police sergeant, police lieutenant, and deputy police chiefinto a series of steps and half-steps.  The wage for each range was based on a survey of comparable communities in the Southeast.  Employees were then assigned a step (or half-step) within their position that corresponded to the lowest step that would still give the individual a 2% raise.  Most of the officers were in the three lowest ranks; in each of those ranks there were officers under age 40 and officers over 40.  In none did their age affect their compensation.  The few officers in the two highest ranks are all over 40.  Their raises, though higher in dollar amount than the raises given to junior officers, represented a smaller percentage of their salaries, which of course are higher than the salaries paid to their juniors.  They are members of the class complaining of the disparate impact of the award.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Petitioners evidence established two principal facts: First, almost two-thirds (66.2%) of the officers under 40 received raises of more than 10% while less than half (45.3%) of those over 40 did.
				<a name="ZO-12ref" href="#ZO-12" class="">

					12
				</b>
                </sup>
            </a>
				  Second, the average percentage increase for the entire class of officers with less than five years of tenure was somewhat higher than the percentage for those with more seniority.
				<a name="ZO-13ref" href="#ZO-13" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>
					13
				</b>
                </sup>
            </a>
				  Because older officers tended to occupy more senior positions, on average they received smaller increases when measured as a percentage of their salary.  The basic explanation for the differential was the Citys perceived need to raise the salaries of junior officers to make them competitive with comparable positions in the market.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Thus, the disparate impact is attributable to the Citys decision to give raises based on seniority and position.  Reliance on seniority and rank is unquestionably reasonable given the Citys goal of raising employees salaries to match those in surrounding communities.  In sum, we hold that the Citys decision to grant a larger raise to lower echelon employees for the purpose of bringing salaries in line with that of surrounding police forces was a decision based on a reasonable factor other than age that responded to the Citys legitimate goal of retaining police officers.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				While there may have been other reasonable ways for the City to achieve its goals, the one selected was not unreasonable.  Unlike the business necessity test, which asks whether there are other ways for the employer to achieve its goals that do not result in a disparate impact on a protected class, the reasonableness inquiry includes no such requirement.

						 The congressional purposes on which we relied in Griggs have a striking parallel to two important points made in the Wirtz Report.  Just as the Griggs opinion ruled out discrimination based on racial animus as a problem in that case, the Wirtz Report concluded that there was no significant discrimination of that kind so far as older workers are concerned.  Wirtz Report 23.  And just as Griggs recognized that the high school diploma requirement, which was unrelated to job performance, had an unfair impact on African-Americans who had received inferior educational opportunities in segregated schools, 401 U. S., at 430, the Wirtz Report identified the identical obstacle to the employment of older workers.  Any formal employment standard which requires, for example, a high school diploma will obviously work against the employment of many older workersunfairly if, despite his limited schooling, an older workers years of experience have given him the relevant equivalent of a high school education.  Wirtz Report 21.  Thus, just as the statutory text is identical, there is a remarkable similarity between the congressional goals we cited in Griggs and those present in the Wirtz Report.

						 In reaching a contrary conclusion, Justice OConnor ignores key textual differences between §4(a)(1), which does not encompass-disparate-impact liability, and §4(a)(2).  Section (a)(1) makes it unlawful for an employer to fail or refuse to hire … any individual … because of such individuals age.  (Emphasis added.)  The focus of the section is on the employers actions with respect to the targeted individual.  Paragraph (a)(2), however, makes it unlawful for an employer to limit … his employees in any way that would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because of such individuals age.  (Emphasis added.)  Unlike in paragraph (a)(2), there is thus an incongruity between the employers actionswhich are focused on his employees generallyand the individual employee who adversely suffers because of those actions.  Thus, an employer who classifies his employees without respect to age may still be liable under the terms of this paragraph if such classification adversely affects the employee because of that employees agethe very definition of disparate impact.  Justice OConnor is therefore quite wrong to suggest that the textual differences between the two paragraphs are unimportant.

						 Justice OConnor reaches a contrary conclusion based on the text of the statute, the legislative history, and the structure of the statute.  As we explain above, n. 6, supra, her textual reasoning is not persuasive.  Further, while Congress may have intended to remedy disparate-impact type situations through noncoercive measures in part, there is nothing to suggest that it intended such measures to be the sole method of achieving the desired result of remedying practices that had an adverse effect on older workers.  Finally, we agree that the differences between age and the classes protected in Title VII are relevant, and that Congress might well have intended to treat the two differently.  See infra, at 7 (OConnor, J., concurring in judgment).   However, Congress obviously considered those classes of individuals to be sufficiently similar to warrant enacting identical legislation, at least with respect to employment practices it sought to prohibit.  While those differences, coupled with a difference in the text of the statue such as the RFOA provision, may warrant addressing disparate-impact claims in the two statutes differently, see infra, at 1112, it does not justify departing from the plain text and our settled interpretation of that text.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/29/206.html#d_1" class="subref" title="subref">29 U. S. C. §206(d)(1)</a>, Congress barred recovery if a pay differential was based on any other factorreasonable or unreasonableother than sex.  The fact that Congress provided that employees could use only reasonable factors in defending a suit under the ADEA is therefore instructive.

				Petitioners, police and public safety officers employed by the city of Jackson, Mississippi (hereinafter City), contend that salary increases received in 1999 violated the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) because they were less generous to officers over the age of 40 than to younger officers.

				On October 1, 1998, the City adopted a pay plan granting raises to all City employees.  The stated purpose of the plan was to attract and retain qualified people, provide incentive for performance, maintain competitiveness with other public sector agencies and ensure equitable compensation to all employees regardless of age, sex, race and/or disability.

				  On May 1, 1999, a revision of the plan, which was motivated, at least in part, by the Citys desire to bring the starting salaries of police officers up to the regional average, granted raises to all police officers and police dispatchers.  Those who had less than five years of tenure received proportionately greater raises when compared to their former pay than those with more seniority.  Although some officers over the age of 40 had less than five years of service, most of the older officers had more.

				Petitioners are a group of older officers who filed suit under the ADEA claiming both that the City deliberately discriminated against them because of their age (the disparate-treatment claim) and that they were adversely affected by the plan because of their age (the disparate-impact claim).  The District Court granted summary judgment to the City on both claims.  The Court of Appeals held that the ruling on the former claim was premature because petitioners were entitled to further discovery on the issue of intent, but it affirmed the dismissal of the disparate-impact claim.  351 F. 3d 183 (CA5 2003). Over one judges dissent, the majority concluded that disparate-impact claims are categorically unavailable under the ADEA.  Both the majority and the dissent assumed that the facts alleged by petitioners would entitle them to relief under the reasoning of Griggs.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In 
				<em>
					Griggs
				</em>
				, a case decided four years after the enactment of the ADEA, we considered whether §703 of Title VII prohibited an employer from requiring a high school education or passing of a standardized general intelligence test as a condition of employment in or transfer to jobs when (a) neither standard is shown to be significantly related to successful job performance, (b) both requirements operate to disqualify Negroes at a substantially higher rate than white applicants, and (c) the jobs in question formerly had been filled only by white employees as part of a longstanding practice of giving preference to whites.  401 U. S., at 425426.  Accepting the Court of Appeals conclusion that the employer had adopted the diploma and test requirements without any intent to discriminate, we held that good faith does not redeem employment procedures or testing mechanisms that operate as built-in headwinds for minority groups and are unrelated to measuring job capability.

				We explained that Congress had directed the thrust of the Act to the 
				<em>
					consequences
				</em>
				 of employment practices, not simply the motivation.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  We relied on the fact that history is filled with examples of men and women who rendered highly effective performance without the conventional badges of accomplishment in terms of certificates, diplomas, or degrees.  Diplomas and tests are useful servants, but Congress has mandated the commonsense proposition that they are not to become masters of reality.

				While our opinion in 
				<em>
					Griggs
				</em>
				 relied primarily on the purposes of the Act, buttressed by the fact that the EEOC had endorsed the same view, we have subsequently noted that our holding represented the better reading of the statutory text as well.  See

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">991</a> (1988)
.  Neither §703(a)(2) nor the comparable language in the ADEA simply prohibits actions that limit, segregate, or classify persons; rather the language prohibits such actions that deprive any individual of employment opportunities or 
				<em>
					otherwise adversely affect

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				The Court of Appeals categorical rejection of disparate-impact liability, like Justice OConnor
				s, rested primarily on the RFOA provision and the majoritys analysis of legislative history.  As we have already explained, we think the history of the enactment of the ADEA, with particular reference to the Wirtz Report, supports the pre-
				<em>
					Hazen Paper

				 consensus concerning disparate-impact liability.  And 
				<em>
					Hazen Paper
				</em>
				 itself contains the response to the concern over the RFOA provision.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The RFOA provision provides that it shall not be unlawful for an employer to take any action otherwise prohibited under subsectio[n] (a) … where the differentiation is based on reasonable factors other than age discrimination … .  
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">81</a>Stat.
603.  In most disparate-treatment cases, if an employer in fact acted on a factor other than age, the action would not be prohibited under subsection (a) in the first place.  See 
				<em>
					Hazen Paper
				</em>
				, 507 U. S., at 609 ([T]here is no disparate treatment under the ADEA when the factor motivating the employer is some feature other than the employees age.).  In those disparate-treatment cases, such as in 
				<em>
					Hazen Paper
				</em>
				 itself, the RFOA provision is simply unnecessary to avoid liability under the ADEA, since there was no prohibited action in the first place.  The RFOA provision is not, as 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice OConnor
				</span>
				 suggests, a safe harbor from liability,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">254</a> (1981)
 (noting, in a Title VII case, that an employer can defeat liability by showing that the employee was rejected for a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason without reference to an RFOA provision).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In disparate-impact cases, however, the allegedly otherwise prohibited activity is not based on age.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				. ( [C]laims that stress disparate impact [by contrast] involve employment practices that are facially neutral in their treatment of different groups but that in fact fall more harshly on one group than another …  (quoting

)).  It is, accordingly, in cases involving disparate-impact claims that the RFOA provision plays its principal role by precluding liability if the adverse impact was attributable to a nonage factor that was reasonable.  Rather than support an argument that disparate impact is unavailable under the ADEA, the RFOA provision actually supports the contrary conclusion.

				Finally, we note that both the Department of Labor, which initially drafted the legislation, and the EEOC, which is the agency charged by Congress with responsibility for implementing the statute, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/29/628.html" class="subref" title="subref">29 U. S. C. §628</a>, have consistently interpreted the ADEA to authorize relief on a disparate-impact theory.  The initial regulations, while not

        <p class="bodytext">
				mentioning disparate impact by name, nevertheless permitted such claims if the employer relied on a factor that was not related to age.

See also §1625.7 (2004) (setting forth the standards for a disparate-impact claim).

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The text of the statute, as interpreted in 
				<em>

				Two textual differences between the ADEA and Title VII make it clear that even though both statutes authorize recovery on a disparate-impact theory, the scope of disparate-impact liability under ADEA is narrower than under Title VII.  The first is the RFOA provision, which we have already identified.  The second is the amendment to Title VII contained in the Civil Rights Act of 1991, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">105</a>Stat.
1071.  One of the purposes of that amendment was to modify the Courts holding in

, a case in which we narrowly construed the employers exposure to liability on a disparate-impact theory.  See Civil Rights Act of 1991, §2, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">105</a>Stat.
1071.  While the relevant 1991 amendments expanded the coverage of Title VII, they did not amend the ADEA or speak to the subject of age discrimination.  Hence, 
				<em>

				s
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				pre-1991 interpretation of Title VIIs identical language remains applicable to the ADEA.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Congress decision to limit the coverage of the ADEA by including the RFOA provision is consistent with the fact that age, unlike race or other classifications protected by Title VII, not uncommonly has relevance to an individuals capacity to engage in certain types of employment.  To be sure, Congress recognized that this is not always the case, and that society may perceive those differences to be larger or more consequential than they are in fact.  However, as Secretary Wirtz noted in his report, certain circumstances … unquestionably affect older workers more strongly, as a group, than they do younger workers.  Wirtz Report 28.  Thus, it is not surprising that certain employment criteria that are routinely used may be reasonable despite their adverse impact on older workers as a group.  Moreover, intentional discrimination on the basis of age has not occurred at the same levels as discrimination against those protected by Title VII.  While the ADEA reflects Congress intent to give older workers employment opportunities whenever possible, the RFOA provision reflects this historical difference.

				Turning to the case before us, we initially note that petitioners have done little more than point out that the pay plan at issue is relatively less generous to older workers than to younger workers.  They have not identified any specific test, requirement, or practice within the pay plan that has an adverse impact on older workers.  As we held in 
				<em>
					Wards Cove
				</em>
				, it is not enough to simply allege that there is a disparate impact on workers, or point to a generalized policy that leads to such an impact.  Rather, the employee is  responsible for isolating and identifying the 
				<em>
					specific
				</em>
				 employment practices that are allegedly responsible for any observed statistical disparities.   490 U. S., at 656 (emphasis added) (quoting 
				<em>
					Watson, 
				</em>
				487 U. S., at 994).  Petitioners have failed to do so.  Their failure to identify the specific practice being challenged is the sort of omission that could result in employers being potentially liable for the myriad of innocent causes that may lead to statistical imbalances … .   490 U. S., at 657.  In this case not only did petitioners thus err by failing to identify the relevant practice, but it is also clear from the record that the Citys plan was based on reasonable factors other than age.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The plan divided each of five basic positionspolice officer, master police officer, police sergeant, police lieutenant, and deputy police chiefinto a series of steps and half-steps.  The wage for each range was based on a survey of comparable communities in the Southeast.  Employees were then assigned a step (or half-step) within their position that corresponded to the lowest step that would still give the individual a 2% raise.  Most of the officers were in the three lowest ranks; in each of those ranks there were officers under age 40 and officers over 40.  In none did their age affect their compensation.  The few officers in the two highest ranks are all over 40.  Their raises, though higher in dollar amount than the raises given to junior officers, represented a smaller percentage of their salaries, which of course are higher than the salaries paid to their juniors.  They are members of the class complaining of the disparate impact of the award.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Petitioners evidence established two principal facts: First, almost two-thirds (66.2%) of the officers under 40 received raises of more than 10% while less than half (45.3%) of those over 40 did.
				<a name="ZO-12ref" href="#ZO-12" class="">
                <sup>

					12
				</b>
                </sup>
            </a>
				  Second, the average percentage increase for the entire class of officers with less than five years of tenure was somewhat higher than the percentage for those with more seniority.
				<a name="ZO-13ref" href="#ZO-13" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>
					13
				</b>
                </sup>
            </a>
				  Because older officers tended to occupy more senior positions, on average they received smaller increases when measured as a percentage of their salary.  The basic explanation for the differential was the Citys perceived need to raise the salaries of junior officers to make them competitive with comparable positions in the market.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Thus, the disparate impact is attributable to the Citys decision to give raises based on seniority and position.  Reliance on seniority and rank is unquestionably reasonable given the Citys goal of raising employees salaries to match those in surrounding communities.  In sum, we hold that the Citys decision to grant a larger raise to lower echelon employees for the purpose of bringing salaries in line with that of surrounding police forces was a decision based on a reasonable factor other than age that responded to the Citys legitimate goal of retaining police officers.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				While there may have been other reasonable ways for the City to achieve its goals, the one selected was not unreasonable.  Unlike the business necessity test, which asks whether there are other ways for the employer to achieve its goals that do not result in a disparate impact on a protected class, the reasonableness inquiry includes no such requirement.

						 The congressional purposes on which we relied in Griggs have a striking parallel to two important points made in the Wirtz Report.  Just as the Griggs opinion ruled out discrimination based on racial animus as a problem in that case, the Wirtz Report concluded that there was no significant discrimination of that kind so far as older workers are concerned.  Wirtz Report 23.  And just as Griggs recognized that the high school diploma requirement, which was unrelated to job performance, had an unfair impact on African-Americans who had received inferior educational opportunities in segregated schools, 401 U. S., at 430, the Wirtz Report identified the identical obstacle to the employment of older workers.  Any formal employment standard which requires, for example, a high school diploma will obviously work against the employment of many older workersunfairly if, despite his limited schooling, an older workers years of experience have given him the relevant equivalent of a high school education.  Wirtz Report 21.  Thus, just as the statutory text is identical, there is a remarkable similarity between the congressional goals we cited in Griggs and those present in the Wirtz Report.

						 In reaching a contrary conclusion, Justice OConnor ignores key textual differences between §4(a)(1), which does not encompass-disparate-impact liability, and §4(a)(2).  Section (a)(1) makes it unlawful for an employer to fail or refuse to hire … any individual … because of such individuals age.  (Emphasis added.)  The focus of the section is on the employers actions with respect to the targeted individual.  Paragraph (a)(2), however, makes it unlawful for an employer to limit … his employees in any way that would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because of such individuals age.  (Emphasis added.)  Unlike in paragraph (a)(2), there is thus an incongruity between the employers actionswhich are focused on his employees generallyand the individual employee who adversely suffers because of those actions.  Thus, an employer who classifies his employees without respect to age may still be liable under the terms of this paragraph if such classification adversely affects the employee because of that employees agethe very definition of disparate impact.  Justice OConnor is therefore quite wrong to suggest that the textual differences between the two paragraphs are unimportant.

						 Justice OConnor reaches a contrary conclusion based on the text of the statute, the legislative history, and the structure of the statute.  As we explain above, n. 6, supra, her textual reasoning is not persuasive.  Further, while Congress may have intended to remedy disparate-impact type situations through noncoercive measures in part, there is nothing to suggest that it intended such measures to be the sole method of achieving the desired result of remedying practices that had an adverse effect on older workers.  Finally, we agree that the differences between age and the classes protected in Title VII are relevant, and that Congress might well have intended to treat the two differently.  See infra, at 7 (OConnor, J., concurring in judgment).   However, Congress obviously considered those classes of individuals to be sufficiently similar to warrant enacting identical legislation, at least with respect to employment practices it sought to prohibit.  While those differences, coupled with a difference in the text of the statue such as the RFOA provision, may warrant addressing disparate-impact claims in the two statutes differently, see infra, at 1112, it does not justify departing from the plain text and our settled interpretation of that text.

				On October 1, 1998, the City adopted a pay plan granting raises to all City employees.  The stated purpose of the plan was to attract and retain qualified people, provide incentive for performance, maintain competitiveness with other public sector agencies and ensure equitable compensation to all employees regardless of age, sex, race and/or disability.

				  On May 1, 1999, a revision of the plan, which was motivated, at least in part, by the Citys desire to bring the starting salaries of police officers up to the regional average, granted raises to all police officers and police dispatchers.  Those who had less than five years of tenure received proportionately greater raises when compared to their former pay than those with more seniority.  Although some officers over the age of 40 had less than five years of service, most of the older officers had more.

				Petitioners are a group of older officers who filed suit under the ADEA claiming both that the City deliberately discriminated against them because of their age (the disparate-treatment claim) and that they were adversely affected by the plan because of their age (the disparate-impact claim).  The District Court granted summary judgment to the City on both claims.  The Court of Appeals held that the ruling on the former claim was premature because petitioners were entitled to further discovery on the issue of intent, but it affirmed the dismissal of the disparate-impact claim.  351 F. 3d 183 (CA5 2003). Over one judges dissent, the majority concluded that disparate-impact claims are categorically unavailable under the ADEA.  Both the majority and the dissent assumed that the facts alleged by petitioners would entitle them to relief under the reasoning of Griggs.

				In

				, a case decided four years after the enactment of the ADEA, we considered whether §703 of Title VII prohibited an employer from requiring a high school education or passing of a standardized general intelligence test as a condition of employment in or transfer to jobs when (a) neither standard is shown to be significantly related to successful job performance, (b) both requirements operate to disqualify Negroes at a substantially higher rate than white applicants, and (c) the jobs in question formerly had been filled only by white employees as part of a longstanding practice of giving preference to whites.  401 U. S., at 425426.  Accepting the Court of Appeals conclusion that the employer had adopted the diploma and test requirements without any intent to discriminate, we held that good faith does not redeem employment procedures or testing mechanisms that operate as built-in headwinds for minority groups and are unrelated to measuring job capability.

				We explained that Congress had directed the thrust of the Act to the 
				<em>
					consequences
				</em>
				 of employment practices, not simply the motivation.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  We relied on the fact that history is filled with examples of men and women who rendered highly effective performance without the conventional badges of accomplishment in terms of certificates, diplomas, or degrees.  Diplomas and tests are useful servants, but Congress has mandated the commonsense proposition that they are not to become masters of reality.

				The Court of Appeals categorical rejection of disparate-impact liability, like Justice OConnor
				s, rested primarily on the RFOA provision and the majoritys analysis of legislative history.  As we have already explained, we think the history of the enactment of the ADEA, with particular reference to the Wirtz Report, supports the pre-
				<em>

				 consensus concerning disparate-impact liability.  And 
				<em>
					Hazen Paper
				</em>
				 itself contains the response to the concern over the RFOA provision.

				The RFOA provision provides that it shall not be unlawful for an employer to take any action otherwise prohibited under subsectio[n] (a) … where the differentiation is based on reasonable factors other than age discrimination … .  
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">81</a>Stat.
603.  In most disparate-treatment cases, if an employer in fact acted on a factor other than age, the action would not be prohibited under subsection (a) in the first place.  See 
				<em>
					Hazen Paper
				</em>
				, 507 U. S., at 609 ([T]here is no disparate treatment under the ADEA when the factor motivating the employer is some feature other than the employees age.).  In those disparate-treatment cases, such as in 
				<em>
					Hazen Paper

				 itself, the RFOA provision is simply unnecessary to avoid liability under the ADEA, since there was no prohibited action in the first place.  The RFOA provision is not, as

				In disparate-impact cases, however, the allegedly otherwise prohibited activity is not based on age.  
				<em>

It is, accordingly, in cases involving disparate-impact claims that the RFOA provision plays its principal role by precluding liability if the adverse impact was attributable to a nonage factor that was reasonable.  Rather than support an argument that disparate impact is unavailable under the ADEA, the RFOA provision actually supports the contrary conclusion.

				Finally, we note that both the Department of Labor, which initially drafted the legislation, and the EEOC, which is the agency charged by Congress with responsibility for implementing the statute, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/29/628.html" class="subref" title="subref">29 U. S. C. §628</a>, have consistently interpreted the ADEA to authorize relief on a disparate-impact theory.  The initial regulations, while not

        <p class="bodytext">
				mentioning disparate impact by name, nevertheless permitted such claims if the employer relied on a factor that was not related to age.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/29/860" class="subref" title="subref">29 CFR §860.103</a>(f)(1)(i) (1970) (barring physical fitness requirements that were not reasonably necessary for the specific work to be performed).

				The text of the statute, as interpreted in

        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				Two textual differences between the ADEA and Title VII make it clear that even though both statutes authorize recovery on a disparate-impact theory, the scope of disparate-impact liability under ADEA is narrower than under Title VII.  The first is the RFOA provision, which we have already identified.  The second is the amendment to Title VII contained in the Civil Rights Act of 1991, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">105</a>Stat.
1071.  One of the purposes of that amendment was to modify the Courts holding in 
				<em>
					Wards Cove Packing Co.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Atonio,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/490/642" class="subref" title="subref">490 U. S. 642</a> (1989)
, a case in which we narrowly construed the employers exposure to liability on a disparate-impact theory.  See Civil Rights Act of 1991, §2, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">105</a>Stat.
1071.  While the relevant 1991 amendments expanded the coverage of Title VII, they did not amend the ADEA or speak to the subject of age discrimination.  Hence, 
				<em>
					Wards Cove
				</em>
				s
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				pre-1991 interpretation of Title VIIs identical language remains applicable to the ADEA.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Congress decision to limit the coverage of the ADEA by including the RFOA provision is consistent with the fact that age, unlike race or other classifications protected by Title VII, not uncommonly has relevance to an individuals capacity to engage in certain types of employment.  To be sure, Congress recognized that this is not always the case, and that society may perceive those differences to be larger or more consequential than they are in fact.  However, as Secretary Wirtz noted in his report, certain circumstances … unquestionably affect older workers more strongly, as a group, than they do younger workers.  Wirtz Report 28.  Thus, it is not surprising that certain employment criteria that are routinely used may be reasonable despite their adverse impact on older workers as a group.  Moreover, intentional discrimination on the basis of age has not occurred at the same levels as discrimination against those protected by Title VII.  While the ADEA reflects Congress intent to give older workers employment opportunities whenever possible, the RFOA provision reflects this historical difference.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Turning to the case before us, we initially note that petitioners have done little more than point out that the pay plan at issue is relatively less generous to older workers than to younger workers.  They have not identified any specific test, requirement, or practice within the pay plan that has an adverse impact on older workers.  As we held in 
				<em>
					Wards Cove
				</em>
				, it is not enough to simply allege that there is a disparate impact on workers, or point to a generalized policy that leads to such an impact.  Rather, the employee is  responsible for isolating and identifying the 
				<em>
					specific
				</em>
				 employment practices that are allegedly responsible for any observed statistical disparities.   490 U. S., at 656 (emphasis added) (quoting 
				<em>
					Watson, 
				</em>
				487 U. S., at 994).  Petitioners have failed to do so.  Their failure to identify the specific practice being challenged is the sort of omission that could result in employers being potentially liable for the myriad of innocent causes that may lead to statistical imbalances … .   490 U. S., at 657.  In this case not only did petitioners thus err by failing to identify the relevant practice, but it is also clear from the record that the Citys plan was based on reasonable factors other than age.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The plan divided each of five basic positionspolice officer, master police officer, police sergeant, police lieutenant, and deputy police chiefinto a series of steps and half-steps.  The wage for each range was based on a survey of comparable communities in the Southeast.  Employees were then assigned a step (or half-step) within their position that corresponded to the lowest step that would still give the individual a 2% raise.  Most of the officers were in the three lowest ranks; in each of those ranks there were officers under age 40 and officers over 40.  In none did their age affect their compensation.  The few officers in the two highest ranks are all over 40.  Their raises, though higher in dollar amount than the raises given to junior officers, represented a smaller percentage of their salaries, which of course are higher than the salaries paid to their juniors.  They are members of the class complaining of the disparate impact of the award.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Petitioners evidence established two principal facts: First, almost two-thirds (66.2%) of the officers under 40 received raises of more than 10% while less than half (45.3%) of those over 40 did.
				<a name="ZO-12ref" href="#ZO-12" class="">
                <sup>

					12
				</b>
                </sup>
            </a>
				  Second, the average percentage increase for the entire class of officers with less than five years of tenure was somewhat higher than the percentage for those with more seniority.
				<a name="ZO-13ref" href="#ZO-13" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>
					13
				</b>
                </sup>
            </a>
				  Because older officers tended to occupy more senior positions, on average they received smaller increases when measured as a percentage of their salary.  The basic explanation for the differential was the Citys perceived need to raise the salaries of junior officers to make them competitive with comparable positions in the market.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Thus, the disparate impact is attributable to the Citys decision to give raises based on seniority and position.  Reliance on seniority and rank is unquestionably reasonable given the Citys goal of raising employees salaries to match those in surrounding communities.  In sum, we hold that the Citys decision to grant a larger raise to lower echelon employees for the purpose of bringing salaries in line with that of surrounding police forces was a decision based on a reasonable factor other than age that responded to the Citys legitimate goal of retaining police officers.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				While there may have been other reasonable ways for the City to achieve its goals, the one selected was not unreasonable.  Unlike the business necessity test, which asks whether there are other ways for the employer to achieve its goals that do not result in a disparate impact on a protected class, the reasonableness inquiry includes no such requirement.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">

						 The congressional purposes on which we relied in Griggs have a striking parallel to two important points made in the Wirtz Report.  Just as the Griggs opinion ruled out discrimination based on racial animus as a problem in that case, the Wirtz Report concluded that there was no significant discrimination of that kind so far as older workers are concerned.  Wirtz Report 23.  And just as Griggs recognized that the high school diploma requirement, which was unrelated to job performance, had an unfair impact on African-Americans who had received inferior educational opportunities in segregated schools, 401 U. S., at 430, the Wirtz Report identified the identical obstacle to the employment of older workers.  Any formal employment standard which requires, for example, a high school diploma will obviously work against the employment of many older workersunfairly if, despite his limited schooling, an older workers years of experience have given him the relevant equivalent of a high school education.  Wirtz Report 21.  Thus, just as the statutory text is identical, there is a remarkable similarity between the congressional goals we cited in Griggs and those present in the Wirtz Report.

						 In reaching a contrary conclusion, Justice OConnor ignores key textual differences between §4(a)(1), which does not encompass-disparate-impact liability, and §4(a)(2).  Section (a)(1) makes it unlawful for an employer to fail or refuse to hire … any individual … because of such individuals age.  (Emphasis added.)  The focus of the section is on the employers actions with respect to the targeted individual.  Paragraph (a)(2), however, makes it unlawful for an employer to limit … his employees in any way that would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because of such individuals age.  (Emphasis added.)  Unlike in paragraph (a)(2), there is thus an incongruity between the employers actionswhich are focused on his employees generallyand the individual employee who adversely suffers because of those actions.  Thus, an employer who classifies his employees without respect to age may still be liable under the terms of this paragraph if such classification adversely affects the employee because of that employees agethe very definition of disparate impact.  Justice OConnor is therefore quite wrong to suggest that the textual differences between the two paragraphs are unimportant.

						 Justice OConnor reaches a contrary conclusion based on the text of the statute, the legislative history, and the structure of the statute.  As we explain above, n. 6, supra, her textual reasoning is not persuasive.  Further, while Congress may have intended to remedy disparate-impact type situations through noncoercive measures in part, there is nothing to suggest that it intended such measures to be the sole method of achieving the desired result of remedying practices that had an adverse effect on older workers.  Finally, we agree that the differences between age and the classes protected in Title VII are relevant, and that Congress might well have intended to treat the two differently.  See infra, at 7 (OConnor, J., concurring in judgment).   However, Congress obviously considered those classes of individuals to be sufficiently similar to warrant enacting identical legislation, at least with respect to employment practices it sought to prohibit.  While those differences, coupled with a difference in the text of the statue such as the RFOA provision, may warrant addressing disparate-impact claims in the two statutes differently, see infra, at 1112, it does not justify departing from the plain text and our settled interpretation of that text.

				Petitioners, police and public safety officers employed by the city of Jackson, Mississippi (hereinafter City), contend that salary increases received in 1999 violated the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) because they were less generous to officers over the age of 40 than to younger officers.

				On October 1, 1998, the City adopted a pay plan granting raises to all City employees.  The stated purpose of the plan was to attract and retain qualified people, provide incentive for performance, maintain competitiveness with other public sector agencies and ensure equitable compensation to all employees regardless of age, sex, race and/or disability.

				  On May 1, 1999, a revision of the plan, which was motivated, at least in part, by the Citys desire to bring the starting salaries of police officers up to the regional average, granted raises to all police officers and police dispatchers.  Those who had less than five years of tenure received proportionately greater raises when compared to their former pay than those with more seniority.  Although some officers over the age of 40 had less than five years of service, most of the older officers had more.

				Petitioners are a group of older officers who filed suit under the ADEA claiming both that the City deliberately discriminated against them because of their age (the disparate-treatment claim) and that they were adversely affected by the plan because of their age (the disparate-impact claim).  The District Court granted summary judgment to the City on both claims.  The Court of Appeals held that the ruling on the former claim was premature because petitioners were entitled to further discovery on the issue of intent, but it affirmed the dismissal of the disparate-impact claim.  351 F. 3d 183 (CA5 2003). Over one judges dissent, the majority concluded that disparate-impact claims are categorically unavailable under the ADEA.  Both the majority and the dissent assumed that the facts alleged by petitioners would entitle them to relief under the reasoning of Griggs.

				In determining whether the ADEA authorizes disparate-impact claims, we begin with the premise that when Congress uses the same language in two statutes having similar purposes, particularly when one is enacted shortly after the other, it is appropriate to presume that Congress intended that text to have the same meaning in both statutes.

				  Our unanimous interpretation of §703(a)(2) of the Title VII in 
				<em>

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In 
				<em>
					Griggs
				</em>
				, a case decided four years after the enactment of the ADEA, we considered whether §703 of Title VII prohibited an employer from requiring a high school education or passing of a standardized general intelligence test as a condition of employment in or transfer to jobs when (a) neither standard is shown to be significantly related to successful job performance, (b) both requirements operate to disqualify Negroes at a substantially higher rate than white applicants, and (c) the jobs in question formerly had been filled only by white employees as part of a longstanding practice of giving preference to whites.  401 U. S., at 425426.  Accepting the Court of Appeals conclusion that the employer had adopted the diploma and test requirements without any intent to discriminate, we held that good faith does not redeem employment procedures or testing mechanisms that operate as built-in headwinds for minority groups and are unrelated to measuring job capability.  
				<em>

				We explained that Congress had directed the thrust of the Act to the 
				<em>
					consequences
				</em>
				 of employment practices, not simply the motivation.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  We relied on the fact that history is filled with examples of men and women who rendered highly effective performance without the conventional badges of accomplishment in terms of certificates, diplomas, or degrees.  Diplomas and tests are useful servants, but Congress has mandated the commonsense proposition that they are not to become masters of reality.

				While our opinion in 
				<em>
					Griggs
				</em>
				 relied primarily on the purposes of the Act, buttressed by the fact that the EEOC had endorsed the same view, we have subsequently noted that our holding represented the better reading of the statutory text as well.  See

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">991</a> (1988)
.  Neither §703(a)(2) nor the comparable language in the ADEA simply prohibits actions that limit, segregate, or classify persons; rather the language prohibits such actions that deprive any individual of employment opportunities or 
				<em>
					otherwise adversely affect

				The Court of Appeals categorical rejection of disparate-impact liability, like Justice OConnor

603.  In most disparate-treatment cases, if an employer in fact acted on a factor other than age, the action would not be prohibited under subsection (a) in the first place.  See 
				<em>
					Hazen Paper

				, 507 U. S., at 609 ([T]here is no disparate treatment under the ADEA when the factor motivating the employer is some feature other than the employees age.).  In those disparate-treatment cases, such as in 
				<em>

				 itself, the RFOA provision is simply unnecessary to avoid liability under the ADEA, since there was no prohibited action in the first place.  The RFOA provision is not, as

)).  It is, accordingly, in cases involving disparate-impact claims that the RFOA provision plays its principal role by precluding liability if the adverse impact was attributable to a nonage factor that was reasonable.  Rather than support an argument that disparate impact is unavailable under the ADEA, the RFOA provision actually supports the contrary conclusion.

				Finally, we note that both the Department of Labor, which initially drafted the legislation, and the EEOC, which is the agency charged by Congress with responsibility for implementing the statute, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/29/628.html" class="subref" title="subref">29 U. S. C. §628</a>, have consistently interpreted the ADEA to authorize relief on a disparate-impact theory.  The initial regulations, while not

				Two textual differences between the ADEA and Title VII make it clear that even though both statutes authorize recovery on a disparate-impact theory, the scope of disparate-impact liability under ADEA is narrower than under Title VII.  The first is the RFOA provision, which we have already identified.  The second is the amendment to Title VII contained in the Civil Rights Act of 1991, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">105</a>Stat.
1071.  One of the purposes of that amendment was to modify the Courts holding in

, a case in which we narrowly construed the employers exposure to liability on a disparate-impact theory.  See Civil Rights Act of 1991, §2, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">105</a>Stat.
1071.  While the relevant 1991 amendments expanded the coverage of Title VII, they did not amend the ADEA or speak to the subject of age discrimination.  Hence, 
				<em>

				s
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				pre-1991 interpretation of Title VIIs identical language remains applicable to the ADEA.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Congress decision to limit the coverage of the ADEA by including the RFOA provision is consistent with the fact that age, unlike race or other classifications protected by Title VII, not uncommonly has relevance to an individuals capacity to engage in certain types of employment.  To be sure, Congress recognized that this is not always the case, and that society may perceive those differences to be larger or more consequential than they are in fact.  However, as Secretary Wirtz noted in his report, certain circumstances … unquestionably affect older workers more strongly, as a group, than they do younger workers.  Wirtz Report 28.  Thus, it is not surprising that certain employment criteria that are routinely used may be reasonable despite their adverse impact on older workers as a group.  Moreover, intentional discrimination on the basis of age has not occurred at the same levels as discrimination against those protected by Title VII.  While the ADEA reflects Congress intent to give older workers employment opportunities whenever possible, the RFOA provision reflects this historical difference.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Turning to the case before us, we initially note that petitioners have done little more than point out that the pay plan at issue is relatively less generous to older workers than to younger workers.  They have not identified any specific test, requirement, or practice within the pay plan that has an adverse impact on older workers.  As we held in 
				<em>
					Wards Cove
				</em>
				, it is not enough to simply allege that there is a disparate impact on workers, or point to a generalized policy that leads to such an impact.  Rather, the employee is  responsible for isolating and identifying the 
				<em>
					specific
				</em>
				 employment practices that are allegedly responsible for any observed statistical disparities.   490 U. S., at 656 (emphasis added) (quoting 
				<em>
					Watson, 
				</em>
				487 U. S., at 994).  Petitioners have failed to do so.  Their failure to identify the specific practice being challenged is the sort of omission that could result in employers being potentially liable for the myriad of innocent causes that may lead to statistical imbalances … .   490 U. S., at 657.  In this case not only did petitioners thus err by failing to identify the relevant practice, but it is also clear from the record that the Citys plan was based on reasonable factors other than age.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The plan divided each of five basic positionspolice officer, master police officer, police sergeant, police lieutenant, and deputy police chiefinto a series of steps and half-steps.  The wage for each range was based on a survey of comparable communities in the Southeast.  Employees were then assigned a step (or half-step) within their position that corresponded to the lowest step that would still give the individual a 2% raise.  Most of the officers were in the three lowest ranks; in each of those ranks there were officers under age 40 and officers over 40.  In none did their age affect their compensation.  The few officers in the two highest ranks are all over 40.  Their raises, though higher in dollar amount than the raises given to junior officers, represented a smaller percentage of their salaries, which of course are higher than the salaries paid to their juniors.  They are members of the class complaining of the disparate impact of the award.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Petitioners evidence established two principal facts: First, almost two-thirds (66.2%) of the officers under 40 received raises of more than 10% while less than half (45.3%) of those over 40 did.
				<a name="ZO-12ref" href="#ZO-12" class="">

					12
				</b>
                </sup>
            </a>
				  Second, the average percentage increase for the entire class of officers with less than five years of tenure was somewhat higher than the percentage for those with more seniority.
				<a name="ZO-13ref" href="#ZO-13" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>
					13
				</b>
                </sup>
            </a>
				  Because older officers tended to occupy more senior positions, on average they received smaller increases when measured as a percentage of their salary.  The basic explanation for the differential was the Citys perceived need to raise the salaries of junior officers to make them competitive with comparable positions in the market.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Thus, the disparate impact is attributable to the Citys decision to give raises based on seniority and position.  Reliance on seniority and rank is unquestionably reasonable given the Citys goal of raising employees salaries to match those in surrounding communities.  In sum, we hold that the Citys decision to grant a larger raise to lower echelon employees for the purpose of bringing salaries in line with that of surrounding police forces was a decision based on a reasonable factor other than age that responded to the Citys legitimate goal of retaining police officers.

				, 922 F. 2d 766, 772 (CA11 1991).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				While there may have been other reasonable ways for the City to achieve its goals, the one selected was not unreasonable.  Unlike the business necessity test, which asks whether there are other ways for the employer to achieve its goals that do not result in a disparate impact on a protected class, the reasonableness inquiry includes no such requirement.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Accordingly, while we do not agree with the Court of Appeals holding that that the disparate-impact theory of recovery is never available under the ADEA, we affirm its judgment.

						 The congressional purposes on which we relied in Griggs have a striking parallel to two important points made in the Wirtz Report.  Just as the Griggs opinion ruled out discrimination based on racial animus as a problem in that case, the Wirtz Report concluded that there was no significant discrimination of that kind so far as older workers are concerned.  Wirtz Report 23.  And just as Griggs recognized that the high school diploma requirement, which was unrelated to job performance, had an unfair impact on African-Americans who had received inferior educational opportunities in segregated schools, 401 U. S., at 430, the Wirtz Report identified the identical obstacle to the employment of older workers.  Any formal employment standard which requires, for example, a high school diploma will obviously work against the employment of many older workersunfairly if, despite his limited schooling, an older workers years of experience have given him the relevant equivalent of a high school education.  Wirtz Report 21.  Thus, just as the statutory text is identical, there is a remarkable similarity between the congressional goals we cited in Griggs and those present in the Wirtz Report.

						 In reaching a contrary conclusion, Justice OConnor ignores key textual differences between §4(a)(1), which does not encompass-disparate-impact liability, and §4(a)(2).  Section (a)(1) makes it unlawful for an employer to fail or refuse to hire … any individual … because of such individuals age.  (Emphasis added.)  The focus of the section is on the employers actions with respect to the targeted individual.  Paragraph (a)(2), however, makes it unlawful for an employer to limit … his employees in any way that would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because of such individuals age.  (Emphasis added.)  Unlike in paragraph (a)(2), there is thus an incongruity between the employers actionswhich are focused on his employees generallyand the individual employee who adversely suffers because of those actions.  Thus, an employer who classifies his employees without respect to age may still be liable under the terms of this paragraph if such classification adversely affects the employee because of that employees agethe very definition of disparate impact.  Justice OConnor is therefore quite wrong to suggest that the textual differences between the two paragraphs are unimportant.

						 Justice OConnor reaches a contrary conclusion based on the text of the statute, the legislative history, and the structure of the statute.  As we explain above, n. 6, supra, her textual reasoning is not persuasive.  Further, while Congress may have intended to remedy disparate-impact type situations through noncoercive measures in part, there is nothing to suggest that it intended such measures to be the sole method of achieving the desired result of remedying practices that had an adverse effect on older workers.  Finally, we agree that the differences between age and the classes protected in Title VII are relevant, and that Congress might well have intended to treat the two differently.  See infra, at 7 (OConnor, J., concurring in judgment).   However, Congress obviously considered those classes of individuals to be sufficiently similar to warrant enacting identical legislation, at least with respect to employment practices it sought to prohibit.  While those differences, coupled with a difference in the text of the statue such as the RFOA provision, may warrant addressing disparate-impact claims in the two statutes differently, see infra, at 1112, it does not justify departing from the plain text and our settled interpretation of that text.

				On October 1, 1998, the City adopted a pay plan granting raises to all City employees.  The stated purpose of the plan was to attract and retain qualified people, provide incentive for performance, maintain competitiveness with other public sector agencies and ensure equitable compensation to all employees regardless of age, sex, race and/or disability.

				  On May 1, 1999, a revision of the plan, which was motivated, at least in part, by the Citys desire to bring the starting salaries of police officers up to the regional average, granted raises to all police officers and police dispatchers.  Those who had less than five years of tenure received proportionately greater raises when compared to their former pay than those with more seniority.  Although some officers over the age of 40 had less than five years of service, most of the older officers had more.

				Petitioners are a group of older officers who filed suit under the ADEA claiming both that the City deliberately discriminated against them because of their age (the disparate-treatment claim) and that they were adversely affected by the plan because of their age (the disparate-impact claim).  The District Court granted summary judgment to the City on both claims.  The Court of Appeals held that the ruling on the former claim was premature because petitioners were entitled to further discovery on the issue of intent, but it affirmed the dismissal of the disparate-impact claim.  351 F. 3d 183 (CA5 2003). Over one judges dissent, the majority concluded that disparate-impact claims are categorically unavailable under the ADEA.  Both the majority and the dissent assumed that the facts alleged by petitioners would entitle them to relief under the reasoning of Griggs.

				In determining whether the ADEA authorizes disparate-impact claims, we begin with the premise that when Congress uses the same language in two statutes having similar purposes, particularly when one is enacted shortly after the other, it is appropriate to presume that Congress intended that text to have the same meaning in both statutes.

				In 
				<em>
					Griggs
				</em>
				, a case decided four years after the enactment of the ADEA, we considered whether §703 of Title VII prohibited an employer from requiring a high school education or passing of a standardized general intelligence test as a condition of employment in or transfer to jobs when (a) neither standard is shown to be significantly related to successful job performance, (b) both requirements operate to disqualify Negroes at a substantially higher rate than white applicants, and (c) the jobs in question formerly had been filled only by white employees as part of a longstanding practice of giving preference to whites.  401 U. S., at 425426.  Accepting the Court of Appeals conclusion that the employer had adopted the diploma and test requirements without any intent to discriminate, we held that good faith does not redeem employment procedures or testing mechanisms that operate as built-in headwinds for minority groups and are unrelated to measuring job capability.  
				<em>

				We explained that Congress had directed the thrust of the Act to the 
				<em>
					consequences
				</em>
				 of employment practices, not simply the motivation.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  We relied on the fact that history is filled with examples of men and women who rendered highly effective performance without the conventional badges of accomplishment in terms of certificates, diplomas, or degrees.  Diplomas and tests are useful servants, but Congress has mandated the commonsense proposition that they are not to become masters of reality.

				at 433.  And we noted that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which had enforcement responsibility, had issued guidelines that accorded with our view.  
				<em>
					Id.

				While our opinion in

				 relied primarily on the purposes of the Act, buttressed by the fact that the EEOC had endorsed the same view, we have subsequently noted that our holding represented the better reading of the statutory text as well.  See

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">991</a> (1988)
.  Neither §703(a)(2) nor the comparable language in the ADEA simply prohibits actions that limit, segregate, or classify persons; rather the language prohibits such actions that deprive any individual of employment opportunities or

				The Court of Appeals categorical rejection of disparate-impact liability, like Justice OConnor
				s, rested primarily on the RFOA provision and the majoritys analysis of legislative history.  As we have already explained, we think the history of the enactment of the ADEA, with particular reference to the Wirtz Report, supports the pre-
				<em>

				</em>
				 consensus concerning disparate-impact liability.  And 
				<em>
					Hazen Paper
				</em>
				 itself contains the response to the concern over the RFOA provision.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The RFOA provision provides that it shall not be unlawful for an employer to take any action otherwise prohibited under subsectio[n] (a) … where the differentiation is based on reasonable factors other than age discrimination … .  
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">81</a>Stat.
603.  In most disparate-treatment cases, if an employer in fact acted on a factor other than age, the action would not be prohibited under subsection (a) in the first place.  See 
				<em>
					Hazen Paper
				</em>
				, 507 U. S., at 609 ([T]here is no disparate treatment under the ADEA when the factor motivating the employer is some feature other than the employees age.).  In those disparate-treatment cases, such as in 
				<em>
					Hazen Paper
				</em>
				 itself, the RFOA provision is simply unnecessary to avoid liability under the ADEA, since there was no prohibited action in the first place.  The RFOA provision is not, as

				In disparate-impact cases, however, the allegedly otherwise prohibited activity is not based on age.

It is, accordingly, in cases involving disparate-impact claims that the RFOA provision plays its principal role by precluding liability if the adverse impact was attributable to a nonage factor that was reasonable.  Rather than support an argument that disparate impact is unavailable under the ADEA, the RFOA provision actually supports the contrary conclusion.

				Finally, we note that both the Department of Labor, which initially drafted the legislation, and the EEOC, which is the agency charged by Congress with responsibility for implementing the statute, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/29/628.html" class="subref" title="subref">29 U. S. C. §628</a>, have consistently interpreted the ADEA to authorize relief on a disparate-impact theory.  The initial regulations, while not

        <p class="bodytext">
				mentioning disparate impact by name, nevertheless permitted such claims if the employer relied on a factor that was not related to age.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/29/860" class="subref" title="subref">29 CFR §860.103</a>(f)(1)(i) (1970) (barring physical fitness requirements that were not reasonably necessary for the specific work to be performed).  See also §1625.7 (2004) (setting forth the standards for a disparate-impact claim).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The text of the statute, as interpreted in 
				<em>
					Griggs
				</em>
				, the RFOA provision, and the EEOC regulations all support petitioners view.  We therefore conclude that it was error for the Court of Appeals to hold that the disparate-impact theory of liability is categorically unavailable under the ADEA.

        <p class="opcentered">
				IV
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				Two textual differences between the ADEA and Title VII make it clear that even though both statutes authorize recovery on a disparate-impact theory, the scope of disparate-impact liability under ADEA is narrower than under Title VII.  The first is the RFOA provision, which we have already identified.  The second is the amendment to Title VII contained in the Civil Rights Act of 1991, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">105</a>Stat.
1071.  One of the purposes of that amendment was to modify the Courts holding in 
				<em>
					Wards Cove Packing Co.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Atonio,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/490/642" class="subref" title="subref">490 U. S. 642</a> (1989)
, a case in which we narrowly construed the employers exposure to liability on a disparate-impact theory.  See Civil Rights Act of 1991, §2, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">105</a>Stat.
1071.  While the relevant 1991 amendments expanded the coverage of Title VII, they did not amend the ADEA or speak to the subject of age discrimination.  Hence, 
				<em>
					Wards Cove
				</em>
				s
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				pre-1991 interpretation of Title VIIs identical language remains applicable to the ADEA.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Congress decision to limit the coverage of the ADEA by including the RFOA provision is consistent with the fact that age, unlike race or other classifications protected by Title VII, not uncommonly has relevance to an individuals capacity to engage in certain types of employment.  To be sure, Congress recognized that this is not always the case, and that society may perceive those differences to be larger or more consequential than they are in fact.  However, as Secretary Wirtz noted in his report, certain circumstances … unquestionably affect older workers more strongly, as a group, than they do younger workers.  Wirtz Report 28.  Thus, it is not surprising that certain employment criteria that are routinely used may be reasonable despite their adverse impact on older workers as a group.  Moreover, intentional discrimination on the basis of age has not occurred at the same levels as discrimination against those protected by Title VII.  While the ADEA reflects Congress intent to give older workers employment opportunities whenever possible, the RFOA provision reflects this historical difference.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Turning to the case before us, we initially note that petitioners have done little more than point out that the pay plan at issue is relatively less generous to older workers than to younger workers.  They have not identified any specific test, requirement, or practice within the pay plan that has an adverse impact on older workers.  As we held in 
				<em>
					Wards Cove
				</em>
				, it is not enough to simply allege that there is a disparate impact on workers, or point to a generalized policy that leads to such an impact.  Rather, the employee is  responsible for isolating and identifying the 
				<em>
					specific
				</em>
				 employment practices that are allegedly responsible for any observed statistical disparities.   490 U. S., at 656 (emphasis added) (quoting 
				<em>
					Watson, 
				</em>
				487 U. S., at 994).  Petitioners have failed to do so.  Their failure to identify the specific practice being challenged is the sort of omission that could result in employers being potentially liable for the myriad of innocent causes that may lead to statistical imbalances … .   490 U. S., at 657.  In this case not only did petitioners thus err by failing to identify the relevant practice, but it is also clear from the record that the Citys plan was based on reasonable factors other than age.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The plan divided each of five basic positionspolice officer, master police officer, police sergeant, police lieutenant, and deputy police chiefinto a series of steps and half-steps.  The wage for each range was based on a survey of comparable communities in the Southeast.  Employees were then assigned a step (or half-step) within their position that corresponded to the lowest step that would still give the individual a 2% raise.  Most of the officers were in the three lowest ranks; in each of those ranks there were officers under age 40 and officers over 40.  In none did their age affect their compensation.  The few officers in the two highest ranks are all over 40.  Their raises, though higher in dollar amount than the raises given to junior officers, represented a smaller percentage of their salaries, which of course are higher than the salaries paid to their juniors.  They are members of the class complaining of the disparate impact of the award.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Petitioners evidence established two principal facts: First, almost two-thirds (66.2%) of the officers under 40 received raises of more than 10% while less than half (45.3%) of those over 40 did.
				<a name="ZO-12ref" href="#ZO-12" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>
					12
				</b>
                </sup>
            </a>
				  Second, the average percentage increase for the entire class of officers with less than five years of tenure was somewhat higher than the percentage for those with more seniority.
				<a name="ZO-13ref" href="#ZO-13" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>
					13
				</b>
                </sup>
            </a>
				  Because older officers tended to occupy more senior positions, on average they received smaller increases when measured as a percentage of their salary.  The basic explanation for the differential was the Citys perceived need to raise the salaries of junior officers to make them competitive with comparable positions in the market.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Thus, the disparate impact is attributable to the Citys decision to give raises based on seniority and position.  Reliance on seniority and rank is unquestionably reasonable given the Citys goal of raising employees salaries to match those in surrounding communities.  In sum, we hold that the Citys decision to grant a larger raise to lower echelon employees for the purpose of bringing salaries in line with that of surrounding police forces was a decision based on a reasonable factor other than age that responded to the Citys legitimate goal of retaining police officers.  Cf.

				, 922 F. 2d 766, 772 (CA11 1991).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				While there may have been other reasonable ways for the City to achieve its goals, the one selected was not unreasonable.  Unlike the business necessity test, which asks whether there are other ways for the employer to achieve its goals that do not result in a disparate impact on a protected class, the reasonableness inquiry includes no such requirement.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">

						 The congressional purposes on which we relied in Griggs have a striking parallel to two important points made in the Wirtz Report.  Just as the Griggs opinion ruled out discrimination based on racial animus as a problem in that case, the Wirtz Report concluded that there was no significant discrimination of that kind so far as older workers are concerned.  Wirtz Report 23.  And just as Griggs recognized that the high school diploma requirement, which was unrelated to job performance, had an unfair impact on African-Americans who had received inferior educational opportunities in segregated schools, 401 U. S., at 430, the Wirtz Report identified the identical obstacle to the employment of older workers.  Any formal employment standard which requires, for example, a high school diploma will obviously work against the employment of many older workersunfairly if, despite his limited schooling, an older workers years of experience have given him the relevant equivalent of a high school education.  Wirtz Report 21.  Thus, just as the statutory text is identical, there is a remarkable similarity between the congressional goals we cited in Griggs and those present in the Wirtz Report.

						 In reaching a contrary conclusion, Justice OConnor ignores key textual differences between §4(a)(1), which does not encompass-disparate-impact liability, and §4(a)(2).  Section (a)(1) makes it unlawful for an employer to fail or refuse to hire … any individual … because of such individuals age.  (Emphasis added.)  The focus of the section is on the employers actions with respect to the targeted individual.  Paragraph (a)(2), however, makes it unlawful for an employer to limit … his employees in any way that would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because of such individuals age.  (Emphasis added.)  Unlike in paragraph (a)(2), there is thus an incongruity between the employers actionswhich are focused on his employees generallyand the individual employee who adversely suffers because of those actions.  Thus, an employer who classifies his employees without respect to age may still be liable under the terms of this paragraph if such classification adversely affects the employee because of that employees agethe very definition of disparate impact.  Justice OConnor is therefore quite wrong to suggest that the textual differences between the two paragraphs are unimportant.

						 Justice OConnor reaches a contrary conclusion based on the text of the statute, the legislative history, and the structure of the statute.  As we explain above, n. 6, supra, her textual reasoning is not persuasive.  Further, while Congress may have intended to remedy disparate-impact type situations through noncoercive measures in part, there is nothing to suggest that it intended such measures to be the sole method of achieving the desired result of remedying practices that had an adverse effect on older workers.  Finally, we agree that the differences between age and the classes protected in Title VII are relevant, and that Congress might well have intended to treat the two differently.  See infra, at 7 (OConnor, J., concurring in judgment).   However, Congress obviously considered those classes of individuals to be sufficiently similar to warrant enacting identical legislation, at least with respect to employment practices it sought to prohibit.  While those differences, coupled with a difference in the text of the statue such as the RFOA provision, may warrant addressing disparate-impact claims in the two statutes differently, see infra, at 1112, it does not justify departing from the plain text and our settled interpretation of that text.

				This is an absolutely classic case for deference to agency interpretation.  The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA),

            <em>
					et seq.
				</em>
				, confers upon the EEOC authority to issue such rules and regulations as it may consider necessary or appropriate for carrying out the ADEA.  §628.  Pursuant to this authority, the EEOC promulgated, after notice-and-comment rulemaking, see 46 Fed. Reg. 47724, 47727 (1981), a regulation that reads as follows:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				When an employment practice, including a test, is claimed as a basis for different treatment of employees or applicants for employment on the grounds that it is a factor other than age, and such a practice has an adverse impact on individuals within the protected age group, it can only be justified as a business necessity.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/29/1625" class="subref" title="subref">29 CFR §1625.7</a>(d) (2004).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
The statement of the EEOC which accompanied publication of the agencys final interpretation of the ADEA said the following regarding this regulation: Paragraph (d) of §1625.7 has been rewritten to make it clear that employment criteria that are age-neutral on their face but which nevertheless have a disparate impact on members of the protected age group must be justified as a business necessity.

				<em>

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				It shall not be unlawful for an employer, employment agency, or labor organization … to take any action 
				<em>
					otherwise prohibited

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
As this text makes clear, the RFOA defense is relevant 
				<em>
					only 
				</em>
				as a response to employer actions otherwise prohibited by the ADEA.  Hence, the unavoidable meaning of the regulation at issue is that the ADEA prohibits employer actions that have an adverse impact on individuals within the protected age group.

				The EEOC has express authority to promulgate rules and regulations interpreting the ADEA.  It has exercised that authority to recognize disparate-impact claims.

						 Perhaps Justice OConnor adopts the narrower position that, while the EEOC has taken the view that the ADEA prohibits actions that have a disparate impact, it has stopped short of recognizing disparate impact claims.  Post, at 18 (opinion concurring in judgment) (emphasis added).  If so, this position is equally misguided.

						 Justice OConnor argues that the regulation does not necessarily construe subsection (4)(a)(2) to prohibit disparate impact, because disparate treatment also can have the effect which the regulation addressesviz., an adverse impact on individuals within the protected age group, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/29/1625" class="subref" title="subref">29 CFR §1625.7</a>(d).  See post, at 20.  That is true enough.  But the question here is not whether disparate treatment claims (when they have a disparate impact) are also covered by the regulation; it is whether disparate impact claims of all sorts are covered; and there is no way to avoid the conclusion (consistently reaffirmed by the agencys actions over the years) that they are.  That is also a complete response to Justice OConnors point that the regulation could not refer to §4(a)(2) because it includes "applicants for employment," who are protected only under §4(a)(1).  Perhaps applicants for employment are covered only when (as Justice OConnor posits) disparate treatment results in disparate impact; or perhaps the agencys attempt to sweep employment applications into the disparate impact prohibition is mistaken.  But whatever in addition it may cover, or may erroneously seek to cover, it is impossible to contend that the regulation does not cover actions that limit, segregate or classify employees in a way that produces a disparate impact on those within the protected age group; and the only basis for its interpretation that those actions are prohibited is §(4)(a)(2).

				This is an absolutely classic case for deference to agency interpretation.  The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/29/621.html" class="subref" title="subref">29 U. S. C. §621</a>
            <em>
					et seq.
				</em>
				, confers upon the EEOC authority to issue such rules and regulations as it may consider necessary or appropriate for carrying out the ADEA.  §628.  Pursuant to this authority, the EEOC promulgated, after notice-and-comment rulemaking, see 46 Fed. Reg. 47724, 47727 (1981), a regulation that reads as follows:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				When an employment practice, including a test, is claimed as a basis for different treatment of employees or applicants for employment on the grounds that it is a factor other than age, and such a practice has an adverse impact on individuals within the protected age group, it can only be justified as a business necessity.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/29/1625" class="subref" title="subref">29 CFR §1625.7</a>(d) (2004).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
The statement of the EEOC which accompanied publication of the agencys final interpretation of the ADEA said the following regarding this regulation: Paragraph (d) of §1625.7 has been rewritten to make it clear that employment criteria that are age-neutral on their face but which nevertheless have a disparate impact on members of the protected age group must be justified as a business necessity.

        <p class="bodytext">
				It shall not be unlawful for an employer, employment agency, or labor organization … to take any action

        <p class="bodytext">
				
As this text makes clear, the RFOA defense is relevant

				The EEOC has express authority to promulgate rules and regulations interpreting the ADEA.  It has exercised that authority to recognize disparate-impact claims.

						 Perhaps Justice OConnor adopts the narrower position that, while the EEOC has taken the view that the ADEA prohibits actions that have a disparate impact, it has stopped short of recognizing disparate impact claims.  Post, at 18 (opinion concurring in judgment) (emphasis added).  If so, this position is equally misguided.  The EEOC need not take the extra step of recognizing that individuals harmed by prohibited actions have a right to sue; the ADEA itself makes that automatic.

						 Justice OConnor argues that the regulation does not necessarily construe subsection (4)(a)(2) to prohibit disparate impact, because disparate treatment also can have the effect which the regulation addressesviz., an adverse impact on individuals within the protected age group, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/29/1625" class="subref" title="subref">29 CFR §1625.7</a>(d).  See post, at 20.  That is true enough.  But the question here is not whether disparate treatment claims (when they have a disparate impact) are also covered by the regulation; it is whether disparate impact claims of all sorts are covered; and there is no way to avoid the conclusion (consistently reaffirmed by the agencys actions over the years) that they are.  That is also a complete response to Justice OConnors point that the regulation could not refer to §4(a)(2) because it includes "applicants for employment," who are protected only under §4(a)(1).  Perhaps applicants for employment are covered only when (as Justice OConnor posits) disparate treatment results in disparate impact; or perhaps the agencys attempt to sweep employment applications into the disparate impact prohibition is mistaken.  But whatever in addition it may cover, or may erroneously seek to cover, it is impossible to contend that the regulation does not cover actions that limit, segregate or classify employees in a way that produces a disparate impact on those within the protected age group; and the only basis for its interpretation that those actions are prohibited is §(4)(a)(2).

						 Justice OConnor argues that the regulation does not necessarily construe subsection (4)(a)(2) to prohibit disparate impact, because disparate treatment also can have the effect which the regulation addressesviz., an adverse impact on individuals within the protected age group, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/29/1625" class="subref" title="subref">29 CFR §1625.7</a>(d).  See post, at 20.  That is true enough.  But the question here is not whether disparate treatment claims (when they have a disparate impact) are also covered by the regulation; it is whether disparate impact claims of all sorts are covered; and there is no way to avoid the conclusion (consistently reaffirmed by the agencys actions over the years) that they are.  That is also a complete response to Justice OConnors point that the regulation could not refer to §4(a)(2) because it includes "applicants for employment," who are protected only under §4(a)(1).  Perhaps applicants for employment are covered only when (as Justice OConnor posits) disparate treatment results in disparate impact; or perhaps the agencys attempt to sweep employment applications into the disparate impact prohibition is mistaken.  But whatever in addition it may cover, or may erroneously seek to cover, it is impossible to contend that the regulation does not cover actions that limit, segregate or classify employees in a way that produces a disparate impact on those within the protected age group; and the only basis for its interpretation that those actions are prohibited is §(4)(a)(2).

				This is an absolutely classic case for deference to agency interpretation.  The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/29/621.html" class="subref" title="subref">29 U. S. C. §621</a>
            <em>
					et seq.
				</em>
				, confers upon the EEOC authority to issue such rules and regulations as it may consider necessary or appropriate for carrying out the ADEA.  §628.  Pursuant to this authority, the EEOC promulgated, after notice-and-comment rulemaking, see 46 Fed. Reg. 47724, 47727 (1981), a regulation that reads as follows:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				When an employment practice, including a test, is claimed as a basis for different treatment of employees or applicants for employment on the grounds that it is a factor other than age, and such a practice has an adverse impact on individuals within the protected age group, it can only be justified as a business necessity.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/29/1625" class="subref" title="subref">29 CFR §1625.7</a>(d) (2004).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
The statement of the EEOC which accompanied publication of the agencys final interpretation of the ADEA said the following regarding this regulation: Paragraph (d) of §1625.7 has been rewritten to make it clear that employment criteria that are age-neutral on their face but which nevertheless have a disparate impact on members of the protected age group must be justified as a business necessity.

This cannot possibly be read as agnostic on the question whether the ADEA prohibits employer practices that have a disparate impact on the aged.  It provides that such practices can

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				It shall not be unlawful for an employer, employment agency, or labor organization … to take any action 
				<em>

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
As this text makes clear, the RFOA defense is relevant 
				<em>
					only 
				</em>
				as a response to employer actions otherwise prohibited by the ADEA.  Hence, the unavoidable meaning of the regulation at issue is that the ADEA prohibits employer actions that have an adverse impact on individuals within the protected age group.

				It shall not be unlawful for an employer, employment agency, or labor organization … to take any action

						 Justice OConnor argues that the regulation does not necessarily construe subsection (4)(a)(2) to prohibit disparate impact, because disparate treatment also can have the effect which the regulation addressesviz., an adverse impact on individuals within the protected age group, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/29/1625" class="subref" title="subref">29 CFR §1625.7</a>(d).  See post, at 20.  That is true enough.  But the question here is not whether disparate treatment claims (when they have a disparate impact) are also covered by the regulation; it is whether disparate impact claims of all sorts are covered; and there is no way to avoid the conclusion (consistently reaffirmed by the agencys actions over the years) that they are.  That is also a complete response to Justice OConnors point that the regulation could not refer to §4(a)(2) because it includes "applicants for employment," who are protected only under §4(a)(1).  Perhaps applicants for employment are covered only when (as Justice OConnor posits) disparate treatment results in disparate impact; or perhaps the agencys attempt to sweep employment applications into the disparate impact prohibition is mistaken.  But whatever in addition it may cover, or may erroneously seek to cover, it is impossible to contend that the regulation does not cover actions that limit, segregate or classify employees in a way that produces a disparate impact on those within the protected age group; and the only basis for its interpretation that those actions are prohibited is §(4)(a)(2).

				</em>
				, confers upon the EEOC authority to issue such rules and regulations as it may consider necessary or appropriate for carrying out the ADEA.  §628.  Pursuant to this authority, the EEOC promulgated, after notice-and-comment rulemaking, see 46 Fed. Reg. 47724, 47727 (1981), a regulation that reads as follows:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				When an employment practice, including a test, is claimed as a basis for different treatment of employees or applicants for employment on the grounds that it is a factor other than age, and such a practice has an adverse impact on individuals within the protected age group, it can only be justified as a business necessity.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/29/1625" class="subref" title="subref">29 CFR §1625.7</a>(d) (2004).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
The statement of the EEOC which accompanied publication of the agencys final interpretation of the ADEA said the following regarding this regulation: Paragraph (d) of §1625.7 has been rewritten to make it clear that employment criteria that are age-neutral on their face but which nevertheless have a disparate impact on members of the protected age group must be justified as a business necessity.

				This is an absolutely classic case for deference to agency interpretation.  The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/29/621.html" class="subref" title="subref">29 U. S. C. §621</a>
            <em>
					et seq.
				</em>
				, confers upon the EEOC authority to issue such rules and regulations as it may consider necessary or appropriate for carrying out the ADEA.  §628.  Pursuant to this authority, the EEOC promulgated, after notice-and-comment rulemaking, see 46 Fed. Reg. 47724, 47727 (1981), a regulation that reads as follows:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				When an employment practice, including a test, is claimed as a basis for different treatment of employees or applicants for employment on the grounds that it is a factor other than age, and such a practice has an adverse impact on individuals within the protected age group, it can only be justified as a business necessity.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/29/1625" class="subref" title="subref">29 CFR §1625.7</a>(d) (2004).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
The statement of the EEOC which accompanied publication of the agencys final interpretation of the ADEA said the following regarding this regulation: Paragraph (d) of §1625.7 has been rewritten to make it clear that employment criteria that are age-neutral on their face but which nevertheless have a disparate impact on members of the protected age group must be justified as a business necessity.

This cannot possibly be read as agnostic on the question whether the ADEA prohibits employer practices that have a disparate impact on the aged.  It provides that such practices can

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				It shall not be unlawful for an employer, employment agency, or labor organization … to take any action 
				<em>
					otherwise prohibited

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
As this text makes clear, the RFOA defense is relevant 
				<em>
					only

				as a response to employer actions otherwise prohibited by the ADEA.  Hence, the unavoidable meaning of the regulation at issue is that the ADEA prohibits employer actions that have an adverse impact on individuals within the protected age group.

				The EEOC has express authority to promulgate rules and regulations interpreting the ADEA.  It has exercised that authority to recognize disparate-impact claims.

						 Perhaps Justice OConnor adopts the narrower position that, while the EEOC has taken the view that the ADEA prohibits actions that have a disparate impact, it has stopped short of recognizing disparate impact claims.  Post, at 18 (opinion concurring in judgment) (emphasis added).  If so, this position is equally misguided.  The EEOC need not take the extra step of recognizing that individuals harmed by prohibited actions have a right to sue; the ADEA itself makes that automatic.

						 Justice OConnor argues that the regulation does not necessarily construe subsection (4)(a)(2) to prohibit disparate impact, because disparate treatment also can have the effect which the regulation addressesviz., an adverse impact on individuals within the protected age group, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/29/1625" class="subref" title="subref">29 CFR §1625.7</a>(d).  See post, at 20.  That is true enough.  But the question here is not whether disparate treatment claims (when they have a disparate impact) are also covered by the regulation; it is whether disparate impact claims of all sorts are covered; and there is no way to avoid the conclusion (consistently reaffirmed by the agencys actions over the years) that they are.  That is also a complete response to Justice OConnors point that the regulation could not refer to §4(a)(2) because it includes "applicants for employment," who are protected only under §4(a)(1).  Perhaps applicants for employment are covered only when (as Justice OConnor posits) disparate treatment results in disparate impact; or perhaps the agencys attempt to sweep employment applications into the disparate impact prohibition is mistaken.  But whatever in addition it may cover, or may erroneously seek to cover, it is impossible to contend that the regulation does not cover actions that limit, segregate or classify employees in a way that produces a disparate impact on those within the protected age group; and the only basis for its interpretation that those actions are prohibited is §(4)(a)(2).

If so, this position is equally misguided.

						 Justice OConnor argues that the regulation does not necessarily construe subsection (4)(a)(2) to prohibit disparate impact, because disparate treatment also can have the effect which the regulation addressesviz., an adverse impact on individuals within the protected age group, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/29/1625" class="subref" title="subref">29 CFR §1625.7</a>(d).  See post, at 20.  That is true enough.  But the question here is not whether disparate treatment claims (when they have a disparate impact) are also covered by the regulation; it is whether disparate impact claims of all sorts are covered; and there is no way to avoid the conclusion (consistently reaffirmed by the agencys actions over the years) that they are.  That is also a complete response to Justice OConnors point that the regulation could not refer to §4(a)(2) because it includes "applicants for employment," who are protected only under §4(a)(1).  Perhaps applicants for employment are covered only when (as Justice OConnor posits) disparate treatment results in disparate impact; or perhaps the agencys attempt to sweep employment applications into the disparate impact prohibition is mistaken.  But whatever in addition it may cover, or may erroneously seek to cover, it is impossible to contend that the regulation does not cover actions that limit, segregate or classify employees in a way that produces a disparate impact on those within the protected age group; and the only basis for its interpretation that those actions are prohibited is §(4)(a)(2).

				This is an absolutely classic case for deference to agency interpretation.  The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/29/621.html" class="subref" title="subref">29 U. S. C. §621</a>
            <em>
					et seq.
				</em>
				, confers upon the EEOC authority to issue such rules and regulations as it may consider necessary or appropriate for carrying out the ADEA.  §628.  Pursuant to this authority, the EEOC promulgated, after notice-and-comment rulemaking, see 46 Fed. Reg. 47724, 47727 (1981), a regulation that reads as follows:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				When an employment practice, including a test, is claimed as a basis for different treatment of employees or applicants for employment on the grounds that it is a factor other than age, and such a practice has an adverse impact on individuals within the protected age group, it can only be justified as a business necessity.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/29/1625" class="subref" title="subref">29 CFR §1625.7</a>(d) (2004).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
The statement of the EEOC which accompanied publication of the agencys final interpretation of the ADEA said the following regarding this regulation: Paragraph (d) of §1625.7 has been rewritten to make it clear that employment criteria that are age-neutral on their face but which nevertheless have a disparate impact on members of the protected age group must be justified as a business necessity.

This cannot possibly be read as agnostic on the question whether the ADEA prohibits employer practices that have a disparate impact on the aged.  It provides that such practices can

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				It shall not be unlawful for an employer, employment agency, or labor organization … to take any action 
				<em>

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
As this text makes clear, the RFOA defense is relevant 
				<em>
					only 
				</em>
				as a response to employer actions otherwise prohibited by the ADEA.  Hence, the unavoidable meaning of the regulation at issue is that the ADEA prohibits employer actions that have an adverse impact on individuals within the protected age group.

        <p class="bodytext">
				It shall not be unlawful for an employer, employment agency, or labor organization … to take any action

						 Justice OConnor argues that the regulation does not necessarily construe subsection (4)(a)(2) to prohibit disparate impact, because disparate treatment also can have the effect which the regulation addressesviz., an adverse impact on individuals within the protected age group, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/29/1625" class="subref" title="subref">29 CFR §1625.7</a>(d).  See post, at 20.  That is true enough.  But the question here is not whether disparate treatment claims (when they have a disparate impact) are also covered by the regulation; it is whether disparate impact claims of all sorts are covered; and there is no way to avoid the conclusion (consistently reaffirmed by the agencys actions over the years) that they are.  That is also a complete response to Justice OConnors point that the regulation could not refer to §4(a)(2) because it includes "applicants for employment," who are protected only under §4(a)(1).  Perhaps applicants for employment are covered only when (as Justice OConnor posits) disparate treatment results in disparate impact; or perhaps the agencys attempt to sweep employment applications into the disparate impact prohibition is mistaken.  But whatever in addition it may cover, or may erroneously seek to cover, it is impossible to contend that the regulation does not cover actions that limit, segregate or classify employees in a way that produces a disparate impact on those within the protected age group; and the only basis for its interpretation that those actions are prohibited is §(4)(a)(2).

					et seq.
				</em>
				, confers upon the EEOC authority to issue such rules and regulations as it may consider necessary or appropriate for carrying out the ADEA.  §628.  Pursuant to this authority, the EEOC promulgated, after notice-and-comment rulemaking, see 46 Fed. Reg. 47724, 47727 (1981), a regulation that reads as follows:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				When an employment practice, including a test, is claimed as a basis for different treatment of employees or applicants for employment on the grounds that it is a factor other than age, and such a practice has an adverse impact on individuals within the protected age group, it can only be justified as a business necessity.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/29/1625" class="subref" title="subref">29 CFR §1625.7</a>(d) (2004).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
The statement of the EEOC which accompanied publication of the agencys final interpretation of the ADEA said the following regarding this regulation: Paragraph (d) of §1625.7 has been rewritten to make it clear that employment criteria that are age-neutral on their face but which nevertheless have a disparate impact on members of the protected age group must be justified as a business necessity.

				This is an absolutely classic case for deference to agency interpretation.  The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/29/621.html" class="subref" title="subref">29 U. S. C. §621</a>
            <em>
					et seq.
				</em>
				, confers upon the EEOC authority to issue such rules and regulations as it may consider necessary or appropriate for carrying out the ADEA.  §628.  Pursuant to this authority, the EEOC promulgated, after notice-and-comment rulemaking, see 46 Fed. Reg. 47724, 47727 (1981), a regulation that reads as follows:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				When an employment practice, including a test, is claimed as a basis for different treatment of employees or applicants for employment on the grounds that it is a factor other than age, and such a practice has an adverse impact on individuals within the protected age group, it can only be justified as a business necessity.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/29/1625" class="subref" title="subref">29 CFR §1625.7</a>(d) (2004).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
The statement of the EEOC which accompanied publication of the agencys final interpretation of the ADEA said the following regarding this regulation: Paragraph (d) of §1625.7 has been rewritten to make it clear that employment criteria that are age-neutral on their face but which nevertheless have a disparate impact on members of the protected age group must be justified as a business necessity.

				<em>

				, to defend the position that the ADEA authorizes disparate-impact claims.

				, at 1821 (opinion concurring in judgment).  The first claim cannot be squared with the text of the EEOCs regulation, quoted above.  This cannot possibly be read as agnostic on the question whether the ADEA prohibits employer practices that have a disparate impact on the aged.  It provides that such practices can 
				<em>
					only 
				</em>
				be justified as a business necessity, compelling the conclusion that, absent a business necessity, such practices are prohibited.

				 would not defer to the EEOC regulation, even if it read as it does, because, she says, the regulation does not purport to interpret the language of §4(a) at all, but is rather limited to an interpretation of the reasonable factors other than age (RFOA) clause of §4(f)(1) of the ADEA, which she says is not at issue.

				, at 19.  This argument assumes, however, that the RFOA clause operates independently of the remainder of the ADEA.  It does not.  Section 4(f)(1) provides, in relevant part: 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				It shall not be unlawful for an employer, employment agency, or labor organization … to take any action 
				<em>
					otherwise prohibited
				</em>
				 under subsections (a), (b), (c), or (e) of this section … where the differentiation is based on reasonable factors other than age … .

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
As this text makes clear, the RFOA defense is relevant 
				<em>
					only 
				</em>
				as a response to employer actions otherwise prohibited by the ADEA.  Hence, the unavoidable meaning of the regulation at issue is that the ADEA prohibits employer actions that have an adverse impact on individuals within the protected age group.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/29/1625" class="subref" title="subref">29 CFR §1625.7</a>(d) (2004).  And, of course, the only provision of the ADEA that could conceivably be interpreted to effect such a prohibition is §4(a)(2)the provision that 
				<span class="smallcaps">

				, at 21.  Her logic seems to be that, because the two interpretations appear in the same paragraph, they should stand or fall together.  She cites no case for this proposition, and it makes little sense.  If the two simultaneously adopted interpretations were contained in

				does not mean to imply, I assume, that our rejection of the EEOCs application of the phrase reasonable factors other than age to disparate impact claims in paragraph (d) of §1625.7 relieves the lower courts of the obligation to defer to the EEOCs other applications of the same phrase in paragraph (c) or (e)).   I can conceive no basis for a different rule simply because the two simul-

				The EEOC has express authority to promulgate rules and regulations interpreting the ADEA.  It has exercised that authority to recognize disparate-impact claims.  And, for the reasons given by the plurality opinion, its position is eminently reasonable.  In my view, that is sufficient to resolve this case.

						 Perhaps Justice OConnor adopts the narrower position that, while the EEOC has taken the view that the ADEA prohibits actions that have a disparate impact, it has stopped short of recognizing disparate impact claims.  Post, at 18 (opinion concurring in judgment) (emphasis added).  If so, this position is equally misguided.  The EEOC need not take the extra step of recognizing that individuals harmed by prohibited actions have a right to sue; the ADEA itself makes that automatic.

						 Justice OConnor argues that the regulation does not necessarily construe subsection (4)(a)(2) to prohibit disparate impact, because disparate treatment also can have the effect which the regulation addressesviz., an adverse impact on individuals within the protected age group, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/29/1625" class="subref" title="subref">29 CFR §1625.7</a>(d).  See post, at 20.  That is true enough.  But the question here is not whether disparate treatment claims (when they have a disparate impact) are also covered by the regulation; it is whether disparate impact claims of all sorts are covered; and there is no way to avoid the conclusion (consistently reaffirmed by the agencys actions over the years) that they are.  That is also a complete response to Justice OConnors point that the regulation could not refer to §4(a)(2) because it includes "applicants for employment," who are protected only under §4(a)(1).  Perhaps applicants for employment are covered only when (as Justice OConnor posits) disparate treatment results in disparate impact; or perhaps the agencys attempt to sweep employment applications into the disparate impact prohibition is mistaken.  But whatever in addition it may cover, or may erroneously seek to cover, it is impossible to contend that the regulation does not cover actions that limit, segregate or classify employees in a way that produces a disparate impact on those within the protected age group; and the only basis for its interpretation that those actions are prohibited is §(4)(a)(2).

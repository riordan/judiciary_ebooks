It can simply change the relevant regulations, for example, by specifying that federal money is sometimes used for minimum, not adequate, programs, which minimum programs lack pre-emptive force.  The agency remains free to amend its regulations to achieve the commonsense result that the Government itself now seeks.  With that understanding, I join the majoritys opinion.

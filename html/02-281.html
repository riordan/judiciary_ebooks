				This case stems from a California countys investigation of Native American tribe members for alleged off-reservation crimes.  Pursuing the investigation, county law-enforcement officers executed a state court warrant for casino employment records kept by the Tribe on its reservation.  The Tribe sued the County, the District Attorney, and the Sheriff in federal court, asserting sovereign immunity from state court processes and seeking declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief.

				The parties and, as

            <em>

				</em>
				, the United States agree that a Native American Tribe, like a State of the United States, is not a person subject to suit under 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/1983.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §1983</a>.  We hold that, in the situation here presented, the Tribe does not qualify as a person who may sue under §1983.  Whether the Tribes suit qualifies for federal-court jurisdiction because it arises under some federal law other than §1983 is an issue the parties have not precisely addressed, and the trial and appellate courts have not clearly decided.  We therefore remand the case for close consideration and specific resolution of that threshold question.

				In March 1999, the Inyo County Department of Health and Human Services received information from the State Department of Social Services indicating that three Casino employees had failed to report Casino earnings on their applications for state welfare benefits.  Brief for Petitioners 45.  According to the County, the employees failed to respond when the Department requested that they reconcile the apparent discrepancies between their Casino earnings and their welfare application forms.

				In February 2000, the District Attorneys Office asked the Casino for the three employees employment records, explaining that it was investigating alleged welfare fraud.  291 F. 3d 549, 554 (CA9 2002).  The Tribe responded that its privacy policy precluded release of the records without the employees consent.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The District Attorney then sought and, on showing probable cause, obtained a search warrant from the Inyo County Superior Court.  The warrant authorized a search of the Casino for payroll records of the three employees.  On March 23, 2000, the Inyo County Sheriff and the District Attorney executed the warrant.  They did so over the objection of tribal officials.  Those officials urged that the state court lacked jurisdiction to authorize a search of premises and seizure of records belonging to a sovereign tribe.

				  The Sheriff and the District Attorney, lacking cooperation from the Tribe, cut the locks off the storage facility containing the Casinos personnel records.  The county officials seized timecard entries, payroll registers, and payroll check registers relating to the three employees; the seizure also garnered information contained in quarterly wage and withholding reports the Corporation had submitted to the State.  Each item seized contained at least one reference to an employee under investigation.

				In July 2000, the District Attorneys Office asked the Tribe for the personnel records of six other Casino employees.  The Tribe reiterated its privacy policy, but offered to accept as evidence of consent a redacted copy of the last page of each employees signed welfare application.  That page contained a statement that employment records of individuals applying for public assistance were subject to review by county officials.  The District Attorney refused the offer.

				To ward off any additional searches, the Tribe and the Corporation filed suit in Federal District Court naming as defendants the District Attorney and the Sheriff in their individual and official capacities, and the County.  Asserting federal question jurisdiction under 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1331.html#i_3_4" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §§1331(i)(3)(4)</a>, and the federal common law of Indian affairs, the Tribe sought injunctive and declaratory relief to vindicate its status as a sovereign immune from state processes under federal law, and to establish that state law was preempted to the extent that it purported to authorize seizure of tribal records.  App. 97, ¶1, 105114, ¶¶2653.  The Tribes complaint also sought relief under 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/1983.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §1983</a>, including compensatory damages.  In this regard, the Tribe alleged that by act-

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				On November 22, 2000, the District Court, on defendants motion, dismissed the Tribes complaint.  Tribal sovereign immunity, the court held, did not categorically preclude the search and seizure of the Casinos personnel records.  Taking into account the competing interests of the State and the Tribe, the court concluded that, [i]n the interest of a fair and uniform application of Californias criminal law, state officials should be able to execute search warrant[s] against the tribe and tribal property.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 62a.  The court also held that the District Attorney and the Sheriff had qualified immunity from suit in their individual capacities.

				The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				the District Courts judgment dismissing the action.  [E]xecution of a search warrant against the Tribe, the Court of Appeals said, interferes with the right of reservation Indians to make their own laws and be ruled by them.   291 F. 3d, at 558 (quoting

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">220</a> (1959)
).  In the appellate courts view, the District Court should not have balanced the interests at stake to determine whether the warrant was enforceable.  291 F. 3d, at 559.  This Courts precedent, the Ninth Circuit said, advanced a more categorical approach denying state jurisdiction … over a tribe absent a waiver by the tribe or a clear grant of authority by Congress.

				[E]ven if a balancing test is the appropriate legal framework, the Court of Appeals added, the balance of interests favors a ruling for the Tribe.  291 F. 3d, at 559.  The Tribes privacy policies regarding employee records promote tribal [self-government] interests, the Ninth Circuit reasoned; notably, those policies fostered a trusting relationship with tribal members, and affect[ed] the Casino, the Tribes predominant source of economic development revenue.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court of Appeals also ruled that the District Attorney and the Sheriff were not shielded by qualified immunity.  [A] reasonable county officer, it held, would have known … that seizing tribal property held on tribal land violated the

				 29, n. 15.  But in this case, the Court of Appeals concluded, a §1983 claim could be maintained because the Tribe sought protection from an unlawful search and seizure, a right secured by the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> and therefore within §1983s compass.  291 F. 3d, at 568, and n. 7.  On December 2, 2002, we granted certiorari.

				Central to our review is the question whether the Tribes complaint is actionable under §1983.  That provision permits citizen[s] and other person[s] within the jurisdiction of the United States to seek legal and equitable relief from person[s] who, under color of state law, deprive them of federally protected rights.

				There is in this case no allegation that the County lacked probable cause or that the warrant was otherwise defective.  It is only by virtue of the Tribes asserted sovereign status that it claims immunity from the Countys processes.  See App. 97105, ¶¶125, 108110, ¶¶3339; 291 F. 3d, at 554 (Court of Appeals find[s] that the County and its agents 
				<em>
					violated the Tribes sovereign immunity 
				</em>
				when they obtained and executed a search warrant against the Tribe and tribal property. (emphasis added)).  Section 1983 was designed to secure private rights against government encroachment, see 
				<em>
					Will
				</em>
				, 491 U. S., at 66, not to advance a sovereigns prerogative to withhold evidence relevant to a criminal investigation.  For example, as the County acknowledges, a tribal member complaining of a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> violation would be a person qualified to sue under §1983.  See Brief for Petitioners 20, n. 7.  But, like other private persons, that member would have no right to immunity from an appropriately executed search warrant based on probable cause.  Accordingly, we hold that the Tribe may not sue under §1983 to vindicate the sovereign right it here claims.

In short, absent §1983 as a foundation for the Tribes action, it is unclear what federal law, if any, the Tribes case aris[es] under.

				This case stems from a California countys investigation of Native American tribe members for alleged off-reservation crimes.  Pursuing the investigation, county law-enforcement officers executed a state court warrant for casino employment records kept by the Tribe on its reservation.  The Tribe sued the County, the District Attorney, and the Sheriff in federal court, asserting sovereign immunity from state court processes and seeking declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief.

We hold that, in the situation here presented, the Tribe does not qualify as a person who may sue under §1983.  Whether the Tribes suit qualifies for federal-court jurisdiction because it arises under some federal law other than §1983 is an issue the parties have not precisely addressed, and the trial and appellate courts have not clearly decided.  We therefore remand the case for close consideration and specific resolution of that threshold question.

				In February 2000, the District Attorneys Office asked the Casino for the three employees employment records, explaining that it was investigating alleged welfare fraud.  291 F. 3d 549, 554 (CA9 2002).  The Tribe responded that its privacy policy precluded release of the records without the employees consent.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The District Attorney then sought and, on showing probable cause, obtained a search warrant from the Inyo County Superior Court.  The warrant authorized a search of the Casino for payroll records of the three employees.  On March 23, 2000, the Inyo County Sheriff and the District Attorney executed the warrant.  They did so over the objection of tribal officials.  Those officials urged that the state court lacked jurisdiction to authorize a search of premises and seizure of records belonging to a sovereign tribe.

				  The Sheriff and the District Attorney, lacking cooperation from the Tribe, cut the locks off the storage facility containing the Casinos personnel records.  The county officials seized timecard entries, payroll registers, and payroll check registers relating to the three employees; the seizure also garnered information contained in quarterly wage and withholding reports the Corporation had submitted to the State.  Each item seized contained at least one reference to an employee under investigation.

				In July 2000, the District Attorneys Office asked the Tribe for the personnel records of six other Casino employees.  The Tribe reiterated its privacy policy, but offered to accept as evidence of consent a redacted copy of the last page of each employees signed welfare application.  That page contained a statement that employment records of individuals applying for public assistance were subject to review by county officials.  The District Attorney refused the offer.

				To ward off any additional searches, the Tribe and the Corporation filed suit in Federal District Court naming as defendants the District Attorney and the Sheriff in their individual and official capacities, and the County.  Asserting federal question jurisdiction under

C. §§1331(i)(3)(4)</a>, and the federal common law of Indian affairs, the Tribe sought injunctive and declaratory relief to vindicate its status as a sovereign immune from state processes under federal law, and to establish that state law was preempted to the extent that it purported to authorize seizure of tribal records.  App. 97, ¶1, 105114, ¶¶2653.  The Tribes complaint also sought relief under 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/1983.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §1983</a>, including compensatory damages.  In this regard, the Tribe alleged that by act-

				On November 22, 2000, the District Court, on defendants motion, dismissed the Tribes complaint.  Tribal sovereign immunity, the court held, did not categorically preclude the search and seizure of the Casinos personnel records.  Taking into account the competing interests of the State and the Tribe, the court concluded that, [i]n the interest of a fair and uniform application of Californias criminal law, state officials should be able to execute search warrant[s] against the tribe and tribal property.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 62a.

				The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed

				[E]ven if a balancing test is the appropriate legal framework, the Court of Appeals added, the balance of interests favors a ruling for the Tribe.  291 F. 3d, at 559.  The Tribes privacy policies regarding employee records promote tribal [self-government] interests, the Ninth Circuit reasoned; notably, those policies fostered a trusting relationship with tribal members, and affect[ed] the Casino, the Tribes predominant source of economic development revenue.

				There is in this case no allegation that the County lacked probable cause or that the warrant was otherwise defective.  It is only by virtue of the Tribes asserted sovereign status that it claims immunity from the Countys processes.  See App. 97105, ¶¶125, 108110, ¶¶3339; 291 F. 3d, at 554 (Court of Appeals find[s] that the County and its agents 
				<em>
					violated the Tribes sovereign immunity 
				</em>
				when they obtained and executed a search warrant against the Tribe and tribal property. (emphasis added)).  Section 1983 was designed to secure private rights against government encroachment, see 
				<em>
					Will
				</em>
				, 491 U. S., at 66, not to advance a sovereigns prerogative to withhold evidence relevant to a criminal investigation.  For example, as the County acknowledges, a tribal member complaining of a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> violation would be a person qualified to sue under §1983.  See Brief for Petitioners 20, n. 7.  But, like other private persons, that member would have no right to immunity from an appropriately executed search warrant based on probable cause.  Accordingly, we hold that the Tribe may not sue under §1983 to vindicate the sovereign right it here claims.

In short, absent §1983 as a foundation for the Tribes action, it is unclear what federal law, if any, the Tribes case aris[es] under.

				This case stems from a California countys investigation of Native American tribe members for alleged off-reservation crimes.  Pursuing the investigation, county law-enforcement officers executed a state court warrant for casino employment records kept by the Tribe on its reservation.  The Tribe sued the County, the District Attorney, and the Sheriff in federal court, asserting sovereign immunity from state court processes and seeking declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief.

We hold that, in the situation here presented, the Tribe does not qualify as a person who may sue under §1983.  Whether the Tribes suit qualifies for federal-court jurisdiction because it arises under some federal law other than §1983 is an issue the parties have not precisely addressed, and the trial and appellate courts have not clearly decided.  We therefore remand the case for close consideration and specific resolution of that threshold question.

				In March 1999, the Inyo County Department of Health and Human Services received information from the State Department of Social Services indicating that three Casino employees had failed to report Casino earnings on their applications for state welfare benefits.

According to the County, the employees failed to respond when the Department requested that they reconcile the apparent discrepancies between their Casino earnings and their welfare application forms.

The Tribe responded that its privacy policy precluded release of the records without the employees consent.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The District Attorney then sought and, on showing probable cause, obtained a search warrant from the Inyo County Superior Court.  The warrant authorized a search of the Casino for payroll records of the three employees.  On March 23, 2000, the Inyo County Sheriff and the District Attorney executed the warrant.  They did so over the objection of tribal officials.  Those officials urged that the state court lacked jurisdiction to authorize a search of premises and seizure of records belonging to a sovereign tribe.

				  The Sheriff and the District Attorney, lacking cooperation from the Tribe, cut the locks off the storage facility containing the Casinos personnel records.  The county officials seized timecard entries, payroll registers, and payroll check registers relating to the three employees; the seizure also garnered information contained in quarterly wage and withholding reports the Corporation had submitted to the State.  Each item seized contained at least one reference to an employee under investigation.

				In July 2000, the District Attorneys Office asked the Tribe for the personnel records of six other Casino employees.  The Tribe reiterated its privacy policy, but offered to accept as evidence of consent a redacted copy of the last page of each employees signed welfare application.  That page contained a statement that employment records of individuals applying for public assistance were subject to review by county officials.  The District Attorney refused the offer.

				To ward off any additional searches, the Tribe and the Corporation filed suit in Federal District Court naming as defendants the District Attorney and the Sheriff in their individual and official capacities, and the County.  Asserting federal question jurisdiction under 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1331.html#i_3_4" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §§1331(i)(3)(4)</a>, and the federal common law of Indian affairs, the Tribe sought injunctive and declaratory relief to vindicate its status as a sovereign immune from state processes under federal law, and to establish that state law was preempted to the extent that it purported to authorize seizure of tribal records.  App. 97, ¶1, 105114, ¶¶2653.  The Tribes complaint also sought relief under

				On November 22, 2000, the District Court, on defendants motion, dismissed the Tribes complaint.  Tribal sovereign immunity, the court held, did not categorically preclude the search and seizure of the Casinos personnel records.  Taking into account the competing interests of the State and the Tribe, the court concluded that, [i]n the interest of a fair and uniform application of Californias criminal law, state officials should be able to execute search warrant[s] against the tribe and tribal property.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 62a.

				[E]ven if a balancing test is the appropriate legal framework, the Court of Appeals added, the balance of interests favors a ruling for the Tribe.  291 F. 3d, at 559.  The Tribes privacy policies regarding employee records promote tribal [self-government] interests, the Ninth Circuit reasoned; notably, those policies fostered a trusting relationship with tribal members, and affect[ed] the Casino, the Tribes predominant source of economic development revenue.

				There is in this case no allegation that the County lacked probable cause or that the warrant was otherwise defective.  It is only by virtue of the Tribes asserted sovereign status that it claims immunity from the Countys processes.  See App. 97105, ¶¶125, 108110, ¶¶3339; 291 F. 3d, at 554 (Court of Appeals find[s] that the County and its agents

				<em>
					Will
				</em>
				, 491 U. S., at 66, not to advance a sovereigns prerogative to withhold evidence relevant to a criminal investigation.  For example, as the County acknowledges, a tribal member complaining of a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> violation would be a person qualified to sue under §1983.  See Brief for Petitioners 20, n. 7.  But, like other private persons, that member would have no right to immunity from an appropriately executed search warrant based on probable cause.  Accordingly, we hold that the Tribe may not sue under §1983 to vindicate the sovereign right it here claims.

				This case stems from a California countys investigation of Native American tribe members for alleged off-reservation crimes.  Pursuing the investigation, county law-enforcement officers executed a state court warrant for casino employment records kept by the Tribe on its reservation.  The Tribe sued the County, the District Attorney, and the Sheriff in federal court, asserting sovereign immunity from state court processes and seeking declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief.

Whether the Tribes suit qualifies for federal-court jurisdiction because it arises under some federal law other than §1983 is an issue the parties have not precisely addressed, and the trial and appellate courts have not clearly decided.  We therefore remand the case for close consideration and specific resolution of that threshold question.

				The District Attorney then sought and, on showing probable cause, obtained a search warrant from the Inyo County Superior Court.  The warrant authorized a search of the Casino for payroll records of the three employees.  On March 23, 2000, the Inyo County Sheriff and the District Attorney executed the warrant.  They did so over the objection of tribal officials.  Those officials urged that the state court lacked jurisdiction to authorize a search of premises and seizure of records belonging to a sovereign tribe.

				  The Sheriff and the District Attorney, lacking cooperation from the Tribe, cut the locks off the storage facility containing the Casinos personnel records.

That page contained a statement that employment records of individuals applying for public assistance were subject to review by county officials.  The District Attorney refused the offer.

				On November 22, 2000, the District Court, on defendants motion, dismissed the Tribes complaint.  Tribal sovereign immunity, the court held, did not categorically preclude the search and seizure of the Casinos personnel records.  Taking into account the competing interests of the State and the Tribe, the court concluded that, [i]n the interest of a fair and uniform application of Californias criminal law, state officials should be able to execute search warrant[s] against the tribe and tribal property.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 62a.

				There is in this case no allegation that the County lacked probable cause or that the warrant was otherwise defective.  It is only by virtue of the Tribes asserted sovereign status that it claims immunity from the Countys processes.  See App. 97105, ¶¶125, 108110, ¶¶3339; 291 F. 3d, at 554 (Court of Appeals find[s] that the County and its agents 
				<em>

				<em>
					Will
				</em>
				, 491 U. S., at 66, not to advance a sovereigns prerogative to withhold evidence relevant to a criminal investigation.  For example, as the County acknowledges, a tribal member complaining of a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> violation would be a person qualified to sue under §1983.  See Brief for Petitioners 20, n. 7.  But, like other private persons, that member would have no right to immunity from an appropriately executed search warrant based on probable cause.  Accordingly, we hold that the Tribe may not sue under §1983 to vindicate the sovereign right it here claims.

				This case stems from a California countys investigation of Native American tribe members for alleged off-reservation crimes.  Pursuing the investigation, county law-enforcement officers executed a state court warrant for casino employment records kept by the Tribe on its reservation.  The Tribe sued the County, the District Attorney, and the Sheriff in federal court, asserting sovereign immunity from state court processes and seeking declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief.

				The District Attorney then sought and, on showing probable cause, obtained a search warrant from the Inyo County Superior Court.  The warrant authorized a search of the Casino for payroll records of the three employees.  On March 23, 2000, the Inyo County Sheriff and the District Attorney executed the warrant.  They did so over the objection of tribal officials.  Those officials urged that the state court lacked jurisdiction to authorize a search of premises and seizure of records belonging to a sovereign tribe.

That page contained a statement that employment records of individuals applying for public assistance were subject to review by county officials.  The District Attorney refused the offer.

				On November 22, 2000, the District Court, on defendants motion, dismissed the Tribes complaint.  Tribal sovereign immunity, the court held, did not categorically preclude the search and seizure of the Casinos personnel records.  Taking into account the competing interests of the State and the Tribe, the court concluded that, [i]n the interest of a fair and uniform application of Californias criminal law, state officials should be able to execute search warrant[s] against the tribe and tribal property.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 62a.

				There is in this case no allegation that the County lacked probable cause or that the warrant was otherwise defective.  It is only by virtue of the Tribes asserted sovereign status that it claims immunity from the Countys processes.  See App. 97105, ¶¶125, 108110, ¶¶3339; 291 F. 3d, at 554 (Court of Appeals find[s] that the County and its agents 
				<em>

				<em>
					Will
				</em>
				, 491 U. S., at 66, not to advance a sovereigns prerogative to withhold evidence relevant to a criminal investigation.  For example, as the County acknowledges, a tribal member complaining of a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> violation would be a person qualified to sue under §1983.  See Brief for Petitioners 20, n. 7.  But, like other private persons, that member would have no right to immunity from an appropriately executed search warrant based on probable cause.  Accordingly, we hold that the Tribe may not sue under §1983 to vindicate the sovereign right it here claims.

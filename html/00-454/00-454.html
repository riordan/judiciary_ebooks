				In 
				<em>
					Montana
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					United States,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/450/544" class="subref" title="subref">450 U. S. 544</a>, this Court held that, with two limited exceptions, Indian tribes lack civil authority over the conduct of nonmembers on non-Indian land within a reservation.  Petitioners trading post on such land within the Navajo Nation Reservation is subject to a hotel occupancy tax that the Tribe imposes on any hotel room located within the reservations boundaries.  The Federal District Court upheld the tax, and the Tenth Circuit affirmed.  Relying in part on 
				<em>
					Merrion
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Jicarilla Apache Tribe,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/455/130" class="subref" title="subref">455 U. S. 130</a>, the latter court complemented 
				<em>
					Montana
				</em>
				s framework with a case-by-case approach that balanced the lands non-Indian fee status with the Tribes sovereign powers, its interests, and the impact that the exercise of its powers had on the nonmembers interests.  The court concluded that the tax fell under 
				<em>
					Montana
				</em>
				s first exception.
			</p>
        <p class="SYLCTE">
            <em>
					Held: 
				</em>
				The Navajo Nations imposition of a hotel occupancy tax upon nonmembers on non-Indian fee land within its reservation is invalid.  Pp. 814.
			</p>
        <p class="SYLCTF">
				
				    
				(a) 
				<em>
					Montana
				</em>
				s general rule applies to tribal attempts to tax nonmember activity occurring on non-Indian fee land.  Tribal jurisdiction is limited: For powers not expressly conferred them by federal statute or treaty, tribes must rely upon their retained or inherent sovereignty.  Their power over nonmembers on non-Indian fee land is sharply circumscribed.  
				<em>
					Montana
				</em>
				 noted only two exceptions: (1) a tribe may regulate the activities of nonmembers who enter consensual relationships with the tribe or its members; and (2) a tribe may exercise civil authority over the conduct of non-Indians on fee lands within its reservation when that conduct threatens or has some direct effect on the tribes political integrity, economic security, or health or welfare.  450 U. S., at 565566.  
				<em>
					Montana
				</em>
				s rule applies to a tribes regulatory authority, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 566, and adjudicatory authority, 
				<em>
					Strate
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					A1 Contractors,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/520/438" class="subref" title="subref">520 U. S. 438</a>.  Citing 
				<em>
					Merrion,
				</em>
				 respondents submit that 
				<em>
					Montana
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Strate
				</em>
				 do not restrict a tribes power to impose revenue-raising taxes.  However, because 
				<em>
					Merrion
				</em>
				 noted that a tribes inherent taxing power only extended to transactions occurring on trust lands and involving the tribe or its members, 455 U. S., at 137, it is easily reconcilable with the 
				<em>
					Montana-Strate
				</em>
				 line of authority.  A tribes sovereign power to tax reaches no further than tribal land.  Thus, 
				<em>
					Merrion 
				</em>
				does not exempt taxation from 
				<em>
					Montana
				</em>
				s general rule, and 
				<em>
					Montana
				</em>
				 is applied straight up.  Because Congress had not authorized the tax at issue through treaty or statute, and because the incidence of the tax falls upon nonmembers on non-Indian fee land, the Navajo Nation must establish the existence of one of 
				<em>
					Montana
				</em>
				s exceptions.  Pp. 38.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				(b) 
				<em>
					Montana
				</em>
				s exceptions do not obtain here.  Neither petitioner nor its hotel guests have entered into a consensual relationship with the Navajo Nation justifying the taxs imposition.  Such a relationship must stem from commercial dealing, contracts, leases, or other arrangements, 
				<em>
					Montana, supra, 
				</em>
				at 565, and a nonmembers actual or potential receipt of tribal police, fire, and medical services does not create the requisite connection.  Nor is petitioners status as an Indian trader licensed by the Indian Affairs Commissioner sufficient by itself to support the taxs imposition.  As to 
				<em>
					Montana
				</em>
				s second exception, petitioners operation of a hotel on non-Indian fee land does not threaten or have a direct effect on the tribes political integrity, economic security, or health or welfare.  Contrary to respondents argument, the judgment in 
				<em>
					Brendale
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/492/408" class="subref" title="subref">492 U. S. 408</a>, did not give Indian tribes broad authority over nonmembers where the acreage of non-Indian fee land is miniscule in relation to the surrounding tribal land.  Irrespective of the percentage of non-Indian fee land within a reservation, 
				<em>
					Montana
				</em>
				s second exception grants tribes nothing beyond what is necessary to protect tribal self-government or control internal relations.  
				<em>
					Strate, supra, 
				</em>
				at 459.  Whatever effect petitioners operation of its trading post might have upon surrounding Navajo land, it does not endanger the Navajo Nations political integrity.  Pp. 813.

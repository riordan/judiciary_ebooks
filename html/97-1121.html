				Chicagos Gang Congregation Ordinance prohibits criminal street gang members from loitering in public places.  Under the ordinance, if a police officer observes a person whom he reasonably believes to be a gang member loitering in a public place with one or more persons, he shall order them to disperse.  Anyone who does not promptly obey such an order has violated the ordinance.  The police departments General Order 924 purports to limit officers enforcement discretion by confining arrest authority to designated officers, establishing detailed criteria for defining street gangs and membership therein, and providing for designated, but publicly undisclosed, enforcement areas.  Two trial judges upheld the ordinances constitutionality, but eleven others ruled it invalid.  The Illinois Appellate Court affirmed the latter cases and reversed the convictions in the former.  The State Supreme Court affirmed, holding that the ordinance violates due process in that it is impermissibly vague on its face and an arbitrary restriction on personal liberties.

            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/461/352" class="subref" title="subref">461 U. S. 352</a>.  The ordinance encompasses a great deal of harmless behavior: In any public place in Chicago, persons in the company of a gang member shall be ordered to disperse if their purpose is not apparent to an officer.  Moreover, the Illinois Supreme Court interprets the ordinances loitering definitionto remain in any one place with no apparent purposeas giving officers absolute discretion to determine what activities constitute loitering.  See 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 359.  This Court has no authority to construe the language of a state statute more narrowly than the States highest court.  See 
				<em>
					Smiley
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Kansas,

            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/196/447" class="subref" title="subref">196 U. S. 447</a>.  The three features of the ordinance that, the city argues, limit the officers discretion(1) it does not permit issuance of a dispersal order to anyone who is moving along or who has an apparent purpose; (2) it does not permit an arrest if individuals obey a dispersal order; and (3) no order can issue unless the officer reasonably believes that one of the loiterers is a gang memberare insufficient.  Finally, the Illinois Supreme Court is correct that General Order 924 is not a sufficient limitation on police discretion.  See

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				1. It was not improper for the state courts to conclude that the ordinance, which covers a significant amount of activity in addition to the intimidating conduct that is its factual predicate, is invalid on its face.  An enactment may be attacked on its face as impermissibly vague if, 
				<em>
					inter alia, 
				</em>
				it fails to establish standards for the police and public that are sufficient to guard against the arbitrary deprivation of liberty.  
				<em>
					Kolender
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Lawson,
				</em>
				 461 U. S., at 358.  The freedom to loiter for innocent purposes is part of such liberty.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Kent
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Dulles,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/357/116" class="subref" title="subref">357 U. S. 116</a>.  The ordinances vagueness makes a facial challenge appropriate.  This is not an enactment that simply regulates business behavior and contains a scienter requirement.  See 
				<em>
					Hoffman Estates
				</em>
				 v.
				<em>
					 Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc.,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/455/489" class="subref" title="subref">455 U. S. 489</a>.  It is a criminal law that contains no

				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 391.  Pp. 712.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				2. Because the ordinance fails to give the ordinary citizen adequate notice of what is forbidden and what is permitted, it is impermissibly vague.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Coates
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Cincinnati,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/402/611" class="subref" title="subref">402 U. S. 611</a>.  The term loiter may have a common and accepted meaning, but the ordinances definition of that termto remain in any one place with no apparent purposedoes not.  It is difficult to imagine how any Chicagoan standing in a public place with a group of people would know if he or she had an apparent purpose.  This vagueness about what loitering is covered and what is not dooms the ordinance.  The citys principal response to the adequate notice concernthat loiterers are not subject to criminal sanction until after they have disobeyed a dispersal orderis unpersuasive for at least two reasons.  First, the fair notice requirements purpose is to enable the ordinary citizen to conform his or her conduct to the law.  See 
				<em>
					Lanzetta
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					New Jersey,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/306/451" class="subref" title="subref">306 U. S. 451</a>.  A dispersal order, which is issued only after prohibited conduct has occurred, cannot retroactively provide adequate notice of the boundary between the permissible and the impermissible applications of the ordinance.  Second, the dispersal orders terms compound the inadequacy of the notice afforded by the ordinance, which vaguely requires that the officer order all such persons to disperse and remove themselves from the area, and thereby raises a host of questions as to the duration and distinguishing features of the loiterers separation.  Pp. 1216.

            <span class="smallcaps">
					Justice OConnor
				</span>
				, joined by 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Breyer, 
				</span>
				concluded that, as construed by the Illinois Supreme Court,
				<span class="smallcaps">
					 
				</span>
				the Chicago ordinance is unconstitutionally vague because it lacks sufficient minimal standards to guide law enforcement officers; in particular, it fails to provide any standard by which police can judge whether an individual has an 
				<em>
					apparent
				</em>
				 purpose.  This vagueness alone provides a sufficient ground for affirming the judgment below, and there is no need to consider the other issues briefed by the parties and addressed by the plurality.  
				    
				It is important to courts and legislatures alike to characterize more clearly the narrow scope of the Courts holding.  Chicago still has reasonable alternatives to combat the very real threat posed by gang intimidation and violence, including, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 adoption of laws that directly prohibit the congregation of gang members to intimidate residents, or the enforcement of existing laws with that effect.  Moreover, the ordinance could have been construed more narrowly to avoid the vagueness problem, by, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 adopting limitations that restrict the ordinances criminal penalties to gang members or interpreting the term apparent purpose narrowly and in light of the Chicago City Councils findings.  This Court, however, cannot impose a limiting construction that a state supreme court has declined to adopt.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Kolender
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Lawson,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/461/352" class="subref" title="subref">461 U. S. 352</a>, n. 4.  The Illinois Supreme Court misapplied this Courts precedents, particularly 
				<em>
					Papachristou
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Jacksonville
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/405/156" class="subref" title="subref">405 U. S. 156</a>, to the extent it read them as 
				<em>
					requiring
				</em>
				 it to hold the ordinance vague in all of its applications.  Pp. 15.

        <p class="bodytext">
            <span class="smallcaps">
					 Justice Kennedy
				</span>
				 concluded that, as interpreted by the Illinois Supreme Court, the Chicago ordinance unconstitutionally reaches a broad range of innocent conduct, and, therefore, is not necessarily saved by the requirement that the citizen disobey a dispersal order before there is a violation.  Although it can be assumed that disobeying some police commands will subject a citizen to prosecution whether or not the citizen knows why the order is given, it does not follow that any unexplained police order must be obeyed without notice of its lawfulness.  The predicate of a dispersal order is not sufficient to eliminate doubts regarding the adequacy of notice under this ordinance.  A citizen, while engaging in a wide array of innocent conduct, is not likely to know when he may be subject to such an order based on the officers own knowledge of the identity or affiliations of other persons with whom the citizen is congregating; nor may the citizen be able to assess what an officer might conceive to be the citizens lack of an apparent purpose.  Pp. 12.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Breyer
				</span>
				 concluded that the ordinance violates the Constitution because it delegates too much discretion to the police, and it is not saved by its limitations requiring that the police reasonably believe that the person ordered to disperse (or someone accompanying  him) is a gang member, and that he remain in the public place with no apparent purpose.  Nor does it violate this Courts usual rules governing facial challenges to forbid the city to apply the unconstitutional ordinance in this case.  There is no way to distinguish in the ordinances terms between one application of unlimited police discretion and another.  It is unconstitutional, not because a policeman applied his discretion wisely or poorly in a particular case, but rather because the policeman enjoys too much discretion in 
				<em>
					every
				</em>
				 case.  And if every application of the ordinance represents an exercise of unlimited discretion, then the ordinance 
				<em>
					is
				</em>
				 invalid in all its applications.  See 
				<em>
					Lanzetta
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					New Jersey,

            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/306/451" class="subref" title="subref">306 U. S. 451</a>.  Contrary to 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Scalia
				</span>
				s suggestion, the ordinance does not escape facial invalidation simply because it may provide fair warning to some individual defendants that it prohibits the conduct in which they are engaged.  This ordinance is unconstitutional, not because it provides insufficient notice, but because it does not provide sufficient minimal standards to guide the police.  See

				I agree with the Court that Chicagos Gang Congregation Ordinance, Chicago Municipal Code §84015 (1992) (gang loitering ordinance or ordinance) is unconstitutionally vague.  A penal law is void for vagueness if it fails to define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited or fails to establish guidelines to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement of the law.

				As it has been construed by the Illinois court, Chicagos gang loitering ordinance is unconstitutionally vague because it lacks sufficient minimal standards to guide law enforcement officers.  In particular, it fails to provide police with any standard by which they can judge whether an individual has an 
				<em>
					apparent
				</em>
				 purpose.  Indeed, because any person standing on the street has a general purposeeven if it is simply to standthe ordinance permits police officers to choose which purposes are 
				<em>
					permissible
				</em>
				.  Under this construction the police do not have to decide that an individual is threaten[ing] the public peace to issue a dispersal order.  See

				</em>
				  Any police officer in Chicago is free, under the Illinois Supreme Courts construction of the ordinance, to order at his whim any person standing in a public place with a suspected gang member to disperse.  Further, as construed by the Illinois court, the ordinance applies to hundreds of thousands of persons who are 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 gang members, standing on any sidewalk or in any park, coffee shop, bar, or other location open to the public, whether publicly or privately owned.  Chicago Municipal Code §84015(c)(5) (1992).

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				To be sure, there is no violation of the ordinance unless a person fails to obey promptly the order to disperse.  But, a police officer cannot issue a dispersal order until he decides that a person is remaining in one place with no apparent purpose, and the ordinance provides no guidance to the officer on how to make this antecedent decision.  Moreover, the requirement that police issue dispersal orders only when they reasonably believ[e] that a group of loiterers includes a gang member fails to cure the ordinances vague aspects.  If the ordinance applied only to persons reasonably believed to be gang members, this requirement might have cured the ordinances vagueness because it would have directed the manner in which the order was issued by specifying to whom the order could be issued.  Cf. 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 1819.  But, the Illinois Supreme Court did not construe the ordinance to be so limited.  See 177 Ill. 2d, at 453454, 687 N. E. 2d, at 62.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				This vagueness consideration alone provides a sufficient ground for affirming the Illinois courts decision, and I agree with Part V of the Courts opinion, which discusses this consideration.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 18 ([T]hat the ordinance does not permit an arrest until after a dispersal order has been disobeyed does not provide any guidance to the officer deciding whether such an order should issue); 
				<em>
					ante, 
				</em>
				at 1819 (It is true … that the requirement that the officer reasonably believe that a group of loiterers contains a gang member does place a limit on the authority to order dispersal.  That limitation would no doubt be sufficient if the ordinance only applied to loitering that had an apparently harmful purpose or effect, or possibly if it only applied to loitering by persons reasonably believed to be criminal gang members).  Accordingly, there is no need to consider the other issues briefed by the parties and addressed by the plurality.  I express no opinion about them.

				It is important to courts and legislatures alike that we characterize more clearly the narrow scope of todays holding.  As the ordinance comes to this Court, it is unconstitutionally vague.  Nevertheless, there remain open to Chicago reasonable alternatives to combat the very real threat posed by gang intimidation and violence.  For example, the Court properly and expressly distinguishes the ordinance from laws that require loiterers to have a harmful purpose, see 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 18
				<em>
					,
				</em>
				 from laws that target only gang members, see 
				<em>
					ibid.
				</em>
				, and from laws that incorporate limits on the area and manner in which the laws may be enforced, see 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 19.  In addition, the ordinance here is unlike a law that directly prohibit[s] the  presence of a large collection of obviously brazen, insistent, and lawless gang members and hangers-on on the public ways,  that  intimidates residents.   
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 7 (quoting Brief for Petitioner 14).  Indeed, as the plurality notes, the city of Chicago has several laws that do exactly this.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 78, n. 17.  Chicago has even enacted a provision that enables police officers to fulfill … their traditional functions, including preserving the public peace.  See 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, at 10 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Thomas, J., 
				</span>
				dissenting).  Specifically, Chicagos general disorderly conduct provision allows the police to arrest those who knowingly provoke, make or aid in making a breach of peace.  See Chicago Municipal Code §84010 (1992).

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In my view, the gang loitering ordinance could have been construed more narrowly.  The term loiter might possibly be construed in a more limited fashion to mean to remain in any one place with no apparent purpose other than to establish control over identifiable areas, to intimidate others from entering those areas, or to conceal illegal activities.  Such a definition would be consistent with the Chicago City Councils findings and would avoid the vagueness problems of the ordinance as construed by the Illinois Supreme Court.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 60a61a.  As noted above, so would limitations that restricted the ordinances criminal penalties to gang members or that more carefully delineated the circumstances in which those penalties would apply to nongang members.

				In my view, the gang loitering ordinance could have been construed more narrowly.  The term loiter might possibly be construed in a more limited fashion to mean to remain in any one place with no apparent purpose other than to establish control over identifiable areas, to intimidate others from entering those areas, or to conceal illegal activities.  Such a definition would be consistent with the Chicago City Councils findings and would avoid the vagueness problems of the ordinance as construed by the Illinois Supreme Court.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 60a61a.

				 purpose.  Indeed, because any person standing on the street has a general purposeeven if it is simply to standthe ordinance permits police officers to choose which purposes are

The term loiter might possibly be construed in a more limited fashion to mean to remain in any one place with no apparent purpose other than to establish control over identifiable areas, to intimidate others from entering those areas, or to conceal illegal activities.  Such a definition would be consistent with the Chicago City Councils findings and would avoid the vagueness problems of the ordinance as construed by the Illinois Supreme Court.

				As it has been construed by the Illinois court, Chicagos gang loitering ordinance is unconstitutionally vague because it lacks sufficient minimal standards to guide law enforcement officers.  In particular, it fails to provide police with any standard by which they can judge whether an individual has an 
				<em>
					apparent
				</em>
				 purpose.  Indeed, because any person standing on the street has a general purposeeven if it is simply to standthe ordinance permits police officers to choose which purposes are 
				<em>
					permissible
				</em>
				.  Under this construction the police do not have to decide that an individual is threaten[ing] the public peace to issue a dispersal order.  See 
				<em>
					post,
				</em>
				 at 11 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Thomas, J., 
				</span>
				dissenting)
				<em>
					.
				</em>
				  Any police officer in Chicago is free, under the Illinois Supreme Courts construction of the ordinance, to order at his whim any person standing in a public place with a suspected gang member to disperse.  Further, as construed by the Illinois court, the ordinance applies to hundreds of thousands of persons who are 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 gang members, standing on any sidewalk or in any park, coffee shop, bar, or other location open to the public, whether publicly or privately owned.  Chicago Municipal Code §84015(c)(5) (1992).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				To be sure, there is no violation of the ordinance unless a person fails to obey promptly the order to disperse.  But, a police officer cannot issue a dispersal order until he decides that a person is remaining in one place with no apparent purpose, and the ordinance provides no guidance to the officer on how to make this antecedent decision.  Moreover, the requirement that police issue dispersal orders only when they reasonably believ[e] that a group of loiterers includes a gang member fails to cure the ordinances vague aspects.  If the ordinance applied only to persons reasonably believed to be gang members, this requirement might have cured the ordinances vagueness because it would have directed the manner in which the order was issued by specifying to whom the order could be issued.  Cf. 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 1819.  But, the Illinois Supreme Court did not construe the ordinance to be so limited.  See 177 Ill. 2d, at 453454, 687 N. E. 2d, at 62.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				This vagueness consideration alone provides a sufficient ground for affirming the Illinois courts decision, and I agree with Part V of the Courts opinion, which discusses this consideration.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 18 ([T]hat the ordinance does not permit an arrest until after a dispersal order has been disobeyed does not provide any guidance to the officer deciding whether such an order should issue);

				As it has been construed by the Illinois court, Chicagos gang loitering ordinance is unconstitutionally vague because it lacks sufficient minimal standards to guide law enforcement officers.  In particular, it fails to provide police with any standard by which they can judge whether an individual has an 
				<em>
					apparent
				</em>
				 purpose.  Indeed, because any person standing on the street has a general purposeeven if it is simply to standthe ordinance permits police officers to choose which purposes are 
				<em>
					permissible
				</em>
				.  Under this construction the police do not have to decide that an individual is threaten[ing] the public peace to issue a dispersal order.  See 
				<em>
					post,
				</em>
				 at 11 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Thomas, J., 
				</span>
				dissenting)
				<em>
					.
				</em>
				  Any police officer in Chicago is free, under the Illinois Supreme Courts construction of the ordinance, to order at his whim any person standing in a public place with a suspected gang member to disperse.  Further, as construed by the Illinois court, the ordinance applies to hundreds of thousands of persons who are 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 gang members, standing on any sidewalk or in any park, coffee shop, bar, or other location open to the public, whether publicly or privately owned.  Chicago Municipal Code §84015(c)(5) (1992).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				To be sure, there is no violation of the ordinance unless a person fails to obey promptly the order to disperse.  But, a police officer cannot issue a dispersal order until he decides that a person is remaining in one place with no apparent purpose, and the ordinance provides no guidance to the officer on how to make this antecedent decision.  Moreover, the requirement that police issue dispersal orders only when they reasonably believ[e] that a group of loiterers includes a gang member fails to cure the ordinances vague aspects.  If the ordinance applied only to persons reasonably believed to be gang members, this requirement might have cured the ordinances vagueness because it would have directed the manner in which the order was issued by specifying to whom the order could be issued.  Cf. 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 1819.  But, the Illinois Supreme Court did not construe the ordinance to be so limited.  See 177 Ill. 2d, at 453454, 687 N. E. 2d, at 62.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				This vagueness consideration alone provides a sufficient ground for affirming the Illinois courts decision, and I agree with Part V of the Courts opinion, which discusses this consideration.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 18 ([T]hat the ordinance does not permit an arrest until after a dispersal order has been disobeyed does not provide any guidance to the officer deciding whether such an order should issue); 
				<em>
					ante, 
				</em>
				at 1819 (It is true … that the requirement that the officer reasonably believe that a group of loiterers contains a gang member does place a limit on the authority to order dispersal.  That limitation would no doubt be sufficient if the ordinance only applied to loitering that had an apparently harmful purpose or effect, or possibly if it only applied to loitering by persons reasonably believed to be criminal gang members).  Accordingly, there is no need to consider the other issues briefed by the parties and addressed by the plurality.  I express no opinion about them.

				It is important to courts and legislatures alike that we characterize more clearly the narrow scope of todays holding.  As the ordinance comes to this Court, it is unconstitutionally vague.  Nevertheless, there remain open to Chicago reasonable alternatives to combat the very real threat posed by gang intimidation and violence.  For example, the Court properly and expressly distinguishes the ordinance from laws that require loiterers to have a harmful purpose, see 
				<em>

					,
				</em>

				I agree with the Court that Chicagos Gang Congregation Ordinance, Chicago Municipal Code §84015 (1992) (gang loitering ordinance or ordinance) is unconstitutionally vague.  A penal law is void for vagueness if it fails to define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited or fails to establish guidelines to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement of the law.

				As it has been construed by the Illinois court, Chicagos gang loitering ordinance is unconstitutionally vague because it lacks sufficient minimal standards to guide law enforcement officers.  In particular, it fails to provide police with any standard by which they can judge whether an individual has an 
				<em>
					apparent
				</em>
				 purpose.  Indeed, because any person standing on the street has a general purposeeven if it is simply to standthe ordinance permits police officers to choose which purposes are 
				<em>
					permissible
				</em>
				.  Under this construction the police do not have to decide that an individual is threaten[ing] the public peace to issue a dispersal order.  See 
				<em>
					post,
				</em>
				 at 11 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Thomas, J., 
				</span>
				dissenting)
				<em>
					.
				</em>
				  Any police officer in Chicago is free, under the Illinois Supreme Courts construction of the ordinance, to order at his whim any person standing in a public place with a suspected gang member to disperse.  Further, as construed by the Illinois court, the ordinance applies to hundreds of thousands of persons who are 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 gang members, standing on any sidewalk or in any park, coffee shop, bar, or other location open to the public, whether publicly or privately owned.  Chicago Municipal Code §84015(c)(5) (1992).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				To be sure, there is no violation of the ordinance unless a person fails to obey promptly the order to disperse.  But, a police officer cannot issue a dispersal order until he decides that a person is remaining in one place with no apparent purpose, and the ordinance provides no guidance to the officer on how to make this antecedent decision.  Moreover, the requirement that police issue dispersal orders only when they reasonably believ[e] that a group of loiterers includes a gang member fails to cure the ordinances vague aspects.  If the ordinance applied only to persons reasonably believed to be gang members, this requirement might have cured the ordinances vagueness because it would have directed the manner in which the order was issued by specifying to whom the order could be issued.  Cf. 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 1819.  But, the Illinois Supreme Court did not construe the ordinance to be so limited.  See 177 Ill. 2d, at 453454, 687 N. E. 2d, at 62.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				This vagueness consideration alone provides a sufficient ground for affirming the Illinois courts decision, and I agree with Part V of the Courts opinion, which discusses this consideration.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 18 ([T]hat the ordinance does not permit an arrest until after a dispersal order has been disobeyed does not provide any guidance to the officer deciding whether such an order should issue); 
				<em>
					ante, 
				</em>
				at 1819 (It is true … that the requirement that the officer reasonably believe that a group of loiterers contains a gang member does place a limit on the authority to order dispersal.  That limitation would no doubt be sufficient if the ordinance only applied to loitering that had an apparently harmful purpose or effect, or possibly if it only applied to loitering by persons reasonably believed to be criminal gang members).  Accordingly, there is no need to consider the other issues briefed by the parties and addressed by the plurality.  I express no opinion about them.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It is important to courts and legislatures alike that we characterize more clearly the narrow scope of todays holding.  As the ordinance comes to this Court, it is unconstitutionally vague.  Nevertheless, there remain open to Chicago reasonable alternatives to combat the very real threat posed by gang intimidation and violence.  For example, the Court properly and expressly distinguishes the ordinance from laws that require loiterers to have a harmful purpose, see 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 18
				<em>
					,
				</em>
				 from laws that target only gang members, see 
				<em>
					ibid.
				</em>
				, and from laws that incorporate limits on the area and manner in which the laws may be enforced, see 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 19.  In addition, the ordinance here is unlike a law that directly prohibit[s] the  presence of a large collection of obviously brazen, insistent, and lawless gang members and hangers-on on the public ways,  that  intimidates residents.   
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 7 (quoting Brief for Petitioner 14).  Indeed, as the plurality notes, the city of Chicago has several laws that do exactly this.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 78, n. 17.  Chicago has even enacted a provision that enables police officers to fulfill … their traditional functions, including preserving the public peace.  See 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, at 10 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Thomas, J., 
				</span>
				dissenting).  Specifically, Chicagos general disorderly conduct provision allows the police to arrest those who knowingly provoke, make or aid in making a breach of peace.  See Chicago Municipal Code §84010 (1992).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In my view, the gang loitering ordinance could have been construed more narrowly.  The term loiter might possibly be construed in a more limited fashion to mean to remain in any one place with no apparent purpose other than to establish control over identifiable areas, to intimidate others from entering those areas, or to conceal illegal activities.  Such a definition would be consistent with the Chicago City Councils findings and would avoid the vagueness problems of the ordinance as construed by the Illinois Supreme Court.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 60a61a.  As noted above, so would limitations that restricted the ordinances criminal penalties to gang members or that more carefully delineated the circumstances in which those penalties would apply to nongang members.

				I agree with the Court that Chicagos Gang Congregation Ordinance, Chicago Municipal Code §84015 (1992) (gang loitering ordinance or ordinance) is unconstitutionally vague.  A penal law is void for vagueness if it fails to define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited or fails to establish guidelines to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement of the law.

				As it has been construed by the Illinois court, Chicagos gang loitering ordinance is unconstitutionally vague because it lacks sufficient minimal standards to guide law enforcement officers.  In particular, it fails to provide police with any standard by which they can judge whether an individual has an 
				<em>
					apparent
				</em>
				 purpose.  Indeed, because any person standing on the street has a general purposeeven if it is simply to standthe ordinance permits police officers to choose which purposes are 
				<em>
					permissible
				</em>
				.  Under this construction the police do not have to decide that an individual is threaten[ing] the public peace to issue a dispersal order.  See 
				<em>
					post,
				</em>
				 at 11 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Thomas, J., 
				</span>
				dissenting)
				<em>
					.
				</em>
				  Any police officer in Chicago is free, under the Illinois Supreme Courts construction of the ordinance, to order at his whim any person standing in a public place with a suspected gang member to disperse.  Further, as construed by the Illinois court, the ordinance applies to hundreds of thousands of persons who are 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 gang members, standing on any sidewalk or in any park, coffee shop, bar, or other location open to the public, whether publicly or privately owned.  Chicago Municipal Code §84015(c)(5) (1992).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				To be sure, there is no violation of the ordinance unless a person fails to obey promptly the order to disperse.  But, a police officer cannot issue a dispersal order until he decides that a person is remaining in one place with no apparent purpose, and the ordinance provides no guidance to the officer on how to make this antecedent decision.  Moreover, the requirement that police issue dispersal orders only when they reasonably believ[e] that a group of loiterers includes a gang member fails to cure the ordinances vague aspects.  If the ordinance applied only to persons reasonably believed to be gang members, this requirement might have cured the ordinances vagueness because it would have directed the manner in which the order was issued by specifying to whom the order could be issued.  Cf. 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 1819.  But, the Illinois Supreme Court did not construe the ordinance to be so limited.  See 177 Ill. 2d, at 453454, 687 N. E. 2d, at 62.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				This vagueness consideration alone provides a sufficient ground for affirming the Illinois courts decision, and I agree with Part V of the Courts opinion, which discusses this consideration.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 18 ([T]hat the ordinance does not permit an arrest until after a dispersal order has been disobeyed does not provide any guidance to the officer deciding whether such an order should issue); 
				<em>
					ante, 
				</em>
				at 1819 (It is true … that the requirement that the officer reasonably believe that a group of loiterers contains a gang member does place a limit on the authority to order dispersal.  That limitation would no doubt be sufficient if the ordinance only applied to loitering that had an apparently harmful purpose or effect, or possibly if it only applied to loitering by persons reasonably believed to be criminal gang members).  Accordingly, there is no need to consider the other issues briefed by the parties and addressed by the plurality.  I express no opinion about them.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It is important to courts and legislatures alike that we characterize more clearly the narrow scope of todays holding.  As the ordinance comes to this Court, it is unconstitutionally vague.  Nevertheless, there remain open to Chicago reasonable alternatives to combat the very real threat posed by gang intimidation and violence.  For example, the Court properly and expressly distinguishes the ordinance from laws that require loiterers to have a harmful purpose, see 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 18
				<em>
					,
				</em>
				 from laws that target only gang members, see 
				<em>
					ibid.
				</em>
				, and from laws that incorporate limits on the area and manner in which the laws may be enforced, see 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 19.  In addition, the ordinance here is unlike a law that directly prohibit[s] the  presence of a large collection of obviously brazen, insistent, and lawless gang members and hangers-on on the public ways,  that  intimidates residents.   
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 7 (quoting Brief for Petitioner 14).  Indeed, as the plurality notes, the city of Chicago has several laws that do exactly this.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 78, n. 17.  Chicago has even enacted a provision that enables police officers to fulfill … their traditional functions, including preserving the public peace.  See 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, at 10 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Thomas, J., 
				</span>
				dissenting).  Specifically, Chicagos general disorderly conduct provision allows the police to arrest those who knowingly provoke, make or aid in making a breach of peace.  See Chicago Municipal Code §84010 (1992).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In my view, the gang loitering ordinance could have been construed more narrowly.  The term loiter might possibly be construed in a more limited fashion to mean to remain in any one place with no apparent purpose other than to establish control over identifiable areas, to intimidate others from entering those areas, or to conceal illegal activities.  Such a definition would be consistent with the Chicago City Councils findings and would avoid the vagueness problems of the ordinance as construed by the Illinois Supreme Court.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 60a61a.  As noted above, so would limitations that restricted the ordinances criminal penalties to gang members or that more carefully delineated the circumstances in which those penalties would apply to nongang members.

				The Illinois Supreme Court did not choose to give a limiting construction to Chicagos ordinance.  To the extent it relied on our precedents, particularly 
				<em>

				 v. 
				<em>

				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/405/156" class="subref" title="subref">405 U. S. 156</a> (1972)
, as 
				<em>
					requiring
				</em>
				 it to hold the ordinance vague in all of its applications because it was intentionally drafted in a vague manner, the Illinois court misapplied our precedents.  See 177 Ill. 2d, at 458459, 687 N. E. 2d, at 64.  This Court has never held that the intent of the drafters determines whether a law is vague.  Nevertheless, we cannot impose a limiting construction that a state supreme court has declined to adopt.  See 
				<em>
					Kolender
				</em>
				, 461 U. S., at 355356, n. 4 (noting that the Court has held that  [f]or the purpose of determining whether a state statute is too vague and indefinite to constitute valid legislation we must take the statute as though it read precisely as the highest court of the State has interpreted it  (citations and internal quotation marks omitted));

 (noting that where the Court is dealing with a state statute on direct review of a state-court decision that has construed the statute[,] [s]uch a construction is binding on us).  Accordingly, I join Parts I, II, and V of the Courts opinion and concur in the judgment.

				The citizens of Chicago were once free to drive about the city at whatever speed they wished.  At some point Chicagoans (or perhaps Illinoisans) decided this would not do, and imposed prophylactic speed limits designed to assure safe operation by the average (or perhaps even subaverage) driver with the average (or perhaps even subaverage) vehicle.  This infringed upon the freedom of all citizens, but was not unconstitutional.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Similarly, the citizens of Chicago were once free to stand around and gawk at the scene of an accident.  At some point Chicagoans discovered that this obstructed traffic and caused more accidents.  They did not make the practice unlawful, but they did authorize police officers to order the crowd to disperse, and imposed penalties for refusal to obey such an order.  Again, this prophylactic measure infringed upon the freedom of all citizens, but was not unconstitutional.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Until the ordinance that is before us today was adopted, the citizens of Chicago were free to stand about in public places with no apparent purposeto engage, that is, in conduct that appeared to be loitering.  In recent years, however, the city has been afflicted with criminal street gangs.  As reflected in the record before us, these gangs congregated in public places to deal in drugs, and to terrorize the neighborhoods by demonstrating control over their turf.  Many residents of the inner city felt that they were prisoners in their own homes.  Once again, Chicagoans decided that to eliminate the problem it was worth restricting some of the freedom that they once enjoyed.  The means they took was similar to the second, and more mild, example given above rather than the first: Loitering was not made unlawful, but when a group of people occupied a public place without an apparent purpose and in the company of a known gang member, police officers were authorized to order them to disperse, and the failure to obey such an order was made unlawful.  See Chicago Municipal Code §84015 (1992).  The minor limitation upon the free state of nature that this prophylactic arrangement imposed upon all Chicagoans seemed to them (and it seems to me) a small price to pay for liberation of their streets.

				The majority today invalidates this perfectly reasonable measure by ignoring our rules governing facial challenges, by elevating loitering to a constitutionally guaranteed right, and by discerning vagueness where, according to our usual standards, none exists.

But if he directly attacks a general principle without having a particular case in view, he leaves the circle in which all nations have agreed to confine his authority; he assumes a more important, and perhaps a more useful influence, than that of the magistrate; but he ceases to represent the judicial power.

Those to whom it is prejudicial learn that means exist of overcoming its authority; and similar suits are multiplied, until it becomes powerless. … The political power which the Americans have entrusted to their courts of justice is therefore immense; but the evils of this power are considerably diminished by the impossibility of attacking the laws except through the courts of justice. …  [W]hen a judge contests a law in an obscure debate on some particular case, the importance of his attack is concealed from public notice; his decision bears upon the interest of an individual, and the law is slighted only incidentally.

In the exercise of that jurisdiction, it is bound by two rules, to which it has rigidly adhered, one, never to anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it; the other never to formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied. . . .

				I am aware, of course, that in some recent facial-challenge cases the Court has, without any attempt at explanation, created entirely irrational exceptions to the unconstitutional in every conceivable application rule, when the statutes at issue concerned hot-button social issues on which informed opinion was zealously united.

				When our normal criteria for facial challenges are applied, it is clear that the Justices in the majority have transposed the burden of proof.  Instead of requiring the respondents, who are challenging the Ordinance, to show that it is invalid in all its applications, they have required the petitioner to show that it is valid in all its applications.  Both the plurality opinion and the concurrences display a lively imagination, creating hypothetical situations in which the laws application would (in their view) be ambiguous.  But that creative role has been usurped from the petitioner, who can defeat the respondents facial challenge by conjuring up 
				<em>
					a single valid application
				</em>
				 of the law.  My contribution would go something like this

				: Tony, a member of the Jets criminal street gang, is standing alongside and chatting with fellow gang members while staking out their turf at Promontory Point on the South Side of Chicago; the group is flashing gang signs and displaying their distinctive tattoos to passersby.  Officer Krupke, applying the Ordinance at issue here, orders the group to disperse.  After some speculative discussion (probably irrelevant here) over whether the Jets are depraved because they are deprived, Tony and the other gang members break off further conversation with the statementnot entirely coherent, but evidently intended to be rudeGee, Officer Krupke, krup you.  A tense standoff ensues until Officer Krupke arrests the group for failing to obey his dispersal order.  Even assuming (as the Justices in the majority do, but I do not) that a law requiring obedience to a dispersal order is impermissibly vague unless it is clear to the objects of the order, before its issuance, that their conduct justifies it, I find it hard to believe that the Jets would not have known they had it coming.  That should settle the matter of respondents facial challenge to the Ordinances vagueness.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Of course respondents would still be able to claim that the Ordinance was vague as applied to them.  But the ultimate demonstration of the inappropriateness of the Courts holding of 
				<em>
					facial 
				</em>
				invalidity is the fact that it is doubtful whether some of these respondents could even sustain an 
				<em>
					as-applied 
				</em>
				challenge on the basis of the majoritys own criteria.  For instance, respondent Jose Renteriawho admitted that he was a member of the Satan Disciples gangwas observed by the arresting officer loitering on a street corner with other gang members.  The officer issued a dispersal order, but when she returned to the same corner 15 to 20 minutes later, Renteria was still there with his friends, whereupon he was arrested.  In another example, respondent Daniel Washington and several otherswho admitted they were members of the Vice Lords gangwere observed by the arresting officer loitering in the street, yelling at passing vehicles, stopping traffic, and preventing pedestrians from using the sidewalks.  The arresting officer issued a dispersal order, issued 
				<em>
					another
				</em>
				 dispersal order later when the group did not move, and finally arrested the group when they were found loitering in the same place still later.  Finally, respondent Gregorio Gutierrezwho had previously admitted to the arresting officer his membership in the Latin Kings gangwas observed loitering with two other men.  The officer issued a dispersal order, drove around the block, and arrested the men after finding them in the same place upon his return.  See Brief for Petitioner 7, n. 5; Brief for United States as 
				<em>
					Amicus Curiae
				</em>
				 16, n. 11.  Even on the majoritys assumption that to avoid vagueness it must be clear to the object of the dispersal order 
				<em>
					ex ante
				</em>
				 that his conduct is covered by the Ordinance, it seems most improbable that any of these as-applied challenges would be sustained.  Much less is it possible to say that the Ordinance is invalid in 
				<em>
					all 
				</em>
				its applications.

				The plurality's explanation for its departure from the usual rule governing facial challenges is seemingly contained in the following statement: [This] is a criminal law that contains no 
				<em>
					mens rea
				</em>
				 requirement … 
				<em>
					and
				</em>
				 infringes on constitutionally protected rights … .  When vagueness permeates the text of

				<em>
					mens rea 
				</em>
				requirement)   (infringement of constitutionally protected right)   (vagueness) = (entitlement to facial invalidation).  There is no such formula; the plurality has made it up for this case, as the absence of any citation demonstrates.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				But no matter.  None of the three factors that the plurality relies upon exists anyway.  I turn first to the support for the proposition that there is a constitutionally protected right to loiteror, as the plurality more favorably describes it, for a person to remain in a public place of his choice.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  The plurality thinks much of this Fundamental Freedom to Loiter, which it contrasts with such lesser, constitutionally 
				<em>
					un
				</em>
				protected, activities as doing (ugh!) 
				<em>
					business
				</em>
				: This is not an ordinance that simply regulates business behavior and contains a scienter requirement. . . . It is a criminal law that contains no 
				<em>
					mens rea
				</em>
				 requirement . . . and infringes on constitutionally protected rights.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				 (internal quotation marks omitted). (Poor Alexander Hamilton, who has seen his commercial republic devolve, in the eyes of the plurality, at least, into an indolent republic, see The Federalist No. 6, p. 56; No. 11, pp. 8491 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961).)
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Of course every activity, even scratching ones head, can be called a constitutional right if one means by that term nothing more than the fact that the activity is covered (as all are) by the Equal Protection Clause, so that those who engage in it cannot be singled out without rational basis.  See

The entire practice of using the Due Process Clause to add judicially favored rights to the limitations upon democracy set forth in the Bill of Rights (usually under the rubric of so-called substantive due process) is in my view judicial usurpation.

				It would be unfair, however, to criticize the pluralitys failed attempt to establish that loitering is a constitutionally protected right while saying nothing of the concurrences.  The plurality at least makes an attempt.  The concurrences, on the other hand, make no pretense at attaching their broad vagueness invalidates rule to a liberty interest.  As far as appears from 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Oconnor
				</span>
				s and 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Breyer
				</span>
				s opinions, 
				<em>
					no
				</em>
				 police officer may issue 
				<em>
					any
				</em>
				 order, affecting 
				<em>
					any
				</em>
				 insignificant sort of citizen conduct (except, perhaps, an order addressed to the unprotected class of gang members) unless the standards for the issuance of that order are precise.  No mod-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				ern urban societyand probably none since London got big enough to have sewerscould function under such a rule.  There are innumerable reasons why it may be im-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				portant for a constable to tell a pedestrian to move onand even if it were possible to list in an ordinance all of the reasons that are known, many are simply unpredictable.  Hence the (entirely reasonable) Rule of the City of New York which reads: No person shall fail, neglect or refuse to comply with the lawful direction or command of any Police Officer, Urban Park Ranger, Parks Enforcement Patrol Officer or other [Parks and Recreation] Department employee, indicated by gesture or otherwise.  56 RCNY §103(c)(1) (1996).  It is one thing to uphold an as applied challenge when a pedestrian disobeys such an order that is unreasonableor even when a pedestrian asserting some true liberty interest (holding a political rally, for instance) disobeys such an order that is reasonable 
				<em>
					but unexplained
				</em>
				.  But to say that such a general ordinance permitting lawful orders is void 
				<em>
					in all its applications
				</em>
				 demands more than a safe and orderly society can reasonably deliver.

        <p class="bodytext">
            <span class="smallcaps">

				 apparently recognizes this, since he acknowledges that some police commands will subject a citizen to prosecution for disobeying whether or not the citizen knows why the order is given, including, for example, an order tell[ing] a pedestrian not to enter a building when the reason is to avoid impeding a rescue team.

But his only explanation of why the present interference with the right to loiter does not fall within that permitted scope of action is as follows: The predicate of an order to disperse is not, in my view, sufficient to eliminate doubts regarding the adequacy of notice under this ordinance.  
				<em>

				I turn next to that element of the plurality's facial-challenge formula which consists of the proposition that this criminal ordinance contains no 
				<em>
					mens rea 
				</em>
				requirement.  The first step in analyzing this proposition is to determine what the 
				<em>
					actus reus
				</em>
				, to which that 
				<em>
					mens rea
				</em>
				 is supposed to be attached, consists of.  The majority believes that loitering forms part of (indeed, the essence of) the offense, and must be proved if conviction is to be obtained.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 2, 6, 913, 1415, 1618 (plurality and majority opinions); 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 23, 4 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					OConnor, J.
				</span>
				, concurring in part and concurring in judgment); 
				<em>

				, at 12 (

				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 34 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Breyer, J
				</span>
				., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  That is not what the Ordinance provides.  The only part of the Ordinance that refers to loitering is the portion that addresses, not the punishable conduct of the defendant, but what the police officer must observe before he can issue an order to disperse; and what he must observe is carefully defined in terms of what the defendant 
				<em>
					appears
				</em>
				 to be doing, not in terms of what the defendant is 
				<em>
					actually
				</em>
				 doing.  The Ordinance does not require that the defendant have been loitering (
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, have been remaining in one place with no purpose), but rather that the police officer have observed him remaining in one place without any 
				<em>
					apparent
				</em>
				 purpose.  Someone who in fact 
				<em>
					has
				</em>
				 a genuine purpose for remaining where he is (waiting for a friend, for example, or waiting to hold up a bank) 
				<em>
					can
				</em>
				 be ordered to move on (assuming the other conditions of the Ordinance are met), so long as his remaining has no 
				<em>
					apparent
				</em>
				 purpose.  It is likely, to be sure, that the Ordinance will come down most heavily upon those who are 
				<em>
					actually 
				</em>
				loitering (those who 
				<em>
					really
				</em>
				 have no purpose in remaining where they are); but that activity is not a condition for issuance of the dispersal order.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The 
				<em>
					only
				</em>
				 act of a defendant that is made punishable by the Ordinanceor, indeed, that is even mentioned by the Ordinanceis his failure to promptly obey an order to disperse.  The question, then, is whether that 
				<em>
					actus reus
				</em>
				 must be accompanied by any wrongful intentand of course it must.  As the Court itself describes the requirement, a person must 
				<em>
					disobey
				</em>
				 the officers order.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 3 (emphasis added).  No one thinks a defendant could be successfully prosecuted under the Ordinance if he did not hear the order to disperse, or if he suffered a paralysis that rendered his compliance impossible.  The willful failure to obey a police order is wrongful intent enough.

A law is unconstitutionally vague if its lack of definitive standards either (1) fails to apprise persons of ordinary intelligence of the prohibited conduct, or (2) encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.  See,

				The plurality relies primarily upon the first of these aspects.  Since, it reasons, the loitering is the conduct that the ordinance is designed to prohibit, and an officer may issue an order only after prohibited conduct has already occurred, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 14, 15, the order to disperse cannot itself serve to apprise persons of ordinary intelligence of the prohibited conduct.  What counts for purposes of vagueness analysis, however, is not what the Ordinance is designed to prohibit, but what it actually subjects to criminal penalty.  As discussed earlier, that consists of nothing but the refusal to obey a dispersal order, as to which there is no doubt of adequate notice of the prohibited conduct.  The plurality's suggestion that even the dispersal order 
				<em>
					itself
				</em>
				 is unconstitutionally vague, because it does not specify 
				<em>
					how far to disperse (!)
				</em>
				, see 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 15, scarcely requires a response.

				  If it were true, it would render unconstitutional for vagueness many of the Presidential proclamations issued under that provision of the United States Code which requires the President, before using the militia or the Armed Forces for law enforcement, to issue a proclamation ordering the insurgents to disperse.

				For its determination of unconstitutional vagueness, the Court relies secondarilyand 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice OConnor
				</span>
				s and 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Breyer
				</span>
				s concurrences exclusivelyupon the second aspect of that doctrine, which requires sufficient specificity to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory law enforcement.  See

				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 3 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Breyer, J
				</span>
				., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  In discussing whether Chicagos Ordinance meets that requirement, the Justices in the majority hide behind an artificial construct of judicial restraint.  They point to the Supreme Court of Illinois statement that the apparent purpose standard provides absolute discretion to police officers to decide what activities constitute loitering, 687 N. E. 2d 53, 63 (1997), and protest that it would be wrong to construe the language of the Ordinance more narrowly than did the States highest court.  
				<em>

				, at 17, 19 (majority opinion); 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 45 (
				<span class="smallcaps">

				 concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  The absolute discretion statement, however, is nothing more than the Illinois Supreme Courts 
				<em>
					characterization
				</em>
				 of what the language achievedafter that court refused (as I do) to read in any limitations that the words do not fairly contain.  It is not a construction of the language (to which we are bound) but a legal conclusion (to which we most assuredly are not bound).

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The criteria for issuance of a dispersal order under the Chicago Ordinance could hardly be clearer.  First, the law requires police officers to reasonably believ[e] that one of the group to which the order is issued is a criminal street gang member.  This resembles a probable-cause standard, and the Chicago Police Departments General Order 924 (1992)promulgated to govern enforcement of the Ordinancemakes the probable cause requirement explicit.

                </sup>
            </a>
				  Under the Order, officers must have probable cause to believe that an individual is a member of a criminal street gang, to be substantiated by the officers experience and knowledge of the alleged offenders and by specific, documented and reliable information such as reliable witness testimony or an individuals admission of gang membership or display of distinctive colors, tattoos, signs, or other markings worn by members of particular criminal street gangs.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 67a69a, 71a72a.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, the Ordinance requires that the group be remain[ing] in one place with no apparent purpose.  
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice OConnor
				</span>
				s assertion that this applies to any person standing in a public place, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 2, is a distortion.  The Ordinance does not apply to standing, but to remain[ing]a term which in this context obviously means [to] endure or persist, see American Heritage Dictionary 1525 (1992).  There may be some ambiguity at the margin, but remain[ing] in one place requires more than a temporary stop, and is clear in most of its applications, including all of those represented by the facts surrounding the respondents arrests described 
				<em>
					supra, 
				</em>
				at 12.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				As for the phrase with no apparent purpose: 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice OConnor
				</span>
				 again distorts this adjectival phrase, by separating it from the word that it modifies.  [A]ny person standing on the street, her concurrence says, has a general purposeeven if it is simply to stand, and thus the ordinance permits police officers to choose which purposes are 
				<em>
					permissible
				</em>
				.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 2.  But Chicago police officers enforcing the Ordinance are not looking for people with no apparent purpose (who are regrettably in oversupply); they are looking for people who remain in any one place with no apparent purposethat is, who remain there without any apparent reason 
				<em>
					for remaining there
				</em>
				.  That is not difficult to perceive.

				The Courts attempt to demonstrate the vagueness of the Ordinance produces the following peculiar statement: The no apparent purpose standard for making [the decision to issue an order to disperse] is inherently subjective because its application depends on whether some purpose is apparent to the officer on the scene.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 18.  In the Courts view, a persons lack of any purpose in staying in one location is presumably an 
				<em>
					objective
				</em>
				 factor, and what the Ordinance requires as a condition of an order to dispersethe absence of any 
				<em>
					apparent
				</em>
				 purposeis a 
				<em>
					subjective
				</em>
				 factor.  This side of the looking glass, just the opposite is true.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Elsewhere, of course, the Court acknowledges the clear, objective commands of the Ordinance, and indeed relies upon them to paint it as unfair:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				By its very terms, the ordinance encompasses a great deal of harmless behavior.  In any public place in the city of Chicago, persons who stand or sit in the company of a gang member may be ordered to disperse unless their purpose is apparent.  The mandatory language in the enactment directs the police to issue an order without first making any inquiry about their possible purposes.  It matters not whether the reason that a gang member and his father, for example, might loiter near Wrigley Field is to rob an unsuspecting fan or just to get a glimpse of Sammy Sosa leaving the ballpark; in either event, if their purpose is not apparent to a nearby police officer, she mayindeed, she shallorder them to disperse.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				16.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
Quite so.  And the fact that this clear instruction to the officers encompasses a great deal of harmless behavior would be invalidating if that harmless behavior were constitutionally protected against abridgment, such as speech or the practice of religion.  Remaining in one place is 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 so protected, and so (as already discussed) it is up to the citizens of Chicagonot usto decide whether the trade-off is worth it.  
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court also assertsin apparent contradiction to the passage just quotedthat the apparent purpose test is too elastic because it presumably allows police officers to treat 
				<em>
					de minimis
				</em>
				 violations as not warranting enforcement.

The problem, of course, well recognized by Chicagos City Council, is that the gang members cease their intimidating and unlawful behavior under the watchful eye of police officers, but return to it as soon as the police drive away.  The only solution, the council concluded, was to clear the streets of congregations of gangs, their drug customers, and their associates.

				<em>
					similar
				</em>
				 to this ordinance that 
				<em>

				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 78, n. 17 (plurality opinion) (citing extant laws against intimidation, streetgang criminal drug conspiracy, and mob action).  The problem, again, is that the intimidation and lawlessness do not occur when the police are in sight.

				<em>
					Ante

				, at 3 (the Court agrees that this might be a cure, see 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1819).  But the Ordinance already specifies to whom the order can be issued: persons remaining in one place with no apparent purpose in the company of a gang member.  And if remain[ing] in one place with no apparent purpose is so vague as to give the police unbridled discretion in controlling the conduct of non-gang-members, it surpasses understanding how it ceases to be so vague when applied to gang members 
				<em>

				The fact is that the present ordinance is entirely clear in its application, cannot be violated except with full knowledge and intent, and vests no more discretion in the police than innumerable other measures authorizing police orders to preserve the public peace and safety.  As suggested by their tortured analyses, and by their suggested solutions that bear no relation to the identified constitutional problem, the majoritys real quarrel with the Chicago Ordinance is simply that it permits (or indeed requires) too much harmless conduct by innocent citizens to be proscribed.  As 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice OConnor
				</span>
				s concurrence says with disapprobation, the ordinance applies to hundreds of thousands of persons who are 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 gang members, standing on any sidewalk or in any park, coffee shop, bar, or other location open to the public.  
				<em>

				, at 23 (internal quotation marks omitted).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				But in our democratic system, how much harmless conduct to proscribe is not a judgment to be made by the courts.  So long as constitutionally guaranteed rights are not affected, and so long as the proscription has a rational basis, 
				<em>
					all sorts
				</em>
				 of perfectly harmless activity by millions of perfectly innocent people can be forbiddenriding a motorcycle without a safety helmet, for example, starting a campfire in a national forest, or selling a safe and effective drug not yet approved by the FDA.  All of these acts are entirely innocent and harmless in themselves, but because of the 
				<em>
					risk
				</em>
				 of harm that they entail, the freedom to engage in them has been abridged.  The citizens of Chicago have decided that depriving themselves of the freedom to hang out with a gang member is necessary to eliminate pervasive gang crime and intimidationand that the elimination of the one is worth the deprivation of the other.  This Court has no business second-guessing either the degree of necessity or the fairness of the trade.

						 In other words, a facial attack, since it requires unconstitutionality in all circumstances, necessarily presumes that the litigant presently before the court would be able to sustain an as-applied challenge.  See Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc.,

The plurality asserts that in United States v. Salerno, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/481/739" class="subref" title="subref">481 U. S. 739</a> (1987)
, which I discuss in text immediately following this footnote, the Court entertained a facial challenge even though the defendants . . . did not claim that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to them.  Ante, at 11, n. 22.  That is not so.  The Court made it absolutely clear in Salerno that a facial challenge requires the assertion that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid, 481 U. S., at 745 (emphasis added).  The footnoted statement upon which the plurality relies (Nor have respondents claimed that the Act is unconstitutional because of the way it was applied to the particular facts of their case, id., at 745, n. 3) was obviously meant to convey the fact that the defendants were not making, in addition to their facial challenge, an alternative as-applied challengei.e., asserting that even if the statute was not unconstitutional in all its applications it was at least unconstitutional in its particular application to them.

						 Salerno, a criminal case, repudiated the Courts statement in Kolender v. Lawson,

S. 352</a>, n. 8 (1983), to the effect that a facial challenge to a criminal statute could succeed even when [the statute] could conceivably have had some valid application.  Kolender seems to have confused the standard for 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> overbreadth challenges with the standard governing facial challenges on all other grounds.  See ibid. (citing the Courts articulation of the standard for 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> overbreadth challenges from Hoffman Estates, supra, at 494).  As Salerno noted, 481 U. S., at 745, the overbreadth doctrine is a specialized exception to the general rule for facial challenges, justified in light of the risk that an overbroad statute will chill free expression.  See, e.g., Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/413/601" class="subref" title="subref">413 U. S. 601</a>,

						 The plurality asserts that the Salerno standard for facial challenge has never been the decisive factor in any decision of this Court.  It means by that only this: in rejecting a facial challenge, the Court has never contented itself with identifying only one situation in which the challenged statute would be constitutional, but has mentioned several.  But that is not at all remarkable, and casts no doubt upon the validity of the principle that Salerno and these many other cases enunciated.  It is difficult to conceive of a statute that would be constitutional in only a single applicationand hard to resist mentioning more than one.


The plurality contends that it does not matter whether the Salerno standard is federal law, since facial challenge is a species of third-party standing, and federal limitations upon third-party standing do not apply in an appeal from a state decision which takes a broader view, as the Illinois Supreme Courts opinion did here.  Ante, at 11, n. 22.  This is quite wrong.  Disagreement over the Salerno rule is not a disagreement over the standing question of whether the person challenging the statute can raise the rights of third parties: under both Salerno and the plurality's rule he can.  The disagreement relates to how many third-party rights he must prove to be infringed by the statute before he can win: Salerno says all (in addition to his own rights), the plurality says many.  That is not a question of standing but of substantive law.  The notion that, if Salerno is the federal rule (a federal statute is not totally invalid unless it is invalid in all its applications), it can be altered by a state court (a federal statute is totally invalid if it is invalid in many of its applications), and that that alteration must be accepted by the Supreme Court of the United States is, to put it as gently as possible, remarkable.

						 The pluralitys explanation for ignoring these laws is that many of them carried severe penalties and, during the Reconstruction era, they had harsh consequences on African-American women and children.  Ante, at 910, n. 20.  Those severe penalties and those harsh consequences are certainly regrettable, but they in no way lessen (indeed, the harshness of penalty tends to increase) the capacity of these laws to prove that loitering was never regarded as a fundamental liberty.

						 Ante, at 9, n. 19.  The plurality bases its assertion of apparent concession upon a footnote in Part I of petitioners brief which reads: Of course, laws regulating social gatherings affect a liberty interest, and thus are subject to review under the rubric of substantive due process . . . . We address that doctrine in Part II below.  Brief for Petitioner 2122, n. 14.  If a careless reader were inclined to confuse the term social gatherings in this passage with loitering, his confusion would be eliminated by pursuing the reference to Part II of the brief, which says, in its introductory paragraph: [A]s we explain below, substantive due process does not support the courts novel holding that the Constitution secures the right to stand still on the public way even when one is not engaged in speech, assembly, or other conduct that enjoys affirmative constitutional protection.  Id., at 39.

						 The plurality says, ante, at 20, n. 35, that since it decides the case on the basis of procedural due process rather than substantive due process, I am mistaken in analyzing its opinion under the framework for substantive due process set out in Washington v. Glucksberg.  Ibid.  But I am not analyzing it under that framework.  I am simply assuming that when the plurality says (as an essential part of its reasoning) that the right to loiter for innocent purposes is . . . a part of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause it does not believe that the same word (liberty) means one thing for purposes of substantive due process and something else for purposes of procedural due process.  There is no authority for that startling proposition.  See Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth,

 (rejecting procedural-due-process claim for lack of liberty interest, and citing substantive-due-process cases).


The pluralitys opinion seeks to have it both ways, invoking the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>s august protection of liberty in defining the standard of certainty that it sets, but then, in identifying the conduct protected by that high standard, ignoring our extensive case-law defining liberty, and substituting, instead, all harmless and innocent conduct, ante, at 14.

						 I call it a suggestion because the plurality says only that the terms of the dispersal order compound the inadequacy of the notice, and acknowledges that they might not render the ordinance unconstitutionally vague if the definition of the forbidden conduct were clear.  Ante, at 15, 16.  This notion that a prescription (Disperse!) which is itself not unconstitutionally vague can somehow contribute to the unconstitutional vagueness of the entire scheme is full of mysterysuspending, as it does, the metaphysical principle that nothing can confer what it does not possess (nemo dat qui non habet).

						 Justice Breyer asserts that one always has some apparent purpose, so that the policeman must interpret the words no apparent purpose as meaning no apparent purpose except for . . . .  Ante, at 12.  It is simply not true that one always has some apparent purposeand especially not true that one always has some apparent purpose in remaining at rest, for the simple reason that one often (indeed, perhaps usually) has no actual purpose in remaining at rest.  Remaining at rest will be a persons normal state, unless he has a purpose which causes him to move.  That is why one frequently reads of a persons wandering aimlessly (which is worthy of note) but not of a persons sitting aimlessly (which is not remarkable at all).  And that is why a synonym for purpose is motive: that which causes one to move.

						 The Court also speculates that a police officer may exercise his discretion to enforce the Ordinance and direct dispersal when (in the Courts view) the Ordinance is inapplicableviz., where there is an apparent purpose, but it is an unlawful one.  See ante, at 18.  No one in his right mind would read the phrase without any apparent purpose to mean anything other than without any apparent lawful purpose.  The implication that acts referred to approvingly in statutory language are lawful acts is routine.  The Court asserts that the Illinois Supreme Court has forced it into this interpretive inanity because, since it has not placed any limiting construction on the language in the ordinance, we must assume that the ordinance means what it says . . . .  Ante, at 19.  But the Illinois Supreme Court did not mention this particular interpretive issue, which has nothing to do with giving the Ordinance a limiting interpretation, and everything to do with giving it its ordinary legal meaning.

				The citizens of Chicago were once free to drive about the city at whatever speed they wished.  At some point Chicagoans (or perhaps Illinoisans) decided this would not do, and imposed prophylactic speed limits designed to assure safe operation by the average (or perhaps even subaverage) driver with the average (or perhaps even subaverage) vehicle.  This infringed upon the freedom of all citizens, but was not unconstitutional.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Similarly, the citizens of Chicago were once free to stand around and gawk at the scene of an accident.  At some point Chicagoans discovered that this obstructed traffic and caused more accidents.  They did not make the practice unlawful, but they did authorize police officers to order the crowd to disperse, and imposed penalties for refusal to obey such an order.  Again, this prophylactic measure infringed upon the freedom of all citizens, but was not unconstitutional.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Until the ordinance that is before us today was adopted, the citizens of Chicago were free to stand about in public places with no apparent purposeto engage, that is, in conduct that appeared to be loitering.  In recent years, however, the city has been afflicted with criminal street gangs.  As reflected in the record before us, these gangs congregated in public places to deal in drugs, and to terrorize the neighborhoods by demonstrating control over their turf.  Many residents of the inner city felt that they were prisoners in their own homes.  Once again, Chicagoans decided that to eliminate the problem it was worth restricting some of the freedom that they once enjoyed.  The means they took was similar to the second, and more mild, example given above rather than the first: Loitering was not made unlawful, but when a group of people occupied a public place without an apparent purpose and in the company of a known gang member, police officers were authorized to order them to disperse, and the failure to obey such an order was made unlawful.  See Chicago Municipal Code §84015 (1992).  The minor limitation upon the free state of nature that this prophylactic arrangement imposed upon all Chicagoans seemed to them (and it seems to me) a small price to pay for liberation of their streets.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The majority today invalidates this perfectly reasonable measure by ignoring our rules governing facial challenges, by elevating loitering to a constitutionally guaranteed right, and by discerning vagueness where, according to our usual standards, none exists.

				Respondents consolidated appeal presents a facial challenge to the Chicago Ordinance on vagueness grounds.  When a facial challenge is successful, the law in question is declared to be unenforceable in 
				<em>
					all
				</em>
				 its applications, and not just in its particular application to the party in suit.  To tell the truth, it is highly questionable whether federal courts have any business making such a declaration.  The rationale for our power to review federal legislation for constitutionality, expressed in 
				<em>
					Marbury
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Madison
				</em>
				, 1 Cranch 137 (1803), was that we 
				<em>
					had

				 to do so in order to decide the case before us.  But that rationale only extends so far as to require us to determine that the statute is unconstitutional as applied to

				The second characteristic of judicial power is, that it pronounces on special cases, and not upon general principles.  If a judge, in deciding a particular point, destroys a general principle by passing a judgment which tends to reject all the inferences from that principle, and consequently to annul it, he remains within the ordinary limits of his functions.  But if he directly attacks a general principle without having a particular case in view, he leaves the circle in which all nations have agreed to confine his authority; he assumes a more important, and perhaps a more useful influence, than that of the magistrate; but he ceases to represent the judicial power.

				Whenever a law which the judge holds to be unconstitutional is invoked in a tribunal of the United States, he may refuse to admit it as a rule … .  But as soon as a judge has refused to apply any given law in a case, that law immediately loses a portion of its moral force.  Those to whom it is prejudicial learn that means exist of overcoming its authority; and similar suits are multiplied, until it becomes powerless. … The political power which the Americans have entrusted to their courts of justice is therefore immense; but the evils of this power are considerably diminished by the impossibility of attacking the laws except through the courts of justice. …  [W]hen a judge contests a law in an obscure debate on some particular case, the importance of his attack is concealed from public notice; his decision bears upon the interest of an individual, and the law is slighted only incidentally.  Moreover, although it is censured, it is not abolished; its moral force may be diminished, but its authority is not taken away; and its final destruction can be accomplished only by the reiterated attacks of judicial functionaries.  Democracy in America 73, 7576 (R.

				The very foundation of the power of the federal courts to declare Acts of Congress unconstitutional lies in the power and duty of those courts to decide cases and controversies before them. . . .  This Court, as is the case with all federal courts, has no jurisdiction to pronounce any statute, either of a State or of the United States, void, because irreconcilable with the Constitution, except as it is called upon to adjudge the legal rights of litigants in actual controversies.  In the exercise of that jurisdiction, it is bound by two rules, to which it has rigidly adhered, one, never to anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it; the other never to formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied. . . .  Kindred to these rules is the rule that one to whom application of a statute is constitutional will not be heard to attack the statute on the ground that impliedly it might also be taken as applying to other persons or other situations in which its application might be unconstitutional. . . .  The delicate power of pronouncing an Act of Congress unconstitutional is not to be exercised with reference to hypothetical cases thus imagined.

        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				It seems to me fundamentally incompatible with this system for the Court not to be content to find that a statute is unconstitutional as applied to the person before it, but to go further and pronounce that the statute is unconstitutional in 
				<em>
					all
				</em>
				 applications.  Its reasoning may well suggest as much, but to pronounce a 
				<em>
					holding
				</em>
				 on that point seems to me no more than an advisory opinionwhich a federal court should never issue at all, see 
				<em>
					Hayburns Case

				, 2 Dall. 409 (1792), and 
				<em>
					especially

				 should not issue with regard to a constitutional question, as to which we seek to avoid even

				I must acknowledge, however, that for some of the present century we have done just this.  But until recently, at least, we haveexcept in free-speech cases subject to the doctrine of overbreadth, see,

				<em>
					unconstitutional
				</em>
				 in all its applications.  (I say that is an eminently reasonable requirement, not only because we should not be holding a statute void in all its applications unless it is unconstitutional in all its applications, but also because 
				<em>
					unless
				</em>
				 it is unconstitutional in all its applications we do not even know, without conducting an as-applied analysis, whether it is void with regard to the very litigant

				I am aware, of course, that in some recent facial-challenge cases the Court has, without any attempt at explanation, created entirely irrational exceptions to the unconstitutional in every conceivable application rule, when the statutes at issue concerned hot-button social issues on which informed opinion was zealously united.

				When our normal criteria for facial challenges are applied, it is clear that the Justices in the majority have transposed the burden of proof.  Instead of requiring the respondents, who are challenging the Ordinance, to show that it is invalid in all its applications, they have required the petitioner to show that it is valid in all its applications.  Both the plurality opinion and the concurrences display a lively imagination, creating hypothetical situations in which the laws application would (in their view) be ambiguous.  But that creative role has been usurped from the petitioner, who can defeat the respondents facial challenge by conjuring up 
				<em>
					a single valid application
				</em>
				 of the law.  My contribution would go something like this
				<a name="ZD-5ref" href="#ZD-5" class="">

				: Tony, a member of the Jets criminal street gang, is standing alongside and chatting with fellow gang members while staking out their turf at Promontory Point on the South Side of Chicago; the group is flashing gang signs and displaying their distinctive tattoos to passersby.  Officer Krupke, applying the Ordinance at issue here, orders the group to disperse.  After some speculative discussion (probably irrelevant here) over whether the Jets are depraved because they are deprived, Tony and the other gang members break off further conversation with the statementnot entirely coherent, but evidently intended to be rudeGee, Officer Krupke, krup you.  A tense standoff ensues until Officer Krupke arrests the group for failing to obey his dispersal order.  Even assuming (as the Justices in the majority do, but I do not) that a law requiring obedience to a dispersal order is impermissibly vague unless it is clear to the objects of the order, before its issuance, that their conduct justifies it, I find it hard to believe that the Jets would not have known they had it coming.  That should settle the matter of respondents facial challenge to the Ordinances vagueness.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Of course respondents would still be able to claim that the Ordinance was vague as applied to them.  But the ultimate demonstration of the inappropriateness of the Courts holding of 
				<em>
					facial 
				</em>
				invalidity is the fact that it is doubtful whether some of these respondents could even sustain an 
				<em>
					as-applied 
				</em>
				challenge on the basis of the majoritys own criteria.  For instance, respondent Jose Renteriawho admitted that he was a member of the Satan Disciples gangwas observed by the arresting officer loitering on a street corner with other gang members.  The officer issued a dispersal order, but when she returned to the same corner 15 to 20 minutes later, Renteria was still there with his friends, whereupon he was arrested.  In another example, respondent Daniel Washington and several otherswho admitted they were members of the Vice Lords gangwere observed by the arresting officer loitering in the street, yelling at passing vehicles, stopping traffic, and preventing pedestrians from using the sidewalks.  The arresting officer issued a dispersal order, issued 
				<em>
					another
				</em>
				 dispersal order later when the group did not move, and finally arrested the group when they were found loitering in the same place still later.  Finally, respondent Gregorio Gutierrezwho had previously admitted to the arresting officer his membership in the Latin Kings gangwas observed loitering with two other men.  The officer issued a dispersal order, drove around the block, and arrested the men after finding them in the same place upon his return.  See Brief for Petitioner 7, n. 5; Brief for United States as 
				<em>
					Amicus Curiae
				</em>
				 16, n. 11.  Even on the majoritys assumption that to avoid vagueness it must be clear to the object of the dispersal order 
				<em>
					ex ante
				</em>
				 that his conduct is covered by the Ordinance, it seems most improbable that any of these as-applied challenges would be sustained.  Much less is it possible to say that the Ordinance is invalid in 
				<em>
					all 
				</em>
				its applications.

				The plurality's explanation for its departure from the usual rule governing facial challenges is seemingly contained in the following statement: [This] is a criminal law that contains no 
				<em>
					mens rea
				</em>
				 requirement … 
				<em>
					and
				</em>
				 infringes on constitutionally protected rights … .  When vagueness permeates the text of

				<em>
					mens rea 
				</em>
				requirement)   (infringement of constitutionally protected right)   (vagueness) = (entitlement to facial invalidation).  There is no such formula; the plurality has made it up for this case, as the absence of any citation demonstrates.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				But no matter.  None of the three factors that the plurality relies upon exists anyway.  I turn first to the support for the proposition that there is a constitutionally protected right to loiteror, as the plurality more favorably describes it, for a person to remain in a public place of his choice.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  The plurality thinks much of this Fundamental Freedom to Loiter, which it contrasts with such lesser, constitutionally 
				<em>
					un
				</em>
				protected, activities as doing (ugh!) 
				<em>
					business
				</em>
				: This is not an ordinance that simply regulates business behavior and contains a scienter requirement. . . . It is a criminal law that contains no 
				<em>
					mens rea
				</em>
				 requirement . . . and infringes on constitutionally protected rights.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				 (internal quotation marks omitted). (Poor Alexander Hamilton, who has seen his commercial republic devolve, in the eyes of the plurality, at least, into an indolent republic, see The Federalist No. 6, p. 56; No. 11, pp. 8491 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961).)
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Of course every activity, even scratching ones head, can be called a constitutional right if one means by that term nothing more than the fact that the activity is covered (as all are) by the Equal Protection Clause, so that those who engage in it cannot be singled out without rational basis.  See

The entire practice of using the Due Process Clause to add judicially favored rights to the limitations upon democracy set forth in the Bill of Rights (usually under the rubric of so-called substantive due process) is in my view judicial usurpation.

				It would be unfair, however, to criticize the pluralitys failed attempt to establish that loitering is a constitutionally protected right while saying nothing of the concurrences.  The plurality at least makes an attempt.  The concurrences, on the other hand, make no pretense at attaching their broad vagueness invalidates rule to a liberty interest.  As far as appears from 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Oconnor
				</span>
				s and 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Breyer
				</span>
				s opinions, 
				<em>
					no

				 police officer may issue 
				<em>
					any
				</em>
				 order, affecting 
				<em>
					any
				</em>
				 insignificant sort of citizen conduct (except, perhaps, an order addressed to the unprotected class of gang members) unless the standards for the issuance of that order are precise.  No mod-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				ern urban societyand probably none since London got big enough to have sewerscould function under such a rule.  There are innumerable reasons why it may be im-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				portant for a constable to tell a pedestrian to move onand even if it were possible to list in an ordinance all of the reasons that are known, many are simply unpredictable.  Hence the (entirely reasonable) Rule of the City of New York which reads: No person shall fail, neglect or refuse to comply with the lawful direction or command of any Police Officer, Urban Park Ranger, Parks Enforcement Patrol Officer or other [Parks and Recreation] Department employee, indicated by gesture or otherwise.  56 RCNY §103(c)(1) (1996).  It is one thing to uphold an as applied challenge when a pedestrian disobeys such an order that is unreasonableor even when a pedestrian asserting some true liberty interest (holding a political rally, for instance) disobeys such an order that is reasonable 
				<em>
					but unexplained
				</em>
				.  But to say that such a general ordinance permitting lawful orders is void 
				<em>
					in all its applications
				</em>
				 demands more than a safe and orderly society can reasonably deliver.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <span class="smallcaps">
					 Justice Kennedy

				 apparently recognizes this, since he acknowledges that some police commands will subject a citizen to prosecution for disobeying whether or not the citizen knows why the order is given, including, for example, an order tell[ing] a pedestrian not to enter a building when the reason is to avoid impeding a rescue team.  
				<em>

But his only explanation of why the present interference with the right to loiter does not fall within that permitted scope of action is as follows: The predicate of an order to disperse is not, in my view, sufficient to eliminate doubts regarding the adequacy of notice under this ordinance.  
				<em>

        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				I turn next to that element of the plurality's facial-challenge formula which consists of the proposition that this criminal ordinance contains no 
				<em>
					mens rea 
				</em>
				requirement.  The first step in analyzing this proposition is to determine what the 
				<em>
					actus reus
				</em>
				, to which that 
				<em>
					mens rea
				</em>
				 is supposed to be attached, consists of.  The majority believes that loitering forms part of (indeed, the essence of) the offense, and must be proved if conviction is to be obtained.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 2, 6, 913, 1415, 1618 (plurality and majority opinions); 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 23, 4 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					OConnor, J.
				</span>
				, concurring in part and concurring in judgment); 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 12 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Kennedy, J
				</span>
				., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 34 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Breyer, J
				</span>
				., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  That is not what the Ordinance provides.  The only part of the Ordinance that refers to loitering is the portion that addresses, not the punishable conduct of the defendant, but what the police officer must observe before he can issue an order to disperse; and what he must observe is carefully defined in terms of what the defendant 
				<em>
					appears
				</em>
				 to be doing, not in terms of what the defendant is 
				<em>
					actually
				</em>
				 doing.  The Ordinance does not require that the defendant have been loitering (
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, have been remaining in one place with no purpose), but rather that the police officer have observed him remaining in one place without any 
				<em>
					apparent
				</em>
				 purpose.  Someone who in fact 
				<em>
					has
				</em>
				 a genuine purpose for remaining where he is (waiting for a friend, for example, or waiting to hold up a bank) 
				<em>
					can
				</em>
				 be ordered to move on (assuming the other conditions of the Ordinance are met), so long as his remaining has no 
				<em>
					apparent
				</em>
				 purpose.  It is likely, to be sure, that the Ordinance will come down most heavily upon those who are 
				<em>
					actually 
				</em>
				loitering (those who 
				<em>
					really
				</em>
				 have no purpose in remaining where they are); but that activity is not a condition for issuance of the dispersal order.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The 
				<em>
					only
				</em>
				 act of a defendant that is made punishable by the Ordinanceor, indeed, that is even mentioned by the Ordinanceis his failure to promptly obey an order to disperse.  The question, then, is whether that 
				<em>
					actus reus
				</em>
				 must be accompanied by any wrongful intentand of course it must.  As the Court itself describes the requirement, a person must 
				<em>
					disobey
				</em>
				 the officers order.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 3 (emphasis added).  No one thinks a defendant could be successfully prosecuted under the Ordinance if he did not hear the order to disperse, or if he suffered a paralysis that rendered his compliance impossible.  The willful failure to obey a police order is wrongful intent enough.

				Finally, I address the last of the three factors in the plurality's facial-challenge formula: the proposition that the Ordinance is vague.  It is not.  Even under the ersatz overbreadth standard applied in

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/461/352" class="subref" title="subref">461 U. S. 352</a> n. 8 (1983), which allows facial challenges if a law reaches a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct, respondents claim fails because the Ordinance would not be vague in most or even a substantial number of applications.  A law is unconstitutionally vague if its lack of definitive standards either (1) fails to apprise persons of ordinary intelligence of the prohibited conduct, or (2) encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The plurality relies primarily upon the first of these aspects.  Since, it reasons, the loitering is the conduct that the ordinance is designed to prohibit, and an officer may issue an order only after prohibited conduct has already occurred, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 14, 15, the order to disperse cannot itself serve to apprise persons of ordinary intelligence of the prohibited conduct.  What counts for purposes of vagueness analysis, however, is not what the Ordinance is designed to prohibit, but what it actually subjects to criminal penalty.  As discussed earlier, that consists of nothing but the refusal to obey a dispersal order, as to which there is no doubt of adequate notice of the prohibited conduct.  The plurality's suggestion that even the dispersal order 
				<em>
					itself
				</em>
				 is unconstitutionally vague, because it does not specify

					how far to disperse (!)

In discussing whether Chicagos Ordinance meets that requirement, the Justices in the majority hide behind an artificial construct of judicial restraint.  They point to the Supreme Court of Illinois statement that the apparent purpose standard provides absolute discretion to police officers to decide what activities constitute loitering, 687 N. E. 2d 53, 63 (1997), and protest that it would be wrong to construe the language of the Ordinance more narrowly than did the States highest court.

				The criteria for issuance of a dispersal order under the Chicago Ordinance could hardly be clearer.  First, the law requires police officers to reasonably believ[e] that one of the group to which the order is issued is a criminal street gang member.  This resembles a probable-cause standard, and the Chicago Police Departments General Order 924 (1992)promulgated to govern enforcement of the Ordinancemakes the probable cause requirement explicit.

                </sup>
            </a>
				  Under the Order, officers must have probable cause to believe that an individual is a member of a criminal street gang, to be substantiated by the officers experience and knowledge of the alleged offenders and by specific, documented and reliable information such as reliable witness testimony or an individuals admission of gang membership or display of distinctive colors, tattoos, signs, or other markings worn by members of particular criminal street gangs.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 67a69a, 71a72a.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, the Ordinance requires that the group be remain[ing] in one place with no apparent purpose.  
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice OConnor
				</span>
				s assertion that this applies to any person standing in a public place, 
				<em>

				, at 2, is a distortion.  The Ordinance does not apply to standing, but to remain[ing]a term which in this context obviously means [to] endure or persist, see American Heritage Dictionary 1525 (1992).  There may be some ambiguity at the margin, but remain[ing] in one place requires more than a temporary stop, and is clear in most of its applications, including all of those represented by the facts surrounding the respondents arrests described

				As for the phrase with no apparent purpose: 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice OConnor
				</span>
				 again distorts this adjectival phrase, by separating it from the word that it modifies.  [A]ny person standing on the street, her concurrence says, has a general purposeeven if it is simply to stand, and thus the ordinance permits police officers to choose which purposes are 
				<em>
					permissible
				</em>

				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 2.  But Chicago police officers enforcing the Ordinance are not looking for people with no apparent purpose (who are regrettably in oversupply); they are looking for people who remain in any one place with no apparent purposethat is, who remain there without any apparent reason 
				<em>
					for remaining there
				</em>
				.  That is not difficult to perceive.

				The Courts attempt to demonstrate the vagueness of the Ordinance produces the following peculiar statement: The no apparent purpose standard for making [the decision to issue an order to disperse] is inherently subjective because its application depends on whether some purpose is apparent to the officer on the scene.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 18.  In the Courts view, a persons lack of any purpose in staying in one location is presumably an 
				<em>
					objective
				</em>
				 factor, and what the Ordinance requires as a condition of an order to dispersethe absence of any 
				<em>
					apparent
				</em>
				 purposeis a 
				<em>
					subjective
				</em>
				 factor.  This side of the looking glass, just the opposite is true.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Elsewhere, of course, the Court acknowledges the clear, objective commands of the Ordinance, and indeed relies upon them to paint it as unfair:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				By its very terms, the ordinance encompasses a great deal of harmless behavior.  In any public place in the city of Chicago, persons who stand or sit in the company of a gang member may be ordered to disperse unless their purpose is apparent.  The mandatory language in the enactment directs the police to issue an order without first making any inquiry about their possible purposes.  It matters not whether the reason that a gang member and his father, for example, might loiter near Wrigley Field is to rob an unsuspecting fan or just to get a glimpse of Sammy Sosa leaving the ballpark; in either event, if their purpose is not apparent to a nearby police officer, she mayindeed, she shallorder them to disperse.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
Quite so.  And the fact that this clear instruction to the officers encompasses a great deal of harmless behavior would be invalidating if that harmless behavior were constitutionally protected against abridgment, such as speech or the practice of religion.  Remaining in one place is 
				<em>

The problem, of course, well recognized by Chicagos City Council, is that the gang members cease their intimidating and unlawful behavior under the watchful eye of police officers, but return to it as soon as the police drive away.

				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 78, n. 17 (plurality opinion) (citing extant laws against intimidation, streetgang criminal drug conspiracy, and mob action).  The problem, again, is that the intimidation and lawlessness do not occur when the police are in sight.

				<em>
					Ante

				, at 3 (the Court agrees that this might be a cure, see 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1819).  But the Ordinance already specifies to whom the order can be issued: persons remaining in one place with no apparent purpose in the company of a gang member.  And if remain[ing] in one place with no apparent purpose is so vague as to give the police unbridled discretion in controlling the conduct of non-gang-members, it surpasses understanding how it ceases to be so vague when applied to gang members 
				<em>

				The fact is that the present ordinance is entirely clear in its application, cannot be violated except with full knowledge and intent, and vests no more discretion in the police than innumerable other measures authorizing police orders to preserve the public peace and safety.  As suggested by their tortured analyses, and by their suggested solutions that bear no relation to the identified constitutional problem, the majoritys real quarrel with the Chicago Ordinance is simply that it permits (or indeed requires) too much harmless conduct by innocent citizens to be proscribed.  As 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice OConnor
				</span>
				s concurrence says with disapprobation, the ordinance applies to hundreds of thousands of persons who are 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 gang members, standing on any sidewalk or in any park, coffee shop, bar, or other location open to the public.  
				<em>

				</em>
				, at 23 (internal quotation marks omitted).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				But in our democratic system, how much harmless conduct to proscribe is not a judgment to be made by the courts.  So long as constitutionally guaranteed rights are not affected, and so long as the proscription has a rational basis, 
				<em>
					all sorts
				</em>
				 of perfectly harmless activity by millions of perfectly innocent people can be forbiddenriding a motorcycle without a safety helmet, for example, starting a campfire in a national forest, or selling a safe and effective drug not yet approved by the FDA.  All of these acts are entirely innocent and harmless in themselves, but because of the 
				<em>
					risk
				</em>
				 of harm that they entail, the freedom to engage in them has been abridged.  The citizens of Chicago have decided that depriving themselves of the freedom to hang out with a gang member is necessary to eliminate pervasive gang crime and intimidationand that the elimination of the one is worth the deprivation of the other.  This Court has no business second-guessing either the degree of necessity or the fairness of the trade.

						 In other words, a facial attack, since it requires unconstitutionality in all circumstances, necessarily presumes that the litigant presently before the court would be able to sustain an as-applied challenge.  See Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc.,

The plurality asserts that in United States v. Salerno, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/481/739" class="subref" title="subref">481 U. S. 739</a> (1987)
, which I discuss in text immediately following this footnote, the Court entertained a facial challenge even though the defendants . . . did not claim that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to them.  Ante, at 11, n. 22.  That is not so.  The Court made it absolutely clear in Salerno that a facial challenge requires the assertion that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid, 481 U. S., at 745 (emphasis added).  The footnoted statement upon which the plurality relies (Nor have respondents claimed that the Act is unconstitutional because of the way it was applied to the particular facts of their case, id., at 745, n. 3) was obviously meant to convey the fact that the defendants were not making, in addition to their facial challenge, an alternative as-applied challengei.e., asserting that even if the statute was not unconstitutional in all its applications it was at least unconstitutional in its particular application to them.

						 Salerno, a criminal case, repudiated the Courts statement in Kolender v. Lawson, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/461/352" class="subref" title="subref">461 U. S. 352</a>, n. 8 (1983), to the effect that a facial challenge to a criminal statute could succeed even when [the statute] could conceivably have had some valid application.  Kolender seems to have confused the standard for 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> overbreadth challenges with the standard governing facial challenges on all other grounds.  See ibid. (citing the Courts articulation of the standard for 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> overbreadth challenges from Hoffman Estates, supra, at 494).  As Salerno noted, 481 U. S., at 745, the overbreadth doctrine is a specialized exception to the general rule for facial challenges, justified in light of the risk that an overbroad statute will chill free expression.  See, e.g., Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/413/601" class="subref" title="subref">413 U. S. 601</a>,

						 The plurality asserts that the Salerno standard for facial challenge has never been the decisive factor in any decision of this Court.  It means by that only this: in rejecting a facial challenge, the Court has never contented itself with identifying only one situation in which the challenged statute would be constitutional, but has mentioned several.  But that is not at all remarkable, and casts no doubt upon the validity of the principle that Salerno and these many other cases enunciated.  It is difficult to conceive of a statute that would be constitutional in only a single applicationand hard to resist mentioning more than one.


The plurality contends that it does not matter whether the Salerno standard is federal law, since facial challenge is a species of third-party standing, and federal limitations upon third-party standing do not apply in an appeal from a state decision which takes a broader view, as the Illinois Supreme Courts opinion did here.  Ante, at 11, n. 22.  This is quite wrong.  Disagreement over the Salerno rule is not a disagreement over the standing question of whether the person challenging the statute can raise the rights of third parties: under both Salerno and the plurality's rule he can.  The disagreement relates to how many third-party rights he must prove to be infringed by the statute before he can win: Salerno says all (in addition to his own rights), the plurality says many.  That is not a question of standing but of substantive law.  The notion that, if Salerno is the federal rule (a federal statute is not totally invalid unless it is invalid in all its applications), it can be altered by a state court (a federal statute is totally invalid if it is invalid in many of its applications), and that that alteration must be accepted by the Supreme Court of the United States is, to put it as gently as possible, remarkable.

						 The pluralitys explanation for ignoring these laws is that many of them carried severe penalties and, during the Reconstruction era, they had harsh consequences on African-American women and children.  Ante, at 910, n. 20.  Those severe penalties and those harsh consequences are certainly regrettable, but they in no way lessen (indeed, the harshness of penalty tends to increase) the capacity of these laws to prove that loitering was never regarded as a fundamental liberty.

						 Ante, at 9, n. 19.  The plurality bases its assertion of apparent concession upon a footnote in Part I of petitioners brief which reads: Of course, laws regulating social gatherings affect a liberty interest, and thus are subject to review under the rubric of substantive due process . . . . We address that doctrine in Part II below.  Brief for Petitioner 2122, n. 14.  If a careless reader were inclined to confuse the term social gatherings in this passage with loitering, his confusion would be eliminated by pursuing the reference to Part II of the brief, which says, in its introductory paragraph: [A]s we explain below, substantive due process does not support the courts novel holding that the Constitution secures the right to stand still on the public way even when one is not engaged in speech, assembly, or other conduct that enjoys affirmative constitutional protection.  Id., at 39.

						 The plurality says, ante, at 20, n. 35, that since it decides the case on the basis of procedural due process rather than substantive due process, I am mistaken in analyzing its opinion under the framework for substantive due process set out in Washington v. Glucksberg.  Ibid.  But I am not analyzing it under that framework.  I am simply assuming that when the plurality says (as an essential part of its reasoning) that the right to loiter for innocent purposes is . . . a part of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause it does not believe that the same word (liberty) means one thing for purposes of substantive due process and something else for purposes of procedural due process.  There is no authority for that startling proposition.  See Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/408/564" class="subref" title="subref">408 U. S. 564</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">572</a>575 (1972)
 (rejecting procedural-due-process claim for lack of liberty interest, and citing substantive-due-process cases).


The pluralitys opinion seeks to have it both ways, invoking the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>s august protection of liberty in defining the standard of certainty that it sets, but then, in identifying the conduct protected by that high standard, ignoring our extensive case-law defining liberty, and substituting, instead, all harmless and innocent conduct, ante, at 14.

						 I call it a suggestion because the plurality says only that the terms of the dispersal order compound the inadequacy of the notice, and acknowledges that they might not render the ordinance unconstitutionally vague if the definition of the forbidden conduct were clear.  Ante, at 15, 16.  This notion that a prescription (Disperse!) which is itself not unconstitutionally vague can somehow contribute to the unconstitutional vagueness of the entire scheme is full of mysterysuspending, as it does, the metaphysical principle that nothing can confer what it does not possess (nemo dat qui non habet).

						 Administrative interpretation and implementation of a regulation are … highly relevant to our [vagueness] analysis, for [i]n evaluating a facial challenge to a state law, a federal court must … consider any limiting construction that a state court or enforcement agency has proffered.   Ward v.

						 Justice Breyer asserts that one always has some apparent purpose, so that the policeman must interpret the words no apparent purpose as meaning no apparent purpose except for . . . .  Ante, at 12.  It is simply not true that one always has some apparent purposeand especially not true that one always has some apparent purpose in remaining at rest, for the simple reason that one often (indeed, perhaps usually) has no actual purpose in remaining at rest.  Remaining at rest will be a persons normal state, unless he has a purpose which causes him to move.  That is why one frequently reads of a persons wandering aimlessly (which is worthy of note) but not of a persons sitting aimlessly (which is not remarkable at all).  And that is why a synonym for purpose is motive: that which causes one to move.

						 The Court also speculates that a police officer may exercise his discretion to enforce the Ordinance and direct dispersal when (in the Courts view) the Ordinance is inapplicableviz., where there is an apparent purpose, but it is an unlawful one.  See ante, at 18.  No one in his right mind would read the phrase without any apparent purpose to mean anything other than without any apparent lawful purpose.  The implication that acts referred to approvingly in statutory language are lawful acts is routine.  The Court asserts that the Illinois Supreme Court has forced it into this interpretive inanity because, since it has not placed any limiting construction on the language in the ordinance, we must assume that the ordinance means what it says . . . .  Ante, at 19.  But the Illinois Supreme Court did not mention this particular interpretive issue, which has nothing to do with giving the Ordinance a limiting interpretation, and everything to do with giving it its ordinary legal meaning.

				The citizens of Chicago were once free to drive about the city at whatever speed they wished.  At some point Chicagoans (or perhaps Illinoisans) decided this would not do, and imposed prophylactic speed limits designed to assure safe operation by the average (or perhaps even subaverage) driver with the average (or perhaps even subaverage) vehicle.  This infringed upon the freedom of all citizens, but was not unconstitutional.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Similarly, the citizens of Chicago were once free to stand around and gawk at the scene of an accident.  At some point Chicagoans discovered that this obstructed traffic and caused more accidents.  They did not make the practice unlawful, but they did authorize police officers to order the crowd to disperse, and imposed penalties for refusal to obey such an order.  Again, this prophylactic measure infringed upon the freedom of all citizens, but was not unconstitutional.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Until the ordinance that is before us today was adopted, the citizens of Chicago were free to stand about in public places with no apparent purposeto engage, that is, in conduct that appeared to be loitering.  In recent years, however, the city has been afflicted with criminal street gangs.  As reflected in the record before us, these gangs congregated in public places to deal in drugs, and to terrorize the neighborhoods by demonstrating control over their turf.  Many residents of the inner city felt that they were prisoners in their own homes.  Once again, Chicagoans decided that to eliminate the problem it was worth restricting some of the freedom that they once enjoyed.  The means they took was similar to the second, and more mild, example given above rather than the first: Loitering was not made unlawful, but when a group of people occupied a public place without an apparent purpose and in the company of a known gang member, police officers were authorized to order them to disperse, and the failure to obey such an order was made unlawful.  See Chicago Municipal Code §84015 (1992).  The minor limitation upon the free state of nature that this prophylactic arrangement imposed upon all Chicagoans seemed to them (and it seems to me) a small price to pay for liberation of their streets.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The majority today invalidates this perfectly reasonable measure by ignoring our rules governing facial challenges, by elevating loitering to a constitutionally guaranteed right, and by discerning vagueness where, according to our usual standards, none exists.

				Respondents consolidated appeal presents a facial challenge to the Chicago Ordinance on vagueness grounds.  When a facial challenge is successful, the law in question is declared to be unenforceable in 
				<em>
					all
				</em>
				 its applications, and not just in its particular application to the party in suit.  To tell the truth, it is highly questionable whether federal courts have any business making such a declaration.  The rationale for our power to review federal legislation for constitutionality, expressed in 
				<em>
					Marbury
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Madison
				</em>
				, 1 Cranch 137 (1803), was that we 
				<em>
					had
				</em>
				 to do so in order to decide the case before us.  But that rationale only extends so far as to require us to determine that the statute is unconstitutional as applied to

				The second characteristic of judicial power is, that it pronounces on special cases, and not upon general principles.  If a judge, in deciding a particular point, destroys a general principle by passing a judgment which tends to reject all the inferences from that principle, and consequently to annul it, he remains within the ordinary limits of his functions.  But if he directly attacks a general principle without having a particular case in view, he leaves the circle in which all nations have agreed to confine his authority; he assumes a more important, and perhaps a more useful influence, than that of the magistrate; but he ceases to represent the judicial power.

				Whenever a law which the judge holds to be unconstitutional is invoked in a tribunal of the United States, he may refuse to admit it as a rule … .  But as soon as a judge has refused to apply any given law in a case, that law immediately loses a portion of its moral force.  Those to whom it is prejudicial learn that means exist of overcoming its authority; and similar suits are multiplied, until it becomes powerless. … The political power which the Americans have entrusted to their courts of justice is therefore immense; but the evils of this power are considerably diminished by the impossibility of attacking the laws except through the courts of justice. …  [W]hen a judge contests a law in an obscure debate on some particular case, the importance of his attack is concealed from public notice; his decision bears upon the interest of an individual, and the law is slighted only incidentally.  Moreover, although it is censured, it is not abolished; its moral force may be diminished, but its authority is not taken away; and its final destruction can be accomplished only by the reiterated attacks of judicial functionaries.  Democracy in America 73, 7576 (R.

				The very foundation of the power of the federal courts to declare Acts of Congress unconstitutional lies in the power and duty of those courts to decide cases and controversies before them. . . .  This Court, as is the case with all federal courts, has no jurisdiction to pronounce any statute, either of a State or of the United States, void, because irreconcilable with the Constitution, except as it is called upon to adjudge the legal rights of litigants in actual controversies.  In the exercise of that jurisdiction, it is bound by two rules, to which it has rigidly adhered, one, never to anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it; the other never to formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied. . . .  Kindred to these rules is the rule that one to whom application of a statute is constitutional will not be heard to attack the statute on the ground that impliedly it might also be taken as applying to other persons or other situations in which its application might be unconstitutional. . . .  The delicate power of pronouncing an Act of Congress unconstitutional is not to be exercised with reference to hypothetical cases thus imagined.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				It seems to me fundamentally incompatible with this system for the Court not to be content to find that a statute is unconstitutional as applied to the person before it, but to go further and pronounce that the statute is unconstitutional in 
				<em>
					all
				</em>
				 applications.  Its reasoning may well suggest as much, but to pronounce a 
				<em>
					holding
				</em>
				 on that point seems to me no more than an advisory opinionwhich a federal court should never issue at all, see 
				<em>
					Hayburns Case
				</em>
				, 2 Dall. 409 (1792), and 
				<em>
					especially
				</em>
				 should not issue with regard to a constitutional question, as to which we seek to avoid even

 (Brandeis, J., concurring).  I think it quite improper, in short, to ask the constitutional claimant before us: Do you just want us to say that this statute cannot constitutionally be applied to you in this case, or do you want to go for broke and try to get the statute pronounced void in all its applications?

				I must acknowledge, however, that for some of the present century we have done just this.  But until recently, at least, we haveexcept in free-speech cases subject to the doctrine of overbreadth, see,

				<em>
					unconstitutional
				</em>
				 in all its applications.  (I say that is an eminently reasonable requirement, not only because we should not be holding a statute void in all its applications unless it is unconstitutional in all its applications, but also because 
				<em>
					unless
				</em>
				 it is unconstitutional in all its applications we do not even know, without conducting an as-applied analysis, whether it is void with regard to the very litigant

				I am aware, of course, that in some recent facial-challenge cases the Court has, without any attempt at explanation, created entirely irrational exceptions to the unconstitutional in every conceivable application rule, when the statutes at issue concerned hot-button social issues on which informed opinion was zealously united.

				When our normal criteria for facial challenges are applied, it is clear that the Justices in the majority have transposed the burden of proof.  Instead of requiring the respondents, who are challenging the Ordinance, to show that it is invalid in all its applications, they have required the petitioner to show that it is valid in all its applications.  Both the plurality opinion and the concurrences display a lively imagination, creating hypothetical situations in which the laws application would (in their view) be ambiguous.  But that creative role has been usurped from the petitioner, who can defeat the respondents facial challenge by conjuring up 
				<em>
					a single valid application
				</em>
				 of the law.  My contribution would go something like this

				: Tony, a member of the Jets criminal street gang, is standing alongside and chatting with fellow gang members while staking out their turf at Promontory Point on the South Side of Chicago; the group is flashing gang signs and displaying their distinctive tattoos to passersby.  Officer Krupke, applying the Ordinance at issue here, orders the group to disperse.  After some speculative discussion (probably irrelevant here) over whether the Jets are depraved because they are deprived, Tony and the other gang members break off further conversation with the statementnot entirely coherent, but evidently intended to be rudeGee, Officer Krupke, krup you.  A tense standoff ensues until Officer Krupke arrests the group for failing to obey his dispersal order.  Even assuming (as the Justices in the majority do, but I do not) that a law requiring obedience to a dispersal order is impermissibly vague unless it is clear to the objects of the order, before its issuance, that their conduct justifies it, I find it hard to believe that the Jets would not have known they had it coming.  That should settle the matter of respondents facial challenge to the Ordinances vagueness.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Of course respondents would still be able to claim that the Ordinance was vague as applied to them.  But the ultimate demonstration of the inappropriateness of the Courts holding of 
				<em>
					facial 
				</em>
				invalidity is the fact that it is doubtful whether some of these respondents could even sustain an 
				<em>
					as-applied 
				</em>
				challenge on the basis of the majoritys own criteria.  For instance, respondent Jose Renteriawho admitted that he was a member of the Satan Disciples gangwas observed by the arresting officer loitering on a street corner with other gang members.  The officer issued a dispersal order, but when she returned to the same corner 15 to 20 minutes later, Renteria was still there with his friends, whereupon he was arrested.  In another example, respondent Daniel Washington and several otherswho admitted they were members of the Vice Lords gangwere observed by the arresting officer loitering in the street, yelling at passing vehicles, stopping traffic, and preventing pedestrians from using the sidewalks.  The arresting officer issued a dispersal order, issued 
				<em>
					another
				</em>
				 dispersal order later when the group did not move, and finally arrested the group when they were found loitering in the same place still later.  Finally, respondent Gregorio Gutierrezwho had previously admitted to the arresting officer his membership in the Latin Kings gangwas observed loitering with two other men.  The officer issued a dispersal order, drove around the block, and arrested the men after finding them in the same place upon his return.  See Brief for Petitioner 7, n. 5; Brief for United States as 
				<em>
					Amicus Curiae
				</em>
				 16, n. 11.  Even on the majoritys assumption that to avoid vagueness it must be clear to the object of the dispersal order 
				<em>
					ex ante
				</em>
				 that his conduct is covered by the Ordinance, it seems most improbable that any of these as-applied challenges would be sustained.  Much less is it possible to say that the Ordinance is invalid in 
				<em>
					all 
				</em>
				its applications.

				The plurality's explanation for its departure from the usual rule governing facial challenges is seemingly contained in the following statement: [This] is a criminal law that contains no 
				<em>
					mens rea
				</em>
				 requirement … 
				<em>
					and
				</em>
				 infringes on constitutionally protected rights … .  When vagueness permeates the text of

				<em>
					mens rea 
				</em>
				requirement)   (infringement of constitutionally protected right)   (vagueness) = (entitlement to facial invalidation).  There is no such formula; the plurality has made it up for this case, as the absence of any citation demonstrates.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				But no matter.  None of the three factors that the plurality relies upon exists anyway.  I turn first to the support for the proposition that there is a constitutionally protected right to loiteror, as the plurality more favorably describes it, for a person to remain in a public place of his choice.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  The plurality thinks much of this Fundamental Freedom to Loiter, which it contrasts with such lesser, constitutionally 
				<em>
					un
				</em>
				protected, activities as doing (ugh!) 
				<em>
					business
				</em>
				: This is not an ordinance that simply regulates business behavior and contains a scienter requirement. . . . It is a criminal law that contains no 
				<em>
					mens rea
				</em>
				 requirement . . . and infringes on constitutionally protected rights.  
				<em>
					Ibid.

				 (internal quotation marks omitted). (Poor Alexander Hamilton, who has seen his commercial republic devolve, in the eyes of the plurality, at least, into an indolent republic, see The Federalist No. 6, p. 56; No. 11, pp. 8491 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961).)

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Of course every activity, even scratching ones head, can be called a constitutional right if one means by that term nothing more than the fact that the activity is covered (as all are) by the Equal Protection Clause, so that those who engage in it cannot be singled out without rational basis.  See

The entire practice of using the Due Process Clause to add judicially favored rights to the limitations upon democracy set forth in the Bill of Rights (usually under the rubric of so-called substantive due process) is in my view judicial usurpation.

				It would be unfair, however, to criticize the pluralitys failed attempt to establish that loitering is a constitutionally protected right while saying nothing of the concurrences.  The plurality at least makes an attempt.  The concurrences, on the other hand, make no pretense at attaching their broad vagueness invalidates rule to a liberty interest.  As far as appears from 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Oconnor
				</span>
				s and 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Breyer
				</span>
				s opinions, 
				<em>
					no

				 police officer may issue 
				<em>
					any
				</em>
				 order, affecting 
				<em>
					any
				</em>
				 insignificant sort of citizen conduct (except, perhaps, an order addressed to the unprotected class of gang members) unless the standards for the issuance of that order are precise.  No mod-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				ern urban societyand probably none since London got big enough to have sewerscould function under such a rule.  There are innumerable reasons why it may be im-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				portant for a constable to tell a pedestrian to move onand even if it were possible to list in an ordinance all of the reasons that are known, many are simply unpredictable.  Hence the (entirely reasonable) Rule of the City of New York which reads: No person shall fail, neglect or refuse to comply with the lawful direction or command of any Police Officer, Urban Park Ranger, Parks Enforcement Patrol Officer or other [Parks and Recreation] Department employee, indicated by gesture or otherwise.  56 RCNY §103(c)(1) (1996).  It is one thing to uphold an as applied challenge when a pedestrian disobeys such an order that is unreasonableor even when a pedestrian asserting some true liberty interest (holding a political rally, for instance) disobeys such an order that is reasonable 
				<em>
					but unexplained
				</em>
				.  But to say that such a general ordinance permitting lawful orders is void 
				<em>
					in all its applications
				</em>
				 demands more than a safe and orderly society can reasonably deliver.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <span class="smallcaps">

				 apparently recognizes this, since he acknowledges that some police commands will subject a citizen to prosecution for disobeying whether or not the citizen knows why the order is given, including, for example, an order tell[ing] a pedestrian not to enter a building when the reason is to avoid impeding a rescue team.

But his only explanation of why the present interference with the right to loiter does not fall within that permitted scope of action is as follows: The predicate of an order to disperse is not, in my view, sufficient to eliminate doubts regarding the adequacy of notice under this ordinance.  
				<em>

        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				I turn next to that element of the plurality's facial-challenge formula which consists of the proposition that this criminal ordinance contains no 
				<em>
					mens rea 
				</em>
				requirement.  The first step in analyzing this proposition is to determine what the 
				<em>
					actus reus
				</em>
				, to which that 
				<em>
					mens rea
				</em>
				 is supposed to be attached, consists of.  The majority believes that loitering forms part of (indeed, the essence of) the offense, and must be proved if conviction is to be obtained.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 2, 6, 913, 1415, 1618 (plurality and majority opinions); 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 23, 4 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					OConnor, J.
				</span>
				, concurring in part and concurring in judgment); 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 12 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Kennedy, J
				</span>
				., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 34 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Breyer, J
				</span>
				., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  That is not what the Ordinance provides.  The only part of the Ordinance that refers to loitering is the portion that addresses, not the punishable conduct of the defendant, but what the police officer must observe before he can issue an order to disperse; and what he must observe is carefully defined in terms of what the defendant 
				<em>
					appears
				</em>
				 to be doing, not in terms of what the defendant is 
				<em>
					actually
				</em>
				 doing.  The Ordinance does not require that the defendant have been loitering (
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, have been remaining in one place with no purpose), but rather that the police officer have observed him remaining in one place without any 
				<em>
					apparent
				</em>
				 purpose.  Someone who in fact 
				<em>
					has
				</em>
				 a genuine purpose for remaining where he is (waiting for a friend, for example, or waiting to hold up a bank) 
				<em>
					can
				</em>
				 be ordered to move on (assuming the other conditions of the Ordinance are met), so long as his remaining has no 
				<em>
					apparent
				</em>
				 purpose.  It is likely, to be sure, that the Ordinance will come down most heavily upon those who are 
				<em>
					actually 
				</em>
				loitering (those who 
				<em>
					really
				</em>
				 have no purpose in remaining where they are); but that activity is not a condition for issuance of the dispersal order.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The 
				<em>
					only
				</em>
				 act of a defendant that is made punishable by the Ordinanceor, indeed, that is even mentioned by the Ordinanceis his failure to promptly obey an order to disperse.  The question, then, is whether that 
				<em>
					actus reus
				</em>
				 must be accompanied by any wrongful intentand of course it must.  As the Court itself describes the requirement, a person must 
				<em>
					disobey
				</em>
				 the officers order.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 3 (emphasis added).  No one thinks a defendant could be successfully prosecuted under the Ordinance if he did not hear the order to disperse, or if he suffered a paralysis that rendered his compliance impossible.  The willful failure to obey a police order is wrongful intent enough.

S. 352</a> n. 8 (1983), which allows facial challenges if a law reaches a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct, respondents claim fails because the Ordinance would not be vague in most or even a substantial number of applications.  A law is unconstitutionally vague if its lack of definitive standards either (1) fails to apprise persons of ordinary intelligence of the prohibited conduct, or (2) encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.  See, 
				<em>

				The plurality relies primarily upon the first of these aspects.  Since, it reasons, the loitering is the conduct that the ordinance is designed to prohibit, and an officer may issue an order only after prohibited conduct has already occurred, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 14, 15, the order to disperse cannot itself serve to apprise persons of ordinary intelligence of the prohibited conduct.  What counts for purposes of vagueness analysis, however, is not what the Ordinance is designed to prohibit, but what it actually subjects to criminal penalty.  As discussed earlier, that consists of nothing but the refusal to obey a dispersal order, as to which there is no doubt of adequate notice of the prohibited conduct.  The plurality's suggestion that even the dispersal order 
				<em>
					itself
				</em>
				 is unconstitutionally vague, because it does not specify 
				<em>
					how far to disperse (!)
				</em>
				, see

				For its determination of unconstitutional vagueness, the Court relies secondarilyand

In discussing whether Chicagos Ordinance meets that requirement, the Justices in the majority hide behind an artificial construct of judicial restraint.  They point to the Supreme Court of Illinois statement that the apparent purpose standard provides absolute discretion to police officers to decide what activities constitute loitering, 687 N. E. 2d 53, 63 (1997), and protest that it would be wrong to construe the language of the Ordinance more narrowly than did the States highest court.

				 of what the language achievedafter that court refused (as I do) to read in any limitations that the words do not fairly contain.  It is not a construction of the language (to which we are bound) but a legal conclusion (to which we most assuredly are not bound).

				The criteria for issuance of a dispersal order under the Chicago Ordinance could hardly be clearer.  First, the law requires police officers to reasonably believ[e] that one of the group to which the order is issued is a criminal street gang member.  This resembles a probable-cause standard, and the Chicago Police Departments General Order 924 (1992)promulgated to govern enforcement of the Ordinancemakes the probable cause requirement explicit.

            </a>
				  Under the Order, officers must have probable cause to believe that an individual is a member of a criminal street gang, to be substantiated by the officers experience and knowledge of the alleged offenders and by specific, documented and reliable information such as reliable witness testimony or an individuals admission of gang membership or display of distinctive colors, tattoos, signs, or other markings worn by members of particular criminal street gangs.

				Second, the Ordinance requires that the group be remain[ing] in one place with no apparent purpose.  
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice OConnor
				</span>
				s assertion that this applies to any person standing in a public place, 
				<em>

The Ordinance does not apply to standing, but to remain[ing]a term which in this context obviously means [to] endure or persist, see American Heritage Dictionary 1525 (1992).  There may be some ambiguity at the margin, but remain[ing] in one place requires more than a temporary stop, and is clear in most of its applications, including all of those represented by the facts surrounding the respondents arrests described

				As for the phrase with no apparent purpose: 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice OConnor
				</span>
				 again distorts this adjectival phrase, by separating it from the word that it modifies.  [A]ny person standing on the street, her concurrence says, has a general purposeeven if it is simply to stand, and thus the ordinance permits police officers to choose which purposes are 
				<em>
					permissible
				</em>

				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 2.  But Chicago police officers enforcing the Ordinance are not looking for people with no apparent purpose (who are regrettably in oversupply); they are looking for people who remain in any one place with no apparent purposethat is, who remain there without any apparent reason 
				<em>
					for remaining there
				</em>
				.  That is not difficult to perceive.

				The Courts attempt to demonstrate the vagueness of the Ordinance produces the following peculiar statement: The no apparent purpose standard for making [the decision to issue an order to disperse] is inherently subjective because its application depends on whether some purpose is apparent to the officer on the scene.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 18.  In the Courts view, a persons lack of any purpose in staying in one location is presumably an 
				<em>
					objective
				</em>
				 factor, and what the Ordinance requires as a condition of an order to dispersethe absence of any 
				<em>
					apparent
				</em>
				 purposeis a 
				<em>
					subjective
				</em>
				 factor.  This side of the looking glass, just the opposite is true.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Elsewhere, of course, the Court acknowledges the clear, objective commands of the Ordinance, and indeed relies upon them to paint it as unfair:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				By its very terms, the ordinance encompasses a great deal of harmless behavior.  In any public place in the city of Chicago, persons who stand or sit in the company of a gang member may be ordered to disperse unless their purpose is apparent.  The mandatory language in the enactment directs the police to issue an order without first making any inquiry about their possible purposes.  It matters not whether the reason that a gang member and his father, for example, might loiter near Wrigley Field is to rob an unsuspecting fan or just to get a glimpse of Sammy Sosa leaving the ballpark; in either event, if their purpose is not apparent to a nearby police officer, she mayindeed, she shallorder them to disperse.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
Quite so.  And the fact that this clear instruction to the officers encompasses a great deal of harmless behavior would be invalidating if that harmless behavior were constitutionally protected against abridgment, such as speech or the practice of religion.  Remaining in one place is 
				<em>
					not

				The Court also assertsin apparent contradiction to the passage just quotedthat the apparent purpose test is too elastic because it presumably allows police officers to treat

				 violations as not warranting enforcement.

The problem, of course, well recognized by Chicagos City Council, is that the gang members cease their intimidating and unlawful behavior under the watchful eye of police officers, but return to it as soon as the police drive away.

				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 78, n. 17 (plurality opinion) (citing extant laws against intimidation, streetgang criminal drug conspiracy, and mob action).  The problem, again, is that the intimidation and lawlessness do not occur when the police are in sight.

				<em>
					Ante

				, at 3 (the Court agrees that this might be a cure, see 
				<em>
					ante

				, at 1819).  But the Ordinance already specifies to whom the order can be issued: persons remaining in one place with no apparent purpose in the company of a gang member.  And if remain[ing] in one place with no apparent purpose is so vague as to give the police unbridled discretion in controlling the conduct of non-gang-members, it surpasses understanding how it ceases to be so vague when applied to gang members 
				<em>

				The fact is that the present ordinance is entirely clear in its application, cannot be violated except with full knowledge and intent, and vests no more discretion in the police than innumerable other measures authorizing police orders to preserve the public peace and safety.  As suggested by their tortured analyses, and by their suggested solutions that bear no relation to the identified constitutional problem, the majoritys real quarrel with the Chicago Ordinance is simply that it permits (or indeed requires) too much harmless conduct by innocent citizens to be proscribed.  As 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice OConnor
				</span>
				s concurrence says with disapprobation, the ordinance applies to hundreds of thousands of persons who are 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 gang members, standing on any sidewalk or in any park, coffee shop, bar, or other location open to the public.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 23 (internal quotation marks omitted).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				But in our democratic system, how much harmless conduct to proscribe is not a judgment to be made by the courts.  So long as constitutionally guaranteed rights are not affected, and so long as the proscription has a rational basis, 
				<em>
					all sorts
				</em>
				 of perfectly harmless activity by millions of perfectly innocent people can be forbiddenriding a motorcycle without a safety helmet, for example, starting a campfire in a national forest, or selling a safe and effective drug not yet approved by the FDA.  All of these acts are entirely innocent and harmless in themselves, but because of the 
				<em>
					risk
				</em>
				 of harm that they entail, the freedom to engage in them has been abridged.  The citizens of Chicago have decided that depriving themselves of the freedom to hang out with a gang member is necessary to eliminate pervasive gang crime and intimidationand that the elimination of the one is worth the deprivation of the other.  This Court has no business second-guessing either the degree of necessity or the fairness of the trade.

						 In other words, a facial attack, since it requires unconstitutionality in all circumstances, necessarily presumes that the litigant presently before the court would be able to sustain an as-applied challenge.  See Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc.,

The plurality asserts that in United States v. Salerno, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/481/739" class="subref" title="subref">481 U. S. 739</a> (1987)
, which I discuss in text immediately following this footnote, the Court entertained a facial challenge even though the defendants . . . did not claim that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to them.  Ante, at 11, n. 22.  That is not so.  The Court made it absolutely clear in Salerno that a facial challenge requires the assertion that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid, 481 U. S., at 745 (emphasis added).  The footnoted statement upon which the plurality relies (Nor have respondents claimed that the Act is unconstitutional because of the way it was applied to the particular facts of their case, id., at 745, n. 3) was obviously meant to convey the fact that the defendants were not making, in addition to their facial challenge, an alternative as-applied challengei.e., asserting that even if the statute was not unconstitutional in all its applications it was at least unconstitutional in its particular application to them.

						 Salerno, a criminal case, repudiated the Courts statement in Kolender v. Lawson, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/461/352" class="subref" title="subref">461 U. S. 352</a>, n. 8 (1983), to the effect that a facial challenge to a criminal statute could succeed even when [the statute] could conceivably have had some valid application.  Kolender seems to have confused the standard for 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> overbreadth challenges with the standard governing facial challenges on all other grounds.  See ibid. (citing the Courts articulation of the standard for 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> overbreadth challenges from Hoffman Estates, supra, at 494).  As Salerno noted, 481 U. S., at 745, the overbreadth doctrine is a specialized exception to the general rule for facial challenges, justified in light of the risk that an overbroad statute will chill free expression.  See, e.g., Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/413/601" class="subref" title="subref">413 U. S. 601</a>,

						 The plurality asserts that the Salerno standard for facial challenge has never been the decisive factor in any decision of this Court.  It means by that only this: in rejecting a facial challenge, the Court has never contented itself with identifying only one situation in which the challenged statute would be constitutional, but has mentioned several.  But that is not at all remarkable, and casts no doubt upon the validity of the principle that Salerno and these many other cases enunciated.  It is difficult to conceive of a statute that would be constitutional in only a single applicationand hard to resist mentioning more than one.


The plurality contends that it does not matter whether the Salerno standard is federal law, since facial challenge is a species of third-party standing, and federal limitations upon third-party standing do not apply in an appeal from a state decision which takes a broader view, as the Illinois Supreme Courts opinion did here.  Ante, at 11, n. 22.  This is quite wrong.  Disagreement over the Salerno rule is not a disagreement over the standing question of whether the person challenging the statute can raise the rights of third parties: under both Salerno and the plurality's rule he can.  The disagreement relates to how many third-party rights he must prove to be infringed by the statute before he can win: Salerno says all (in addition to his own rights), the plurality says many.  That is not a question of standing but of substantive law.  The notion that, if Salerno is the federal rule (a federal statute is not totally invalid unless it is invalid in all its applications), it can be altered by a state court (a federal statute is totally invalid if it is invalid in many of its applications), and that that alteration must be accepted by the Supreme Court of the United States is, to put it as gently as possible, remarkable.

I am simply assuming that when the plurality says (as an essential part of its reasoning) that the right to loiter for innocent purposes is . . . a part of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause it does not believe that the same word (liberty) means one thing for purposes of substantive due process and something else for purposes of procedural due process.  There is no authority for that startling proposition.  See Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/408/564" class="subref" title="subref">408 U. S. 564</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">572</a>575 (1972)
 (rejecting procedural-due-process claim for lack of liberty interest, and citing substantive-due-process cases).


The pluralitys opinion seeks to have it both ways, invoking the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>s august protection of liberty in defining the standard of certainty that it sets, but then, in identifying the conduct protected by that high standard, ignoring our extensive case-law defining liberty, and substituting, instead, all harmless and innocent conduct, ante, at 14.

						 I call it a suggestion because the plurality says only that the terms of the dispersal order compound the inadequacy of the notice, and acknowledges that they might not render the ordinance unconstitutionally vague if the definition of the forbidden conduct were clear.  Ante, at 15, 16.  This notion that a prescription (Disperse!) which is itself not unconstitutionally vague can somehow contribute to the unconstitutional vagueness of the entire scheme is full of mysterysuspending, as it does, the metaphysical principle that nothing can confer what it does not possess (nemo dat qui non habet).

						 Justice Breyer asserts that one always has some apparent purpose, so that the policeman must interpret the words no apparent purpose as meaning no apparent purpose except for . . . .  Ante, at 12.  It is simply not true that one always has some apparent purposeand especially not true that one always has some apparent purpose in remaining at rest, for the simple reason that one often (indeed, perhaps usually) has no actual purpose in remaining at rest.  Remaining at rest will be a persons normal state, unless he has a purpose which causes him to move.  That is why one frequently reads of a persons wandering aimlessly (which is worthy of note) but not of a persons sitting aimlessly (which is not remarkable at all).  And that is why a synonym for purpose is motive: that which causes one to move.

						 The Court also speculates that a police officer may exercise his discretion to enforce the Ordinance and direct dispersal when (in the Courts view) the Ordinance is inapplicableviz., where there is an apparent purpose, but it is an unlawful one.  See ante, at 18.  No one in his right mind would read the phrase without any apparent purpose to mean anything other than without any apparent lawful purpose.  The implication that acts referred to approvingly in statutory language are lawful acts is routine.  The Court asserts that the Illinois Supreme Court has forced it into this interpretive inanity because, since it has not placed any limiting construction on the language in the ordinance, we must assume that the ordinance means what it says . . . .  Ante, at 19.  But the Illinois Supreme Court did not mention this particular interpretive issue, which has nothing to do with giving the Ordinance a limiting interpretation, and everything to do with giving it its ordinary legal meaning.

				The citizens of Chicago were once free to drive about the city at whatever speed they wished.  At some point Chicagoans (or perhaps Illinoisans) decided this would not do, and imposed prophylactic speed limits designed to assure safe operation by the average (or perhaps even subaverage) driver with the average (or perhaps even subaverage) vehicle.  This infringed upon the freedom of all citizens, but was not unconstitutional.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Similarly, the citizens of Chicago were once free to stand around and gawk at the scene of an accident.  At some point Chicagoans discovered that this obstructed traffic and caused more accidents.  They did not make the practice unlawful, but they did authorize police officers to order the crowd to disperse, and imposed penalties for refusal to obey such an order.  Again, this prophylactic measure infringed upon the freedom of all citizens, but was not unconstitutional.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Until the ordinance that is before us today was adopted, the citizens of Chicago were free to stand about in public places with no apparent purposeto engage, that is, in conduct that appeared to be loitering.  In recent years, however, the city has been afflicted with criminal street gangs.  As reflected in the record before us, these gangs congregated in public places to deal in drugs, and to terrorize the neighborhoods by demonstrating control over their turf.  Many residents of the inner city felt that they were prisoners in their own homes.  Once again, Chicagoans decided that to eliminate the problem it was worth restricting some of the freedom that they once enjoyed.  The means they took was similar to the second, and more mild, example given above rather than the first: Loitering was not made unlawful, but when a group of people occupied a public place without an apparent purpose and in the company of a known gang member, police officers were authorized to order them to disperse, and the failure to obey such an order was made unlawful.  See Chicago Municipal Code §84015 (1992).  The minor limitation upon the free state of nature that this prophylactic arrangement imposed upon all Chicagoans seemed to them (and it seems to me) a small price to pay for liberation of their streets.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The majority today invalidates this perfectly reasonable measure by ignoring our rules governing facial challenges, by elevating loitering to a constitutionally guaranteed right, and by discerning vagueness where, according to our usual standards, none exists.

				Respondents consolidated appeal presents a facial challenge to the Chicago Ordinance on vagueness grounds.  When a facial challenge is successful, the law in question is declared to be unenforceable in 
				<em>
					all
				</em>
				 its applications, and not just in its particular application to the party in suit.  To tell the truth, it is highly questionable whether federal courts have any business making such a declaration.  The rationale for our power to review federal legislation for constitutionality, expressed in 
				<em>
					Marbury
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Madison
				</em>
				, 1 Cranch 137 (1803), was that we 
				<em>
					had
				</em>
				 to do so in order to decide the case before us.  But that rationale only extends so far as to require us to determine that the statute is unconstitutional as applied to

				 party, in the circumstances of 
				<em>
					this

				The second characteristic of judicial power is, that it pronounces on special cases, and not upon general principles.  If a judge, in deciding a particular point, destroys a general principle by passing a judgment which tends to reject all the inferences from that principle, and consequently to annul it, he remains within the ordinary limits of his functions.  But if he directly attacks a general principle without having a particular case in view, he leaves the circle in which all nations have agreed to confine his authority; he assumes a more important, and perhaps a more useful influence, than that of the magistrate; but he ceases to represent the judicial power.

				Whenever a law which the judge holds to be unconstitutional is invoked in a tribunal of the United States, he may refuse to admit it as a rule … .  But as soon as a judge has refused to apply any given law in a case, that law immediately loses a portion of its moral force.  Those to whom it is prejudicial learn that means exist of overcoming its authority; and similar suits are multiplied, until it becomes powerless. … The political power which the Americans have entrusted to their courts of justice is therefore immense; but the evils of this power are considerably diminished by the impossibility of attacking the laws except through the courts of justice. …  [W]hen a judge contests a law in an obscure debate on some particular case, the importance of his attack is concealed from public notice; his decision bears upon the interest of an individual, and the law is slighted only incidentally.  Moreover, although it is censured, it is not abolished; its moral force may be diminished, but its authority is not taken away; and its final destruction can be accomplished only by the reiterated attacks of judicial functionaries.  Democracy in America 73, 7576 (R.

				The very foundation of the power of the federal courts to declare Acts of Congress unconstitutional lies in the power and duty of those courts to decide cases and controversies before them. . . .  This Court, as is the case with all federal courts, has no jurisdiction to pronounce any statute, either of a State or of the United States, void, because irreconcilable with the Constitution, except as it is called upon to adjudge the legal rights of litigants in actual controversies.  In the exercise of that jurisdiction, it is bound by two rules, to which it has rigidly adhered, one, never to anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it; the other never to formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied. . . .  Kindred to these rules is the rule that one to whom application of a statute is constitutional will not be heard to attack the statute on the ground that impliedly it might also be taken as applying to other persons or other situations in which its application might be unconstitutional. . . .  The delicate power of pronouncing an Act of Congress unconstitutional is not to be exercised with reference to hypothetical cases thus imagined.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				It seems to me fundamentally incompatible with this system for the Court not to be content to find that a statute is unconstitutional as applied to the person before it, but to go further and pronounce that the statute is unconstitutional in 
				<em>
					all
				</em>
				 applications.  Its reasoning may well suggest as much, but to pronounce a 
				<em>
					holding
				</em>
				 on that point seems to me no more than an advisory opinionwhich a federal court should never issue at all, see 
				<em>
					Hayburns Case
				</em>
				, 2 Dall. 409 (1792), and 
				<em>
					especially
				</em>
				 should not issue with regard to a constitutional question, as to which we seek to avoid even

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">347</a> (1936)
 (Brandeis, J., concurring).  I think it quite improper, in short, to ask the constitutional claimant before us: Do you just want us to say that this statute cannot constitutionally be applied to you in this case, or do you want to go for broke and try to get the statute pronounced void in all its applications?

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I must acknowledge, however, that for some of the present century we have done just this.  But until recently, at least, we haveexcept in free-speech cases subject to the doctrine of overbreadth, see,

				<em>
					unconstitutional
				</em>
				 in all its applications.  (I say that is an eminently reasonable requirement, not only because we should not be holding a statute void in all its applications unless it is unconstitutional in all its applications, but also because 
				<em>
					unless
				</em>
				 it is unconstitutional in all its applications we do not even know, without conducting an as-applied analysis, whether it is void with regard to the very litigant

				When our normal criteria for facial challenges are applied, it is clear that the Justices in the majority have transposed the burden of proof.  Instead of requiring the respondents, who are challenging the Ordinance, to show that it is invalid in all its applications, they have required the petitioner to show that it is valid in all its applications.  Both the plurality opinion and the concurrences display a lively imagination, creating hypothetical situations in which the laws application would (in their view) be ambiguous.  But that creative role has been usurped from the petitioner, who can defeat the respondents facial challenge by conjuring up 
				<em>
					a single valid application
				</em>
				 of the law.  My contribution would go something like this

				: Tony, a member of the Jets criminal street gang, is standing alongside and chatting with fellow gang members while staking out their turf at Promontory Point on the South Side of Chicago; the group is flashing gang signs and displaying their distinctive tattoos to passersby.  Officer Krupke, applying the Ordinance at issue here, orders the group to disperse.  After some speculative discussion (probably irrelevant here) over whether the Jets are depraved because they are deprived, Tony and the other gang members break off further conversation with the statementnot entirely coherent, but evidently intended to be rudeGee, Officer Krupke, krup you.  A tense standoff ensues until Officer Krupke arrests the group for failing to obey his dispersal order.  Even assuming (as the Justices in the majority do, but I do not) that a law requiring obedience to a dispersal order is impermissibly vague unless it is clear to the objects of the order, before its issuance, that their conduct justifies it, I find it hard to believe that the Jets would not have known they had it coming.  That should settle the matter of respondents facial challenge to the Ordinances vagueness.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Of course respondents would still be able to claim that the Ordinance was vague as applied to them.  But the ultimate demonstration of the inappropriateness of the Courts holding of 
				<em>
					facial 
				</em>
				invalidity is the fact that it is doubtful whether some of these respondents could even sustain an 
				<em>
					as-applied 
				</em>
				challenge on the basis of the majoritys own criteria.  For instance, respondent Jose Renteriawho admitted that he was a member of the Satan Disciples gangwas observed by the arresting officer loitering on a street corner with other gang members.  The officer issued a dispersal order, but when she returned to the same corner 15 to 20 minutes later, Renteria was still there with his friends, whereupon he was arrested.  In another example, respondent Daniel Washington and several otherswho admitted they were members of the Vice Lords gangwere observed by the arresting officer loitering in the street, yelling at passing vehicles, stopping traffic, and preventing pedestrians from using the sidewalks.  The arresting officer issued a dispersal order, issued 
				<em>
					another
				</em>
				 dispersal order later when the group did not move, and finally arrested the group when they were found loitering in the same place still later.  Finally, respondent Gregorio Gutierrezwho had previously admitted to the arresting officer his membership in the Latin Kings gangwas observed loitering with two other men.  The officer issued a dispersal order, drove around the block, and arrested the men after finding them in the same place upon his return.  See Brief for Petitioner 7, n. 5; Brief for United States as 
				<em>
					Amicus Curiae
				</em>
				 16, n. 11.  Even on the majoritys assumption that to avoid vagueness it must be clear to the object of the dispersal order 
				<em>
					ex ante
				</em>
				 that his conduct is covered by the Ordinance, it seems most improbable that any of these as-applied challenges would be sustained.  Much less is it possible to say that the Ordinance is invalid in 
				<em>
					all 
				</em>
				its applications.

				The plurality's explanation for its departure from the usual rule governing facial challenges is seemingly contained in the following statement: [This] is a criminal law that contains no 
				<em>
					mens rea
				</em>
				 requirement … 
				<em>
					and
				</em>
				 infringes on constitutionally protected rights … .  When vagueness permeates the text of

				<em>
					mens rea 
				</em>
				requirement)   (infringement of constitutionally protected right)   (vagueness) = (entitlement to facial invalidation).  There is no such formula; the plurality has made it up for this case, as the absence of any citation demonstrates.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				But no matter.  None of the three factors that the plurality relies upon exists anyway.  I turn first to the support for the proposition that there is a constitutionally protected right to loiteror, as the plurality more favorably describes it, for a person to remain in a public place of his choice.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  The plurality thinks much of this Fundamental Freedom to Loiter, which it contrasts with such lesser, constitutionally 
				<em>
					un
				</em>
				protected, activities as doing (ugh!) 
				<em>
					business
				</em>
				: This is not an ordinance that simply regulates business behavior and contains a scienter requirement. . . . It is a criminal law that contains no 
				<em>
					mens rea
				</em>
				 requirement . . . and infringes on constitutionally protected rights.  
				<em>

				Of course every activity, even scratching ones head, can be called a constitutional right if one means by that term nothing more than the fact that the activity is covered (as all are) by the Equal Protection Clause, so that those who engage in it cannot be singled out without rational basis.  See

				It would be unfair, however, to criticize the pluralitys failed attempt to establish that loitering is a constitutionally protected right while saying nothing of the concurrences.  The plurality at least makes an attempt.  The concurrences, on the other hand, make no pretense at attaching their broad vagueness invalidates rule to a liberty interest.  As far as appears from 
				<span class="smallcaps">

				s and 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Breyer
				</span>
				s opinions, 
				<em>
					no

				 police officer may issue 
				<em>
					any
				</em>
				 order, affecting 
				<em>
					any
				</em>
				 insignificant sort of citizen conduct (except, perhaps, an order addressed to the unprotected class of gang members) unless the standards for the issuance of that order are precise.  No mod-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				ern urban societyand probably none since London got big enough to have sewerscould function under such a rule.  There are innumerable reasons why it may be im-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				portant for a constable to tell a pedestrian to move onand even if it were possible to list in an ordinance all of the reasons that are known, many are simply unpredictable.  Hence the (entirely reasonable) Rule of the City of New York which reads: No person shall fail, neglect or refuse to comply with the lawful direction or command of any Police Officer, Urban Park Ranger, Parks Enforcement Patrol Officer or other [Parks and Recreation] Department employee, indicated by gesture or otherwise.  56 RCNY §103(c)(1) (1996).  It is one thing to uphold an as applied challenge when a pedestrian disobeys such an order that is unreasonableor even when a pedestrian asserting some true liberty interest (holding a political rally, for instance) disobeys such an order that is reasonable 
				<em>
					but unexplained
				</em>
				.  But to say that such a general ordinance permitting lawful orders is void 
				<em>
					in all its applications

				 demands more than a safe and orderly society can reasonably deliver.

        <p class="bodytext">
            <span class="smallcaps">

But his only explanation of why the present interference with the right to loiter does not fall within that permitted scope of action is as follows: The predicate of an order to disperse is not, in my view, sufficient to eliminate doubts regarding the adequacy of notice under this ordinance.

				I turn next to that element of the plurality's facial-challenge formula which consists of the proposition that this criminal ordinance contains no 
				<em>
					mens rea 
				</em>
				requirement.  The first step in analyzing this proposition is to determine what the 
				<em>
					actus reus
				</em>
				, to which that 
				<em>
					mens rea
				</em>
				 is supposed to be attached, consists of.  The majority believes that loitering forms part of (indeed, the essence of) the offense, and must be proved if conviction is to be obtained.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 2, 6, 913, 1415, 1618 (plurality and majority opinions); 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 23, 4 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					OConnor, J.
				</span>
				, concurring in part and concurring in judgment); 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 12 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Kennedy, J
				</span>
				., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 34 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Breyer, J
				</span>
				., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  That is not what the Ordinance provides.  The only part of the Ordinance that refers to loitering is the portion that addresses, not the punishable conduct of the defendant, but what the police officer must observe before he can issue an order to disperse; and what he must observe is carefully defined in terms of what the defendant 
				<em>
					appears
				</em>
				 to be doing, not in terms of what the defendant is 
				<em>
					actually
				</em>
				 doing.  The Ordinance does not require that the defendant have been loitering (
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, have been remaining in one place with no purpose), but rather that the police officer have observed him remaining in one place without any 
				<em>
					apparent
				</em>
				 purpose.  Someone who in fact 
				<em>
					has
				</em>
				 a genuine purpose for remaining where he is (waiting for a friend, for example, or waiting to hold up a bank) 
				<em>
					can
				</em>
				 be ordered to move on (assuming the other conditions of the Ordinance are met), so long as his remaining has no 
				<em>
					apparent
				</em>
				 purpose.  It is likely, to be sure, that the Ordinance will come down most heavily upon those who are 
				<em>
					actually 
				</em>
				loitering (those who 
				<em>
					really
				</em>
				 have no purpose in remaining where they are); but that activity is not a condition for issuance of the dispersal order.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The 
				<em>
					only
				</em>
				 act of a defendant that is made punishable by the Ordinanceor, indeed, that is even mentioned by the Ordinanceis his failure to promptly obey an order to disperse.  The question, then, is whether that 
				<em>
					actus reus
				</em>
				 must be accompanied by any wrongful intentand of course it must.  As the Court itself describes the requirement, a person must 
				<em>
					disobey
				</em>
				 the officers order.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 3 (emphasis added).  No one thinks a defendant could be successfully prosecuted under the Ordinance if he did not hear the order to disperse, or if he suffered a paralysis that rendered his compliance impossible.  The willful failure to obey a police order is wrongful intent enough.

				Finally, I address the last of the three factors in the plurality's facial-challenge formula: the proposition that the Ordinance is vague.  It is not.  Even under the ersatz overbreadth standard applied in

S. 352</a> n. 8 (1983), which allows facial challenges if a law reaches a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct, respondents claim fails because the Ordinance would not be vague in most or even a substantial number of applications.  A law is unconstitutionally vague if its lack of definitive standards either (1) fails to apprise persons of ordinary intelligence of the prohibited conduct, or (2) encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The plurality relies primarily upon the first of these aspects.  Since, it reasons, the loitering is the conduct that the ordinance is designed to prohibit, and an officer may issue an order only after prohibited conduct has already occurred, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 14, 15, the order to disperse cannot itself serve to apprise persons of ordinary intelligence of the prohibited conduct.  What counts for purposes of vagueness analysis, however, is not what the Ordinance is designed to prohibit, but what it actually subjects to criminal penalty.  As discussed earlier, that consists of nothing but the refusal to obey a dispersal order, as to which there is no doubt of adequate notice of the prohibited conduct.  The plurality's suggestion that even the dispersal order 
				<em>
					itself
				</em>
				 is unconstitutionally vague, because it does not specify 
				<em>
					how far to disperse (!)
				</em>
				, see 
				<em>

				The criteria for issuance of a dispersal order under the Chicago Ordinance could hardly be clearer.  First, the law requires police officers to reasonably believ[e] that one of the group to which the order is issued is a criminal street gang member.  This resembles a probable-cause standard, and the Chicago Police Departments General Order 924 (1992)promulgated to govern enforcement of the Ordinancemakes the probable cause requirement explicit.

            </a>
				  Under the Order, officers must have probable cause to believe that an individual is a member of a criminal street gang, to be substantiated by the officers experience and knowledge of the alleged offenders and by specific, documented and reliable information such as reliable witness testimony or an individuals admission of gang membership or display of distinctive colors, tattoos, signs, or other markings worn by members of particular criminal street gangs.

				Second, the Ordinance requires that the group be remain[ing] in one place with no apparent purpose.  
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice OConnor
				</span>
				s assertion that this applies to any person standing in a public place,

The Ordinance does not apply to standing, but to remain[ing]a term which in this context obviously means [to] endure or persist, see American Heritage Dictionary 1525 (1992).  There may be some ambiguity at the margin, but remain[ing] in one place requires more than a temporary stop, and is clear in most of its applications, including all of those represented by the facts surrounding the respondents arrests described

				As for the phrase with no apparent purpose: 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice OConnor
				</span>
				 again distorts this adjectival phrase, by separating it from the word that it modifies.  [A]ny person standing on the street, her concurrence says, has a general purposeeven if it is simply to stand, and thus the ordinance permits police officers to choose which purposes are 
				<em>
					permissible
				</em>
				.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 2.  But Chicago police officers enforcing the Ordinance are not looking for people with no apparent purpose (who are regrettably in oversupply); they are looking for people who remain in any one place with no apparent purposethat is, who remain there without any apparent reason 
				<em>
					for remaining there
				</em>
				.  That is not difficult to perceive.

				The Courts attempt to demonstrate the vagueness of the Ordinance produces the following peculiar statement: The no apparent purpose standard for making [the decision to issue an order to disperse] is inherently subjective because its application depends on whether some purpose is apparent to the officer on the scene.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 18.  In the Courts view, a persons lack of any purpose in staying in one location is presumably an 
				<em>
					objective
				</em>
				 factor, and what the Ordinance requires as a condition of an order to dispersethe absence of any 
				<em>
					apparent
				</em>
				 purposeis a 
				<em>
					subjective
				</em>
				 factor.  This side of the looking glass, just the opposite is true.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Elsewhere, of course, the Court acknowledges the clear, objective commands of the Ordinance, and indeed relies upon them to paint it as unfair:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				By its very terms, the ordinance encompasses a great deal of harmless behavior.  In any public place in the city of Chicago, persons who stand or sit in the company of a gang member may be ordered to disperse unless their purpose is apparent.  The mandatory language in the enactment directs the police to issue an order without first making any inquiry about their possible purposes.  It matters not whether the reason that a gang member and his father, for example, might loiter near Wrigley Field is to rob an unsuspecting fan or just to get a glimpse of Sammy Sosa leaving the ballpark; in either event, if their purpose is not apparent to a nearby police officer, she mayindeed, she shallorder them to disperse.

Quite so.  And the fact that this clear instruction to the officers encompasses a great deal of harmless behavior would be invalidating if that harmless behavior were constitutionally protected against abridgment, such as speech or the practice of religion.  Remaining in one place is 
				<em>

				The Court also assertsin apparent contradiction to the passage just quotedthat the apparent purpose test is too elastic because it presumably allows police officers to treat

				 violations as not warranting enforcement.

The problem, of course, well recognized by Chicagos City Council, is that the gang members cease their intimidating and unlawful behavior under the watchful eye of police officers, but return to it as soon as the police drive away.

				<em>
					Ante

				, at 78, n. 17 (plurality opinion) (citing extant laws against intimidation, streetgang criminal drug conspiracy, and mob action).  The problem, again, is that the intimidation and lawlessness do not occur when the police are in sight.

				<em>
					Ante

				, at 3 (the Court agrees that this might be a cure, see 
				<em>
					ante

				, at 1819).  But the Ordinance already specifies to whom the order can be issued: persons remaining in one place with no apparent purpose in the company of a gang member.  And if remain[ing] in one place with no apparent purpose is so vague as to give the police unbridled discretion in controlling the conduct of non-gang-members, it surpasses understanding how it ceases to be so vague when applied to gang members 
				<em>

				The fact is that the present ordinance is entirely clear in its application, cannot be violated except with full knowledge and intent, and vests no more discretion in the police than innumerable other measures authorizing police orders to preserve the public peace and safety.  As suggested by their tortured analyses, and by their suggested solutions that bear no relation to the identified constitutional problem, the majoritys real quarrel with the Chicago Ordinance is simply that it permits (or indeed requires) too much harmless conduct by innocent citizens to be proscribed.  As 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice OConnor
				</span>
				s concurrence says with disapprobation, the ordinance applies to hundreds of thousands of persons who are 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 gang members, standing on any sidewalk or in any park, coffee shop, bar, or other location open to the public.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 23 (internal quotation marks omitted).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				But in our democratic system, how much harmless conduct to proscribe is not a judgment to be made by the courts.  So long as constitutionally guaranteed rights are not affected, and so long as the proscription has a rational basis, 
				<em>
					all sorts
				</em>
				 of perfectly harmless activity by millions of perfectly innocent people can be forbiddenriding a motorcycle without a safety helmet, for example, starting a campfire in a national forest, or selling a safe and effective drug not yet approved by the FDA.  All of these acts are entirely innocent and harmless in themselves, but because of the 
				<em>
					risk
				</em>
				 of harm that they entail, the freedom to engage in them has been abridged.  The citizens of Chicago have decided that depriving themselves of the freedom to hang out with a gang member is necessary to eliminate pervasive gang crime and intimidationand that the elimination of the one is worth the deprivation of the other.  This Court has no business second-guessing either the degree of necessity or the fairness of the trade.

						 In other words, a facial attack, since it requires unconstitutionality in all circumstances, necessarily presumes that the litigant presently before the court would be able to sustain an as-applied challenge.  See Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc.,

The plurality asserts that in United States v. Salerno, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/481/739" class="subref" title="subref">481 U. S. 739</a> (1987)
, which I discuss in text immediately following this footnote, the Court entertained a facial challenge even though the defendants . . . did not claim that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to them.  Ante, at 11, n. 22.  That is not so.  The Court made it absolutely clear in Salerno that a facial challenge requires the assertion that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid, 481 U. S., at 745 (emphasis added).  The footnoted statement upon which the plurality relies (Nor have respondents claimed that the Act is unconstitutional because of the way it was applied to the particular facts of their case, id., at 745, n. 3) was obviously meant to convey the fact that the defendants were not making, in addition to their facial challenge, an alternative as-applied challengei.e., asserting that even if the statute was not unconstitutional in all its applications it was at least unconstitutional in its particular application to them.

						 Salerno, a criminal case, repudiated the Courts statement in Kolender v. Lawson, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/461/352" class="subref" title="subref">461 U. S. 352</a>, n. 8 (1983), to the effect that a facial challenge to a criminal statute could succeed even when [the statute] could conceivably have had some valid application.  Kolender seems to have confused the standard for 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> overbreadth challenges with the standard governing facial challenges on all other grounds.  See ibid. (citing the Courts articulation of the standard for 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> overbreadth challenges from Hoffman Estates, supra, at 494).  As Salerno noted, 481 U. S., at 745, the overbreadth doctrine is a specialized exception to the general rule for facial challenges, justified in light of the risk that an overbroad statute will chill free expression.  See, e.g., Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/413/601" class="subref" title="subref">413 U. S. 601</a>,

						 The plurality asserts that the Salerno standard for facial challenge has never been the decisive factor in any decision of this Court.  It means by that only this: in rejecting a facial challenge, the Court has never contented itself with identifying only one situation in which the challenged statute would be constitutional, but has mentioned several.  But that is not at all remarkable, and casts no doubt upon the validity of the principle that Salerno and these many other cases enunciated.  It is difficult to conceive of a statute that would be constitutional in only a single applicationand hard to resist mentioning more than one.


The plurality contends that it does not matter whether the Salerno standard is federal law, since facial challenge is a species of third-party standing, and federal limitations upon third-party standing do not apply in an appeal from a state decision which takes a broader view, as the Illinois Supreme Courts opinion did here.  Ante, at 11, n. 22.  This is quite wrong.  Disagreement over the Salerno rule is not a disagreement over the standing question of whether the person challenging the statute can raise the rights of third parties: under both Salerno and the plurality's rule he can.  The disagreement relates to how many third-party rights he must prove to be infringed by the statute before he can win: Salerno says all (in addition to his own rights), the plurality says many.  That is not a question of standing but of substantive law.  The notion that, if Salerno is the federal rule (a federal statute is not totally invalid unless it is invalid in all its applications), it can be altered by a state court (a federal statute is totally invalid if it is invalid in many of its applications), and that that alteration must be accepted by the Supreme Court of the United States is, to put it as gently as possible, remarkable.

If a careless reader were inclined to confuse the term social gatherings in this passage with loitering, his confusion would be eliminated by pursuing the reference to Part II of the brief, which says, in its introductory paragraph: [A]s we explain below, substantive due process does not support the courts novel holding that the Constitution secures the right to stand still on the public way even when one is not engaged in speech, assembly, or other conduct that enjoys affirmative constitutional protection.  Id., at 39.

Glucksberg.  Ibid.  But I am not analyzing it under that framework.  I am simply assuming that when the plurality says (as an essential part of its reasoning) that the right to loiter for innocent purposes is . . . a part of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause it does not believe that the same word (liberty) means one thing for purposes of substantive due process and something else for purposes of procedural due process.  There is no authority for that startling proposition.  See Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth,

The pluralitys opinion seeks to have it both ways, invoking the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>s august protection of liberty in defining the standard of certainty that it sets, but then, in identifying the conduct protected by that high standard, ignoring our extensive case-law defining liberty, and substituting, instead, all harmless and innocent conduct, ante, at 14.

This notion that a prescription (Disperse!) which is itself not unconstitutionally vague can somehow contribute to the unconstitutional vagueness of the entire scheme is full of mysterysuspending, as it does, the metaphysical principle that nothing can confer what it does not possess (nemo dat qui non habet).

						 Administrative interpretation and implementation of a regulation are … highly relevant to our [vagueness] analysis, for [i]n evaluating a facial challenge to a state law, a federal court must … consider any limiting construction that a state court or enforcement agency has proffered.   Ward v.

						 Justice Breyer asserts that one always has some apparent purpose, so that the policeman must interpret the words no apparent purpose as meaning no apparent purpose except for . . . .  Ante, at 12.  It is simply not true that one always has some apparent purposeand especially not true that one always has some apparent purpose in remaining at rest, for the simple reason that one often (indeed, perhaps usually) has no actual purpose in remaining at rest.  Remaining at rest will be a persons normal state, unless he has a purpose which causes him to move.  That is why one frequently reads of a persons wandering aimlessly (which is worthy of note) but not of a persons sitting aimlessly (which is not remarkable at all).  And that is why a synonym for purpose is motive: that which causes one to move.

						 The Court also speculates that a police officer may exercise his discretion to enforce the Ordinance and direct dispersal when (in the Courts view) the Ordinance is inapplicableviz., where there is an apparent purpose, but it is an unlawful one.  See ante, at 18.  No one in his right mind would read the phrase without any apparent purpose to mean anything other than without any apparent lawful purpose.  The implication that acts referred to approvingly in statutory language are lawful acts is routine.  The Court asserts that the Illinois Supreme Court has forced it into this interpretive inanity because, since it has not placed any limiting construction on the language in the ordinance, we must assume that the ordinance means what it says . . . .  Ante, at 19.  But the Illinois Supreme Court did not mention this particular interpretive issue, which has nothing to do with giving the Ordinance a limiting interpretation, and everything to do with giving it its ordinary legal meaning.

				The citizens of Chicago were once free to drive about the city at whatever speed they wished.  At some point Chicagoans (or perhaps Illinoisans) decided this would not do, and imposed prophylactic speed limits designed to assure safe operation by the average (or perhaps even subaverage) driver with the average (or perhaps even subaverage) vehicle.  This infringed upon the freedom of all citizens, but was not unconstitutional.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Similarly, the citizens of Chicago were once free to stand around and gawk at the scene of an accident.  At some point Chicagoans discovered that this obstructed traffic and caused more accidents.  They did not make the practice unlawful, but they did authorize police officers to order the crowd to disperse, and imposed penalties for refusal to obey such an order.  Again, this prophylactic measure infringed upon the freedom of all citizens, but was not unconstitutional.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Until the ordinance that is before us today was adopted, the citizens of Chicago were free to stand about in public places with no apparent purposeto engage, that is, in conduct that appeared to be loitering.  In recent years, however, the city has been afflicted with criminal street gangs.  As reflected in the record before us, these gangs congregated in public places to deal in drugs, and to terrorize the neighborhoods by demonstrating control over their turf.  Many residents of the inner city felt that they were prisoners in their own homes.  Once again, Chicagoans decided that to eliminate the problem it was worth restricting some of the freedom that they once enjoyed.  The means they took was similar to the second, and more mild, example given above rather than the first: Loitering was not made unlawful, but when a group of people occupied a public place without an apparent purpose and in the company of a known gang member, police officers were authorized to order them to disperse, and the failure to obey such an order was made unlawful.  See Chicago Municipal Code §84015 (1992).  The minor limitation upon the free state of nature that this prophylactic arrangement imposed upon all Chicagoans seemed to them (and it seems to me) a small price to pay for liberation of their streets.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The majority today invalidates this perfectly reasonable measure by ignoring our rules governing facial challenges, by elevating loitering to a constitutionally guaranteed right, and by discerning vagueness where, according to our usual standards, none exists.

				Respondents consolidated appeal presents a facial challenge to the Chicago Ordinance on vagueness grounds.  When a facial challenge is successful, the law in question is declared to be unenforceable in 
				<em>
					all
				</em>
				 its applications, and not just in its particular application to the party in suit.  To tell the truth, it is highly questionable whether federal courts have any business making such a declaration.  The rationale for our power to review federal legislation for constitutionality, expressed in 
				<em>
					Marbury
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Madison
				</em>
				, 1 Cranch 137 (1803), was that we 
				<em>
					had
				</em>
				 to do so in order to decide the case before us.  But that rationale only extends so far as to require us to determine that the statute is unconstitutional as applied to

				The second characteristic of judicial power is, that it pronounces on special cases, and not upon general principles.  If a judge, in deciding a particular point, destroys a general principle by passing a judgment which tends to reject all the inferences from that principle, and consequently to annul it, he remains within the ordinary limits of his functions.  But if he directly attacks a general principle without having a particular case in view, he leaves the circle in which all nations have agreed to confine his authority; he assumes a more important, and perhaps a more useful influence, than that of the magistrate; but he ceases to represent the judicial power.

				Whenever a law which the judge holds to be unconstitutional is invoked in a tribunal of the United States, he may refuse to admit it as a rule … .  But as soon as a judge has refused to apply any given law in a case, that law immediately loses a portion of its moral force.  Those to whom it is prejudicial learn that means exist of overcoming its authority; and similar suits are multiplied, until it becomes powerless. … The political power which the Americans have entrusted to their courts of justice is therefore immense; but the evils of this power are considerably diminished by the impossibility of attacking the laws except through the courts of justice. …  [W]hen a judge contests a law in an obscure debate on some particular case, the importance of his attack is concealed from public notice; his decision bears upon the interest of an individual, and the law is slighted only incidentally.  Moreover, although it is censured, it is not abolished; its moral force may be diminished, but its authority is not taken away; and its final destruction can be accomplished only by the reiterated attacks of judicial functionaries.  Democracy in America 73, 7576 (R.

				The very foundation of the power of the federal courts to declare Acts of Congress unconstitutional lies in the power and duty of those courts to decide cases and controversies before them. . . .  This Court, as is the case with all federal courts, has no jurisdiction to pronounce any statute, either of a State or of the United States, void, because irreconcilable with the Constitution, except as it is called upon to adjudge the legal rights of litigants in actual controversies.  In the exercise of that jurisdiction, it is bound by two rules, to which it has rigidly adhered, one, never to anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it; the other never to formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied. . . .  Kindred to these rules is the rule that one to whom application of a statute is constitutional will not be heard to attack the statute on the ground that impliedly it might also be taken as applying to other persons or other situations in which its application might be unconstitutional. . . .  The delicate power of pronouncing an Act of Congress unconstitutional is not to be exercised with reference to hypothetical cases thus imagined.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				It seems to me fundamentally incompatible with this system for the Court not to be content to find that a statute is unconstitutional as applied to the person before it, but to go further and pronounce that the statute is unconstitutional in 
				<em>
					all
				</em>
				 applications.  Its reasoning may well suggest as much, but to pronounce a 
				<em>
					holding
				</em>
				 on that point seems to me no more than an advisory opinionwhich a federal court should never issue at all, see 
				<em>
					Hayburns Case
				</em>
				, 2 Dall. 409 (1792), and 
				<em>
					especially
				</em>
				 should not issue with regard to a constitutional question, as to which we seek to avoid even

 (Brandeis, J., concurring).  I think it quite improper, in short, to ask the constitutional claimant before us: Do you just want us to say that this statute cannot constitutionally be applied to you in this case, or do you want to go for broke and try to get the statute pronounced void in all its applications?

				I must acknowledge, however, that for some of the present century we have done just this.  But until recently, at least, we haveexcept in free-speech cases subject to the doctrine of overbreadth, see,

				<em>
					unconstitutional
				</em>
				 in all its applications.  (I say that is an eminently reasonable requirement, not only because we should not be holding a statute void in all its applications unless it is unconstitutional in all its applications, but also because 
				<em>
					unless
				</em>
				 it is unconstitutional in all its applications we do not even know, without conducting an as-applied analysis, whether it is void with regard to the very litigant

				When our normal criteria for facial challenges are applied, it is clear that the Justices in the majority have transposed the burden of proof.  Instead of requiring the respondents, who are challenging the Ordinance, to show that it is invalid in all its applications, they have required the petitioner to show that it is valid in all its applications.  Both the plurality opinion and the concurrences display a lively imagination, creating hypothetical situations in which the laws application would (in their view) be ambiguous.  But that creative role has been usurped from the petitioner, who can defeat the respondents facial challenge by conjuring up 
				<em>
					a single valid application

				 of the law.  My contribution would go something like this

				: Tony, a member of the Jets criminal street gang, is standing alongside and chatting with fellow gang members while staking out their turf at Promontory Point on the South Side of Chicago; the group is flashing gang signs and displaying their distinctive tattoos to passersby.  Officer Krupke, applying the Ordinance at issue here, orders the group to disperse.  After some speculative discussion (probably irrelevant here) over whether the Jets are depraved because they are deprived, Tony and the other gang members break off further conversation with the statementnot entirely coherent, but evidently intended to be rudeGee, Officer Krupke, krup you.  A tense standoff ensues until Officer Krupke arrests the group for failing to obey his dispersal order.  Even assuming (as the Justices in the majority do, but I do not) that a law requiring obedience to a dispersal order is impermissibly vague unless it is clear to the objects of the order, before its issuance, that their conduct justifies it, I find it hard to believe that the Jets would not have known they had it coming.  That should settle the matter of respondents facial challenge to the Ordinances vagueness.

				Of course respondents would still be able to claim that the Ordinance was vague as applied to them.  But the ultimate demonstration of the inappropriateness of the Courts holding of 
				<em>
					facial 
				</em>
				invalidity is the fact that it is doubtful whether some of these respondents could even sustain an 
				<em>
					as-applied 
				</em>
				challenge on the basis of the majoritys own criteria.  For instance, respondent Jose Renteriawho admitted that he was a member of the Satan Disciples gangwas observed by the arresting officer loitering on a street corner with other gang members.  The officer issued a dispersal order, but when she returned to the same corner 15 to 20 minutes later, Renteria was still there with his friends, whereupon he was arrested.  In another example, respondent Daniel Washington and several otherswho admitted they were members of the Vice Lords gangwere observed by the arresting officer loitering in the street, yelling at passing vehicles, stopping traffic, and preventing pedestrians from using the sidewalks.  The arresting officer issued a dispersal order, issued 
				<em>
					another
				</em>
				 dispersal order later when the group did not move, and finally arrested the group when they were found loitering in the same place still later.  Finally, respondent Gregorio Gutierrezwho had previously admitted to the arresting officer his membership in the Latin Kings gangwas observed loitering with two other men.  The officer issued a dispersal order, drove around the block, and arrested the men after finding them in the same place upon his return.  See Brief for Petitioner 7, n. 5; Brief for United States as 
				<em>
					Amicus Curiae
				</em>
				 16, n. 11.  Even on the majoritys assumption that to avoid vagueness it must be clear to the object of the dispersal order 
				<em>
					ex ante
				</em>
				 that his conduct is covered by the Ordinance, it seems most improbable that any of these as-applied challenges would be sustained.  Much less is it possible to say that the Ordinance is invalid in 
				<em>
					all 
				</em>
				its applications.

				The plurality's explanation for its departure from the usual rule governing facial challenges is seemingly contained in the following statement: [This] is a criminal law that contains no 
				<em>
					mens rea
				</em>
				 requirement … 
				<em>
					and
				</em>

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				But no matter.  None of the three factors that the plurality relies upon exists anyway.  I turn first to the support for the proposition that there is a constitutionally protected right to loiteror, as the plurality more favorably describes it, for a person to remain in a public place of his choice.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  The plurality thinks much of this Fundamental Freedom to Loiter, which it contrasts with such lesser, constitutionally 
				<em>
					un
				</em>
				protected, activities as doing (ugh!) 
				<em>
					business
				</em>
				: This is not an ordinance that simply regulates business behavior and contains a scienter requirement. . . . It is a criminal law that contains no 
				<em>
					mens rea
				</em>
				 requirement . . . and infringes on constitutionally protected rights.  
				<em>

				Of course every activity, even scratching ones head, can be called a constitutional right if one means by that term nothing more than the fact that the activity is covered (as all are) by the Equal Protection Clause, so that those who engage in it cannot be singled out without rational basis.  See

				It would be unfair, however, to criticize the pluralitys failed attempt to establish that loitering is a constitutionally protected right while saying nothing of the concurrences.  The plurality at least makes an attempt.  The concurrences, on the other hand, make no pretense at attaching their broad vagueness invalidates rule to a liberty interest.  As far as appears from 
				<span class="smallcaps">

				s and 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Breyer
				</span>
				s opinions, 
				<em>
					no

				 police officer may issue 
				<em>
					any
				</em>
				 order, affecting 
				<em>
					any
				</em>
				 insignificant sort of citizen conduct (except, perhaps, an order addressed to the unprotected class of gang members) unless the standards for the issuance of that order are precise.  No mod-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				ern urban societyand probably none since London got big enough to have sewerscould function under such a rule.  There are innumerable reasons why it may be im-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				portant for a constable to tell a pedestrian to move onand even if it were possible to list in an ordinance all of the reasons that are known, many are simply unpredictable.  Hence the (entirely reasonable) Rule of the City of New York which reads: No person shall fail, neglect or refuse to comply with the lawful direction or command of any Police Officer, Urban Park Ranger, Parks Enforcement Patrol Officer or other [Parks and Recreation] Department employee, indicated by gesture or otherwise.  56 RCNY §103(c)(1) (1996).  It is one thing to uphold an as applied challenge when a pedestrian disobeys such an order that is unreasonableor even when a pedestrian asserting some true liberty interest (holding a political rally, for instance) disobeys such an order that is reasonable 
				<em>
					but unexplained
				</em>
				.  But to say that such a general ordinance permitting lawful orders is void

					in all its applications

				 demands more than a safe and orderly society can reasonably deliver.

        <p class="bodytext">
            <span class="smallcaps">

				I turn next to that element of the plurality's facial-challenge formula which consists of the proposition that this criminal ordinance contains no 
				<em>
					mens rea 
				</em>
				requirement.  The first step in analyzing this proposition is to determine what the 
				<em>
					actus reus
				</em>
				, to which that 
				<em>
					mens rea
				</em>
				 is supposed to be attached, consists of.  The majority believes that loitering forms part of (indeed, the essence of) the offense, and must be proved if conviction is to be obtained.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 2, 6, 913, 1415, 1618 (plurality and majority opinions); 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 23, 4 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					OConnor, J.
				</span>
				, concurring in part and concurring in judgment); 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 12 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Kennedy, J
				</span>
				., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 34 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Breyer, J
				</span>
				., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  That is not what the Ordinance provides.  The only part of the Ordinance that refers to loitering is the portion that addresses, not the punishable conduct of the defendant, but what the police officer must observe before he can issue an order to disperse; and what he must observe is carefully defined in terms of what the defendant 
				<em>
					appears
				</em>
				 to be doing, not in terms of what the defendant is 
				<em>
					actually
				</em>
				 doing.  The Ordinance does not require that the defendant have been loitering (
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, have been remaining in one place with no purpose), but rather that the police officer have observed him remaining in one place without any 
				<em>
					apparent
				</em>
				 purpose.  Someone who in fact 
				<em>
					has
				</em>
				 a genuine purpose for remaining where he is (waiting for a friend, for example, or waiting to hold up a bank) 
				<em>
					can
				</em>
				 be ordered to move on (assuming the other conditions of the Ordinance are met), so long as his remaining has no 
				<em>
					apparent
				</em>
				 purpose.  It is likely, to be sure, that the Ordinance will come down most heavily upon those who are 
				<em>
					actually 
				</em>
				loitering (those who 
				<em>
					really
				</em>
				 have no purpose in remaining where they are); but that activity is not a condition for issuance of the dispersal order.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The 
				<em>
					only
				</em>
				 act of a defendant that is made punishable by the Ordinanceor, indeed, that is even mentioned by the Ordinanceis his failure to promptly obey an order to disperse.  The question, then, is whether that 
				<em>
					actus reus
				</em>
				 must be accompanied by any wrongful intentand of course it must.  As the Court itself describes the requirement, a person must 
				<em>
					disobey
				</em>
				 the officers order.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 3 (emphasis added).  No one thinks a defendant could be successfully prosecuted under the Ordinance if he did not hear the order to disperse, or if he suffered a paralysis that rendered his compliance impossible.  The willful failure to obey a police order is wrongful intent enough.

				Finally, I address the last of the three factors in the plurality's facial-challenge formula: the proposition that the Ordinance is vague.  It is not.  Even under the ersatz overbreadth standard applied in

S. 352</a> n. 8 (1983), which allows facial challenges if a law reaches a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct, respondents claim fails because the Ordinance would not be vague in most or even a substantial number of applications.  A law is unconstitutionally vague if its lack of definitive standards either (1) fails to apprise persons of ordinary intelligence of the prohibited conduct, or (2) encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The plurality relies primarily upon the first of these aspects.  Since, it reasons, the loitering is the conduct that the ordinance is designed to prohibit, and an officer may issue an order only after prohibited conduct has already occurred, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 14, 15, the order to disperse cannot itself serve to apprise persons of ordinary intelligence of the prohibited conduct.  What counts for purposes of vagueness analysis, however, is not what the Ordinance is designed to prohibit, but what it actually subjects to criminal penalty.  As discussed earlier, that consists of nothing but the refusal to obey a dispersal order, as to which there is no doubt of adequate notice of the prohibited conduct.  The plurality's suggestion that even the dispersal order 
				<em>
					itself
				</em>
				 is unconstitutionally vague, because it does not specify 
				<em>
					how far to disperse (!)
				</em>
				, see 
				<em>

				  If it were true, it would render unconstitutional for vagueness many of the Presidential proclamations issued under that provision of the United States Code which requires the President, before using the militia or the Armed Forces for law enforcement, to issue a proclamation ordering the insurgents to disperse.

				For its determination of unconstitutional vagueness, the Court relies secondarilyand 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice OConnor

				<span class="smallcaps">

In discussing whether Chicagos Ordinance meets that requirement, the Justices in the majority hide behind an artificial construct of judicial restraint.  They point to the Supreme Court of Illinois statement that the apparent purpose standard provides absolute discretion to police officers to decide what activities constitute loitering, 687 N. E. 2d 53, 63 (1997), and protest that it would be wrong to construe the language of the Ordinance more narrowly than did the States highest court.

				 of what the language achievedafter that court refused (as I do) to read in any limitations that the words do not fairly contain.  It is not a construction of the language (to which we are bound) but a legal conclusion (to which we most assuredly are not bound).

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The criteria for issuance of a dispersal order under the Chicago Ordinance could hardly be clearer.  First, the law requires police officers to reasonably believ[e] that one of the group to which the order is issued is a criminal street gang member.  This resembles a probable-cause standard, and the Chicago Police Departments General Order 924 (1992)promulgated to govern enforcement of the Ordinancemakes the probable cause requirement explicit.

				  Under the Order, officers must have probable cause to believe that an individual is a member of a criminal street gang, to be substantiated by the officers experience and knowledge of the alleged offenders and by specific, documented and reliable information such as reliable witness testimony or an individuals admission of gang membership or display of distinctive colors, tattoos, signs, or other markings worn by members of particular criminal street gangs.

				Second, the Ordinance requires that the group be remain[ing] in one place with no apparent purpose.

There may be some ambiguity at the margin, but remain[ing] in one place requires more than a temporary stop, and is clear in most of its applications, including all of those represented by the facts surrounding the respondents arrests described

				The Courts attempt to demonstrate the vagueness of the Ordinance produces the following peculiar statement: The no apparent purpose standard for making [the decision to issue an order to disperse] is inherently subjective because its application depends on whether some purpose is apparent to the officer on the scene.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 18.  In the Courts view, a persons lack of any purpose in staying in one location is presumably an 
				<em>

				</em>
				 factor, and what the Ordinance requires as a condition of an order to dispersethe absence of any 
				<em>
					apparent
				</em>
				 purposeis a 
				<em>
					subjective
				</em>
				 factor.  This side of the looking glass, just the opposite is true.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Elsewhere, of course, the Court acknowledges the clear, objective commands of the Ordinance, and indeed relies upon them to paint it as unfair:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				By its very terms, the ordinance encompasses a great deal of harmless behavior.  In any public place in the city of Chicago, persons who stand or sit in the company of a gang member may be ordered to disperse unless their purpose is apparent.  The mandatory language in the enactment directs the police to issue an order without first making any inquiry about their possible purposes.  It matters not whether the reason that a gang member and his father, for example, might loiter near Wrigley Field is to rob an unsuspecting fan or just to get a glimpse of Sammy Sosa leaving the ballpark; in either event, if their purpose is not apparent to a nearby police officer, she mayindeed, she shallorder them to disperse.

Quite so.  And the fact that this clear instruction to the officers encompasses a great deal of harmless behavior would be invalidating if that harmless behavior were constitutionally protected against abridgment, such as speech or the practice of religion.  Remaining in one place is 
				<em>

The problem, of course, well recognized by Chicagos City Council, is that the gang members cease their intimidating and unlawful behavior under the watchful eye of police officers, but return to it as soon as the police drive away.

				, at 78, n. 17 (plurality opinion) (citing extant laws against intimidation, streetgang criminal drug conspiracy, and mob action).  The problem, again, is that the intimidation and lawlessness do not occur when the police are in sight.

And if remain[ing] in one place with no apparent purpose is so vague as to give the police unbridled discretion in controlling the conduct of non-gang-members, it surpasses understanding how it ceases to be so vague when applied to gang members

				The fact is that the present ordinance is entirely clear in its application, cannot be violated except with full knowledge and intent, and vests no more discretion in the police than innumerable other measures authorizing police orders to preserve the public peace and safety.  As suggested by their tortured analyses, and by their suggested solutions that bear no relation to the identified constitutional problem, the majoritys real quarrel with the Chicago Ordinance is simply that it permits (or indeed requires) too much harmless conduct by innocent citizens to be proscribed.  As 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice OConnor
				</span>
				s concurrence says with disapprobation, the ordinance applies to hundreds of thousands of persons who are 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 gang members, standing on any sidewalk or in any park, coffee shop, bar, or other location open to the public.  
				<em>

				</em>
				, at 23 (internal quotation marks omitted).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				But in our democratic system, how much harmless conduct to proscribe is not a judgment to be made by the courts.  So long as constitutionally guaranteed rights are not affected, and so long as the proscription has a rational basis, 
				<em>
					all sorts
				</em>
				 of perfectly harmless activity by millions of perfectly innocent people can be forbiddenriding a motorcycle without a safety helmet, for example, starting a campfire in a national forest, or selling a safe and effective drug not yet approved by the FDA.  All of these acts are entirely innocent and harmless in themselves, but because of the 
				<em>
					risk
				</em>
				 of harm that they entail, the freedom to engage in them has been abridged.  The citizens of Chicago have decided that depriving themselves of the freedom to hang out with a gang member is necessary to eliminate pervasive gang crime and intimidationand that the elimination of the one is worth the deprivation of the other.  This Court has no business second-guessing either the degree of necessity or the fairness of the trade.

						 In other words, a facial attack, since it requires unconstitutionality in all circumstances, necessarily presumes that the litigant presently before the court would be able to sustain an as-applied challenge.  See Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc.,

The plurality asserts that in United States v. Salerno, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/481/739" class="subref" title="subref">481 U. S. 739</a> (1987)
, which I discuss in text immediately following this footnote, the Court entertained a facial challenge even though the defendants . . . did not claim that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to them.  Ante, at 11, n. 22.  That is not so.  The Court made it absolutely clear in Salerno that a facial challenge requires the assertion that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid, 481 U. S., at 745 (emphasis added).  The footnoted statement upon which the plurality relies (Nor have respondents claimed that the Act is unconstitutional because of the way it was applied to the particular facts of their case, id., at 745, n. 3) was obviously meant to convey the fact that the defendants were not making, in addition to their facial challenge, an alternative as-applied challengei.e., asserting that even if the statute was not unconstitutional in all its applications it was at least unconstitutional in its particular application to them.

						 Salerno, a criminal case, repudiated the Courts statement in Kolender v. Lawson, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/461/352" class="subref" title="subref">461 U. S. 352</a>, n. 8 (1983), to the effect that a facial challenge to a criminal statute could succeed even when [the statute] could conceivably have had some valid application.  Kolender seems to have confused the standard for 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> overbreadth challenges with the standard governing facial challenges on all other grounds.  See ibid. (citing the Courts articulation of the standard for 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> overbreadth challenges from Hoffman Estates, supra, at 494).  As Salerno noted, 481 U. S., at 745, the overbreadth doctrine is a specialized exception to the general rule for facial challenges, justified in light of the risk that an overbroad statute will chill free expression.  See, e.g., Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/413/601" class="subref" title="subref">413 U. S. 601</a>,

						 The plurality asserts that the Salerno standard for facial challenge has never been the decisive factor in any decision of this Court.  It means by that only this: in rejecting a facial challenge, the Court has never contented itself with identifying only one situation in which the challenged statute would be constitutional, but has mentioned several.  But that is not at all remarkable, and casts no doubt upon the validity of the principle that Salerno and these many other cases enunciated.  It is difficult to conceive of a statute that would be constitutional in only a single applicationand hard to resist mentioning more than one.


The plurality contends that it does not matter whether the Salerno standard is federal law, since facial challenge is a species of third-party standing, and federal limitations upon third-party standing do not apply in an appeal from a state decision which takes a broader view, as the Illinois Supreme Courts opinion did here.  Ante, at 11, n. 22.  This is quite wrong.  Disagreement over the Salerno rule is not a disagreement over the standing question of whether the person challenging the statute can raise the rights of third parties: under both Salerno and the plurality's rule he can.  The disagreement relates to how many third-party rights he must prove to be infringed by the statute before he can win: Salerno says all (in addition to his own rights), the plurality says many.  That is not a question of standing but of substantive law.  The notion that, if Salerno is the federal rule (a federal statute is not totally invalid unless it is invalid in all its applications), it can be altered by a state court (a federal statute is totally invalid if it is invalid in many of its applications), and that that alteration must be accepted by the Supreme Court of the United States is, to put it as gently as possible, remarkable.

If a careless reader were inclined to confuse the term social gatherings in this passage with loitering, his confusion would be eliminated by pursuing the reference to Part II of the brief, which says, in its introductory paragraph: [A]s we explain below, substantive due process does not support the courts novel holding that the Constitution secures the right to stand still on the public way even when one is not engaged in speech, assembly, or other conduct that enjoys affirmative constitutional protection.  Id., at 39.

Glucksberg.  Ibid.  But I am not analyzing it under that framework.  I am simply assuming that when the plurality says (as an essential part of its reasoning) that the right to loiter for innocent purposes is . . . a part of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause it does not believe that the same word (liberty) means one thing for purposes of substantive due process and something else for purposes of procedural due process.  There is no authority for that startling proposition.  See Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth,

The pluralitys opinion seeks to have it both ways, invoking the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>s august protection of liberty in defining the standard of certainty that it sets, but then, in identifying the conduct protected by that high standard, ignoring our extensive case-law defining liberty, and substituting, instead, all harmless and innocent conduct, ante, at 14.

This notion that a prescription (Disperse!) which is itself not unconstitutionally vague can somehow contribute to the unconstitutional vagueness of the entire scheme is full of mysterysuspending, as it does, the metaphysical principle that nothing can confer what it does not possess (nemo dat qui non habet).

						 Justice Breyer asserts that one always has some apparent purpose, so that the policeman must interpret the words no apparent purpose as meaning no apparent purpose except for . . . .  Ante, at 12.  It is simply not true that one always has some apparent purposeand especially not true that one always has some apparent purpose in remaining at rest, for the simple reason that one often (indeed, perhaps usually) has no actual purpose in remaining at rest.  Remaining at rest will be a persons normal state, unless he has a purpose which causes him to move.  That is why one frequently reads of a persons wandering aimlessly (which is worthy of note) but not of a persons sitting aimlessly (which is not remarkable at all).

						 The Court also speculates that a police officer may exercise his discretion to enforce the Ordinance and direct dispersal when (in the Courts view) the Ordinance is inapplicableviz., where there is an apparent purpose, but it is an unlawful one.  See ante, at 18.  No one in his right mind would read the phrase without any apparent purpose to mean anything other than without any apparent lawful purpose.  The implication that acts referred to approvingly in statutory language are lawful acts is routine.  The Court asserts that the Illinois Supreme Court has forced it into this interpretive inanity because, since it has not placed any limiting construction on the language in the ordinance, we must assume that the ordinance means what it says . . . .  Ante, at 19.  But the Illinois Supreme Court did not mention this particular interpretive issue, which has nothing to do with giving the Ordinance a limiting interpretation, and everything to do with giving it its ordinary legal meaning.

				The citizens of Chicago were once free to drive about the city at whatever speed they wished.  At some point Chicagoans (or perhaps Illinoisans) decided this would not do, and imposed prophylactic speed limits designed to assure safe operation by the average (or perhaps even subaverage) driver with the average (or perhaps even subaverage) vehicle.  This infringed upon the freedom of all citizens, but was not unconstitutional.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Similarly, the citizens of Chicago were once free to stand around and gawk at the scene of an accident.  At some point Chicagoans discovered that this obstructed traffic and caused more accidents.  They did not make the practice unlawful, but they did authorize police officers to order the crowd to disperse, and imposed penalties for refusal to obey such an order.  Again, this prophylactic measure infringed upon the freedom of all citizens, but was not unconstitutional.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Until the ordinance that is before us today was adopted, the citizens of Chicago were free to stand about in public places with no apparent purposeto engage, that is, in conduct that appeared to be loitering.  In recent years, however, the city has been afflicted with criminal street gangs.  As reflected in the record before us, these gangs congregated in public places to deal in drugs, and to terrorize the neighborhoods by demonstrating control over their turf.  Many residents of the inner city felt that they were prisoners in their own homes.  Once again, Chicagoans decided that to eliminate the problem it was worth restricting some of the freedom that they once enjoyed.  The means they took was similar to the second, and more mild, example given above rather than the first: Loitering was not made unlawful, but when a group of people occupied a public place without an apparent purpose and in the company of a known gang member, police officers were authorized to order them to disperse, and the failure to obey such an order was made unlawful.  See Chicago Municipal Code §84015 (1992).  The minor limitation upon the free state of nature that this prophylactic arrangement imposed upon all Chicagoans seemed to them (and it seems to me) a small price to pay for liberation of their streets.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The majority today invalidates this perfectly reasonable measure by ignoring our rules governing facial challenges, by elevating loitering to a constitutionally guaranteed right, and by discerning vagueness where, according to our usual standards, none exists.

				Respondents consolidated appeal presents a facial challenge to the Chicago Ordinance on vagueness grounds.  When a facial challenge is successful, the law in question is declared to be unenforceable in 
				<em>
					all
				</em>
				 its applications, and not just in its particular application to the party in suit.  To tell the truth, it is highly questionable whether federal courts have any business making such a declaration.  The rationale for our power to review federal legislation for constitutionality, expressed in 
				<em>
					Marbury
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Madison
				</em>
				, 1 Cranch 137 (1803), was that we 
				<em>
					had
				</em>
				 to do so in order to decide the case before us.  But that rationale only extends so far as to require us to determine that the statute is unconstitutional as applied to

				The second characteristic of judicial power is, that it pronounces on special cases, and not upon general principles.  If a judge, in deciding a particular point, destroys a general principle by passing a judgment which tends to reject all the inferences from that principle, and consequently to annul it, he remains within the ordinary limits of his functions.  But if he directly attacks a general principle without having a particular case in view, he leaves the circle in which all nations have agreed to confine his authority; he assumes a more important, and perhaps a more useful influence, than that of the magistrate; but he ceases to represent the judicial power.

				Whenever a law which the judge holds to be unconstitutional is invoked in a tribunal of the United States, he may refuse to admit it as a rule … .  But as soon as a judge has refused to apply any given law in a case, that law immediately loses a portion of its moral force.  Those to whom it is prejudicial learn that means exist of overcoming its authority; and similar suits are multiplied, until it becomes powerless. … The political power which the Americans have entrusted to their courts of justice is therefore immense; but the evils of this power are considerably diminished by the impossibility of attacking the laws except through the courts of justice. …  [W]hen a judge contests a law in an obscure debate on some particular case, the importance of his attack is concealed from public notice; his decision bears upon the interest of an individual, and the law is slighted only incidentally.  Moreover, although it is censured, it is not abolished; its moral force may be diminished, but its authority is not taken away; and its final destruction can be accomplished only by the reiterated attacks of judicial functionaries.  Democracy in America 73, 7576 (R.

				The very foundation of the power of the federal courts to declare Acts of Congress unconstitutional lies in the power and duty of those courts to decide cases and controversies before them. . . .  This Court, as is the case with all federal courts, has no jurisdiction to pronounce any statute, either of a State or of the United States, void, because irreconcilable with the Constitution, except as it is called upon to adjudge the legal rights of litigants in actual controversies.  In the exercise of that jurisdiction, it is bound by two rules, to which it has rigidly adhered, one, never to anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it; the other never to formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied. . . .  Kindred to these rules is the rule that one to whom application of a statute is constitutional will not be heard to attack the statute on the ground that impliedly it might also be taken as applying to other persons or other situations in which its application might be unconstitutional. . . .  The delicate power of pronouncing an Act of Congress unconstitutional is not to be exercised with reference to hypothetical cases thus imagined.

        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				It seems to me fundamentally incompatible with this system for the Court not to be content to find that a statute is unconstitutional as applied to the person before it, but to go further and pronounce that the statute is unconstitutional in 
				<em>
					all
				</em>
				 applications.  Its reasoning may well suggest as much, but to pronounce a 
				<em>
					holding
				</em>
				 on that point seems to me no more than an advisory opinionwhich a federal court should never issue at all, see 
				<em>
					Hayburns Case
				</em>
				, 2 Dall. 409 (1792), and 
				<em>
					especially

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I must acknowledge, however, that for some of the present century we have done just this.  But until recently, at least, we haveexcept in free-speech cases subject to the doctrine of overbreadth, see,

				<em>
					unconstitutional
				</em>
				 in all its applications.  (I say that is an eminently reasonable requirement, not only because we should not be holding a statute void in all its applications unless it is unconstitutional in all its applications, but also because

				</em>
				 it is unconstitutional in all its applications we do not even know, without conducting an as-applied analysis, whether it is void with regard to the very litigant

				I am aware, of course, that in some recent facial-challenge cases the Court has, without any attempt at explanation, created entirely irrational exceptions to the unconstitutional in every conceivable application rule, when the statutes at issue concerned hot-button social issues on which informed opinion was zealously united.

				When our normal criteria for facial challenges are applied, it is clear that the Justices in the majority have transposed the burden of proof.  Instead of requiring the respondents, who are challenging the Ordinance, to show that it is invalid in all its applications, they have required the petitioner to show that it is valid in all its applications.  Both the plurality opinion and the concurrences display a lively imagination, creating hypothetical situations in which the laws application would (in their view) be ambiguous.  But that creative role has been usurped from the petitioner, who can defeat the respondents facial challenge by conjuring up 
				<em>
					a single valid application
				</em>
				 of the law.  My contribution would go something like this

				: Tony, a member of the Jets criminal street gang, is standing alongside and chatting with fellow gang members while staking out their turf at Promontory Point on the South Side of Chicago; the group is flashing gang signs and displaying their distinctive tattoos to passersby.  Officer Krupke, applying the Ordinance at issue here, orders the group to disperse.  After some speculative discussion (probably irrelevant here) over whether the Jets are depraved because they are deprived, Tony and the other gang members break off further conversation with the statementnot entirely coherent, but evidently intended to be rudeGee, Officer Krupke, krup you.  A tense standoff ensues until Officer Krupke arrests the group for failing to obey his dispersal order.  Even assuming (as the Justices in the majority do, but I do not) that a law requiring obedience to a dispersal order is impermissibly vague unless it is clear to the objects of the order, before its issuance, that their conduct justifies it, I find it hard to believe that the Jets would not have known they had it coming.  That should settle the matter of respondents facial challenge to the Ordinances vagueness.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Of course respondents would still be able to claim that the Ordinance was vague as applied to them.  But the ultimate demonstration of the inappropriateness of the Courts holding of 
				<em>
					facial 
				</em>
				invalidity is the fact that it is doubtful whether some of these respondents could even sustain an 
				<em>
					as-applied 
				</em>
				challenge on the basis of the majoritys own criteria.  For instance, respondent Jose Renteriawho admitted that he was a member of the Satan Disciples gangwas observed by the arresting officer loitering on a street corner with other gang members.  The officer issued a dispersal order, but when she returned to the same corner 15 to 20 minutes later, Renteria was still there with his friends, whereupon he was arrested.  In another example, respondent Daniel Washington and several otherswho admitted they were members of the Vice Lords gangwere observed by the arresting officer loitering in the street, yelling at passing vehicles, stopping traffic, and preventing pedestrians from using the sidewalks.  The arresting officer issued a dispersal order, issued 
				<em>
					another

				 dispersal order later when the group did not move, and finally arrested the group when they were found loitering in the same place still later.  Finally, respondent Gregorio Gutierrezwho had previously admitted to the arresting officer his membership in the Latin Kings gangwas observed loitering with two other men.  The officer issued a dispersal order, drove around the block, and arrested the men after finding them in the same place upon his return.  See Brief for Petitioner 7, n. 5; Brief for United States as

				 that his conduct is covered by the Ordinance, it seems most improbable that any of these as-applied challenges would be sustained.  Much less is it possible to say that the Ordinance is invalid in

				The plurality's explanation for its departure from the usual rule governing facial challenges is seemingly contained in the following statement: [This] is a criminal law that contains no

				But no matter.  None of the three factors that the plurality relies upon exists anyway.  I turn first to the support for the proposition that there is a constitutionally protected right to loiteror, as the plurality more favorably describes it, for a person to remain in a public place of his choice.  
				<em>

				  The plurality thinks much of this Fundamental Freedom to Loiter, which it contrasts with such lesser, constitutionally 
				<em>

				protected, activities as doing (ugh!)

				</em>
				: This is not an ordinance that simply regulates business behavior and contains a scienter requirement. . . . It is a criminal law that contains no

				Of course every activity, even scratching ones head, can be called a constitutional right if one means by that term nothing more than the fact that the activity is covered (as all are) by the Equal Protection Clause, so that those who engage in it cannot be singled out without rational basis.  See

				It would be unfair, however, to criticize the pluralitys failed attempt to establish that loitering is a constitutionally protected right while saying nothing of the concurrences.  The plurality at least makes an attempt.  The concurrences, on the other hand, make no pretense at attaching their broad vagueness invalidates rule to a liberty interest.  As far as appears from 
				<span class="smallcaps">

				<em>
					any

				 order, affecting 
				<em>
					any
				</em>
				 insignificant sort of citizen conduct (except, perhaps, an order addressed to the unprotected class of gang members) unless the standards for the issuance of that order are precise.  No mod-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				ern urban societyand probably none since London got big enough to have sewerscould function under such a rule.  There are innumerable reasons why it may be im-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				portant for a constable to tell a pedestrian to move onand even if it were possible to list in an ordinance all of the reasons that are known, many are simply unpredictable.  Hence the (entirely reasonable) Rule of the City of New York which reads: No person shall fail, neglect or refuse to comply with the lawful direction or command of any Police Officer, Urban Park Ranger, Parks Enforcement Patrol Officer or other [Parks and Recreation] Department employee, indicated by gesture or otherwise.  56 RCNY §103(c)(1) (1996).  It is one thing to uphold an as applied challenge when a pedestrian disobeys such an order that is unreasonableor even when a pedestrian asserting some true liberty interest (holding a political rally, for instance) disobeys such an order that is reasonable 
				<em>
					but unexplained

				I turn next to that element of the plurality's facial-challenge formula which consists of the proposition that this criminal ordinance contains no 
				<em>
					mens rea 
				</em>
				requirement.  The first step in analyzing this proposition is to determine what the 
				<em>
					actus reus
				</em>
				, to which that 
				<em>
					mens rea
				</em>
				 is supposed to be attached, consists of.  The majority believes that loitering forms part of (indeed, the essence of) the offense, and must be proved if conviction is to be obtained.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 2, 6, 913, 1415, 1618 (plurality and majority opinions); 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 23, 4 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					OConnor, J.
				</span>
				, concurring in part and concurring in judgment); 
				<em>

				</em>
				, at 12 (
				<span class="smallcaps">

				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 34 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Breyer, J
				</span>
				., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  That is not what the Ordinance provides.  The only part of the Ordinance that refers to loitering is the portion that addresses, not the punishable conduct of the defendant, but what the police officer must observe before he can issue an order to disperse; and what he must observe is carefully defined in terms of what the defendant 
				<em>
					appears
				</em>
				 to be doing, not in terms of what the defendant is 
				<em>
					actually
				</em>
				 doing.  The Ordinance does not require that the defendant have been loitering (
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, have been remaining in one place with no purpose), but rather that the police officer have observed him remaining in one place without any 
				<em>
					apparent
				</em>
				 purpose.  Someone who in fact 
				<em>
					has
				</em>
				 a genuine purpose for remaining where he is (waiting for a friend, for example, or waiting to hold up a bank) 
				<em>
					can
				</em>
				 be ordered to move on (assuming the other conditions of the Ordinance are met), so long as his remaining has no 
				<em>
					apparent
				</em>
				 purpose.  It is likely, to be sure, that the Ordinance will come down most heavily upon those who are 
				<em>
					actually 
				</em>
				loitering (those who 
				<em>
					really
				</em>
				 have no purpose in remaining where they are); but that activity is not a condition for issuance of the dispersal order.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The 
				<em>
					only
				</em>
				 act of a defendant that is made punishable by the Ordinanceor, indeed, that is even mentioned by the Ordinanceis his failure to promptly obey an order to disperse.  The question, then, is whether that 
				<em>
					actus reus
				</em>
				 must be accompanied by any wrongful intentand of course it must.  As the Court itself describes the requirement, a person must 
				<em>
					disobey
				</em>
				 the officers order.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 3 (emphasis added).  No one thinks a defendant could be successfully prosecuted under the Ordinance if he did not hear the order to disperse, or if he suffered a paralysis that rendered his compliance impossible.  The willful failure to obey a police order is wrongful intent enough.

				Finally, I address the last of the three factors in the plurality's facial-challenge formula: the proposition that the Ordinance is vague.  It is not.  Even under the ersatz overbreadth standard applied in

S. 352</a> n. 8 (1983), which allows facial challenges if a law reaches a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct, respondents claim fails because the Ordinance would not be vague in most or even a substantial number of applications.  A law is unconstitutionally vague if its lack of definitive standards either (1) fails to apprise persons of ordinary intelligence of the prohibited conduct, or (2) encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Grayned

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The plurality relies primarily upon the first of these aspects.  Since, it reasons, the loitering is the conduct that the ordinance is designed to prohibit, and an officer may issue an order only after prohibited conduct has already occurred, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 14, 15, the order to disperse cannot itself serve to apprise persons of ordinary intelligence of the prohibited conduct.  What counts for purposes of vagueness analysis, however, is not what the Ordinance is designed to prohibit, but what it actually subjects to criminal penalty.  As discussed earlier, that consists of nothing but the refusal to obey a dispersal order, as to which there is no doubt of adequate notice of the prohibited conduct.  The plurality's suggestion that even the dispersal order 
				<em>
					itself
				</em>
				 is unconstitutionally vague, because it does not specify 
				<em>
					how far to disperse (!)
				</em>
				, see 
				<em>

				  If it were true, it would render unconstitutional for vagueness many of the Presidential proclamations issued under that provision of the United States Code which requires the President, before using the militia or the Armed Forces for law enforcement, to issue a proclamation ordering the insurgents to disperse.

				For its determination of unconstitutional vagueness, the Court relies secondarilyand 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice OConnor
				</span>
				s and 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Breyer
				</span>
				s concurrences exclusivelyupon the second aspect of that doctrine, which requires sufficient specificity to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory law enforcement.  See

				, at 3 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Breyer, J
				</span>
				., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  In discussing whether Chicagos Ordinance meets that requirement, the Justices in the majority hide behind an artificial construct of judicial restraint.  They point to the Supreme Court of Illinois statement that the apparent purpose standard provides absolute discretion to police officers to decide what activities constitute loitering, 687 N. E. 2d 53, 63 (1997), and protest that it would be wrong to construe the language of the Ordinance more narrowly than did the States highest court.

				<em>
					characterization

				 of what the language achievedafter that court refused (as I do) to read in any limitations that the words do not fairly contain.  It is not a construction of the language (to which we are bound) but a legal conclusion (to which we most assuredly are not bound).

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The criteria for issuance of a dispersal order under the Chicago Ordinance could hardly be clearer.  First, the law requires police officers to reasonably believ[e] that one of the group to which the order is issued is a criminal street gang member.  This resembles a probable-cause standard, and the Chicago Police Departments General Order 924 (1992)promulgated to govern enforcement of the Ordinancemakes the probable cause requirement explicit.

            </a>
				  Under the Order, officers must have probable cause to believe that an individual is a member of a criminal street gang, to be substantiated by the officers experience and knowledge of the alleged offenders and by specific, documented and reliable information such as reliable witness testimony or an individuals admission of gang membership or display of distinctive colors, tattoos, signs, or other markings worn by members of particular criminal street gangs.

				Second, the Ordinance requires that the group be remain[ing] in one place with no apparent purpose.  
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice OConnor
				</span>
				s assertion that this applies to any person standing in a public place, 
				<em>

The Ordinance does not apply to standing, but to remain[ing]a term which in this context obviously means [to] endure or persist, see American Heritage Dictionary 1525 (1992).  There may be some ambiguity at the margin, but remain[ing] in one place requires more than a temporary stop, and is clear in most of its applications, including all of those represented by the facts surrounding the respondents arrests described 
				<em>
					supra, 
				</em>
				at 12.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				As for the phrase with no apparent purpose: 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice OConnor
				</span>
				 again distorts this adjectival phrase, by separating it from the word that it modifies.  [A]ny person standing on the street, her concurrence says, has a general purposeeven if it is simply to stand, and thus the ordinance permits police officers to choose which purposes are 
				<em>
					permissible

				<em>
					Ante

				<em>
					for remaining there
				</em>
				.  That is not difficult to perceive.

				The Courts attempt to demonstrate the vagueness of the Ordinance produces the following peculiar statement: The no apparent purpose standard for making [the decision to issue an order to disperse] is inherently subjective because its application depends on whether some purpose is apparent to the officer on the scene.

				Elsewhere, of course, the Court acknowledges the clear, objective commands of the Ordinance, and indeed relies upon them to paint it as unfair:

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				By its very terms, the ordinance encompasses a great deal of harmless behavior.  In any public place in the city of Chicago, persons who stand or sit in the company of a gang member may be ordered to disperse unless their purpose is apparent.  The mandatory language in the enactment directs the police to issue an order without first making any inquiry about their possible purposes.  It matters not whether the reason that a gang member and his father, for example, might loiter near Wrigley Field is to rob an unsuspecting fan or just to get a glimpse of Sammy Sosa leaving the ballpark; in either event, if their purpose is not apparent to a nearby police officer, she mayindeed, she shallorder them to disperse.

Quite so.  And the fact that this clear instruction to the officers encompasses a great deal of harmless behavior would be invalidating if that harmless behavior were constitutionally protected against abridgment, such as speech or the practice of religion.  Remaining in one place is 
				<em>

The problem, of course, well recognized by Chicagos City Council, is that the gang members cease their intimidating and unlawful behavior under the watchful eye of police officers, but return to it as soon as the police drive away.

				The fact is that the present ordinance is entirely clear in its application, cannot be violated except with full knowledge and intent, and vests no more discretion in the police than innumerable other measures authorizing police orders to preserve the public peace and safety.  As suggested by their tortured analyses, and by their suggested solutions that bear no relation to the identified constitutional problem, the majoritys real quarrel with the Chicago Ordinance is simply that it permits (or indeed requires) too much harmless conduct by innocent citizens to be proscribed.  As 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice OConnor
				</span>
				s concurrence says with disapprobation, the ordinance applies to hundreds of thousands of persons who are 
				<em>

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				But in our democratic system, how much harmless conduct to proscribe is not a judgment to be made by the courts.  So long as constitutionally guaranteed rights are not affected, and so long as the proscription has a rational basis, 
				<em>
					all sorts
				</em>
				 of perfectly harmless activity by millions of perfectly innocent people can be forbiddenriding a motorcycle without a safety helmet, for example, starting a campfire in a national forest, or selling a safe and effective drug not yet approved by the FDA.  All of these acts are entirely innocent and harmless in themselves, but because of the 
				<em>
					risk
				</em>
				 of harm that they entail, the freedom to engage in them has been abridged.  The citizens of Chicago have decided that depriving themselves of the freedom to hang out with a gang member is necessary to eliminate pervasive gang crime and intimidationand that the elimination of the one is worth the deprivation of the other.  This Court has no business second-guessing either the degree of necessity or the fairness of the trade.

						 In other words, a facial attack, since it requires unconstitutionality in all circumstances, necessarily presumes that the litigant presently before the court would be able to sustain an as-applied challenge.  See Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/455/489" class="subref" title="subref">455 U. S. 489</a>,

 (A plaintiff who engages in some conduct that is clearly proscribed cannot complain of the vagueness of the law as applied tothe conduct of others.  A court should therefore examine the complainants conduct before analyzing other hypothetical applications of the law); Parker v. Levy,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">756</a> (1974)
 (One to whose con-duct a statute clearly applies may not successfully challenge it for vagueness).  


The plurality asserts that in United States v. Salerno, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/481/739" class="subref" title="subref">481 U. S. 739</a> (1987)
, which I discuss in text immediately following this footnote, the Court entertained a facial challenge even though the defendants . . . did not claim that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to them.  Ante, at 11, n. 22.  That is not so.  The Court made it absolutely clear in Salerno that a facial challenge requires the assertion that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid, 481 U. S., at 745 (emphasis added).  The footnoted statement upon which the plurality relies (Nor have respondents claimed that the Act is unconstitutional because of the way it was applied to the particular facts of their case, id., at 745, n. 3) was obviously meant to convey the fact that the defendants were not making, in addition to their facial challenge, an alternative as-applied challengei.e., asserting that even if the statute was not unconstitutional in all its applications it was at least unconstitutional in its particular application to them.

						 Salerno, a criminal case, repudiated the Courts statement in Kolender v. Lawson, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/461/352" class="subref" title="subref">461 U. S. 352</a>, n. 8 (1983), to the effect that a facial challenge to a criminal statute could succeed even when [the statute] could conceivably have had some valid application.  Kolender seems to have confused the standard for 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> overbreadth challenges with the standard governing facial challenges on all other grounds.  See ibid. (citing the Courts articulation of the standard for 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> overbreadth challenges from Hoffman Estates, supra, at 494).  As Salerno noted, 481 U. S., at 745, the overbreadth doctrine is a specialized exception to the general rule for facial challenges, justified in light of the risk that an overbroad statute will chill free expression.  See, e.g., Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/413/601" class="subref" title="subref">413 U. S. 601</a>,

						 The plurality asserts that the Salerno standard for facial challenge has never been the decisive factor in any decision of this Court.  It means by that only this: in rejecting a facial challenge, the Court has never contented itself with identifying only one situation in which the challenged statute would be constitutional, but has mentioned several.  But that is not at all remarkable, and casts no doubt upon the validity of the principle that Salerno and these many other cases enunciated.  It is difficult to conceive of a statute that would be constitutional in only a single applicationand hard to resist mentioning more than one.


The plurality contends that it does not matter whether the Salerno standard is federal law, since facial challenge is a species of third-party standing, and federal limitations upon third-party standing do not apply in an appeal from a state decision which takes a broader view, as the Illinois Supreme Courts opinion did here.  Ante, at 11, n. 22.  This is quite wrong.  Disagreement over the Salerno rule is not a disagreement over the standing question of whether the person challenging the statute can raise the rights of third parties: under both Salerno and the plurality's rule he can.  The disagreement relates to how many third-party rights he must prove to be infringed by the statute before he can win: Salerno says all (in addition to his own rights), the plurality says many.  That is not a question of standing but of substantive law.  The notion that, if Salerno is the federal rule (a federal statute is not totally invalid unless it is invalid in all its applications), it can be altered by a state court (a federal statute is totally invalid if it is invalid in many of its applications), and that that alteration must be accepted by the Supreme Court of the United States is, to put it as gently as possible, remarkable.

						 The pluralitys explanation for ignoring these laws is that many of them carried severe penalties and, during the Reconstruction era, they had harsh consequences on African-American women and children.  Ante, at 910, n. 20.  Those severe penalties and those harsh consequences are certainly regrettable, but they in no way lessen (indeed, the harshness of penalty tends to increase) the capacity of these laws to prove that loitering was never regarded as a fundamental liberty.

If a careless reader were inclined to confuse the term social gatherings in this passage with loitering, his confusion would be eliminated by pursuing the reference to Part II of the brief, which says, in its introductory paragraph: [A]s we explain below, substantive due process does not support the courts novel holding that the Constitution secures the right to stand still on the public way even when one is not engaged in speech, assembly, or other conduct that enjoys affirmative constitutional protection.  Id., at 39.

						 The plurality says, ante, at 20, n. 35, that since it decides the case on the basis of procedural due process rather than substantive due process, I am mistaken in analyzing its opinion under the framework for substantive due process set out in Washington v. Glucksberg.  Ibid.  But I am not analyzing it under that framework.  I am simply assuming that when the plurality says (as an essential part of its reasoning) that the right to loiter for innocent purposes is . . . a part of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause it does not believe that the same word (liberty) means one thing for purposes of substantive due process and something else for purposes of procedural due process.  There is no authority for that startling proposition.  See Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth,

The pluralitys opinion seeks to have it both ways, invoking the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>s august protection of liberty in defining the standard of certainty that it sets, but then, in identifying the conduct protected by that high standard, ignoring our extensive case-law defining liberty, and substituting, instead, all harmless and innocent conduct, ante, at 14.

						 I call it a suggestion because the plurality says only that the terms of the dispersal order compound the inadequacy of the notice, and acknowledges that they might not render the ordinance unconstitutionally vague if the definition of the forbidden conduct were clear.  Ante, at 15, 16.  This notion that a prescription (Disperse!) which is itself not unconstitutionally vague can somehow contribute to the unconstitutional vagueness of the entire scheme is full of mysterysuspending, as it does, the metaphysical principle that nothing can confer what it does not possess (nemo dat qui non habet).

						 Justice Breyer asserts that one always has some apparent purpose, so that the policeman must interpret the words no apparent purpose as meaning no apparent purpose except for . . . .  Ante, at 12.  It is simply not true that one always has some apparent purposeand especially not true that one always has some apparent purpose in remaining at rest, for the simple reason that one often (indeed, perhaps usually) has no actual purpose in remaining at rest.  Remaining at rest will be a persons normal state, unless he has a purpose which causes him to move.  That is why one frequently reads of a persons wandering aimlessly (which is worthy of note) but not of a persons sitting aimlessly (which is not remarkable at all).  And that is why a synonym for purpose is motive: that which causes one to move.

						 The Court also speculates that a police officer may exercise his discretion to enforce the Ordinance and direct dispersal when (in the Courts view) the Ordinance is inapplicableviz., where there is an apparent purpose, but it is an unlawful one.  See ante, at 18.  No one in his right mind would read the phrase without any apparent purpose to mean anything other than without any apparent lawful purpose.  The implication that acts referred to approvingly in statutory language are lawful acts is routine.  The Court asserts that the Illinois Supreme Court has forced it into this interpretive inanity because, since it has not placed any limiting construction on the language in the ordinance, we must assume that the ordinance means what it says . . . .  Ante, at 19.  But the Illinois Supreme Court did not mention this particular interpretive issue, which has nothing to do with giving the Ordinance a limiting interpretation, and everything to do with giving it its ordinary legal meaning.

				The citizens of Chicago were once free to drive about the city at whatever speed they wished.  At some point Chicagoans (or perhaps Illinoisans) decided this would not do, and imposed prophylactic speed limits designed to assure safe operation by the average (or perhaps even subaverage) driver with the average (or perhaps even subaverage) vehicle.  This infringed upon the freedom of all citizens, but was not unconstitutional.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Similarly, the citizens of Chicago were once free to stand around and gawk at the scene of an accident.  At some point Chicagoans discovered that this obstructed traffic and caused more accidents.  They did not make the practice unlawful, but they did authorize police officers to order the crowd to disperse, and imposed penalties for refusal to obey such an order.  Again, this prophylactic measure infringed upon the freedom of all citizens, but was not unconstitutional.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Until the ordinance that is before us today was adopted, the citizens of Chicago were free to stand about in public places with no apparent purposeto engage, that is, in conduct that appeared to be loitering.  In recent years, however, the city has been afflicted with criminal street gangs.  As reflected in the record before us, these gangs congregated in public places to deal in drugs, and to terrorize the neighborhoods by demonstrating control over their turf.  Many residents of the inner city felt that they were prisoners in their own homes.  Once again, Chicagoans decided that to eliminate the problem it was worth restricting some of the freedom that they once enjoyed.  The means they took was similar to the second, and more mild, example given above rather than the first: Loitering was not made unlawful, but when a group of people occupied a public place without an apparent purpose and in the company of a known gang member, police officers were authorized to order them to disperse, and the failure to obey such an order was made unlawful.  See Chicago Municipal Code §84015 (1992).  The minor limitation upon the free state of nature that this prophylactic arrangement imposed upon all Chicagoans seemed to them (and it seems to me) a small price to pay for liberation of their streets.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The majority today invalidates this perfectly reasonable measure by ignoring our rules governing facial challenges, by elevating loitering to a constitutionally guaranteed right, and by discerning vagueness where, according to our usual standards, none exists.

				Respondents consolidated appeal presents a facial challenge to the Chicago Ordinance on vagueness grounds.  When a facial challenge is successful, the law in question is declared to be unenforceable in 
				<em>
					all
				</em>
				 its applications, and not just in its particular application to the party in suit.  To tell the truth, it is highly questionable whether federal courts have any business making such a declaration.  The rationale for our power to review federal legislation for constitutionality, expressed in 
				<em>
					Marbury
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Madison
				</em>
				, 1 Cranch 137 (1803), was that we 
				<em>
					had
				</em>
				 to do so in order to decide the case before us.  But that rationale only extends so far as to require us to determine that the statute is unconstitutional as applied to 
				<em>
					this
				</em>
				 party, in the circumstances of 
				<em>
					this
				</em>
				 case.

				That limitation was fully grasped by Tocqueville, in his famous chapter on the power of the judiciary in American society:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The second characteristic of judicial power is, that it pronounces on special cases, and not upon general principles.  If a judge, in deciding a particular point, destroys a general principle by passing a judgment which tends to reject all the inferences from that principle, and consequently to annul it, he remains within the ordinary limits of his functions.  But if he directly attacks a general principle without having a particular case in view, he leaves the circle in which all nations have agreed to confine his authority; he assumes a more important, and perhaps a more useful influence, than that of the magistrate; but he ceases to represent the judicial power.

				Whenever a law which the judge holds to be unconstitutional is invoked in a tribunal of the United States, he may refuse to admit it as a rule … .  But as soon as a judge has refused to apply any given law in a case, that law immediately loses a portion of its moral force.  Those to whom it is prejudicial learn that means exist of overcoming its authority; and similar suits are multiplied, until it becomes powerless. … The political power which the Americans have entrusted to their courts of justice is therefore immense; but the evils of this power are considerably diminished by the impossibility of attacking the laws except through the courts of justice. …  [W]hen a judge contests a law in an obscure debate on some particular case, the importance of his attack is concealed from public notice; his decision bears upon the interest of an individual, and the law is slighted only incidentally.  Moreover, although it is censured, it is not abolished; its moral force may be diminished, but its authority is not taken away; and its final destruction can be accomplished only by the reiterated attacks of judicial functionaries.  Democracy in America 73, 7576 (R.

				The very foundation of the power of the federal courts to declare Acts of Congress unconstitutional lies in the power and duty of those courts to decide cases and controversies before them. . . .  This Court, as is the case with all federal courts, has no jurisdiction to pronounce any statute, either of a State or of the United States, void, because irreconcilable with the Constitution, except as it is called upon to adjudge the legal rights of litigants in actual controversies.  In the exercise of that jurisdiction, it is bound by two rules, to which it has rigidly adhered, one, never to anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it; the other never to formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied. . . .  Kindred to these rules is the rule that one to whom application of a statute is constitutional will not be heard to attack the statute on the ground that impliedly it might also be taken as applying to other persons or other situations in which its application might be unconstitutional. . . .  The delicate power of pronouncing an Act of Congress unconstitutional is not to be exercised with reference to hypothetical cases thus imagined.

        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				It seems to me fundamentally incompatible with this system for the Court not to be content to find that a statute is unconstitutional as applied to the person before it, but to go further and pronounce that the statute is unconstitutional in 
				<em>
					all
				</em>
				 applications.  Its reasoning may well suggest as much, but to pronounce a 
				<em>
					holding
				</em>
				 on that point seems to me no more than an advisory opinionwhich a federal court should never issue at all, see 
				<em>
					Hayburns Case

				, 2 Dall. 409 (1792), and 
				<em>
					especially

				I must acknowledge, however, that for some of the present century we have done just this.  But until recently, at least, we haveexcept in free-speech cases subject to the doctrine of overbreadth, see,

					unconstitutional
				</em>
				 in all its applications.  (I say that is an eminently reasonable requirement, not only because we should not be holding a statute void in all its applications unless it is unconstitutional in all its applications, but also because

				 it is unconstitutional in all its applications we do not even know, without conducting an as-applied analysis, whether it is void with regard to the very litigant

				I am aware, of course, that in some recent facial-challenge cases the Court has, without any attempt at explanation, created entirely irrational exceptions to the unconstitutional in every conceivable application rule, when the statutes at issue concerned hot-button social issues on which informed opinion was zealously united.

				When our normal criteria for facial challenges are applied, it is clear that the Justices in the majority have transposed the burden of proof.  Instead of requiring the respondents, who are challenging the Ordinance, to show that it is invalid in all its applications, they have required the petitioner to show that it is valid in all its applications.  Both the plurality opinion and the concurrences display a lively imagination, creating hypothetical situations in which the laws application would (in their view) be ambiguous.  But that creative role has been usurped from the petitioner, who can defeat the respondents facial challenge by conjuring up 
				<em>
					a single valid application
				</em>
				 of the law.  My contribution would go something like this

				: Tony, a member of the Jets criminal street gang, is standing alongside and chatting with fellow gang members while staking out their turf at Promontory Point on the South Side of Chicago; the group is flashing gang signs and displaying their distinctive tattoos to passersby.  Officer Krupke, applying the Ordinance at issue here, orders the group to disperse.  After some speculative discussion (probably irrelevant here) over whether the Jets are depraved because they are deprived, Tony and the other gang members break off further conversation with the statementnot entirely coherent, but evidently intended to be rudeGee, Officer Krupke, krup you.  A tense standoff ensues until Officer Krupke arrests the group for failing to obey his dispersal order.  Even assuming (as the Justices in the majority do, but I do not) that a law requiring obedience to a dispersal order is impermissibly vague unless it is clear to the objects of the order, before its issuance, that their conduct justifies it, I find it hard to believe that the Jets would not have known they had it coming.  That should settle the matter of respondents facial challenge to the Ordinances vagueness.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Of course respondents would still be able to claim that the Ordinance was vague as applied to them.  But the ultimate demonstration of the inappropriateness of the Courts holding of 
				<em>
					facial 
				</em>
				invalidity is the fact that it is doubtful whether some of these respondents could even sustain an 
				<em>
					as-applied 
				</em>
				challenge on the basis of the majoritys own criteria.  For instance, respondent Jose Renteriawho admitted that he was a member of the Satan Disciples gangwas observed by the arresting officer loitering on a street corner with other gang members.  The officer issued a dispersal order, but when she returned to the same corner 15 to 20 minutes later, Renteria was still there with his friends, whereupon he was arrested.  In another example, respondent Daniel Washington and several otherswho admitted they were members of the Vice Lords gangwere observed by the arresting officer loitering in the street, yelling at passing vehicles, stopping traffic, and preventing pedestrians from using the sidewalks.  The arresting officer issued a dispersal order, issued 
				<em>
					another
				</em>
				 dispersal order later when the group did not move, and finally arrested the group when they were found loitering in the same place still later.  Finally, respondent Gregorio Gutierrezwho had previously admitted to the arresting officer his membership in the Latin Kings gangwas observed loitering with two other men.  The officer issued a dispersal order, drove around the block, and arrested the men after finding them in the same place upon his return.  See Brief for Petitioner 7, n. 5; Brief for United States as 
				<em>
					Amicus Curiae
				</em>
				 16, n. 11.  Even on the majoritys assumption that to avoid vagueness it must be clear to the object of the dispersal order 
				<em>
					ex ante
				</em>
				 that his conduct is covered by the Ordinance, it seems most improbable that any of these as-applied challenges would be sustained.  Much less is it possible to say that the Ordinance is invalid in 
				<em>
					all 
				</em>
				its applications.

				The plurality's explanation for its departure from the usual rule governing facial challenges is seemingly contained in the following statement: [This] is a criminal law that contains no 
				<em>
					mens rea
				</em>
				 requirement … 
				<em>
					and
				</em>
				 infringes on constitutionally protected rights … .  When vagueness permeates the text of 
				<em>
					such
				</em>
				 a law, it is subject to facial attack.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 11 (emphasis added).  The proposition is set forth with such assurance that one might suppose that it repeats some well-accepted formula in our jurisprudence: (Criminal law without 
				<em>
					mens rea 
				</em>
				requirement)   (infringement of constitutionally protected right)   (vagueness) = (entitlement to facial invalidation).  There is no such formula; the plurality has made it up for this case, as the absence of any citation demonstrates.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				But no matter.  None of the three factors that the plurality relies upon exists anyway.  I turn first to the support for the proposition that there is a constitutionally protected right to loiteror, as the plurality more favorably describes it, for a person to remain in a public place of his choice.  
				<em>
					Ibid.

				Of course every activity, even scratching ones head, can be called a constitutional right if one means by that term nothing more than the fact that the activity is covered (as all are) by the Equal Protection Clause, so that those who engage in it cannot be singled out without rational basis.  See

				It would be unfair, however, to criticize the pluralitys failed attempt to establish that loitering is a constitutionally protected right while saying nothing of the concurrences.

				<span class="smallcaps">

				 insignificant sort of citizen conduct (except, perhaps, an order addressed to the unprotected class of gang members) unless the standards for the issuance of that order are precise.  No mod-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				ern urban societyand probably none since London got big enough to have sewerscould function under such a rule.  There are innumerable reasons why it may be im-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				portant for a constable to tell a pedestrian to move onand even if it were possible to list in an ordinance all of the reasons that are known, many are simply unpredictable.  Hence the (entirely reasonable) Rule of the City of New York which reads: No person shall fail, neglect or refuse to comply with the lawful direction or command of any Police Officer, Urban Park Ranger, Parks Enforcement Patrol Officer or other [Parks and Recreation] Department employee, indicated by gesture or otherwise.  56 RCNY §103(c)(1) (1996).  It is one thing to uphold an as applied challenge when a pedestrian disobeys such an order that is unreasonableor even when a pedestrian asserting some true liberty interest (holding a political rally, for instance) disobeys such an order that is reasonable 
				<em>

				I turn next to that element of the plurality's facial-challenge formula which consists of the proposition that this criminal ordinance contains no 
				<em>
					mens rea 
				</em>
				requirement.  The first step in analyzing this proposition is to determine what the 
				<em>
					actus reus
				</em>
				, to which that 
				<em>
					mens rea
				</em>
				 is supposed to be attached, consists of.  The majority believes that loitering forms part of (indeed, the essence of) the offense, and must be proved if conviction is to be obtained.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 2, 6, 913, 1415, 1618 (plurality and majority opinions); 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 23, 4 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					OConnor, J.
				</span>
				, concurring in part and concurring in judgment); 
				<em>

				</em>
				, at 12 (
				<span class="smallcaps">

				., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 34 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Breyer, J
				</span>
				., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  That is not what the Ordinance provides.  The only part of the Ordinance that refers to loitering is the portion that addresses, not the punishable conduct of the defendant, but what the police officer must observe before he can issue an order to disperse; and what he must observe is carefully defined in terms of what the defendant 
				<em>
					appears
				</em>
				 to be doing, not in terms of what the defendant is 
				<em>
					actually
				</em>
				 doing.  The Ordinance does not require that the defendant have been loitering (
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, have been remaining in one place with no purpose), but rather that the police officer have observed him remaining in one place without any 
				<em>
					apparent
				</em>
				 purpose.  Someone who in fact 
				<em>
					has
				</em>
				 a genuine purpose for remaining where he is (waiting for a friend, for example, or waiting to hold up a bank) 
				<em>
					can
				</em>
				 be ordered to move on (assuming the other conditions of the Ordinance are met), so long as his remaining has no 
				<em>
					apparent
				</em>
				 purpose.  It is likely, to be sure, that the Ordinance will come down most heavily upon those who are 
				<em>
					actually 
				</em>
				loitering (those who 
				<em>
					really
				</em>
				 have no purpose in remaining where they are); but that activity is not a condition for issuance of the dispersal order.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The 
				<em>
					only
				</em>
				 act of a defendant that is made punishable by the Ordinanceor, indeed, that is even mentioned by the Ordinanceis his failure to promptly obey an order to disperse.  The question, then, is whether that 
				<em>
					actus reus
				</em>
				 must be accompanied by any wrongful intentand of course it must.  As the Court itself describes the requirement, a person must 
				<em>
					disobey
				</em>
				 the officers order.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 3 (emphasis added).  No one thinks a defendant could be successfully prosecuted under the Ordinance if he did not hear the order to disperse, or if he suffered a paralysis that rendered his compliance impossible.  The willful failure to obey a police order is wrongful intent enough.

A law is unconstitutionally vague if its lack of definitive standards either (1) fails to apprise persons of ordinary intelligence of the prohibited conduct, or (2) encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,

				The plurality relies primarily upon the first of these aspects.  Since, it reasons, the loitering is the conduct that the ordinance is designed to prohibit, and an officer may issue an order only after prohibited conduct has already occurred, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 14, 15, the order to disperse cannot itself serve to apprise persons of ordinary intelligence of the prohibited conduct.  What counts for purposes of vagueness analysis, however, is not what the Ordinance is designed to prohibit, but what it actually subjects to criminal penalty.  As discussed earlier, that consists of nothing but the refusal to obey a dispersal order, as to which there is no doubt of adequate notice of the prohibited conduct.  The plurality's suggestion that even the dispersal order 
				<em>
					itself
				</em>
				 is unconstitutionally vague, because it does not specify 
				<em>
					how far to disperse (!)
				</em>
				, see 
				<em>

				  If it were true, it would render unconstitutional for vagueness many of the Presidential proclamations issued under that provision of the United States Code which requires the President, before using the militia or the Armed Forces for law enforcement, to issue a proclamation ordering the insurgents to disperse.

				For its determination of unconstitutional vagueness, the Court relies secondarilyand 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice OConnor
				</span>
				s and 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Breyer
				</span>
				s concurrences exclusivelyupon the second aspect of that doctrine, which requires sufficient specificity to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory law enforcement.  See

				, at 3 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Breyer, J
				</span>
				., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  In discussing whether Chicagos Ordinance meets that requirement, the Justices in the majority hide behind an artificial construct of judicial restraint.  They point to the Supreme Court of Illinois statement that the apparent purpose standard provides absolute discretion to police officers to decide what activities constitute loitering, 687 N. E. 2d 53, 63 (1997), and protest that it would be wrong to construe the language of the Ordinance more narrowly than did the States highest court.

				<em>
					characterization

				 of what the language achievedafter that court refused (as I do) to read in any limitations that the words do not fairly contain.  It is not a construction of the language (to which we are bound) but a legal conclusion (to which we most assuredly are not bound).

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The criteria for issuance of a dispersal order under the Chicago Ordinance could hardly be clearer.  First, the law requires police officers to reasonably believ[e] that one of the group to which the order is issued is a criminal street gang member.  This resembles a probable-cause standard, and the Chicago Police Departments General Order 924 (1992)promulgated to govern enforcement of the Ordinancemakes the probable cause requirement explicit.

                </sup>
            </a>
				  Under the Order, officers must have probable cause to believe that an individual is a member of a criminal street gang, to be substantiated by the officers experience and knowledge of the alleged offenders and by specific, documented and reliable information such as reliable witness testimony or an individuals admission of gang membership or display of distinctive colors, tattoos, signs, or other markings worn by members of particular criminal street gangs.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 67a69a, 71a72a.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, the Ordinance requires that the group be remain[ing] in one place with no apparent purpose.  
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice OConnor
				</span>
				s assertion that this applies to any person standing in a public place, 
				<em>
					ante

				, at 2, is a distortion.  The Ordinance does not apply to standing, but to remain[ing]a term which in this context obviously means [to] endure or persist, see American Heritage Dictionary 1525 (1992).  There may be some ambiguity at the margin, but remain[ing] in one place requires more than a temporary stop, and is clear in most of its applications, including all of those represented by the facts surrounding the respondents arrests described 
				<em>
					supra, 
				</em>
				at 12.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				As for the phrase with no apparent purpose: 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice OConnor
				</span>
				 again distorts this adjectival phrase, by separating it from the word that it modifies.  [A]ny person standing on the street, her concurrence says, has a general purposeeven if it is simply to stand, and thus the ordinance permits police officers to choose which purposes are 
				<em>
					permissible
				</em>
				.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 2.  But Chicago police officers enforcing the Ordinance are not looking for people with no apparent purpose (who are regrettably in oversupply); they are looking for people who remain in any one place with no apparent purposethat is, who remain there without any apparent reason 
				<em>
					for remaining there
				</em>
				.  That is not difficult to perceive.

				The Courts attempt to demonstrate the vagueness of the Ordinance produces the following peculiar statement: The no apparent purpose standard for making [the decision to issue an order to disperse] is inherently subjective because its application depends on whether some purpose is apparent to the officer on the scene.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 18.  In the Courts view, a persons lack of any purpose in staying in one location is presumably an 
				<em>
					objective
				</em>
				 factor, and what the Ordinance requires as a condition of an order to dispersethe absence of any 
				<em>
					apparent
				</em>
				 purposeis a 
				<em>
					subjective
				</em>
				 factor.  This side of the looking glass, just the opposite is true.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Elsewhere, of course, the Court acknowledges the clear, objective commands of the Ordinance, and indeed relies upon them to paint it as unfair:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				By its very terms, the ordinance encompasses a great deal of harmless behavior.  In any public place in the city of Chicago, persons who stand or sit in the company of a gang member may be ordered to disperse unless their purpose is apparent.  The mandatory language in the enactment directs the police to issue an order without first making any inquiry about their possible purposes.  It matters not whether the reason that a gang member and his father, for example, might loiter near Wrigley Field is to rob an unsuspecting fan or just to get a glimpse of Sammy Sosa leaving the ballpark; in either event, if their purpose is not apparent to a nearby police officer, she mayindeed, she shallorder them to disperse.

Quite so.  And the fact that this clear instruction to the officers encompasses a great deal of harmless behavior would be invalidating if that harmless behavior were constitutionally protected against abridgment, such as speech or the practice of religion.  Remaining in one place is 
				<em>

The problem, of course, well recognized by Chicagos City Council, is that the gang members cease their intimidating and unlawful behavior under the watchful eye of police officers, but return to it as soon as the police drive away.  The only solution, the council concluded, was to clear the streets of congregations of gangs, their drug customers, and their associates.

				, at 78, n. 17 (plurality opinion) (citing extant laws against intimidation, streetgang criminal drug conspiracy, and mob action).  The problem, again, is that the intimidation and lawlessness do not occur when the police are in sight.

				<em>
					Ante

And if remain[ing] in one place with no apparent purpose is so vague as to give the police unbridled discretion in controlling the conduct of non-gang-members, it surpasses understanding how it ceases to be so vague when applied to gang members 
				<em>

				The fact is that the present ordinance is entirely clear in its application, cannot be violated except with full knowledge and intent, and vests no more discretion in the police than innumerable other measures authorizing police orders to preserve the public peace and safety.  As suggested by their tortured analyses, and by their suggested solutions that bear no relation to the identified constitutional problem, the majoritys real quarrel with the Chicago Ordinance is simply that it permits (or indeed requires) too much harmless conduct by innocent citizens to be proscribed.  As 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice OConnor
				</span>
				s concurrence says with disapprobation, the ordinance applies to hundreds of thousands of persons who are 
				<em>

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				But in our democratic system, how much harmless conduct to proscribe is not a judgment to be made by the courts.  So long as constitutionally guaranteed rights are not affected, and so long as the proscription has a rational basis, 
				<em>
					all sorts
				</em>
				 of perfectly harmless activity by millions of perfectly innocent people can be forbiddenriding a motorcycle without a safety helmet, for example, starting a campfire in a national forest, or selling a safe and effective drug not yet approved by the FDA.  All of these acts are entirely innocent and harmless in themselves, but because of the 
				<em>
					risk
				</em>
				 of harm that they entail, the freedom to engage in them has been abridged.  The citizens of Chicago have decided that depriving themselves of the freedom to hang out with a gang member is necessary to eliminate pervasive gang crime and intimidationand that the elimination of the one is worth the deprivation of the other.  This Court has no business second-guessing either the degree of necessity or the fairness of the trade.

						 In other words, a facial attack, since it requires unconstitutionality in all circumstances, necessarily presumes that the litigant presently before the court would be able to sustain an as-applied challenge.  See Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/455/489" class="subref" title="subref">455 U. S. 489</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">495</a> (1982)
 (A plaintiff who engages in some conduct that is clearly proscribed cannot complain of the vagueness of the law as applied tothe conduct of others.  A court should therefore examine the complainants conduct before analyzing other hypothetical applications of the law); Parker v. Levy, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/417/733" class="subref" title="subref">417 U. S. 733</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">756</a> (1974)
 (One to whose con-duct a statute clearly applies may not successfully challenge it for vagueness).  


The plurality asserts that in United States v. Salerno, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/481/739" class="subref" title="subref">481 U. S. 739</a> (1987)
, which I discuss in text immediately following this footnote, the Court entertained a facial challenge even though the defendants . . . did not claim that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to them.  Ante, at 11, n. 22.  That is not so.  The Court made it absolutely clear in Salerno that a facial challenge requires the assertion that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid, 481 U. S., at 745 (emphasis added).  The footnoted statement upon which the plurality relies (Nor have respondents claimed that the Act is unconstitutional because of the way it was applied to the particular facts of their case, id., at 745, n. 3) was obviously meant to convey the fact that the defendants were not making, in addition to their facial challenge, an alternative as-applied challengei.e., asserting that even if the statute was not unconstitutional in all its applications it was at least unconstitutional in its particular application to them.

						 Salerno, a criminal case, repudiated the Courts statement in Kolender v. Lawson, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/461/352" class="subref" title="subref">461 U. S. 352</a>, n. 8 (1983), to the effect that a facial challenge to a criminal statute could succeed even when [the statute] could conceivably have had some valid application.  Kolender seems to have confused the standard for 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> overbreadth challenges with the standard governing facial challenges on all other grounds.  See ibid. (citing the Courts articulation of the standard for 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> overbreadth challenges from Hoffman Estates, supra, at 494).  As Salerno noted, 481 U. S., at 745, the overbreadth doctrine is a specialized exception to the general rule for facial challenges, justified in light of the risk that an overbroad statute will chill free expression.  See, e.g., Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/413/601" class="subref" title="subref">413 U. S. 601</a>,

						 The plurality asserts that the Salerno standard for facial challenge has never been the decisive factor in any decision of this Court.  It means by that only this: in rejecting a facial challenge, the Court has never contented itself with identifying only one situation in which the challenged statute would be constitutional, but has mentioned several.  But that is not at all remarkable, and casts no doubt upon the validity of the principle that Salerno and these many other cases enunciated.  It is difficult to conceive of a statute that would be constitutional in only a single applicationand hard to resist mentioning more than one.


The plurality contends that it does not matter whether the Salerno standard is federal law, since facial challenge is a species of third-party standing, and federal limitations upon third-party standing do not apply in an appeal from a state decision which takes a broader view, as the Illinois Supreme Courts opinion did here.  Ante, at 11, n. 22.  This is quite wrong.  Disagreement over the Salerno rule is not a disagreement over the standing question of whether the person challenging the statute can raise the rights of third parties: under both Salerno and the plurality's rule he can.  The disagreement relates to how many third-party rights he must prove to be infringed by the statute before he can win: Salerno says all (in addition to his own rights), the plurality says many.  That is not a question of standing but of substantive law.  The notion that, if Salerno is the federal rule (a federal statute is not totally invalid unless it is invalid in all its applications), it can be altered by a state court (a federal statute is totally invalid if it is invalid in many of its applications), and that that alteration must be accepted by the Supreme Court of the United States is, to put it as gently as possible, remarkable.

						 The pluralitys explanation for ignoring these laws is that many of them carried severe penalties and, during the Reconstruction era, they had harsh consequences on African-American women and children.  Ante, at 910, n. 20.  Those severe penalties and those harsh consequences are certainly regrettable, but they in no way lessen (indeed, the harshness of penalty tends to increase) the capacity of these laws to prove that loitering was never regarded as a fundamental liberty.

						 Ante, at 9, n. 19.

We address that doctrine in Part II below.  Brief for Petitioner 2122, n. 14.  If a careless reader were inclined to confuse the term social gatherings in this passage with loitering, his confusion would be eliminated by pursuing the reference to Part II of the brief, which says, in its introductory paragraph: [A]s we explain below, substantive due process does not support the courts novel holding that the Constitution secures the right to stand still on the public way even when one is not engaged in speech, assembly, or other conduct that enjoys affirmative constitutional protection.  Id., at 39.

						 The plurality says, ante, at 20, n. 35, that since it decides the case on the basis of procedural due process rather than substantive due process, I am mistaken in analyzing its opinion under the framework for substantive due process set out in Washington v. Glucksberg.  Ibid.  But I am not analyzing it under that framework.  I am simply assuming that when the plurality says (as an essential part of its reasoning) that the right to loiter for innocent purposes is . . . a part of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause it does not believe that the same word (liberty) means one thing for purposes of substantive due process and something else for purposes of procedural due process.  There is no authority for that startling proposition.  See Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/408/564" class="subref" title="subref">408 U. S. 564</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">572</a>575 (1972)
 (rejecting procedural-due-process claim for lack of liberty interest, and citing substantive-due-process cases).


The pluralitys opinion seeks to have it both ways, invoking the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>s august protection of liberty in defining the standard of certainty that it sets, but then, in identifying the conduct protected by that high standard, ignoring our extensive case-law defining liberty, and substituting, instead, all harmless and innocent conduct, ante, at 14.

						 I call it a suggestion because the plurality says only that the terms of the dispersal order compound the inadequacy of the notice, and acknowledges that they might not render the ordinance unconstitutionally vague if the definition of the forbidden conduct were clear.  Ante, at 15, 16.  This notion that a prescription (Disperse!) which is itself not unconstitutionally vague can somehow contribute to the unconstitutional vagueness of the entire scheme is full of mysterysuspending, as it does, the metaphysical principle that nothing can confer what it does not possess (nemo dat qui non habet).

						 Justice Breyer asserts that one always has some apparent purpose, so that the policeman must interpret the words no apparent purpose as meaning no apparent purpose except for . . . .  Ante, at 12.  It is simply not true that one always has some apparent purposeand especially not true that one always has some apparent purpose in remaining at rest, for the simple reason that one often (indeed, perhaps usually) has no actual purpose in remaining at rest.  Remaining at rest will be a persons normal state, unless he has a purpose which causes him to move.  That is why one frequently reads of a persons wandering aimlessly (which is worthy of note) but not of a persons sitting aimlessly (which is not remarkable at all).  And that is why a synonym for purpose is motive: that which causes one to move.

						 The Court also speculates that a police officer may exercise his discretion to enforce the Ordinance and direct dispersal when (in the Courts view) the Ordinance is inapplicableviz., where there is an apparent purpose, but it is an unlawful one.  See ante, at 18.  No one in his right mind would read the phrase without any apparent purpose to mean anything other than without any apparent lawful purpose.  The implication that acts referred to approvingly in statutory language are lawful acts is routine.  The Court asserts that the Illinois Supreme Court has forced it into this interpretive inanity because, since it has not placed any limiting construction on the language in the ordinance, we must assume that the ordinance means what it says . . . .  Ante, at 19.  But the Illinois Supreme Court did not mention this particular interpretive issue, which has nothing to do with giving the Ordinance a limiting interpretation, and everything to do with giving it its ordinary legal meaning.

				The citizens of Chicago were once free to drive about the city at whatever speed they wished.  At some point Chicagoans (or perhaps Illinoisans) decided this would not do, and imposed prophylactic speed limits designed to assure safe operation by the average (or perhaps even subaverage) driver with the average (or perhaps even subaverage) vehicle.  This infringed upon the freedom of all citizens, but was not unconstitutional.

				Similarly, the citizens of Chicago were once free to stand around and gawk at the scene of an accident.  At some point Chicagoans discovered that this obstructed traffic and caused more accidents.  They did not make the practice unlawful, but they did authorize police officers to order the crowd to disperse, and imposed penalties for refusal to obey such an order.  Again, this prophylactic measure infringed upon the freedom of all citizens, but was not unconstitutional.

				Until the ordinance that is before us today was adopted, the citizens of Chicago were free to stand about in public places with no apparent purposeto engage, that is, in conduct that appeared to be loitering.  In recent years, however, the city has been afflicted with criminal street gangs.  As reflected in the record before us, these gangs congregated in public places to deal in drugs, and to terrorize the neighborhoods by demonstrating control over their turf.  Many residents of the inner city felt that they were prisoners in their own homes.  Once again, Chicagoans decided that to eliminate the problem it was worth restricting some of the freedom that they once enjoyed.  The means they took was similar to the second, and more mild, example given above rather than the first: Loitering was not made unlawful, but when a group of people occupied a public place without an apparent purpose and in the company of a known gang member, police officers were authorized to order them to disperse, and the failure to obey such an order was made unlawful.  See Chicago Municipal Code §84015 (1992).  The minor limitation upon the free state of nature that this prophylactic arrangement imposed upon all Chicagoans seemed to them (and it seems to me) a small price to pay for liberation of their streets.

				The majority today invalidates this perfectly reasonable measure by ignoring our rules governing facial challenges, by elevating loitering to a constitutionally guaranteed right, and by discerning vagueness where, according to our usual standards, none exists.

				Respondents consolidated appeal presents a facial challenge to the Chicago Ordinance on vagueness grounds.  When a facial challenge is successful, the law in question is declared to be unenforceable in 
				<em>
					all
				</em>
				 its applications, and not just in its particular application to the party in suit.  To tell the truth, it is highly questionable whether federal courts have any business making such a declaration.  The rationale for our power to review federal legislation for constitutionality, expressed in 
				<em>
					Marbury
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Madison
				</em>
				, 1 Cranch 137 (1803), was that we 
				<em>
					had

				 to do so in order to decide the case before us.  But that rationale only extends so far as to require us to determine that the statute is unconstitutional as applied to

				The second characteristic of judicial power is, that it pronounces on special cases, and not upon general principles.  If a judge, in deciding a particular point, destroys a general principle by passing a judgment which tends to reject all the inferences from that principle, and consequently to annul it, he remains within the ordinary limits of his functions.  But if he directly attacks a general principle without having a particular case in view, he leaves the circle in which all nations have agreed to confine his authority; he assumes a more important, and perhaps a more useful influence, than that of the magistrate; but he ceases to represent the judicial power.

But as soon as a judge has refused to apply any given law in a case, that law immediately loses a portion of its moral force.  Those to whom it is prejudicial learn that means exist of overcoming its authority; and similar suits are multiplied, until it becomes powerless. … The political power which the Americans have entrusted to their courts of justice is therefore immense; but the evils of this power are considerably diminished by the impossibility of attacking the laws except through the courts of justice. …  [W]hen a judge contests a law in an obscure debate on some particular case, the importance of his attack is concealed from public notice; his decision bears upon the interest of an individual, and the law is slighted only incidentally.  Moreover, although it is censured, it is not abolished; its moral force may be diminished, but its authority is not taken away; and its final destruction can be accomplished only by the reiterated attacks of judicial functionaries.  Democracy in America 73, 7576 (R.

				When our normal criteria for facial challenges are applied, it is clear that the Justices in the majority have transposed the burden of proof.  Instead of requiring the respondents, who are challenging the Ordinance, to show that it is invalid in all its applications, they have required the petitioner to show that it is valid in all its applications.  Both the plurality opinion and the concurrences display a lively imagination, creating hypothetical situations in which the laws application would (in their view) be ambiguous.  But that creative role has been usurped from the petitioner, who can defeat the respondents facial challenge by conjuring up 
				<em>
					a single valid application
				</em>
				 of the law.  My contribution would go something like this

				: Tony, a member of the Jets criminal street gang, is standing alongside and chatting with fellow gang members while staking out their turf at Promontory Point on the South Side of Chicago; the group is flashing gang signs and displaying their distinctive tattoos to passersby.  Officer Krupke, applying the Ordinance at issue here, orders the group to disperse.  After some speculative discussion (probably irrelevant here) over whether the Jets are depraved because they are deprived, Tony and the other gang members break off further conversation with the statementnot entirely coherent, but evidently intended to be rudeGee, Officer Krupke, krup you.  A tense standoff ensues until Officer Krupke arrests the group for failing to obey his dispersal order.  Even assuming (as the Justices in the majority do, but I do not) that a law requiring obedience to a dispersal order is impermissibly vague unless it is clear to the objects of the order, before its issuance, that their conduct justifies it, I find it hard to believe that the Jets would not have known they had it coming.  That should settle the matter of respondents facial challenge to the Ordinances vagueness.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Of course respondents would still be able to claim that the Ordinance was vague as applied to them.  But the ultimate demonstration of the inappropriateness of the Courts holding of 
				<em>
					facial 
				</em>
				invalidity is the fact that it is doubtful whether some of these respondents could even sustain an 
				<em>
					as-applied 
				</em>
				challenge on the basis of the majoritys own criteria.  For instance, respondent Jose Renteriawho admitted that he was a member of the Satan Disciples gangwas observed by the arresting officer loitering on a street corner with other gang members.  The officer issued a dispersal order, but when she returned to the same corner 15 to 20 minutes later, Renteria was still there with his friends, whereupon he was arrested.  In another example, respondent Daniel Washington and several otherswho admitted they were members of the Vice Lords gangwere observed by the arresting officer loitering in the street, yelling at passing vehicles, stopping traffic, and preventing pedestrians from using the sidewalks.  The arresting officer issued a dispersal order, issued 
				<em>
					another
				</em>
				 dispersal order later when the group did not move, and finally arrested the group when they were found loitering in the same place still later.  Finally, respondent Gregorio Gutierrezwho had previously admitted to the arresting officer his membership in the Latin Kings gangwas observed loitering with two other men.  The officer issued a dispersal order, drove around the block, and arrested the men after finding them in the same place upon his return.  See Brief for Petitioner 7, n. 5; Brief for United States as 
				<em>
					Amicus Curiae
				</em>
				 16, n. 11.  Even on the majoritys assumption that to avoid vagueness it must be clear to the object of the dispersal order 
				<em>
					ex ante
				</em>
				 that his conduct is covered by the Ordinance, it seems most improbable that any of these as-applied challenges would be sustained.  Much less is it possible to say that the Ordinance is invalid in 
				<em>
					all 
				</em>
				its applications.

				The plurality's explanation for its departure from the usual rule governing facial challenges is seemingly contained in the following statement: [This] is a criminal law that contains no 
				<em>
					mens rea
				</em>
				 requirement … 
				<em>
					and
				</em>
				 infringes on constitutionally protected rights … .  When vagueness permeates the text of

				<em>
					mens rea 
				</em>
				requirement)   (infringement of constitutionally protected right)   (vagueness) = (entitlement to facial invalidation).  There is no such formula; the plurality has made it up for this case, as the absence of any citation demonstrates.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				But no matter.  None of the three factors that the plurality relies upon exists anyway.  I turn first to the support for the proposition that there is a constitutionally protected right to loiteror, as the plurality more favorably describes it, for a person to remain in a public place of his choice.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  The plurality thinks much of this Fundamental Freedom to Loiter, which it contrasts with such lesser, constitutionally 
				<em>
					un
				</em>
				protected, activities as doing (ugh!) 
				<em>
					business
				</em>
				: This is not an ordinance that simply regulates business behavior and contains a scienter requirement. . . . It is a criminal law that contains no 
				<em>
					mens rea
				</em>
				 requirement . . . and infringes on constitutionally protected rights.  
				<em>
					Ibid.

				Of course every activity, even scratching ones head, can be called a constitutional right if one means by that term nothing more than the fact that the activity is covered (as all are) by the Equal Protection Clause, so that those who engage in it cannot be singled out without rational basis.  See

				It would be unfair, however, to criticize the pluralitys failed attempt to establish that loitering is a constitutionally protected right while saying nothing of the concurrences.  The plurality at least makes an attempt.  The concurrences, on the other hand, make no pretense at attaching their broad vagueness invalidates rule to a liberty interest.  As far as appears from 
				<span class="smallcaps">

				<span class="smallcaps">

				<em>
					no

				 police officer may issue 
				<em>
					any
				</em>
				 order, affecting 
				<em>
					any
				</em>
				 insignificant sort of citizen conduct (except, perhaps, an order addressed to the unprotected class of gang members) unless the standards for the issuance of that order are precise.  No mod-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				ern urban societyand probably none since London got big enough to have sewerscould function under such a rule.  There are innumerable reasons why it may be im-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				portant for a constable to tell a pedestrian to move onand even if it were possible to list in an ordinance all of the reasons that are known, many are simply unpredictable.  Hence the (entirely reasonable) Rule of the City of New York which reads: No person shall fail, neglect or refuse to comply with the lawful direction or command of any Police Officer, Urban Park Ranger, Parks Enforcement Patrol Officer or other [Parks and Recreation] Department employee, indicated by gesture or otherwise.  56 RCNY §103(c)(1) (1996).  It is one thing to uphold an as applied challenge when a pedestrian disobeys such an order that is unreasonableor even when a pedestrian asserting some true liberty interest (holding a political rally, for instance) disobeys such an order that is reasonable 
				<em>
					but unexplained

				.  But to say that such a general ordinance permitting lawful orders is void

				I turn next to that element of the plurality's facial-challenge formula which consists of the proposition that this criminal ordinance contains no 
				<em>
					mens rea 
				</em>
				requirement.  The first step in analyzing this proposition is to determine what the 
				<em>
					actus reus
				</em>
				, to which that 
				<em>
					mens rea
				</em>
				 is supposed to be attached, consists of.  The majority believes that loitering forms part of (indeed, the essence of) the offense, and must be proved if conviction is to be obtained.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 2, 6, 913, 1415, 1618 (plurality and majority opinions); 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 23, 4 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					OConnor, J.
				</span>
				, concurring in part and concurring in judgment); 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 12 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Kennedy, J
				</span>
				., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 34 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Breyer, J
				</span>
				., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  That is not what the Ordinance provides.  The only part of the Ordinance that refers to loitering is the portion that addresses, not the punishable conduct of the defendant, but what the police officer must observe before he can issue an order to disperse; and what he must observe is carefully defined in terms of what the defendant 
				<em>
					appears
				</em>
				 to be doing, not in terms of what the defendant is 
				<em>
					actually
				</em>
				 doing.  The Ordinance does not require that the defendant have been loitering (
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, have been remaining in one place with no purpose), but rather that the police officer have observed him remaining in one place without any 
				<em>
					apparent
				</em>
				 purpose.  Someone who in fact 
				<em>
					has
				</em>
				 a genuine purpose for remaining where he is (waiting for a friend, for example, or waiting to hold up a bank) 
				<em>
					can
				</em>
				 be ordered to move on (assuming the other conditions of the Ordinance are met), so long as his remaining has no 
				<em>
					apparent
				</em>
				 purpose.  It is likely, to be sure, that the Ordinance will come down most heavily upon those who are 
				<em>
					actually 
				</em>
				loitering (those who 
				<em>
					really
				</em>
				 have no purpose in remaining where they are); but that activity is not a condition for issuance of the dispersal order.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The 
				<em>
					only
				</em>
				 act of a defendant that is made punishable by the Ordinanceor, indeed, that is even mentioned by the Ordinanceis his failure to promptly obey an order to disperse.  The question, then, is whether that 
				<em>
					actus reus
				</em>
				 must be accompanied by any wrongful intentand of course it must.  As the Court itself describes the requirement, a person must 
				<em>
					disobey
				</em>
				 the officers order.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 3 (emphasis added).  No one thinks a defendant could be successfully prosecuted under the Ordinance if he did not hear the order to disperse, or if he suffered a paralysis that rendered his compliance impossible.  The willful failure to obey a police order is wrongful intent enough.

				Finally, I address the last of the three factors in the plurality's facial-challenge formula: the proposition that the Ordinance is vague.  It is not.  Even under the ersatz overbreadth standard applied in

A law is unconstitutionally vague if its lack of definitive standards either (1) fails to apprise persons of ordinary intelligence of the prohibited conduct, or (2) encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,

				The plurality relies primarily upon the first of these aspects.  Since, it reasons, the loitering is the conduct that the ordinance is designed to prohibit, and an officer may issue an order only after prohibited conduct has already occurred, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 14, 15, the order to disperse cannot itself serve to apprise persons of ordinary intelligence of the prohibited conduct.  What counts for purposes of vagueness analysis, however, is not what the Ordinance is designed to prohibit, but what it actually subjects to criminal penalty.  As discussed earlier, that consists of nothing but the refusal to obey a dispersal order, as to which there is no doubt of adequate notice of the prohibited conduct.  The plurality's suggestion that even the dispersal order 
				<em>
					itself
				</em>
				 is unconstitutionally vague, because it does not specify 
				<em>
					how far to disperse (!)
				</em>
				, see 
				<em>

				  If it were true, it would render unconstitutional for vagueness many of the Presidential proclamations issued under that provision of the United States Code which requires the President, before using the militia or the Armed Forces for law enforcement, to issue a proclamation ordering the insurgents to disperse.

				For its determination of unconstitutional vagueness, the Court relies secondarilyand 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice OConnor
				</span>
				s and 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Breyer
				</span>
				s concurrences exclusivelyupon the second aspect of that doctrine, which requires sufficient specificity to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory law enforcement.  See 
				<em>

				</em>
				, at 3 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Breyer, J
				</span>
				., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  In discussing whether Chicagos Ordinance meets that requirement, the Justices in the majority hide behind an artificial construct of judicial restraint.  They point to the Supreme Court of Illinois statement that the apparent purpose standard provides absolute discretion to police officers to decide what activities constitute loitering, 687 N. E. 2d 53, 63 (1997), and protest that it would be wrong to construe the language of the Ordinance more narrowly than did the States highest court.

				<em>

				, at 45 (

				<em>
					characterization
				</em>
				 of what the language achievedafter that court refused (as I do) to read in any limitations that the words do not fairly contain.  It is not a construction of the language (to which we are bound) but a legal conclusion (to which we most assuredly are not bound).

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The criteria for issuance of a dispersal order under the Chicago Ordinance could hardly be clearer.  First, the law requires police officers to reasonably believ[e] that one of the group to which the order is issued is a criminal street gang member.  This resembles a probable-cause standard, and the Chicago Police Departments General Order 924 (1992)promulgated to govern enforcement of the Ordinancemakes the probable cause requirement explicit.
				<a name="ZD-10ref" href="#ZD-10" class="">

					10
				</b>
                </sup>
            </a>
				  Under the Order, officers must have probable cause to believe that an individual is a member of a criminal street gang, to be substantiated by the officers experience and knowledge of the alleged offenders and by specific, documented and reliable information such as reliable witness testimony or an individuals admission of gang membership or display of distinctive colors, tattoos, signs, or other markings worn by members of particular criminal street gangs.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 67a69a, 71a72a.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, the Ordinance requires that the group be remain[ing] in one place with no apparent purpose.  
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice OConnor
				</span>
				s assertion that this applies to any person standing in a public place, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 2, is a distortion.  The Ordinance does not apply to standing, but to remain[ing]a term which in this context obviously means [to] endure or persist, see American Heritage Dictionary 1525 (1992).  There may be some ambiguity at the margin, but remain[ing] in one place requires more than a temporary stop, and is clear in most of its applications, including all of those represented by the facts surrounding the respondents arrests described 
				<em>
					supra, 
				</em>
				at 12.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				As for the phrase with no apparent purpose: 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice OConnor
				</span>
				 again distorts this adjectival phrase, by separating it from the word that it modifies.  [A]ny person standing on the street, her concurrence says, has a general purposeeven if it is simply to stand, and thus the ordinance permits police officers to choose which purposes are 
				<em>
					permissible
				</em>
				.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 2.  But Chicago police officers enforcing the Ordinance are not looking for people with no apparent purpose (who are regrettably in oversupply); they are looking for people who remain in any one place with no apparent purposethat is, who remain there without any apparent reason 
				<em>
					for remaining there
				</em>
				.  That is not difficult to perceive.

				The Courts attempt to demonstrate the vagueness of the Ordinance produces the following peculiar statement: The no apparent purpose standard for making [the decision to issue an order to disperse] is inherently subjective because its application depends on whether some purpose is apparent to the officer on the scene.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 18.  In the Courts view, a persons lack of any purpose in staying in one location is presumably an 
				<em>
					objective
				</em>
				 factor, and what the Ordinance requires as a condition of an order to dispersethe absence of any 
				<em>
					apparent
				</em>
				 purposeis a 
				<em>
					subjective
				</em>
				 factor.  This side of the looking glass, just the opposite is true.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Elsewhere, of course, the Court acknowledges the clear, objective commands of the Ordinance, and indeed relies upon them to paint it as unfair:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				By its very terms, the ordinance encompasses a great deal of harmless behavior.  In any public place in the city of Chicago, persons who stand or sit in the company of a gang member may be ordered to disperse unless their purpose is apparent.  The mandatory language in the enactment directs the police to issue an order without first making any inquiry about their possible purposes.  It matters not whether the reason that a gang member and his father, for example, might loiter near Wrigley Field is to rob an unsuspecting fan or just to get a glimpse of Sammy Sosa leaving the ballpark; in either event, if their purpose is not apparent to a nearby police officer, she mayindeed, she shallorder them to disperse.

Quite so.  And the fact that this clear instruction to the officers encompasses a great deal of harmless behavior would be invalidating if that harmless behavior were constitutionally protected against abridgment, such as speech or the practice of religion.  Remaining in one place is 
				<em>

				The Court also assertsin apparent contradiction to the passage just quotedthat the apparent purpose test is too elastic because it presumably allows police officers to treat

				, at 78, n. 17.  The problem, of course, well recognized by Chicagos City Council, is that the gang members cease their intimidating and unlawful behavior under the watchful eye of police officers, but return to it as soon as the police drive away.  The only solution, the council concluded, was to clear the streets of congregations of gangs, their drug customers, and their associates.

				, at 78, n. 17 (plurality opinion) (citing extant laws against intimidation, streetgang criminal drug conspiracy, and mob action).  The problem, again, is that the intimidation and lawlessness do not occur when the police are in sight.

				<em>
					Ante

				, at 3 (the Court agrees that this might be a cure, see 
				<em>
					ante

And if remain[ing] in one place with no apparent purpose is so vague as to give the police unbridled discretion in controlling the conduct of non-gang-members, it surpasses understanding how it ceases to be so vague when applied to gang members 
				<em>

				The fact is that the present ordinance is entirely clear in its application, cannot be violated except with full knowledge and intent, and vests no more discretion in the police than innumerable other measures authorizing police orders to preserve the public peace and safety.  As suggested by their tortured analyses, and by their suggested solutions that bear no relation to the identified constitutional problem, the majoritys real quarrel with the Chicago Ordinance is simply that it permits (or indeed requires) too much harmless conduct by innocent citizens to be proscribed.  As 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice OConnor
				</span>
				s concurrence says with disapprobation, the ordinance applies to hundreds of thousands of persons who are 
				<em>
					not

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				But in our democratic system, how much harmless conduct to proscribe is not a judgment to be made by the courts.  So long as constitutionally guaranteed rights are not affected, and so long as the proscription has a rational basis, 
				<em>
					all sorts
				</em>
				 of perfectly harmless activity by millions of perfectly innocent people can be forbiddenriding a motorcycle without a safety helmet, for example, starting a campfire in a national forest, or selling a safe and effective drug not yet approved by the FDA.  All of these acts are entirely innocent and harmless in themselves, but because of the 
				<em>
					risk
				</em>
				 of harm that they entail, the freedom to engage in them has been abridged.  The citizens of Chicago have decided that depriving themselves of the freedom to hang out with a gang member is necessary to eliminate pervasive gang crime and intimidationand that the elimination of the one is worth the deprivation of the other.  This Court has no business second-guessing either the degree of necessity or the fairness of the trade.

						 In other words, a facial attack, since it requires unconstitutionality in all circumstances, necessarily presumes that the litigant presently before the court would be able to sustain an as-applied challenge.  See Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/455/489" class="subref" title="subref">455 U. S. 489</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">495</a> (1982)
 (A plaintiff who engages in some conduct that is clearly proscribed cannot complain of the vagueness of the law as applied tothe conduct of others.  A court should therefore examine the complainants conduct before analyzing other hypothetical applications of the law); Parker v. Levy, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/417/733" class="subref" title="subref">417 U. S. 733</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">756</a> (1974)
 (One to whose con-duct a statute clearly applies may not successfully challenge it for vagueness).  


The plurality asserts that in United States v. Salerno, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/481/739" class="subref" title="subref">481 U. S. 739</a> (1987)
, which I discuss in text immediately following this footnote, the Court entertained a facial challenge even though the defendants . . . did not claim that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to them.  Ante, at 11, n. 22.  That is not so.  The Court made it absolutely clear in Salerno that a facial challenge requires the assertion that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid, 481 U. S., at 745 (emphasis added).  The footnoted statement upon which the plurality relies (Nor have respondents claimed that the Act is unconstitutional because of the way it was applied to the particular facts of their case, id., at 745, n. 3) was obviously meant to convey the fact that the defendants were not making, in addition to their facial challenge, an alternative as-applied challengei.e., asserting that even if the statute was not unconstitutional in all its applications it was at least unconstitutional in its particular application to them.

						 Salerno, a criminal case, repudiated the Courts statement in Kolender v. Lawson, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/461/352" class="subref" title="subref">461 U. S. 352</a>, n. 8 (1983), to the effect that a facial challenge to a criminal statute could succeed even when [the statute] could conceivably have had some valid application.  Kolender seems to have confused the standard for 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> overbreadth challenges with the standard governing facial challenges on all other grounds.  See ibid. (citing the Courts articulation of the standard for 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> overbreadth challenges from Hoffman Estates, supra, at 494).  As Salerno noted, 481 U. S., at 745, the overbreadth doctrine is a specialized exception to the general rule for facial challenges, justified in light of the risk that an overbroad statute will chill free expression.  See, e.g., Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/413/601" class="subref" title="subref">413 U. S. 601</a>,

						 The plurality asserts that the Salerno standard for facial challenge has never been the decisive factor in any decision of this Court.  It means by that only this: in rejecting a facial challenge, the Court has never contented itself with identifying only one situation in which the challenged statute would be constitutional, but has mentioned several.  But that is not at all remarkable, and casts no doubt upon the validity of the principle that Salerno and these many other cases enunciated.  It is difficult to conceive of a statute that would be constitutional in only a single applicationand hard to resist mentioning more than one.


The plurality contends that it does not matter whether the Salerno standard is federal law, since facial challenge is a species of third-party standing, and federal limitations upon third-party standing do not apply in an appeal from a state decision which takes a broader view, as the Illinois Supreme Courts opinion did here.  Ante, at 11, n. 22.  This is quite wrong.  Disagreement over the Salerno rule is not a disagreement over the standing question of whether the person challenging the statute can raise the rights of third parties: under both Salerno and the plurality's rule he can.  The disagreement relates to how many third-party rights he must prove to be infringed by the statute before he can win: Salerno says all (in addition to his own rights), the plurality says many.  That is not a question of standing but of substantive law.  The notion that, if Salerno is the federal rule (a federal statute is not totally invalid unless it is invalid in all its applications), it can be altered by a state court (a federal statute is totally invalid if it is invalid in many of its applications), and that that alteration must be accepted by the Supreme Court of the United States is, to put it as gently as possible, remarkable.

						 The pluralitys explanation for ignoring these laws is that many of them carried severe penalties and, during the Reconstruction era, they had harsh consequences on African-American women and children.  Ante, at 910, n. 20.  Those severe penalties and those harsh consequences are certainly regrettable, but they in no way lessen (indeed, the harshness of penalty tends to increase) the capacity of these laws to prove that loitering was never regarded as a fundamental liberty.

						 Ante, at 9, n. 19.  The plurality bases its assertion of apparent concession upon a footnote in Part I of petitioners brief which reads: Of course, laws regulating social gatherings affect a liberty interest, and thus are subject to review under the rubric of substantive due process . . . . We address that doctrine in Part II below.  Brief for Petitioner 2122, n. 14.  If a careless reader were inclined to confuse the term social gatherings in this passage with loitering, his confusion would be eliminated by pursuing the reference to Part II of the brief, which says, in its introductory paragraph: [A]s we explain below, substantive due process does not support the courts novel holding that the Constitution secures the right to stand still on the public way even when one is not engaged in speech, assembly, or other conduct that enjoys affirmative constitutional protection.  Id., at 39.

						 The plurality says, ante, at 20, n. 35, that since it decides the case on the basis of procedural due process rather than substantive due process, I am mistaken in analyzing its opinion under the framework for substantive due process set out in Washington v. Glucksberg.  Ibid.  But I am not analyzing it under that framework.  I am simply assuming that when the plurality says (as an essential part of its reasoning) that the right to loiter for innocent purposes is . . . a part of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause it does not believe that the same word (liberty) means one thing for purposes of substantive due process and something else for purposes of procedural due process.  There is no authority for that startling proposition.  See Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/408/564" class="subref" title="subref">408 U. S. 564</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">572</a>575 (1972)
 (rejecting procedural-due-process claim for lack of liberty interest, and citing substantive-due-process cases).


The pluralitys opinion seeks to have it both ways, invoking the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>s august protection of liberty in defining the standard of certainty that it sets, but then, in identifying the conduct protected by that high standard, ignoring our extensive case-law defining liberty, and substituting, instead, all harmless and innocent conduct, ante, at 14.

						 I call it a suggestion because the plurality says only that the terms of the dispersal order compound the inadequacy of the notice, and acknowledges that they might not render the ordinance unconstitutionally vague if the definition of the forbidden conduct were clear.  Ante, at 15, 16.  This notion that a prescription (Disperse!) which is itself not unconstitutionally vague can somehow contribute to the unconstitutional vagueness of the entire scheme is full of mysterysuspending, as it does, the metaphysical principle that nothing can confer what it does not possess (nemo dat qui non habet).

						 Justice Breyer asserts that one always has some apparent purpose, so that the policeman must interpret the words no apparent purpose as meaning no apparent purpose except for . . . .  Ante, at 12.  It is simply not true that one always has some apparent purposeand especially not true that one always has some apparent purpose in remaining at rest, for the simple reason that one often (indeed, perhaps usually) has no actual purpose in remaining at rest.  Remaining at rest will be a persons normal state, unless he has a purpose which causes him to move.  That is why one frequently reads of a persons wandering aimlessly (which is worthy of note) but not of a persons sitting aimlessly (which is not remarkable at all).  And that is why a synonym for purpose is motive: that which causes one to move.

						 The Court also speculates that a police officer may exercise his discretion to enforce the Ordinance and direct dispersal when (in the Courts view) the Ordinance is inapplicableviz., where there is an apparent purpose, but it is an unlawful one.  See ante, at 18.  No one in his right mind would read the phrase without any apparent purpose to mean anything other than without any apparent lawful purpose.  The implication that acts referred to approvingly in statutory language are lawful acts is routine.  The Court asserts that the Illinois Supreme Court has forced it into this interpretive inanity because, since it has not placed any limiting construction on the language in the ordinance, we must assume that the ordinance means what it says . . . .  Ante, at 19.  But the Illinois Supreme Court did not mention this particular interpretive issue, which has nothing to do with giving the Ordinance a limiting interpretation, and everything to do with giving it its ordinary legal meaning.

				The citizens of Chicago were once free to drive about the city at whatever speed they wished.  At some point Chicagoans (or perhaps Illinoisans) decided this would not do, and imposed prophylactic speed limits designed to assure safe operation by the average (or perhaps even subaverage) driver with the average (or perhaps even subaverage) vehicle.  This infringed upon the freedom of all citizens, but was not unconstitutional.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Similarly, the citizens of Chicago were once free to stand around and gawk at the scene of an accident.  At some point Chicagoans discovered that this obstructed traffic and caused more accidents.  They did not make the practice unlawful, but they did authorize police officers to order the crowd to disperse, and imposed penalties for refusal to obey such an order.  Again, this prophylactic measure infringed upon the freedom of all citizens, but was not unconstitutional.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Until the ordinance that is before us today was adopted, the citizens of Chicago were free to stand about in public places with no apparent purposeto engage, that is, in conduct that appeared to be loitering.  In recent years, however, the city has been afflicted with criminal street gangs.  As reflected in the record before us, these gangs congregated in public places to deal in drugs, and to terrorize the neighborhoods by demonstrating control over their turf.  Many residents of the inner city felt that they were prisoners in their own homes.  Once again, Chicagoans decided that to eliminate the problem it was worth restricting some of the freedom that they once enjoyed.  The means they took was similar to the second, and more mild, example given above rather than the first: Loitering was not made unlawful, but when a group of people occupied a public place without an apparent purpose and in the company of a known gang member, police officers were authorized to order them to disperse, and the failure to obey such an order was made unlawful.  See Chicago Municipal Code §84015 (1992).  The minor limitation upon the free state of nature that this prophylactic arrangement imposed upon all Chicagoans seemed to them (and it seems to me) a small price to pay for liberation of their streets.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The majority today invalidates this perfectly reasonable measure by ignoring our rules governing facial challenges, by elevating loitering to a constitutionally guaranteed right, and by discerning vagueness where, according to our usual standards, none exists.

				Respondents consolidated appeal presents a facial challenge to the Chicago Ordinance on vagueness grounds.  When a facial challenge is successful, the law in question is declared to be unenforceable in 
				<em>
					all

				 its applications, and not just in its particular application to the party in suit.  To tell the truth, it is highly questionable whether federal courts have any business making such a declaration.  The rationale for our power to review federal legislation for constitutionality, expressed in

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The second characteristic of judicial power is, that it pronounces on special cases, and not upon general principles.  If a judge, in deciding a particular point, destroys a general principle by passing a judgment which tends to reject all the inferences from that principle, and consequently to annul it, he remains within the ordinary limits of his functions.  But if he directly attacks a general principle without having a particular case in view, he leaves the circle in which all nations have agreed to confine his authority; he assumes a more important, and perhaps a more useful influence, than that of the magistrate; but he ceases to represent the judicial power.

				Whenever a law which the judge holds to be unconstitutional is invoked in a tribunal of the United States, he may refuse to admit it as a rule … .  But as soon as a judge has refused to apply any given law in a case, that law immediately loses a portion of its moral force.  Those to whom it is prejudicial learn that means exist of overcoming its authority; and similar suits are multiplied, until it becomes powerless. … The political power which the Americans have entrusted to their courts of justice is therefore immense; but the evils of this power are considerably diminished by the impossibility of attacking the laws except through the courts of justice. …  [W]hen a judge contests a law in an obscure debate on some particular case, the importance of his attack is concealed from public notice; his decision bears upon the interest of an individual, and the law is slighted only incidentally.  Moreover, although it is censured, it is not abolished; its moral force may be diminished, but its authority is not taken away; and its final destruction can be accomplished only by the reiterated attacks of judicial functionaries.  Democracy in America 73, 7576 (R.

				The very foundation of the power of the federal courts to declare Acts of Congress unconstitutional lies in the power and duty of those courts to decide cases and controversies before them. . . .  This Court, as is the case with all federal courts, has no jurisdiction to pronounce any statute, either of a State or of the United States, void, because irreconcilable with the Constitution, except as it is called upon to adjudge the legal rights of litigants in actual controversies.  In the exercise of that jurisdiction, it is bound by two rules, to which it has rigidly adhered, one, never to anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it; the other never to formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied. . . .  Kindred to these rules is the rule that one to whom application of a statute is constitutional will not be heard to attack the statute on the ground that impliedly it might also be taken as applying to other persons or other situations in which its application might be unconstitutional. . . .  The delicate power of pronouncing an Act of Congress unconstitutional is not to be exercised with reference to hypothetical cases thus imagined.

				I am aware, of course, that in some recent facial-challenge cases the Court has, without any attempt at explanation, created entirely irrational exceptions to the unconstitutional in every conceivable application rule, when the statutes at issue concerned hot-button social issues on which informed opinion was zealously united.

				When our normal criteria for facial challenges are applied, it is clear that the Justices in the majority have transposed the burden of proof.  Instead of requiring the respondents, who are challenging the Ordinance, to show that it is invalid in all its applications, they have required the petitioner to show that it is valid in all its applications.  Both the plurality opinion and the concurrences display a lively imagination, creating hypothetical situations in which the laws application would (in their view) be ambiguous.  But that creative role has been usurped from the petitioner, who can defeat the respondents facial challenge by conjuring up 
				<em>
					a single valid application
				</em>
				 of the law.  My contribution would go something like this
				<a name="ZD-5ref" href="#ZD-5" class="">

				: Tony, a member of the Jets criminal street gang, is standing alongside and chatting with fellow gang members while staking out their turf at Promontory Point on the South Side of Chicago; the group is flashing gang signs and displaying their distinctive tattoos to passersby.  Officer Krupke, applying the Ordinance at issue here, orders the group to disperse.  After some speculative discussion (probably irrelevant here) over whether the Jets are depraved because they are deprived, Tony and the other gang members break off further conversation with the statementnot entirely coherent, but evidently intended to be rudeGee, Officer Krupke, krup you.  A tense standoff ensues until Officer Krupke arrests the group for failing to obey his dispersal order.  Even assuming (as the Justices in the majority do, but I do not) that a law requiring obedience to a dispersal order is impermissibly vague unless it is clear to the objects of the order, before its issuance, that their conduct justifies it, I find it hard to believe that the Jets would not have known they had it coming.  That should settle the matter of respondents facial challenge to the Ordinances vagueness.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Of course respondents would still be able to claim that the Ordinance was vague as applied to them.  But the ultimate demonstration of the inappropriateness of the Courts holding of 
				<em>
					facial 
				</em>
				invalidity is the fact that it is doubtful whether some of these respondents could even sustain an 
				<em>
					as-applied 
				</em>
				challenge on the basis of the majoritys own criteria.  For instance, respondent Jose Renteriawho admitted that he was a member of the Satan Disciples gangwas observed by the arresting officer loitering on a street corner with other gang members.  The officer issued a dispersal order, but when she returned to the same corner 15 to 20 minutes later, Renteria was still there with his friends, whereupon he was arrested.  In another example, respondent Daniel Washington and several otherswho admitted they were members of the Vice Lords gangwere observed by the arresting officer loitering in the street, yelling at passing vehicles, stopping traffic, and preventing pedestrians from using the sidewalks.  The arresting officer issued a dispersal order, issued 
				<em>
					another
				</em>
				 dispersal order later when the group did not move, and finally arrested the group when they were found loitering in the same place still later.  Finally, respondent Gregorio Gutierrezwho had previously admitted to the arresting officer his membership in the Latin Kings gangwas observed loitering with two other men.  The officer issued a dispersal order, drove around the block, and arrested the men after finding them in the same place upon his return.  See Brief for Petitioner 7, n. 5; Brief for United States as 
				<em>
					Amicus Curiae
				</em>
				 16, n. 11.  Even on the majoritys assumption that to avoid vagueness it must be clear to the object of the dispersal order 
				<em>
					ex ante
				</em>
				 that his conduct is covered by the Ordinance, it seems most improbable that any of these as-applied challenges would be sustained.  Much less is it possible to say that the Ordinance is invalid in 
				<em>
					all 
				</em>
				its applications.

				The plurality's explanation for its departure from the usual rule governing facial challenges is seemingly contained in the following statement: [This] is a criminal law that contains no 
				<em>
					mens rea
				</em>
				 requirement … 
				<em>
					and
				</em>
				 infringes on constitutionally protected rights … .  When vagueness permeates the text of 
				<em>
					such

				 a law, it is subject to facial attack.  
				<em>
					Ante

				, at 11 (emphasis added).  The proposition is set forth with such assurance that one might suppose that it repeats some well-accepted formula in our jurisprudence: (Criminal law without 
				<em>
					mens rea 
				</em>
				requirement)   (infringement of constitutionally protected right)   (vagueness) = (entitlement to facial invalidation).  There is no such formula; the plurality has made it up for this case, as the absence of any citation demonstrates.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				But no matter.  None of the three factors that the plurality relies upon exists anyway.  I turn first to the support for the proposition that there is a constitutionally protected right to loiteror, as the plurality more favorably describes it, for a person to remain in a public place of his choice.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  The plurality thinks much of this Fundamental Freedom to Loiter, which it contrasts with such lesser, constitutionally 
				<em>
					un
				</em>
				protected, activities as doing (ugh!) 
				<em>
					business
				</em>
				: This is not an ordinance that simply regulates business behavior and contains a scienter requirement. . . . It is a criminal law that contains no 
				<em>
					mens rea
				</em>
				 requirement . . . and infringes on constitutionally protected rights.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				 (internal quotation marks omitted). (Poor Alexander Hamilton, who has seen his commercial republic devolve, in the eyes of the plurality, at least, into an indolent republic, see The Federalist No. 6, p. 56; No. 11, pp. 8491 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961).)
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Of course every activity, even scratching ones head, can be called a constitutional right if one means by that term nothing more than the fact that the activity is covered (as all are) by the Equal Protection Clause, so that those who engage in it cannot be singled out without rational basis.  See

The entire practice of using the Due Process Clause to add judicially favored rights to the limitations upon democracy set forth in the Bill of Rights (usually under the rubric of so-called substantive due process) is in my view judicial usurpation.

				It would be unfair, however, to criticize the pluralitys failed attempt to establish that loitering is a constitutionally protected right while saying nothing of the concurrences.  The plurality at least makes an attempt.  The concurrences, on the other hand, make no pretense at attaching their broad vagueness invalidates rule to a liberty interest.  As far as appears from 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Oconnor
				</span>
				s and 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Breyer
				</span>
				s opinions, 
				<em>
					no
				</em>
				 police officer may issue 
				<em>
					any
				</em>
				 order, affecting 
				<em>
					any
				</em>
				 insignificant sort of citizen conduct (except, perhaps, an order addressed to the unprotected class of gang members) unless the standards for the issuance of that order are precise.  No mod-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				ern urban societyand probably none since London got big enough to have sewerscould function under such a rule.  There are innumerable reasons why it may be im-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				portant for a constable to tell a pedestrian to move onand even if it were possible to list in an ordinance all of the reasons that are known, many are simply unpredictable.  Hence the (entirely reasonable) Rule of the City of New York which reads: No person shall fail, neglect or refuse to comply with the lawful direction or command of any Police Officer, Urban Park Ranger, Parks Enforcement Patrol Officer or other [Parks and Recreation] Department employee, indicated by gesture or otherwise.  56 RCNY §103(c)(1) (1996).  It is one thing to uphold an as applied challenge when a pedestrian disobeys such an order that is unreasonableor even when a pedestrian asserting some true liberty interest (holding a political rally, for instance) disobeys such an order that is reasonable 
				<em>
					but unexplained
				</em>
				.  But to say that such a general ordinance permitting lawful orders is void 
				<em>
					in all its applications
				</em>
				 demands more than a safe and orderly society can reasonably deliver.

        <p class="bodytext">
            <span class="smallcaps">

But his only explanation of why the present interference with the right to loiter does not fall within that permitted scope of action is as follows: The predicate of an order to disperse is not, in my view, sufficient to eliminate doubts regarding the adequacy of notice under this ordinance.

				thinks is constitutionalas is demonstrated by substituting for references to the facts of the present case (shown in italics) references to his rescue-team hypothetical (shown in brackets): A citizen, while engaging in a wide array of innocent conduct, is not likely to know when he may be subject to a

				I turn next to that element of the plurality's facial-challenge formula which consists of the proposition that this criminal ordinance contains no 
				<em>
					mens rea 
				</em>
				requirement.  The first step in analyzing this proposition is to determine what the 
				<em>
					actus reus
				</em>
				, to which that 
				<em>
					mens rea
				</em>
				 is supposed to be attached, consists of.  The majority believes that loitering forms part of (indeed, the essence of) the offense, and must be proved if conviction is to be obtained.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 2, 6, 913, 1415, 1618 (plurality and majority opinions); 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 23, 4 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					OConnor, J.
				</span>
				, concurring in part and concurring in judgment); 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 12 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Kennedy, J
				</span>
				., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 34 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Breyer, J
				</span>
				., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  That is not what the Ordinance provides.  The only part of the Ordinance that refers to loitering is the portion that addresses, not the punishable conduct of the defendant, but what the police officer must observe before he can issue an order to disperse; and what he must observe is carefully defined in terms of what the defendant 
				<em>
					appears
				</em>
				 to be doing, not in terms of what the defendant is 
				<em>
					actually
				</em>
				 doing.  The Ordinance does not require that the defendant have been loitering (
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, have been remaining in one place with no purpose), but rather that the police officer have observed him remaining in one place without any 
				<em>
					apparent
				</em>
				 purpose.  Someone who in fact 
				<em>
					has
				</em>
				 a genuine purpose for remaining where he is (waiting for a friend, for example, or waiting to hold up a bank) 
				<em>
					can
				</em>
				 be ordered to move on (assuming the other conditions of the Ordinance are met), so long as his remaining has no 
				<em>
					apparent
				</em>
				 purpose.  It is likely, to be sure, that the Ordinance will come down most heavily upon those who are 
				<em>
					actually 
				</em>
				loitering (those who 
				<em>
					really
				</em>
				 have no purpose in remaining where they are); but that activity is not a condition for issuance of the dispersal order.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The 
				<em>
					only
				</em>
				 act of a defendant that is made punishable by the Ordinanceor, indeed, that is even mentioned by the Ordinanceis his failure to promptly obey an order to disperse.  The question, then, is whether that 
				<em>
					actus reus
				</em>
				 must be accompanied by any wrongful intentand of course it must.  As the Court itself describes the requirement, a person must 
				<em>
					disobey
				</em>
				 the officers order.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 3 (emphasis added).  No one thinks a defendant could be successfully prosecuted under the Ordinance if he did not hear the order to disperse, or if he suffered a paralysis that rendered his compliance impossible.  The willful failure to obey a police order is wrongful intent enough.

				Finally, I address the last of the three factors in the plurality's facial-challenge formula: the proposition that the Ordinance is vague.  It is not.  Even under the ersatz overbreadth standard applied in

S. 352</a> n. 8 (1983), which allows facial challenges if a law reaches a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct, respondents claim fails because the Ordinance would not be vague in most or even a substantial number of applications.  A law is unconstitutionally vague if its lack of definitive standards either (1) fails to apprise persons of ordinary intelligence of the prohibited conduct, or (2) encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>

				The plurality relies primarily upon the first of these aspects.  Since, it reasons, the loitering is the conduct that the ordinance is designed to prohibit, and an officer may issue an order only after prohibited conduct has already occurred, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 14, 15, the order to disperse cannot itself serve to apprise persons of ordinary intelligence of the prohibited conduct.  What counts for purposes of vagueness analysis, however, is not what the Ordinance is designed to prohibit, but what it actually subjects to criminal penalty.  As discussed earlier, that consists of nothing but the refusal to obey a dispersal order, as to which there is no doubt of adequate notice of the prohibited conduct.  The plurality's suggestion that even the dispersal order 
				<em>
					itself
				</em>
				 is unconstitutionally vague, because it does not specify 
				<em>
					how far to disperse (!)
				</em>
				, see 
				<em>

				</em>
				, at 15, scarcely requires a response.

				  If it were true, it would render unconstitutional for vagueness many of the Presidential proclamations issued under that provision of the United States Code which requires the President, before using the militia or the Armed Forces for law enforcement, to issue a proclamation ordering the insurgents to disperse.

				For its determination of unconstitutional vagueness, the Court relies secondarilyand 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice OConnor
				</span>
				s and 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Breyer
				</span>
				s concurrences exclusivelyupon the second aspect of that doctrine, which requires sufficient specificity to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory law enforcement.  See 
				<em>

				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 3 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Breyer, J
				</span>
				., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  In discussing whether Chicagos Ordinance meets that requirement, the Justices in the majority hide behind an artificial construct of judicial restraint.  They point to the Supreme Court of Illinois statement that the apparent purpose standard provides absolute discretion to police officers to decide what activities constitute loitering, 687 N. E. 2d 53, 63 (1997), and protest that it would be wrong to construe the language of the Ordinance more narrowly than did the States highest court.  
				<em>
					Ante

				, at 17, 19 (majority opinion); 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 45 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					OConnor, J.,
				</span>
				 concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  The absolute discretion statement, however, is nothing more than the Illinois Supreme Courts 
				<em>
					characterization
				</em>
				 of what the language achievedafter that court refused (as I do) to read in any limitations that the words do not fairly contain.  It is not a construction of the language (to which we are bound) but a legal conclusion (to which we most assuredly are not bound).

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The criteria for issuance of a dispersal order under the Chicago Ordinance could hardly be clearer.  First, the law requires police officers to reasonably believ[e] that one of the group to which the order is issued is a criminal street gang member.  This resembles a probable-cause standard, and the Chicago Police Departments General Order 924 (1992)promulgated to govern enforcement of the Ordinancemakes the probable cause requirement explicit.
				<a name="ZD-10ref" href="#ZD-10" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>
					10
				</b>
                </sup>
            </a>
				  Under the Order, officers must have probable cause to believe that an individual is a member of a criminal street gang, to be substantiated by the officers experience and knowledge of the alleged offenders and by specific, documented and reliable information such as reliable witness testimony or an individuals admission of gang membership or display of distinctive colors, tattoos, signs, or other markings worn by members of particular criminal street gangs.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 67a69a, 71a72a.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, the Ordinance requires that the group be remain[ing] in one place with no apparent purpose.  
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice OConnor
				</span>
				s assertion that this applies to any person standing in a public place, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 2, is a distortion.  The Ordinance does not apply to standing, but to remain[ing]a term which in this context obviously means [to] endure or persist, see American Heritage Dictionary 1525 (1992).  There may be some ambiguity at the margin, but remain[ing] in one place requires more than a temporary stop, and is clear in most of its applications, including all of those represented by the facts surrounding the respondents arrests described 
				<em>
					supra, 
				</em>
				at 12.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				As for the phrase with no apparent purpose: 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice OConnor
				</span>
				 again distorts this adjectival phrase, by separating it from the word that it modifies.  [A]ny person standing on the street, her concurrence says, has a general purposeeven if it is simply to stand, and thus the ordinance permits police officers to choose which purposes are 
				<em>
					permissible
				</em>
				.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 2.  But Chicago police officers enforcing the Ordinance are not looking for people with no apparent purpose (who are regrettably in oversupply); they are looking for people who remain in any one place with no apparent purposethat is, who remain there without any apparent reason 
				<em>
					for remaining there
				</em>
				.  That is not difficult to perceive.

				The Courts attempt to demonstrate the vagueness of the Ordinance produces the following peculiar statement: The no apparent purpose standard for making [the decision to issue an order to disperse] is inherently subjective because its application depends on whether some purpose is apparent to the officer on the scene.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 18.  In the Courts view, a persons lack of any purpose in staying in one location is presumably an 
				<em>
					objective
				</em>
				 factor, and what the Ordinance requires as a condition of an order to dispersethe absence of any 
				<em>
					apparent
				</em>
				 purposeis a 
				<em>
					subjective
				</em>
				 factor.  This side of the looking glass, just the opposite is true.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Elsewhere, of course, the Court acknowledges the clear, objective commands of the Ordinance, and indeed relies upon them to paint it as unfair:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				By its very terms, the ordinance encompasses a great deal of harmless behavior.  In any public place in the city of Chicago, persons who stand or sit in the company of a gang member may be ordered to disperse unless their purpose is apparent.  The mandatory language in the enactment directs the police to issue an order without first making any inquiry about their possible purposes.  It matters not whether the reason that a gang member and his father, for example, might loiter near Wrigley Field is to rob an unsuspecting fan or just to get a glimpse of Sammy Sosa leaving the ballpark; in either event, if their purpose is not apparent to a nearby police officer, she mayindeed, she shallorder them to disperse.

Quite so.  And the fact that this clear instruction to the officers encompasses a great deal of harmless behavior would be invalidating if that harmless behavior were constitutionally protected against abridgment, such as speech or the practice of religion.  Remaining in one place is 
				<em>

				The Court also assertsin apparent contradiction to the passage just quotedthat the apparent purpose test is too elastic because it presumably allows police officers to treat

The problem, of course, well recognized by Chicagos City Council, is that the gang members cease their intimidating and unlawful behavior under the watchful eye of police officers, but return to it as soon as the police drive away.  The only solution, the council concluded, was to clear the streets of congregations of gangs, their drug customers, and their associates.

And if remain[ing] in one place with no apparent purpose is so vague as to give the police unbridled discretion in controlling the conduct of non-gang-members, it surpasses understanding how it ceases to be so vague when applied to gang members

				The fact is that the present ordinance is entirely clear in its application, cannot be violated except with full knowledge and intent, and vests no more discretion in the police than innumerable other measures authorizing police orders to preserve the public peace and safety.  As suggested by their tortured analyses, and by their suggested solutions that bear no relation to the identified constitutional problem, the majoritys real quarrel with the Chicago Ordinance is simply that it permits (or indeed requires) too much harmless conduct by innocent citizens to be proscribed.  As 
				<span class="smallcaps">

				s concurrence says with disapprobation, the ordinance applies to hundreds of thousands of persons who are

				But in our democratic system, how much harmless conduct to proscribe is not a judgment to be made by the courts.  So long as constitutionally guaranteed rights are not affected, and so long as the proscription has a rational basis, 
				<em>
					all sorts
				</em>
				 of perfectly harmless activity by millions of perfectly innocent people can be forbiddenriding a motorcycle without a safety helmet, for example, starting a campfire in a national forest, or selling a safe and effective drug not yet approved by the FDA.  All of these acts are entirely innocent and harmless in themselves, but because of the 
				<em>
					risk
				</em>
				 of harm that they entail, the freedom to engage in them has been abridged.  The citizens of Chicago have decided that depriving themselves of the freedom to hang out with a gang member is necessary to eliminate pervasive gang crime and intimidationand that the elimination of the one is worth the deprivation of the other.  This Court has no business second-guessing either the degree of necessity or the fairness of the trade.

						 In other words, a facial attack, since it requires unconstitutionality in all circumstances, necessarily presumes that the litigant presently before the court would be able to sustain an as-applied challenge.  See Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/455/489" class="subref" title="subref">455 U. S. 489</a>,

 (A plaintiff who engages in some conduct that is clearly proscribed cannot complain of the vagueness of the law as applied tothe conduct of others.  A court should therefore examine the complainants conduct before analyzing other hypothetical applications of the law); Parker v. Levy, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/417/733" class="subref" title="subref">417 U. S. 733</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">756</a> (1974)
 (One to whose con-duct a statute clearly applies may not successfully challenge it for vagueness).  


The plurality asserts that in United States v. Salerno, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/481/739" class="subref" title="subref">481 U. S. 739</a> (1987)
, which I discuss in text immediately following this footnote, the Court entertained a facial challenge even though the defendants . . . did not claim that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to them.  Ante, at 11, n. 22.  That is not so.  The Court made it absolutely clear in Salerno that a facial challenge requires the assertion that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid, 481 U. S., at 745 (emphasis added).  The footnoted statement upon which the plurality relies (Nor have respondents claimed that the Act is unconstitutional because of the way it was applied to the particular facts of their case, id., at 745, n. 3) was obviously meant to convey the fact that the defendants were not making, in addition to their facial challenge, an alternative as-applied challengei.e., asserting that even if the statute was not unconstitutional in all its applications it was at least unconstitutional in its particular application to them.

						 Salerno, a criminal case, repudiated the Courts statement in Kolender v. Lawson, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/461/352" class="subref" title="subref">461 U. S. 352</a>, n. 8 (1983), to the effect that a facial challenge to a criminal statute could succeed even when [the statute] could conceivably have had some valid application.  Kolender seems to have confused the standard for 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> overbreadth challenges with the standard governing facial challenges on all other grounds.  See ibid. (citing the Courts articulation of the standard for 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> overbreadth challenges from Hoffman Estates, supra, at 494).  As Salerno noted, 481 U. S., at 745, the overbreadth doctrine is a specialized exception to the general rule for facial challenges, justified in light of the risk that an overbroad statute will chill free expression.  See, e.g., Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/413/601" class="subref" title="subref">413 U. S. 601</a>,

						 The plurality asserts that the Salerno standard for facial challenge has never been the decisive factor in any decision of this Court.  It means by that only this: in rejecting a facial challenge, the Court has never contented itself with identifying only one situation in which the challenged statute would be constitutional, but has mentioned several.  But that is not at all remarkable, and casts no doubt upon the validity of the principle that Salerno and these many other cases enunciated.  It is difficult to conceive of a statute that would be constitutional in only a single applicationand hard to resist mentioning more than one.


The plurality contends that it does not matter whether the Salerno standard is federal law, since facial challenge is a species of third-party standing, and federal limitations upon third-party standing do not apply in an appeal from a state decision which takes a broader view, as the Illinois Supreme Courts opinion did here.  Ante, at 11, n. 22.  This is quite wrong.  Disagreement over the Salerno rule is not a disagreement over the standing question of whether the person challenging the statute can raise the rights of third parties: under both Salerno and the plurality's rule he can.  The disagreement relates to how many third-party rights he must prove to be infringed by the statute before he can win: Salerno says all (in addition to his own rights), the plurality says many.  That is not a question of standing but of substantive law.  The notion that, if Salerno is the federal rule (a federal statute is not totally invalid unless it is invalid in all its applications), it can be altered by a state court (a federal statute is totally invalid if it is invalid in many of its applications), and that that alteration must be accepted by the Supreme Court of the United States is, to put it as gently as possible, remarkable.

						 The pluralitys explanation for ignoring these laws is that many of them carried severe penalties and, during the Reconstruction era, they had harsh consequences on African-American women and children.  Ante, at 910, n. 20.  Those severe penalties and those harsh consequences are certainly regrettable, but they in no way lessen (indeed, the harshness of penalty tends to increase) the capacity of these laws to prove that loitering was never regarded as a fundamental liberty.

						 Ante, at 9, n. 19.  The plurality bases its assertion of apparent concession upon a footnote in Part I of petitioners brief which reads: Of course, laws regulating social gatherings affect a liberty interest, and thus are subject to review under the rubric of substantive due process . . . . We address that doctrine in Part II below.  Brief for Petitioner 2122, n. 14.  If a careless reader were inclined to confuse the term social gatherings in this passage with loitering, his confusion would be eliminated by pursuing the reference to Part II of the brief, which says, in its introductory paragraph: [A]s we explain below, substantive due process does not support the courts novel holding that the Constitution secures the right to stand still on the public way even when one is not engaged in speech, assembly, or other conduct that enjoys affirmative constitutional protection.  Id., at 39.

						 The plurality says, ante, at 20, n. 35, that since it decides the case on the basis of procedural due process rather than substantive due process, I am mistaken in analyzing its opinion under the framework for substantive due process set out in Washington v. Glucksberg.  Ibid.  But I am not analyzing it under that framework.  I am simply assuming that when the plurality says (as an essential part of its reasoning) that the right to loiter for innocent purposes is . . . a part of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause it does not believe that the same word (liberty) means one thing for purposes of substantive due process and something else for purposes of procedural due process.  There is no authority for that startling proposition.  See Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/408/564" class="subref" title="subref">408 U. S. 564</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">572</a>575 (1972)
 (rejecting procedural-due-process claim for lack of liberty interest, and citing substantive-due-process cases).


The pluralitys opinion seeks to have it both ways, invoking the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>s august protection of liberty in defining the standard of certainty that it sets, but then, in identifying the conduct protected by that high standard, ignoring our extensive case-law defining liberty, and substituting, instead, all harmless and innocent conduct, ante, at 14.

						 I call it a suggestion because the plurality says only that the terms of the dispersal order compound the inadequacy of the notice, and acknowledges that they might not render the ordinance unconstitutionally vague if the definition of the forbidden conduct were clear.  Ante, at 15, 16.  This notion that a prescription (Disperse!) which is itself not unconstitutionally vague can somehow contribute to the unconstitutional vagueness of the entire scheme is full of mysterysuspending, as it does, the metaphysical principle that nothing can confer what it does not possess (nemo dat qui non habet).

						 Justice Breyer asserts that one always has some apparent purpose, so that the policeman must interpret the words no apparent purpose as meaning no apparent purpose except for . . . .  Ante, at 12.  It is simply not true that one always has some apparent purposeand especially not true that one always has some apparent purpose in remaining at rest, for the simple reason that one often (indeed, perhaps usually) has no actual purpose in remaining at rest.  Remaining at rest will be a persons normal state, unless he has a purpose which causes him to move.  That is why one frequently reads of a persons wandering aimlessly (which is worthy of note) but not of a persons sitting aimlessly (which is not remarkable at all).  And that is why a synonym for purpose is motive: that which causes one to move.

						 The Court also speculates that a police officer may exercise his discretion to enforce the Ordinance and direct dispersal when (in the Courts view) the Ordinance is inapplicableviz., where there is an apparent purpose, but it is an unlawful one.  See ante, at 18.  No one in his right mind would read the phrase without any apparent purpose to mean anything other than without any apparent lawful purpose.  The implication that acts referred to approvingly in statutory language are lawful acts is routine.  The Court asserts that the Illinois Supreme Court has forced it into this interpretive inanity because, since it has not placed any limiting construction on the language in the ordinance, we must assume that the ordinance means what it says . . . .  Ante, at 19.  But the Illinois Supreme Court did not mention this particular interpretive issue, which has nothing to do with giving the Ordinance a limiting interpretation, and everything to do with giving it its ordinary legal meaning.

				The citizens of Chicago were once free to drive about the city at whatever speed they wished.  At some point Chicagoans (or perhaps Illinoisans) decided this would not do, and imposed prophylactic speed limits designed to assure safe operation by the average (or perhaps even subaverage) driver with the average (or perhaps even subaverage) vehicle.  This infringed upon the freedom of all citizens, but was not unconstitutional.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Similarly, the citizens of Chicago were once free to stand around and gawk at the scene of an accident.  At some point Chicagoans discovered that this obstructed traffic and caused more accidents.  They did not make the practice unlawful, but they did authorize police officers to order the crowd to disperse, and imposed penalties for refusal to obey such an order.  Again, this prophylactic measure infringed upon the freedom of all citizens, but was not unconstitutional.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Until the ordinance that is before us today was adopted, the citizens of Chicago were free to stand about in public places with no apparent purposeto engage, that is, in conduct that appeared to be loitering.  In recent years, however, the city has been afflicted with criminal street gangs.  As reflected in the record before us, these gangs congregated in public places to deal in drugs, and to terrorize the neighborhoods by demonstrating control over their turf.  Many residents of the inner city felt that they were prisoners in their own homes.  Once again, Chicagoans decided that to eliminate the problem it was worth restricting some of the freedom that they once enjoyed.  The means they took was similar to the second, and more mild, example given above rather than the first: Loitering was not made unlawful, but when a group of people occupied a public place without an apparent purpose and in the company of a known gang member, police officers were authorized to order them to disperse, and the failure to obey such an order was made unlawful.  See Chicago Municipal Code §84015 (1992).  The minor limitation upon the free state of nature that this prophylactic arrangement imposed upon all Chicagoans seemed to them (and it seems to me) a small price to pay for liberation of their streets.

				The majority today invalidates this perfectly reasonable measure by ignoring our rules governing facial challenges, by elevating loitering to a constitutionally guaranteed right, and by discerning vagueness where, according to our usual standards, none exists.

				The very foundation of the power of the federal courts to declare Acts of Congress unconstitutional lies in the power and duty of those courts to decide cases and controversies before them. . . .  This Court, as is the case with all federal courts, has no jurisdiction to pronounce any statute, either of a State or of the United States, void, because irreconcilable with the Constitution, except as it is called upon to adjudge the legal rights of litigants in actual controversies.  In the exercise of that jurisdiction, it is bound by two rules, to which it has rigidly adhered, one, never to anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it; the other never to formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied. . . .  Kindred to these rules is the rule that one to whom application of a statute is constitutional will not be heard to attack the statute on the ground that impliedly it might also be taken as applying to other persons or other situations in which its application might be unconstitutional. . . .  The delicate power of pronouncing an Act of Congress unconstitutional is not to be exercised with reference to hypothetical cases thus imagined.

				I am aware, of course, that in some recent facial-challenge cases the Court has, without any attempt at explanation, created entirely irrational exceptions to the unconstitutional in every conceivable application rule, when the statutes at issue concerned hot-button social issues on which informed opinion was zealously united.

				When our normal criteria for facial challenges are applied, it is clear that the Justices in the majority have transposed the burden of proof.  Instead of requiring the respondents, who are challenging the Ordinance, to show that it is invalid in all its applications, they have required the petitioner to show that it is valid in all its applications.  Both the plurality opinion and the concurrences display a lively imagination, creating hypothetical situations in which the laws application would (in their view) be ambiguous.  But that creative role has been usurped from the petitioner, who can defeat the respondents facial challenge by conjuring up 
				<em>
					a single valid application
				</em>
				 of the law.  My contribution would go something like this
				<a name="ZD-5ref" href="#ZD-5" class="">
                <sup>

				: Tony, a member of the Jets criminal street gang, is standing alongside and chatting with fellow gang members while staking out their turf at Promontory Point on the South Side of Chicago; the group is flashing gang signs and displaying their distinctive tattoos to passersby.  Officer Krupke, applying the Ordinance at issue here, orders the group to disperse.  After some speculative discussion (probably irrelevant here) over whether the Jets are depraved because they are deprived, Tony and the other gang members break off further conversation with the statementnot entirely coherent, but evidently intended to be rudeGee, Officer Krupke, krup you.  A tense standoff ensues until Officer Krupke arrests the group for failing to obey his dispersal order.  Even assuming (as the Justices in the majority do, but I do not) that a law requiring obedience to a dispersal order is impermissibly vague unless it is clear to the objects of the order, before its issuance, that their conduct justifies it, I find it hard to believe that the Jets would not have known they had it coming.  That should settle the matter of respondents facial challenge to the Ordinances vagueness.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Of course respondents would still be able to claim that the Ordinance was vague as applied to them.  But the ultimate demonstration of the inappropriateness of the Courts holding of 
				<em>
					facial 
				</em>
				invalidity is the fact that it is doubtful whether some of these respondents could even sustain an 
				<em>
					as-applied 
				</em>
				challenge on the basis of the majoritys own criteria.  For instance, respondent Jose Renteriawho admitted that he was a member of the Satan Disciples gangwas observed by the arresting officer loitering on a street corner with other gang members.  The officer issued a dispersal order, but when she returned to the same corner 15 to 20 minutes later, Renteria was still there with his friends, whereupon he was arrested.  In another example, respondent Daniel Washington and several otherswho admitted they were members of the Vice Lords gangwere observed by the arresting officer loitering in the street, yelling at passing vehicles, stopping traffic, and preventing pedestrians from using the sidewalks.  The arresting officer issued a dispersal order, issued 
				<em>
					another
				</em>
				 dispersal order later when the group did not move, and finally arrested the group when they were found loitering in the same place still later.  Finally, respondent Gregorio Gutierrezwho had previously admitted to the arresting officer his membership in the Latin Kings gangwas observed loitering with two other men.  The officer issued a dispersal order, drove around the block, and arrested the men after finding them in the same place upon his return.  See Brief for Petitioner 7, n. 5; Brief for United States as 
				<em>
					Amicus Curiae
				</em>
				 16, n. 11.  Even on the majoritys assumption that to avoid vagueness it must be clear to the object of the dispersal order 
				<em>
					ex ante
				</em>
				 that his conduct is covered by the Ordinance, it seems most improbable that any of these as-applied challenges would be sustained.  Much less is it possible to say that the Ordinance is invalid in 
				<em>
					all 
				</em>
				its applications.

				The plurality's explanation for its departure from the usual rule governing facial challenges is seemingly contained in the following statement: [This] is a criminal law that contains no 
				<em>
					mens rea
				</em>
				 requirement … 
				<em>
					and
				</em>
				 infringes on constitutionally protected rights … .  When vagueness permeates the text of 
				<em>
					such

				 a law, it is subject to facial attack.  
				<em>
					Ante

				, at 11 (emphasis added).  The proposition is set forth with such assurance that one might suppose that it repeats some well-accepted formula in our jurisprudence: (Criminal law without 
				<em>
					mens rea 
				</em>
				requirement)   (infringement of constitutionally protected right)   (vagueness) = (entitlement to facial invalidation).  There is no such formula; the plurality has made it up for this case, as the absence of any citation demonstrates.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				But no matter.  None of the three factors that the plurality relies upon exists anyway.  I turn first to the support for the proposition that there is a constitutionally protected right to loiteror, as the plurality more favorably describes it, for a person to remain in a public place of his choice.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  The plurality thinks much of this Fundamental Freedom to Loiter, which it contrasts with such lesser, constitutionally 
				<em>
					un
				</em>
				protected, activities as doing (ugh!) 
				<em>
					business
				</em>
				: This is not an ordinance that simply regulates business behavior and contains a scienter requirement. . . . It is a criminal law that contains no 
				<em>
					mens rea
				</em>
				 requirement . . . and infringes on constitutionally protected rights.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				 (internal quotation marks omitted). (Poor Alexander Hamilton, who has seen his commercial republic devolve, in the eyes of the plurality, at least, into an indolent republic, see The Federalist No. 6, p. 56; No. 11, pp. 8491 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961).)
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Of course every activity, even scratching ones head, can be called a constitutional right if one means by that term nothing more than the fact that the activity is covered (as all are) by the Equal Protection Clause, so that those who engage in it cannot be singled out without rational basis.  See

The entire practice of using the Due Process Clause to add judicially favored rights to the limitations upon democracy set forth in the Bill of Rights (usually under the rubric of so-called substantive due process) is in my view judicial usurpation.

				It would be unfair, however, to criticize the pluralitys failed attempt to establish that loitering is a constitutionally protected right while saying nothing of the concurrences.  The plurality at least makes an attempt.  The concurrences, on the other hand, make no pretense at attaching their broad vagueness invalidates rule to a liberty interest.  As far as appears from 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Oconnor

				s and 
				<span class="smallcaps">

				<em>

				 police officer may issue 
				<em>
					any
				</em>
				 order, affecting 
				<em>
					any
				</em>
				 insignificant sort of citizen conduct (except, perhaps, an order addressed to the unprotected class of gang members) unless the standards for the issuance of that order are precise.  No mod-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				ern urban societyand probably none since London got big enough to have sewerscould function under such a rule.  There are innumerable reasons why it may be im-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				portant for a constable to tell a pedestrian to move onand even if it were possible to list in an ordinance all of the reasons that are known, many are simply unpredictable.  Hence the (entirely reasonable) Rule of the City of New York which reads: No person shall fail, neglect or refuse to comply with the lawful direction or command of any Police Officer, Urban Park Ranger, Parks Enforcement Patrol Officer or other [Parks and Recreation] Department employee, indicated by gesture or otherwise.  56 RCNY §103(c)(1) (1996).  It is one thing to uphold an as applied challenge when a pedestrian disobeys such an order that is unreasonableor even when a pedestrian asserting some true liberty interest (holding a political rally, for instance) disobeys such an order that is reasonable 
				<em>
					but unexplained

				I turn next to that element of the plurality's facial-challenge formula which consists of the proposition that this criminal ordinance contains no 
				<em>
					mens rea 
				</em>
				requirement.  The first step in analyzing this proposition is to determine what the 
				<em>
					actus reus
				</em>
				, to which that 
				<em>
					mens rea
				</em>
				 is supposed to be attached, consists of.  The majority believes that loitering forms part of (indeed, the essence of) the offense, and must be proved if conviction is to be obtained.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 2, 6, 913, 1415, 1618 (plurality and majority opinions); 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 23, 4 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					OConnor, J.
				</span>
				, concurring in part and concurring in judgment); 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 12 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Kennedy, J
				</span>
				., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 34 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Breyer, J
				</span>
				., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  That is not what the Ordinance provides.  The only part of the Ordinance that refers to loitering is the portion that addresses, not the punishable conduct of the defendant, but what the police officer must observe before he can issue an order to disperse; and what he must observe is carefully defined in terms of what the defendant 
				<em>
					appears
				</em>
				 to be doing, not in terms of what the defendant is 
				<em>
					actually
				</em>
				 doing.  The Ordinance does not require that the defendant have been loitering (
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, have been remaining in one place with no purpose), but rather that the police officer have observed him remaining in one place without any 
				<em>
					apparent
				</em>
				 purpose.  Someone who in fact 
				<em>
					has
				</em>
				 a genuine purpose for remaining where he is (waiting for a friend, for example, or waiting to hold up a bank) 
				<em>
					can
				</em>
				 be ordered to move on (assuming the other conditions of the Ordinance are met), so long as his remaining has no 
				<em>
					apparent
				</em>
				 purpose.  It is likely, to be sure, that the Ordinance will come down most heavily upon those who are 
				<em>
					actually 
				</em>
				loitering (those who 
				<em>
					really
				</em>
				 have no purpose in remaining where they are); but that activity is not a condition for issuance of the dispersal order.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The 
				<em>
					only
				</em>
				 act of a defendant that is made punishable by the Ordinanceor, indeed, that is even mentioned by the Ordinanceis his failure to promptly obey an order to disperse.  The question, then, is whether that 
				<em>
					actus reus
				</em>
				 must be accompanied by any wrongful intentand of course it must.  As the Court itself describes the requirement, a person must 
				<em>
					disobey
				</em>
				 the officers order.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 3 (emphasis added).  No one thinks a defendant could be successfully prosecuted under the Ordinance if he did not hear the order to disperse, or if he suffered a paralysis that rendered his compliance impossible.  The willful failure to obey a police order is wrongful intent enough.

S. 352</a> n. 8 (1983), which allows facial challenges if a law reaches a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct, respondents claim fails because the Ordinance would not be vague in most or even a substantial number of applications.  A law is unconstitutionally vague if its lack of definitive standards either (1) fails to apprise persons of ordinary intelligence of the prohibited conduct, or (2) encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,

				The plurality relies primarily upon the first of these aspects.  Since, it reasons, the loitering is the conduct that the ordinance is designed to prohibit, and an officer may issue an order only after prohibited conduct has already occurred, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 14, 15, the order to disperse cannot itself serve to apprise persons of ordinary intelligence of the prohibited conduct.  What counts for purposes of vagueness analysis, however, is not what the Ordinance is designed to prohibit, but what it actually subjects to criminal penalty.  As discussed earlier, that consists of nothing but the refusal to obey a dispersal order, as to which there is no doubt of adequate notice of the prohibited conduct.  The plurality's suggestion that even the dispersal order 
				<em>
					itself
				</em>
				 is unconstitutionally vague, because it does not specify 
				<em>
					how far to disperse (!)
				</em>
				, see 
				<em>

				, at 15, scarcely requires a response.

				  If it were true, it would render unconstitutional for vagueness many of the Presidential proclamations issued under that provision of the United States Code which requires the President, before using the militia or the Armed Forces for law enforcement, to issue a proclamation ordering the insurgents to disperse.

				For its determination of unconstitutional vagueness, the Court relies secondarilyand 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice OConnor
				</span>
				s and 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Breyer
				</span>
				s concurrences exclusivelyupon the second aspect of that doctrine, which requires sufficient specificity to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory law enforcement.  See

				</em>
				, at 3 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Breyer, J
				</span>
				., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  In discussing whether Chicagos Ordinance meets that requirement, the Justices in the majority hide behind an artificial construct of judicial restraint.  They point to the Supreme Court of Illinois statement that the apparent purpose standard provides absolute discretion to police officers to decide what activities constitute loitering, 687 N. E. 2d 53, 63 (1997), and protest that it would be wrong to construe the language of the Ordinance more narrowly than did the States highest court.  
				<em>

				<em>
					ante

				, at 45 (
				<span class="smallcaps">

				 concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  The absolute discretion statement, however, is nothing more than the Illinois Supreme Courts 
				<em>
					characterization
				</em>
				 of what the language achievedafter that court refused (as I do) to read in any limitations that the words do not fairly contain.  It is not a construction of the language (to which we are bound) but a legal conclusion (to which we most assuredly are not bound).

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The criteria for issuance of a dispersal order under the Chicago Ordinance could hardly be clearer.  First, the law requires police officers to reasonably believ[e] that one of the group to which the order is issued is a criminal street gang member.  This resembles a probable-cause standard, and the Chicago Police Departments General Order 924 (1992)promulgated to govern enforcement of the Ordinancemakes the probable cause requirement explicit.

                </sup>
            </a>
				  Under the Order, officers must have probable cause to believe that an individual is a member of a criminal street gang, to be substantiated by the officers experience and knowledge of the alleged offenders and by specific, documented and reliable information such as reliable witness testimony or an individuals admission of gang membership or display of distinctive colors, tattoos, signs, or other markings worn by members of particular criminal street gangs.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 67a69a, 71a72a.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, the Ordinance requires that the group be remain[ing] in one place with no apparent purpose.  
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice OConnor
				</span>
				s assertion that this applies to any person standing in a public place, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 2, is a distortion.  The Ordinance does not apply to standing, but to remain[ing]a term which in this context obviously means [to] endure or persist, see American Heritage Dictionary 1525 (1992).  There may be some ambiguity at the margin, but remain[ing] in one place requires more than a temporary stop, and is clear in most of its applications, including all of those represented by the facts surrounding the respondents arrests described 
				<em>
					supra, 
				</em>
				at 12.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				As for the phrase with no apparent purpose: 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice OConnor
				</span>
				 again distorts this adjectival phrase, by separating it from the word that it modifies.  [A]ny person standing on the street, her concurrence says, has a general purposeeven if it is simply to stand, and thus the ordinance permits police officers to choose which purposes are 
				<em>
					permissible
				</em>
				.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 2.  But Chicago police officers enforcing the Ordinance are not looking for people with no apparent purpose (who are regrettably in oversupply); they are looking for people who remain in any one place with no apparent purposethat is, who remain there without any apparent reason 
				<em>
					for remaining there
				</em>
				.  That is not difficult to perceive.

				The Courts attempt to demonstrate the vagueness of the Ordinance produces the following peculiar statement: The no apparent purpose standard for making [the decision to issue an order to disperse] is inherently subjective because its application depends on whether some purpose is apparent to the officer on the scene.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 18.  In the Courts view, a persons lack of any purpose in staying in one location is presumably an 
				<em>
					objective
				</em>
				 factor, and what the Ordinance requires as a condition of an order to dispersethe absence of any 
				<em>
					apparent
				</em>
				 purposeis a 
				<em>
					subjective
				</em>
				 factor.  This side of the looking glass, just the opposite is true.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Elsewhere, of course, the Court acknowledges the clear, objective commands of the Ordinance, and indeed relies upon them to paint it as unfair:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				By its very terms, the ordinance encompasses a great deal of harmless behavior.  In any public place in the city of Chicago, persons who stand or sit in the company of a gang member may be ordered to disperse unless their purpose is apparent.  The mandatory language in the enactment directs the police to issue an order without first making any inquiry about their possible purposes.  It matters not whether the reason that a gang member and his father, for example, might loiter near Wrigley Field is to rob an unsuspecting fan or just to get a glimpse of Sammy Sosa leaving the ballpark; in either event, if their purpose is not apparent to a nearby police officer, she mayindeed, she shallorder them to disperse.

Quite so.  And the fact that this clear instruction to the officers encompasses a great deal of harmless behavior would be invalidating if that harmless behavior were constitutionally protected against abridgment, such as speech or the practice of religion.  Remaining in one place is 
				<em>

				The Court also assertsin apparent contradiction to the passage just quotedthat the apparent purpose test is too elastic because it presumably allows police officers to treat

				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1819).  But the Ordinance already specifies to whom the order can be issued: persons remaining in one place with no apparent purpose in the company of a gang member.  And if remain[ing] in one place with no apparent purpose is so vague as to give the police unbridled discretion in controlling the conduct of non-gang-members, it surpasses understanding how it ceases to be so vague when applied to gang members 
				<em>
					alone

				The fact is that the present ordinance is entirely clear in its application, cannot be violated except with full knowledge and intent, and vests no more discretion in the police than innumerable other measures authorizing police orders to preserve the public peace and safety.  As suggested by their tortured analyses, and by their suggested solutions that bear no relation to the identified constitutional problem, the majoritys real quarrel with the Chicago Ordinance is simply that it permits (or indeed requires) too much harmless conduct by innocent citizens to be proscribed.  As 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice OConnor
				</span>
				s concurrence says with disapprobation, the ordinance applies to hundreds of thousands of persons who are 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 gang members, standing on any sidewalk or in any park, coffee shop, bar, or other location open to the public.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 23 (internal quotation marks omitted).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				But in our democratic system, how much harmless conduct to proscribe is not a judgment to be made by the courts.  So long as constitutionally guaranteed rights are not affected, and so long as the proscription has a rational basis, 
				<em>
					all sorts
				</em>
				 of perfectly harmless activity by millions of perfectly innocent people can be forbiddenriding a motorcycle without a safety helmet, for example, starting a campfire in a national forest, or selling a safe and effective drug not yet approved by the FDA.  All of these acts are entirely innocent and harmless in themselves, but because of the 
				<em>
					risk
				</em>
				 of harm that they entail, the freedom to engage in them has been abridged.  The citizens of Chicago have decided that depriving themselves of the freedom to hang out with a gang member is necessary to eliminate pervasive gang crime and intimidationand that the elimination of the one is worth the deprivation of the other.  This Court has no business second-guessing either the degree of necessity or the fairness of the trade.

						 In other words, a facial attack, since it requires unconstitutionality in all circumstances, necessarily presumes that the litigant presently before the court would be able to sustain an as-applied challenge.  See Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/455/489" class="subref" title="subref">455 U. S. 489</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">495</a> (1982)
 (A plaintiff who engages in some conduct that is clearly proscribed cannot complain of the vagueness of the law as applied tothe conduct of others.  A court should therefore examine the complainants conduct before analyzing other hypothetical applications of the law); Parker v. Levy, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/417/733" class="subref" title="subref">417 U. S. 733</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">756</a> (1974)
 (One to whose con-duct a statute clearly applies may not successfully challenge it for vagueness).  


The plurality asserts that in United States v. Salerno, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/481/739" class="subref" title="subref">481 U. S. 739</a> (1987)
, which I discuss in text immediately following this footnote, the Court entertained a facial challenge even though the defendants . . . did not claim that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to them.  Ante, at 11, n. 22.  That is not so.  The Court made it absolutely clear in Salerno that a facial challenge requires the assertion that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid, 481 U. S., at 745 (emphasis added).  The footnoted statement upon which the plurality relies (Nor have respondents claimed that the Act is unconstitutional because of the way it was applied to the particular facts of their case, id., at 745, n. 3) was obviously meant to convey the fact that the defendants were not making, in addition to their facial challenge, an alternative as-applied challengei.e., asserting that even if the statute was not unconstitutional in all its applications it was at least unconstitutional in its particular application to them.

						 Salerno, a criminal case, repudiated the Courts statement in Kolender v. Lawson, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/461/352" class="subref" title="subref">461 U. S. 352</a>, n. 8 (1983), to the effect that a facial challenge to a criminal statute could succeed even when [the statute] could conceivably have had some valid application.  Kolender seems to have confused the standard for 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> overbreadth challenges with the standard governing facial challenges on all other grounds.  See ibid. (citing the Courts articulation of the standard for 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> overbreadth challenges from Hoffman Estates, supra, at 494).  As Salerno noted, 481 U. S., at 745, the overbreadth doctrine is a specialized exception to the general rule for facial challenges, justified in light of the risk that an overbroad statute will chill free expression.  See, e.g., Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/413/601" class="subref" title="subref">413 U. S. 601</a>,

						 The plurality asserts that the Salerno standard for facial challenge has never been the decisive factor in any decision of this Court.  It means by that only this: in rejecting a facial challenge, the Court has never contented itself with identifying only one situation in which the challenged statute would be constitutional, but has mentioned several.  But that is not at all remarkable, and casts no doubt upon the validity of the principle that Salerno and these many other cases enunciated.  It is difficult to conceive of a statute that would be constitutional in only a single applicationand hard to resist mentioning more than one.


The plurality contends that it does not matter whether the Salerno standard is federal law, since facial challenge is a species of third-party standing, and federal limitations upon third-party standing do not apply in an appeal from a state decision which takes a broader view, as the Illinois Supreme Courts opinion did here.  Ante, at 11, n. 22.  This is quite wrong.  Disagreement over the Salerno rule is not a disagreement over the standing question of whether the person challenging the statute can raise the rights of third parties: under both Salerno and the plurality's rule he can.  The disagreement relates to how many third-party rights he must prove to be infringed by the statute before he can win: Salerno says all (in addition to his own rights), the plurality says many.  That is not a question of standing but of substantive law.  The notion that, if Salerno is the federal rule (a federal statute is not totally invalid unless it is invalid in all its applications), it can be altered by a state court (a federal statute is totally invalid if it is invalid in many of its applications), and that that alteration must be accepted by the Supreme Court of the United States is, to put it as gently as possible, remarkable.

						 The pluralitys explanation for ignoring these laws is that many of them carried severe penalties and, during the Reconstruction era, they had harsh consequences on African-American women and children.  Ante, at 910, n. 20.  Those severe penalties and those harsh consequences are certainly regrettable, but they in no way lessen (indeed, the harshness of penalty tends to increase) the capacity of these laws to prove that loitering was never regarded as a fundamental liberty.

						 Ante, at 9, n. 19.  The plurality bases its assertion of apparent concession upon a footnote in Part I of petitioners brief which reads: Of course, laws regulating social gatherings affect a liberty interest, and thus are subject to review under the rubric of substantive due process . . . . We address that doctrine in Part II below.  Brief for Petitioner 2122, n. 14.  If a careless reader were inclined to confuse the term social gatherings in this passage with loitering, his confusion would be eliminated by pursuing the reference to Part II of the brief, which says, in its introductory paragraph: [A]s we explain below, substantive due process does not support the courts novel holding that the Constitution secures the right to stand still on the public way even when one is not engaged in speech, assembly, or other conduct that enjoys affirmative constitutional protection.  Id., at 39.

						 The plurality says, ante, at 20, n. 35, that since it decides the case on the basis of procedural due process rather than substantive due process, I am mistaken in analyzing its opinion under the framework for substantive due process set out in Washington v. Glucksberg.  Ibid.  But I am not analyzing it under that framework.  I am simply assuming that when the plurality says (as an essential part of its reasoning) that the right to loiter for innocent purposes is . . . a part of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause it does not believe that the same word (liberty) means one thing for purposes of substantive due process and something else for purposes of procedural due process.  There is no authority for that startling proposition.  See Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/408/564" class="subref" title="subref">408 U. S. 564</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">572</a>575 (1972)
 (rejecting procedural-due-process claim for lack of liberty interest, and citing substantive-due-process cases).


The pluralitys opinion seeks to have it both ways, invoking the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>s august protection of liberty in defining the standard of certainty that it sets, but then, in identifying the conduct protected by that high standard, ignoring our extensive case-law defining liberty, and substituting, instead, all harmless and innocent conduct, ante, at 14.

						 I call it a suggestion because the plurality says only that the terms of the dispersal order compound the inadequacy of the notice, and acknowledges that they might not render the ordinance unconstitutionally vague if the definition of the forbidden conduct were clear.  Ante, at 15, 16.  This notion that a prescription (Disperse!) which is itself not unconstitutionally vague can somehow contribute to the unconstitutional vagueness of the entire scheme is full of mysterysuspending, as it does, the metaphysical principle that nothing can confer what it does not possess (nemo dat qui non habet).

						 Administrative interpretation and implementation of a regulation are … highly relevant to our [vagueness] analysis, for [i]n evaluating a facial challenge to a state law, a federal court must … consider any limiting construction that a state court or enforcement agency has proffered.   Ward v.

						 Justice Breyer asserts that one always has some apparent purpose, so that the policeman must interpret the words no apparent purpose as meaning no apparent purpose except for . . . .  Ante, at 12.  It is simply not true that one always has some apparent purposeand especially not true that one always has some apparent purpose in remaining at rest, for the simple reason that one often (indeed, perhaps usually) has no actual purpose in remaining at rest.  Remaining at rest will be a persons normal state, unless he has a purpose which causes him to move.  That is why one frequently reads of a persons wandering aimlessly (which is worthy of note) but not of a persons sitting aimlessly (which is not remarkable at all).  And that is why a synonym for purpose is motive: that which causes one to move.

						 The Court also speculates that a police officer may exercise his discretion to enforce the Ordinance and direct dispersal when (in the Courts view) the Ordinance is inapplicableviz., where there is an apparent purpose, but it is an unlawful one.  See ante, at 18.  No one in his right mind would read the phrase without any apparent purpose to mean anything other than without any apparent lawful purpose.  The implication that acts referred to approvingly in statutory language are lawful acts is routine.  The Court asserts that the Illinois Supreme Court has forced it into this interpretive inanity because, since it has not placed any limiting construction on the language in the ordinance, we must assume that the ordinance means what it says . . . .  Ante, at 19.  But the Illinois Supreme Court did not mention this particular interpretive issue, which has nothing to do with giving the Ordinance a limiting interpretation, and everything to do with giving it its ordinary legal meaning.

				The citizens of Chicago were once free to drive about the city at whatever speed they wished.  At some point Chicagoans (or perhaps Illinoisans) decided this would not do, and imposed prophylactic speed limits designed to assure safe operation by the average (or perhaps even subaverage) driver with the average (or perhaps even subaverage) vehicle.  This infringed upon the freedom of all citizens, but was not unconstitutional.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Similarly, the citizens of Chicago were once free to stand around and gawk at the scene of an accident.  At some point Chicagoans discovered that this obstructed traffic and caused more accidents.  They did not make the practice unlawful, but they did authorize police officers to order the crowd to disperse, and imposed penalties for refusal to obey such an order.  Again, this prophylactic measure infringed upon the freedom of all citizens, but was not unconstitutional.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Until the ordinance that is before us today was adopted, the citizens of Chicago were free to stand about in public places with no apparent purposeto engage, that is, in conduct that appeared to be loitering.  In recent years, however, the city has been afflicted with criminal street gangs.  As reflected in the record before us, these gangs congregated in public places to deal in drugs, and to terrorize the neighborhoods by demonstrating control over their turf.  Many residents of the inner city felt that they were prisoners in their own homes.  Once again, Chicagoans decided that to eliminate the problem it was worth restricting some of the freedom that they once enjoyed.  The means they took was similar to the second, and more mild, example given above rather than the first: Loitering was not made unlawful, but when a group of people occupied a public place without an apparent purpose and in the company of a known gang member, police officers were authorized to order them to disperse, and the failure to obey such an order was made unlawful.  See Chicago Municipal Code §84015 (1992).  The minor limitation upon the free state of nature that this prophylactic arrangement imposed upon all Chicagoans seemed to them (and it seems to me) a small price to pay for liberation of their streets.

Kindred to these rules is the rule that one to whom application of a statute is constitutional will not be heard to attack the statute on the ground that impliedly it might also be taken as applying to other persons or other situations in which its application might be unconstitutional. . . .  The delicate power of pronouncing an Act of Congress unconstitutional is not to be exercised with reference to hypothetical cases thus imagined.

				It seems to me fundamentally incompatible with this system for the Court not to be content to find that a statute is unconstitutional as applied to the person before it, but to go further and pronounce that the statute is unconstitutional in 
				<em>
					all
				</em>
				 applications.  Its reasoning may well suggest as much, but to pronounce a 
				<em>
					holding
				</em>
				 on that point seems to me no more than an advisory opinionwhich a federal court should never issue at all, see 
				<em>
					Hayburns Case
				</em>
				, 2 Dall. 409 (1792), and 
				<em>

 (Brandeis, J., concurring).  I think it quite improper, in short, to ask the constitutional claimant before us: Do you just want us to say that this statute cannot constitutionally be applied to you in this case, or do you want to go for broke and try to get the statute pronounced void in all its applications?

				<em>
					unconstitutional
				</em>
				 in all its applications.  (I say that is an eminently reasonable requirement, not only because we should not be holding a statute void in all its applications unless it is unconstitutional in all its applications, but also because 
				<em>
					unless
				</em>
				 it is unconstitutional in all its applications we do not even know, without conducting an as-applied analysis, whether it is void with regard to the very litigant

				I am aware, of course, that in some recent facial-challenge cases the Court has, without any attempt at explanation, created entirely irrational exceptions to the unconstitutional in every conceivable application rule, when the statutes at issue concerned hot-button social issues on which informed opinion was zealously united.

				When our normal criteria for facial challenges are applied, it is clear that the Justices in the majority have transposed the burden of proof.  Instead of requiring the respondents, who are challenging the Ordinance, to show that it is invalid in all its applications, they have required the petitioner to show that it is valid in all its applications.  Both the plurality opinion and the concurrences display a lively imagination, creating hypothetical situations in which the laws application would (in their view) be ambiguous.  But that creative role has been usurped from the petitioner, who can defeat the respondents facial challenge by conjuring up 
				<em>
					a single valid application
				</em>
				 of the law.  My contribution would go something like this

				: Tony, a member of the Jets criminal street gang, is standing alongside and chatting with fellow gang members while staking out their turf at Promontory Point on the South Side of Chicago; the group is flashing gang signs and displaying their distinctive tattoos to passersby.  Officer Krupke, applying the Ordinance at issue here, orders the group to disperse.  After some speculative discussion (probably irrelevant here) over whether the Jets are depraved because they are deprived, Tony and the other gang members break off further conversation with the statementnot entirely coherent, but evidently intended to be rudeGee, Officer Krupke, krup you.  A tense standoff ensues until Officer Krupke arrests the group for failing to obey his dispersal order.  Even assuming (as the Justices in the majority do, but I do not) that a law requiring obedience to a dispersal order is impermissibly vague unless it is clear to the objects of the order, before its issuance, that their conduct justifies it, I find it hard to believe that the Jets would not have known they had it coming.  That should settle the matter of respondents facial challenge to the Ordinances vagueness.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Of course respondents would still be able to claim that the Ordinance was vague as applied to them.  But the ultimate demonstration of the inappropriateness of the Courts holding of 
				<em>
					facial 
				</em>
				invalidity is the fact that it is doubtful whether some of these respondents could even sustain an 
				<em>
					as-applied 
				</em>
				challenge on the basis of the majoritys own criteria.  For instance, respondent Jose Renteriawho admitted that he was a member of the Satan Disciples gangwas observed by the arresting officer loitering on a street corner with other gang members.  The officer issued a dispersal order, but when she returned to the same corner 15 to 20 minutes later, Renteria was still there with his friends, whereupon he was arrested.  In another example, respondent Daniel Washington and several otherswho admitted they were members of the Vice Lords gangwere observed by the arresting officer loitering in the street, yelling at passing vehicles, stopping traffic, and preventing pedestrians from using the sidewalks.  The arresting officer issued a dispersal order, issued 
				<em>
					another
				</em>
				 dispersal order later when the group did not move, and finally arrested the group when they were found loitering in the same place still later.  Finally, respondent Gregorio Gutierrezwho had previously admitted to the arresting officer his membership in the Latin Kings gangwas observed loitering with two other men.  The officer issued a dispersal order, drove around the block, and arrested the men after finding them in the same place upon his return.  See Brief for Petitioner 7, n. 5; Brief for United States as 
				<em>
					Amicus Curiae
				</em>
				 16, n. 11.  Even on the majoritys assumption that to avoid vagueness it must be clear to the object of the dispersal order 
				<em>
					ex ante
				</em>
				 that his conduct is covered by the Ordinance, it seems most improbable that any of these as-applied challenges would be sustained.  Much less is it possible to say that the Ordinance is invalid in 
				<em>
					all 
				</em>
				its applications.

				The plurality's explanation for its departure from the usual rule governing facial challenges is seemingly contained in the following statement: [This] is a criminal law that contains no 
				<em>
					mens rea
				</em>
				 requirement … 
				<em>
					and
				</em>
				 infringes on constitutionally protected rights … .  When vagueness permeates the text of 
				<em>
					such
				</em>
				 a law, it is subject to facial attack.  
				<em>
					Ante

				, at 11 (emphasis added).  The proposition is set forth with such assurance that one might suppose that it repeats some well-accepted formula in our jurisprudence: (Criminal law without 
				<em>
					mens rea 
				</em>
				requirement)   (infringement of constitutionally protected right)   (vagueness) = (entitlement to facial invalidation).  There is no such formula; the plurality has made it up for this case, as the absence of any citation demonstrates.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				But no matter.  None of the three factors that the plurality relies upon exists anyway.  I turn first to the support for the proposition that there is a constitutionally protected right to loiteror, as the plurality more favorably describes it, for a person to remain in a public place of his choice.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  The plurality thinks much of this Fundamental Freedom to Loiter, which it contrasts with such lesser, constitutionally 
				<em>
					un
				</em>
				protected, activities as doing (ugh!) 
				<em>
					business
				</em>
				: This is not an ordinance that simply regulates business behavior and contains a scienter requirement. . . . It is a criminal law that contains no 
				<em>
					mens rea
				</em>
				 requirement . . . and infringes on constitutionally protected rights.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				 (internal quotation marks omitted). (Poor Alexander Hamilton, who has seen his commercial republic devolve, in the eyes of the plurality, at least, into an indolent republic, see The Federalist No. 6, p. 56; No. 11, pp. 8491 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961).)
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Of course every activity, even scratching ones head, can be called a constitutional right if one means by that term nothing more than the fact that the activity is covered (as all are) by the Equal Protection Clause, so that those who engage in it cannot be singled out without rational basis.  See

The entire practice of using the Due Process Clause to add judicially favored rights to the limitations upon democracy set forth in the Bill of Rights (usually under the rubric of so-called substantive due process) is in my view judicial usurpation.

Hence the (entirely reasonable) Rule of the City of New York which reads: No person shall fail, neglect or refuse to comply with the lawful direction or command of any Police Officer, Urban Park Ranger, Parks Enforcement Patrol Officer or other [Parks and Recreation] Department employee, indicated by gesture or otherwise.  56 RCNY §103(c)(1) (1996).  It is one thing to uphold an as applied challenge when a pedestrian disobeys such an order that is unreasonableor even when a pedestrian asserting some true liberty interest (holding a political rally, for instance) disobeys such an order that is reasonable

				I turn next to that element of the plurality's facial-challenge formula which consists of the proposition that this criminal ordinance contains no 
				<em>
					mens rea 
				</em>
				requirement.  The first step in analyzing this proposition is to determine what the 
				<em>
					actus reus
				</em>
				, to which that 
				<em>
					mens rea
				</em>
				 is supposed to be attached, consists of.  The majority believes that loitering forms part of (indeed, the essence of) the offense, and must be proved if conviction is to be obtained.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 2, 6, 913, 1415, 1618 (plurality and majority opinions); 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 23, 4 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					OConnor, J.
				</span>
				, concurring in part and concurring in judgment); 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 12 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Kennedy, J
				</span>
				., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 34 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Breyer, J
				</span>
				., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  That is not what the Ordinance provides.  The only part of the Ordinance that refers to loitering is the portion that addresses, not the punishable conduct of the defendant, but what the police officer must observe before he can issue an order to disperse; and what he must observe is carefully defined in terms of what the defendant 
				<em>
					appears
				</em>
				 to be doing, not in terms of what the defendant is 
				<em>
					actually
				</em>
				 doing.  The Ordinance does not require that the defendant have been loitering (
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, have been remaining in one place with no purpose), but rather that the police officer have observed him remaining in one place without any 
				<em>
					apparent
				</em>
				 purpose.  Someone who in fact 
				<em>
					has
				</em>
				 a genuine purpose for remaining where he is (waiting for a friend, for example, or waiting to hold up a bank) 
				<em>
					can
				</em>
				 be ordered to move on (assuming the other conditions of the Ordinance are met), so long as his remaining has no 
				<em>
					apparent
				</em>
				 purpose.  It is likely, to be sure, that the Ordinance will come down most heavily upon those who are 
				<em>
					actually 
				</em>
				loitering (those who 
				<em>
					really
				</em>
				 have no purpose in remaining where they are); but that activity is not a condition for issuance of the dispersal order.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The 
				<em>
					only
				</em>
				 act of a defendant that is made punishable by the Ordinanceor, indeed, that is even mentioned by the Ordinanceis his failure to promptly obey an order to disperse.  The question, then, is whether that 
				<em>
					actus reus
				</em>
				 must be accompanied by any wrongful intentand of course it must.  As the Court itself describes the requirement, a person must 
				<em>
					disobey
				</em>
				 the officers order.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 3 (emphasis added).  No one thinks a defendant could be successfully prosecuted under the Ordinance if he did not hear the order to disperse, or if he suffered a paralysis that rendered his compliance impossible.  The willful failure to obey a police order is wrongful intent enough.

				Finally, I address the last of the three factors in the plurality's facial-challenge formula: the proposition that the Ordinance is vague.  It is not.  Even under the ersatz overbreadth standard applied in

S. 352</a> n. 8 (1983), which allows facial challenges if a law reaches a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct, respondents claim fails because the Ordinance would not be vague in most or even a substantial number of applications.  A law is unconstitutionally vague if its lack of definitive standards either (1) fails to apprise persons of ordinary intelligence of the prohibited conduct, or (2) encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,

				The plurality relies primarily upon the first of these aspects.  Since, it reasons, the loitering is the conduct that the ordinance is designed to prohibit, and an officer may issue an order only after prohibited conduct has already occurred, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 14, 15, the order to disperse cannot itself serve to apprise persons of ordinary intelligence of the prohibited conduct.  What counts for purposes of vagueness analysis, however, is not what the Ordinance is designed to prohibit, but what it actually subjects to criminal penalty.  As discussed earlier, that consists of nothing but the refusal to obey a dispersal order, as to which there is no doubt of adequate notice of the prohibited conduct.  The plurality's suggestion that even the dispersal order 
				<em>
					itself
				</em>
				 is unconstitutionally vague, because it does not specify 
				<em>
					how far to disperse (!)
				</em>
				, see 
				<em>

				  If it were true, it would render unconstitutional for vagueness many of the Presidential proclamations issued under that provision of the United States Code which requires the President, before using the militia or the Armed Forces for law enforcement, to issue a proclamation ordering the insurgents to disperse.

				For its determination of unconstitutional vagueness, the Court relies secondarilyand 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice OConnor
				</span>
				s and 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Breyer
				</span>
				s concurrences exclusivelyupon the second aspect of that doctrine, which requires sufficient specificity to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory law enforcement.  See

				</em>
				, at 3 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Breyer, J
				</span>
				., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  In discussing whether Chicagos Ordinance meets that requirement, the Justices in the majority hide behind an artificial construct of judicial restraint.  They point to the Supreme Court of Illinois statement that the apparent purpose standard provides absolute discretion to police officers to decide what activities constitute loitering, 687 N. E. 2d 53, 63 (1997), and protest that it would be wrong to construe the language of the Ordinance more narrowly than did the States highest court.

				<em>

				, at 45 (
				<span class="smallcaps">

				<em>
					characterization
				</em>
				 of what the language achievedafter that court refused (as I do) to read in any limitations that the words do not fairly contain.  It is not a construction of the language (to which we are bound) but a legal conclusion (to which we most assuredly are not bound).

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The criteria for issuance of a dispersal order under the Chicago Ordinance could hardly be clearer.  First, the law requires police officers to reasonably believ[e] that one of the group to which the order is issued is a criminal street gang member.  This resembles a probable-cause standard, and the Chicago Police Departments General Order 924 (1992)promulgated to govern enforcement of the Ordinancemakes the probable cause requirement explicit.
				<a name="ZD-10ref" href="#ZD-10" class="">

					10
				</b>
                </sup>
            </a>
				  Under the Order, officers must have probable cause to believe that an individual is a member of a criminal street gang, to be substantiated by the officers experience and knowledge of the alleged offenders and by specific, documented and reliable information such as reliable witness testimony or an individuals admission of gang membership or display of distinctive colors, tattoos, signs, or other markings worn by members of particular criminal street gangs.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 67a69a, 71a72a.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, the Ordinance requires that the group be remain[ing] in one place with no apparent purpose.  
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice OConnor
				</span>
				s assertion that this applies to any person standing in a public place, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 2, is a distortion.  The Ordinance does not apply to standing, but to remain[ing]a term which in this context obviously means [to] endure or persist, see American Heritage Dictionary 1525 (1992).  There may be some ambiguity at the margin, but remain[ing] in one place requires more than a temporary stop, and is clear in most of its applications, including all of those represented by the facts surrounding the respondents arrests described 
				<em>
					supra, 
				</em>
				at 12.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				As for the phrase with no apparent purpose: 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice OConnor
				</span>
				 again distorts this adjectival phrase, by separating it from the word that it modifies.  [A]ny person standing on the street, her concurrence says, has a general purposeeven if it is simply to stand, and thus the ordinance permits police officers to choose which purposes are 
				<em>
					permissible
				</em>
				.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 2.  But Chicago police officers enforcing the Ordinance are not looking for people with no apparent purpose (who are regrettably in oversupply); they are looking for people who remain in any one place with no apparent purposethat is, who remain there without any apparent reason 
				<em>
					for remaining there
				</em>
				.  That is not difficult to perceive.

				The Courts attempt to demonstrate the vagueness of the Ordinance produces the following peculiar statement: The no apparent purpose standard for making [the decision to issue an order to disperse] is inherently subjective because its application depends on whether some purpose is apparent to the officer on the scene.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 18.  In the Courts view, a persons lack of any purpose in staying in one location is presumably an 
				<em>
					objective
				</em>
				 factor, and what the Ordinance requires as a condition of an order to dispersethe absence of any 
				<em>
					apparent
				</em>
				 purposeis a 
				<em>
					subjective
				</em>
				 factor.  This side of the looking glass, just the opposite is true.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Elsewhere, of course, the Court acknowledges the clear, objective commands of the Ordinance, and indeed relies upon them to paint it as unfair:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				By its very terms, the ordinance encompasses a great deal of harmless behavior.  In any public place in the city of Chicago, persons who stand or sit in the company of a gang member may be ordered to disperse unless their purpose is apparent.  The mandatory language in the enactment directs the police to issue an order without first making any inquiry about their possible purposes.  It matters not whether the reason that a gang member and his father, for example, might loiter near Wrigley Field is to rob an unsuspecting fan or just to get a glimpse of Sammy Sosa leaving the ballpark; in either event, if their purpose is not apparent to a nearby police officer, she mayindeed, she shallorder them to disperse.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				16.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
Quite so.  And the fact that this clear instruction to the officers encompasses a great deal of harmless behavior would be invalidating if that harmless behavior were constitutionally protected against abridgment, such as speech or the practice of religion.  Remaining in one place is 
				<em>

				 so protected, and so (as already discussed) it is up to the citizens of Chicagonot usto decide whether the trade-off is worth it.

				The Court also assertsin apparent contradiction to the passage just quotedthat the apparent purpose test is too elastic because it presumably allows police officers to treat

				 violations as not warranting enforcement.

The problem, of course, well recognized by Chicagos City Council, is that the gang members cease their intimidating and unlawful behavior under the watchful eye of police officers, but return to it as soon as the police drive away.

As suggested by their tortured analyses, and by their suggested solutions that bear no relation to the identified constitutional problem, the majoritys real quarrel with the Chicago Ordinance is simply that it permits (or indeed requires) too much harmless conduct by innocent citizens to be proscribed.

				But in our democratic system, how much harmless conduct to proscribe is not a judgment to be made by the courts.  So long as constitutionally guaranteed rights are not affected, and so long as the proscription has a rational basis, 
				<em>
					all sorts
				</em>
				 of perfectly harmless activity by millions of perfectly innocent people can be forbiddenriding a motorcycle without a safety helmet, for example, starting a campfire in a national forest, or selling a safe and effective drug not yet approved by the FDA.  All of these acts are entirely innocent and harmless in themselves, but because of the 
				<em>
					risk
				</em>
				 of harm that they entail, the freedom to engage in them has been abridged.  The citizens of Chicago have decided that depriving themselves of the freedom to hang out with a gang member is necessary to eliminate pervasive gang crime and intimidationand that the elimination of the one is worth the deprivation of the other.  This Court has no business second-guessing either the degree of necessity or the fairness of the trade.

						 In other words, a facial attack, since it requires unconstitutionality in all circumstances, necessarily presumes that the litigant presently before the court would be able to sustain an as-applied challenge.  See Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/455/489" class="subref" title="subref">455 U. S. 489</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">495</a> (1982)
 (A plaintiff who engages in some conduct that is clearly proscribed cannot complain of the vagueness of the law as applied tothe conduct of others.  A court should therefore examine the complainants conduct before analyzing other hypothetical applications of the law); Parker v. Levy, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/417/733" class="subref" title="subref">417 U. S. 733</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">756</a> (1974)
 (One to whose con-duct a statute clearly applies may not successfully challenge it for vagueness).  


The plurality asserts that in United States v. Salerno, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/481/739" class="subref" title="subref">481 U. S. 739</a> (1987)
, which I discuss in text immediately following this footnote, the Court entertained a facial challenge even though the defendants . . . did not claim that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to them.  Ante, at 11, n. 22.  That is not so.  The Court made it absolutely clear in Salerno that a facial challenge requires the assertion that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid, 481 U. S., at 745 (emphasis added).  The footnoted statement upon which the plurality relies (Nor have respondents claimed that the Act is unconstitutional because of the way it was applied to the particular facts of their case, id., at 745, n. 3) was obviously meant to convey the fact that the defendants were not making, in addition to their facial challenge, an alternative as-applied challengei.e., asserting that even if the statute was not unconstitutional in all its applications it was at least unconstitutional in its particular application to them.

						 Salerno, a criminal case, repudiated the Courts statement in Kolender v. Lawson, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/461/352" class="subref" title="subref">461 U. S. 352</a>, n. 8 (1983), to the effect that a facial challenge to a criminal statute could succeed even when [the statute] could conceivably have had some valid application.  Kolender seems to have confused the standard for 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> overbreadth challenges with the standard governing facial challenges on all other grounds.  See ibid. (citing the Courts articulation of the standard for 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> overbreadth challenges from Hoffman Estates, supra, at 494).  As Salerno noted, 481 U. S., at 745, the overbreadth doctrine is a specialized exception to the general rule for facial challenges, justified in light of the risk that an overbroad statute will chill free expression.  See, e.g., Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/413/601" class="subref" title="subref">413 U. S. 601</a>,

						 The plurality asserts that the Salerno standard for facial challenge has never been the decisive factor in any decision of this Court.  It means by that only this: in rejecting a facial challenge, the Court has never contented itself with identifying only one situation in which the challenged statute would be constitutional, but has mentioned several.  But that is not at all remarkable, and casts no doubt upon the validity of the principle that Salerno and these many other cases enunciated.  It is difficult to conceive of a statute that would be constitutional in only a single applicationand hard to resist mentioning more than one.


The plurality contends that it does not matter whether the Salerno standard is federal law, since facial challenge is a species of third-party standing, and federal limitations upon third-party standing do not apply in an appeal from a state decision which takes a broader view, as the Illinois Supreme Courts opinion did here.  Ante, at 11, n. 22.  This is quite wrong.  Disagreement over the Salerno rule is not a disagreement over the standing question of whether the person challenging the statute can raise the rights of third parties: under both Salerno and the plurality's rule he can.  The disagreement relates to how many third-party rights he must prove to be infringed by the statute before he can win: Salerno says all (in addition to his own rights), the plurality says many.  That is not a question of standing but of substantive law.  The notion that, if Salerno is the federal rule (a federal statute is not totally invalid unless it is invalid in all its applications), it can be altered by a state court (a federal statute is totally invalid if it is invalid in many of its applications), and that that alteration must be accepted by the Supreme Court of the United States is, to put it as gently as possible, remarkable.

						 The pluralitys explanation for ignoring these laws is that many of them carried severe penalties and, during the Reconstruction era, they had harsh consequences on African-American women and children.  Ante, at 910, n. 20.  Those severe penalties and those harsh consequences are certainly regrettable, but they in no way lessen (indeed, the harshness of penalty tends to increase) the capacity of these laws to prove that loitering was never regarded as a fundamental liberty.

						 Ante, at 9, n. 19.  The plurality bases its assertion of apparent concession upon a footnote in Part I of petitioners brief which reads: Of course, laws regulating social gatherings affect a liberty interest, and thus are subject to review under the rubric of substantive due process . . . . We address that doctrine in Part II below.  Brief for Petitioner 2122, n. 14.  If a careless reader were inclined to confuse the term social gatherings in this passage with loitering, his confusion would be eliminated by pursuing the reference to Part II of the brief, which says, in its introductory paragraph: [A]s we explain below, substantive due process does not support the courts novel holding that the Constitution secures the right to stand still on the public way even when one is not engaged in speech, assembly, or other conduct that enjoys affirmative constitutional protection.  Id., at 39.

						 The plurality says, ante, at 20, n. 35, that since it decides the case on the basis of procedural due process rather than substantive due process, I am mistaken in analyzing its opinion under the framework for substantive due process set out in Washington v. Glucksberg.  Ibid.  But I am not analyzing it under that framework.  I am simply assuming that when the plurality says (as an essential part of its reasoning) that the right to loiter for innocent purposes is . . . a part of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause it does not believe that the same word (liberty) means one thing for purposes of substantive due process and something else for purposes of procedural due process.  There is no authority for that startling proposition.  See Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/408/564" class="subref" title="subref">408 U. S. 564</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">572</a>575 (1972)
 (rejecting procedural-due-process claim for lack of liberty interest, and citing substantive-due-process cases).


The pluralitys opinion seeks to have it both ways, invoking the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>s august protection of liberty in defining the standard of certainty that it sets, but then, in identifying the conduct protected by that high standard, ignoring our extensive case-law defining liberty, and substituting, instead, all harmless and innocent conduct, ante, at 14.

						 I call it a suggestion because the plurality says only that the terms of the dispersal order compound the inadequacy of the notice, and acknowledges that they might not render the ordinance unconstitutionally vague if the definition of the forbidden conduct were clear.  Ante, at 15, 16.  This notion that a prescription (Disperse!) which is itself not unconstitutionally vague can somehow contribute to the unconstitutional vagueness of the entire scheme is full of mysterysuspending, as it does, the metaphysical principle that nothing can confer what it does not possess (nemo dat qui non habet).

						 Administrative interpretation and implementation of a regulation are … highly relevant to our [vagueness] analysis, for [i]n evaluating a facial challenge to a state law, a federal court must … consider any limiting construction that a state court or enforcement agency has proffered.   Ward v.

						 Justice Breyer asserts that one always has some apparent purpose, so that the policeman must interpret the words no apparent purpose as meaning no apparent purpose except for . . . .  Ante, at 12.  It is simply not true that one always has some apparent purposeand especially not true that one always has some apparent purpose in remaining at rest, for the simple reason that one often (indeed, perhaps usually) has no actual purpose in remaining at rest.  Remaining at rest will be a persons normal state, unless he has a purpose which causes him to move.  That is why one frequently reads of a persons wandering aimlessly (which is worthy of note) but not of a persons sitting aimlessly (which is not remarkable at all).  And that is why a synonym for purpose is motive: that which causes one to move.

						 The Court also speculates that a police officer may exercise his discretion to enforce the Ordinance and direct dispersal when (in the Courts view) the Ordinance is inapplicableviz., where there is an apparent purpose, but it is an unlawful one.  See ante, at 18.  No one in his right mind would read the phrase without any apparent purpose to mean anything other than without any apparent lawful purpose.  The implication that acts referred to approvingly in statutory language are lawful acts is routine.  The Court asserts that the Illinois Supreme Court has forced it into this interpretive inanity because, since it has not placed any limiting construction on the language in the ordinance, we must assume that the ordinance means what it says . . . .  Ante, at 19.  But the Illinois Supreme Court did not mention this particular interpretive issue, which has nothing to do with giving the Ordinance a limiting interpretation, and everything to do with giving it its ordinary legal meaning.

				The citizens of Chicago were once free to drive about the city at whatever speed they wished.  At some point Chicagoans (or perhaps Illinoisans) decided this would not do, and imposed prophylactic speed limits designed to assure safe operation by the average (or perhaps even subaverage) driver with the average (or perhaps even subaverage) vehicle.  This infringed upon the freedom of all citizens, but was not unconstitutional.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Similarly, the citizens of Chicago were once free to stand around and gawk at the scene of an accident.  At some point Chicagoans discovered that this obstructed traffic and caused more accidents.  They did not make the practice unlawful, but they did authorize police officers to order the crowd to disperse, and imposed penalties for refusal to obey such an order.  Again, this prophylactic measure infringed upon the freedom of all citizens, but was not unconstitutional.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Until the ordinance that is before us today was adopted, the citizens of Chicago were free to stand about in public places with no apparent purposeto engage, that is, in conduct that appeared to be loitering.  In recent years, however, the city has been afflicted with criminal street gangs.  As reflected in the record before us, these gangs congregated in public places to deal in drugs, and to terrorize the neighborhoods by demonstrating control over their turf.  Many residents of the inner city felt that they were prisoners in their own homes.  Once again, Chicagoans decided that to eliminate the problem it was worth restricting some of the freedom that they once enjoyed.  The means they took was similar to the second, and more mild, example given above rather than the first: Loitering was not made unlawful, but when a group of people occupied a public place without an apparent purpose and in the company of a known gang member, police officers were authorized to order them to disperse, and the failure to obey such an order was made unlawful.  See Chicago Municipal Code §84015 (1992).  The minor limitation upon the free state of nature that this prophylactic arrangement imposed upon all Chicagoans seemed to them (and it seems to me) a small price to pay for liberation of their streets.

				The majority today invalidates this perfectly reasonable measure by ignoring our rules governing facial challenges, by elevating loitering to a constitutionally guaranteed right, and by discerning vagueness where, according to our usual standards, none exists.

				Respondents consolidated appeal presents a facial challenge to the Chicago Ordinance on vagueness grounds.  When a facial challenge is successful, the law in question is declared to be unenforceable in 
				<em>
					all

				 its applications, and not just in its particular application to the party in suit.  To tell the truth, it is highly questionable whether federal courts have any business making such a declaration.  The rationale for our power to review federal legislation for constitutionality, expressed in

But if he directly attacks a general principle without having a particular case in view, he leaves the circle in which all nations have agreed to confine his authority; he assumes a more important, and perhaps a more useful influence, than that of the magistrate; but he ceases to represent the judicial power.

Those to whom it is prejudicial learn that means exist of overcoming its authority; and similar suits are multiplied, until it becomes powerless. … The political power which the Americans have entrusted to their courts of justice is therefore immense; but the evils of this power are considerably diminished by the impossibility of attacking the laws except through the courts of justice. …  [W]hen a judge contests a law in an obscure debate on some particular case, the importance of his attack is concealed from public notice; his decision bears upon the interest of an individual, and the law is slighted only incidentally.

				I am aware, of course, that in some recent facial-challenge cases the Court has, without any attempt at explanation, created entirely irrational exceptions to the unconstitutional in every conceivable application rule, when the statutes at issue concerned hot-button social issues on which informed opinion was zealously united.

				When our normal criteria for facial challenges are applied, it is clear that the Justices in the majority have transposed the burden of proof.  Instead of requiring the respondents, who are challenging the Ordinance, to show that it is invalid in all its applications, they have required the petitioner to show that it is valid in all its applications.  Both the plurality opinion and the concurrences display a lively imagination, creating hypothetical situations in which the laws application would (in their view) be ambiguous.  But that creative role has been usurped from the petitioner, who can defeat the respondents facial challenge by conjuring up 
				<em>
					a single valid application
				</em>
				 of the law.  My contribution would go something like this
				<a name="ZD-5ref" href="#ZD-5" class="">

				: Tony, a member of the Jets criminal street gang, is standing alongside and chatting with fellow gang members while staking out their turf at Promontory Point on the South Side of Chicago; the group is flashing gang signs and displaying their distinctive tattoos to passersby.  Officer Krupke, applying the Ordinance at issue here, orders the group to disperse.  After some speculative discussion (probably irrelevant here) over whether the Jets are depraved because they are deprived, Tony and the other gang members break off further conversation with the statementnot entirely coherent, but evidently intended to be rudeGee, Officer Krupke, krup you.  A tense standoff ensues until Officer Krupke arrests the group for failing to obey his dispersal order.  Even assuming (as the Justices in the majority do, but I do not) that a law requiring obedience to a dispersal order is impermissibly vague unless it is clear to the objects of the order, before its issuance, that their conduct justifies it, I find it hard to believe that the Jets would not have known they had it coming.  That should settle the matter of respondents facial challenge to the Ordinances vagueness.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Of course respondents would still be able to claim that the Ordinance was vague as applied to them.  But the ultimate demonstration of the inappropriateness of the Courts holding of 
				<em>
					facial 
				</em>
				invalidity is the fact that it is doubtful whether some of these respondents could even sustain an 
				<em>
					as-applied 
				</em>
				challenge on the basis of the majoritys own criteria.  For instance, respondent Jose Renteriawho admitted that he was a member of the Satan Disciples gangwas observed by the arresting officer loitering on a street corner with other gang members.  The officer issued a dispersal order, but when she returned to the same corner 15 to 20 minutes later, Renteria was still there with his friends, whereupon he was arrested.  In another example, respondent Daniel Washington and several otherswho admitted they were members of the Vice Lords gangwere observed by the arresting officer loitering in the street, yelling at passing vehicles, stopping traffic, and preventing pedestrians from using the sidewalks.  The arresting officer issued a dispersal order, issued 
				<em>
					another
				</em>
				 dispersal order later when the group did not move, and finally arrested the group when they were found loitering in the same place still later.  Finally, respondent Gregorio Gutierrezwho had previously admitted to the arresting officer his membership in the Latin Kings gangwas observed loitering with two other men.  The officer issued a dispersal order, drove around the block, and arrested the men after finding them in the same place upon his return.  See Brief for Petitioner 7, n. 5; Brief for United States as 
				<em>
					Amicus Curiae
				</em>
				 16, n. 11.  Even on the majoritys assumption that to avoid vagueness it must be clear to the object of the dispersal order 
				<em>
					ex ante
				</em>
				 that his conduct is covered by the Ordinance, it seems most improbable that any of these as-applied challenges would be sustained.  Much less is it possible to say that the Ordinance is invalid in 
				<em>
					all 
				</em>
				its applications.

				The plurality's explanation for its departure from the usual rule governing facial challenges is seemingly contained in the following statement: [This] is a criminal law that contains no 
				<em>
					mens rea
				</em>
				 requirement … 
				<em>
					and
				</em>
				 infringes on constitutionally protected rights … .  When vagueness permeates the text of 
				<em>
					such
				</em>
				 a law, it is subject to facial attack.  
				<em>
					Ante

				, at 11 (emphasis added).  The proposition is set forth with such assurance that one might suppose that it repeats some well-accepted formula in our jurisprudence: (Criminal law without 
				<em>
					mens rea 
				</em>
				requirement)   (infringement of constitutionally protected right)   (vagueness) = (entitlement to facial invalidation).  There is no such formula; the plurality has made it up for this case, as the absence of any citation demonstrates.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				But no matter.  None of the three factors that the plurality relies upon exists anyway.  I turn first to the support for the proposition that there is a constitutionally protected right to loiteror, as the plurality more favorably describes it, for a person to remain in a public place of his choice.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  The plurality thinks much of this Fundamental Freedom to Loiter, which it contrasts with such lesser, constitutionally 
				<em>
					un
				</em>
				protected, activities as doing (ugh!) 
				<em>
					business
				</em>
				: This is not an ordinance that simply regulates business behavior and contains a scienter requirement. . . . It is a criminal law that contains no 
				<em>
					mens rea
				</em>
				 requirement . . . and infringes on constitutionally protected rights.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				 (internal quotation marks omitted). (Poor Alexander Hamilton, who has seen his commercial republic devolve, in the eyes of the plurality, at least, into an indolent republic, see The Federalist No. 6, p. 56; No. 11, pp. 8491 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961).)
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Of course every activity, even scratching ones head, can be called a constitutional right if one means by that term nothing more than the fact that the activity is covered (as all are) by the Equal Protection Clause, so that those who engage in it cannot be singled out without rational basis.  See

The entire practice of using the Due Process Clause to add judicially favored rights to the limitations upon democracy set forth in the Bill of Rights (usually under the rubric of so-called substantive due process) is in my view judicial usurpation.

				It would be unfair, however, to criticize the pluralitys failed attempt to establish that loitering is a constitutionally protected right while saying nothing of the concurrences.  The plurality at least makes an attempt.  The concurrences, on the other hand, make no pretense at attaching their broad vagueness invalidates rule to a liberty interest.  As far as appears from 
				<span class="smallcaps">

				<em>
					any

				 order, affecting 
				<em>
					any
				</em>
				 insignificant sort of citizen conduct (except, perhaps, an order addressed to the unprotected class of gang members) unless the standards for the issuance of that order are precise.  No mod-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				ern urban societyand probably none since London got big enough to have sewerscould function under such a rule.  There are innumerable reasons why it may be im-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				portant for a constable to tell a pedestrian to move onand even if it were possible to list in an ordinance all of the reasons that are known, many are simply unpredictable.  Hence the (entirely reasonable) Rule of the City of New York which reads: No person shall fail, neglect or refuse to comply with the lawful direction or command of any Police Officer, Urban Park Ranger, Parks Enforcement Patrol Officer or other [Parks and Recreation] Department employee, indicated by gesture or otherwise.  56 RCNY §103(c)(1) (1996).  It is one thing to uphold an as applied challenge when a pedestrian disobeys such an order that is unreasonableor even when a pedestrian asserting some true liberty interest (holding a political rally, for instance) disobeys such an order that is reasonable 
				<em>
					but unexplained
				</em>
				.  But to say that such a general ordinance permitting lawful orders is void 
				<em>

				 demands more than a safe and orderly society can reasonably deliver.

				I turn next to that element of the plurality's facial-challenge formula which consists of the proposition that this criminal ordinance contains no 
				<em>
					mens rea 
				</em>
				requirement.  The first step in analyzing this proposition is to determine what the 
				<em>
					actus reus
				</em>
				, to which that 
				<em>
					mens rea
				</em>
				 is supposed to be attached, consists of.  The majority believes that loitering forms part of (indeed, the essence of) the offense, and must be proved if conviction is to be obtained.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 2, 6, 913, 1415, 1618 (plurality and majority opinions); 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 23, 4 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					OConnor, J.
				</span>
				, concurring in part and concurring in judgment); 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 12 (
				<span class="smallcaps">

				</span>
				., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 34 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Breyer, J
				</span>
				., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  That is not what the Ordinance provides.  The only part of the Ordinance that refers to loitering is the portion that addresses, not the punishable conduct of the defendant, but what the police officer must observe before he can issue an order to disperse; and what he must observe is carefully defined in terms of what the defendant 
				<em>
					appears
				</em>
				 to be doing, not in terms of what the defendant is 
				<em>
					actually
				</em>
				 doing.  The Ordinance does not require that the defendant have been loitering (
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, have been remaining in one place with no purpose), but rather that the police officer have observed him remaining in one place without any 
				<em>
					apparent
				</em>
				 purpose.  Someone who in fact 
				<em>
					has
				</em>
				 a genuine purpose for remaining where he is (waiting for a friend, for example, or waiting to hold up a bank) 
				<em>
					can
				</em>
				 be ordered to move on (assuming the other conditions of the Ordinance are met), so long as his remaining has no 
				<em>
					apparent
				</em>
				 purpose.  It is likely, to be sure, that the Ordinance will come down most heavily upon those who are 
				<em>
					actually 
				</em>
				loitering (those who 
				<em>
					really
				</em>
				 have no purpose in remaining where they are); but that activity is not a condition for issuance of the dispersal order.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The 
				<em>
					only
				</em>
				 act of a defendant that is made punishable by the Ordinanceor, indeed, that is even mentioned by the Ordinanceis his failure to promptly obey an order to disperse.  The question, then, is whether that 
				<em>
					actus reus
				</em>
				 must be accompanied by any wrongful intentand of course it must.  As the Court itself describes the requirement, a person must 
				<em>
					disobey
				</em>
				 the officers order.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 3 (emphasis added).  No one thinks a defendant could be successfully prosecuted under the Ordinance if he did not hear the order to disperse, or if he suffered a paralysis that rendered his compliance impossible.  The willful failure to obey a police order is wrongful intent enough.

				Finally, I address the last of the three factors in the plurality's facial-challenge formula: the proposition that the Ordinance is vague.  It is not.  Even under the ersatz overbreadth standard applied in

S. 352</a> n. 8 (1983), which allows facial challenges if a law reaches a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct, respondents claim fails because the Ordinance would not be vague in most or even a substantial number of applications.  A law is unconstitutionally vague if its lack of definitive standards either (1) fails to apprise persons of ordinary intelligence of the prohibited conduct, or (2) encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,

				The plurality relies primarily upon the first of these aspects.  Since, it reasons, the loitering is the conduct that the ordinance is designed to prohibit, and an officer may issue an order only after prohibited conduct has already occurred, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 14, 15, the order to disperse cannot itself serve to apprise persons of ordinary intelligence of the prohibited conduct.  What counts for purposes of vagueness analysis, however, is not what the Ordinance is designed to prohibit, but what it actually subjects to criminal penalty.  As discussed earlier, that consists of nothing but the refusal to obey a dispersal order, as to which there is no doubt of adequate notice of the prohibited conduct.  The plurality's suggestion that even the dispersal order 
				<em>
					itself
				</em>
				 is unconstitutionally vague, because it does not specify 
				<em>
					how far to disperse (!)
				</em>
				, see 
				<em>

				, at 15, scarcely requires a response.

				  If it were true, it would render unconstitutional for vagueness many of the Presidential proclamations issued under that provision of the United States Code which requires the President, before using the militia or the Armed Forces for law enforcement, to issue a proclamation ordering the insurgents to disperse.

				For its determination of unconstitutional vagueness, the Court relies secondarilyand 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice OConnor
				</span>
				s and 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Breyer
				</span>
				s concurrences exclusivelyupon the second aspect of that doctrine, which requires sufficient specificity to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory law enforcement.  See 
				<em>

				<em>

				</em>
				, at 3 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Breyer, J
				</span>
				., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  In discussing whether Chicagos Ordinance meets that requirement, the Justices in the majority hide behind an artificial construct of judicial restraint.  They point to the Supreme Court of Illinois statement that the apparent purpose standard provides absolute discretion to police officers to decide what activities constitute loitering, 687 N. E. 2d 53, 63 (1997), and protest that it would be wrong to construe the language of the Ordinance more narrowly than did the States highest court.  
				<em>

				, at 17, 19 (majority opinion); 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 45 (
				<span class="smallcaps">

				</span>
				 concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  The absolute discretion statement, however, is nothing more than the Illinois Supreme Courts 
				<em>
					characterization
				</em>
				 of what the language achievedafter that court refused (as I do) to read in any limitations that the words do not fairly contain.  It is not a construction of the language (to which we are bound) but a legal conclusion (to which we most assuredly are not bound).

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The criteria for issuance of a dispersal order under the Chicago Ordinance could hardly be clearer.  First, the law requires police officers to reasonably believ[e] that one of the group to which the order is issued is a criminal street gang member.  This resembles a probable-cause standard, and the Chicago Police Departments General Order 924 (1992)promulgated to govern enforcement of the Ordinancemakes the probable cause requirement explicit.
				<a name="ZD-10ref" href="#ZD-10" class="">

					10
				</b>
                </sup>
            </a>
				  Under the Order, officers must have probable cause to believe that an individual is a member of a criminal street gang, to be substantiated by the officers experience and knowledge of the alleged offenders and by specific, documented and reliable information such as reliable witness testimony or an individuals admission of gang membership or display of distinctive colors, tattoos, signs, or other markings worn by members of particular criminal street gangs.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 67a69a, 71a72a.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, the Ordinance requires that the group be remain[ing] in one place with no apparent purpose.  
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice OConnor
				</span>
				s assertion that this applies to any person standing in a public place, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 2, is a distortion.  The Ordinance does not apply to standing, but to remain[ing]a term which in this context obviously means [to] endure or persist, see American Heritage Dictionary 1525 (1992).  There may be some ambiguity at the margin, but remain[ing] in one place requires more than a temporary stop, and is clear in most of its applications, including all of those represented by the facts surrounding the respondents arrests described 
				<em>
					supra, 
				</em>
				at 12.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				As for the phrase with no apparent purpose: 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice OConnor
				</span>
				 again distorts this adjectival phrase, by separating it from the word that it modifies.  [A]ny person standing on the street, her concurrence says, has a general purposeeven if it is simply to stand, and thus the ordinance permits police officers to choose which purposes are 
				<em>
					permissible
				</em>
				.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 2.  But Chicago police officers enforcing the Ordinance are not looking for people with no apparent purpose (who are regrettably in oversupply); they are looking for people who remain in any one place with no apparent purposethat is, who remain there without any apparent reason 
				<em>
					for remaining there
				</em>
				.  That is not difficult to perceive.

				The Courts attempt to demonstrate the vagueness of the Ordinance produces the following peculiar statement: The no apparent purpose standard for making [the decision to issue an order to disperse] is inherently subjective because its application depends on whether some purpose is apparent to the officer on the scene.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 18.  In the Courts view, a persons lack of any purpose in staying in one location is presumably an 
				<em>
					objective
				</em>
				 factor, and what the Ordinance requires as a condition of an order to dispersethe absence of any 
				<em>
					apparent
				</em>
				 purposeis a 
				<em>
					subjective
				</em>
				 factor.  This side of the looking glass, just the opposite is true.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Elsewhere, of course, the Court acknowledges the clear, objective commands of the Ordinance, and indeed relies upon them to paint it as unfair:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				By its very terms, the ordinance encompasses a great deal of harmless behavior.  In any public place in the city of Chicago, persons who stand or sit in the company of a gang member may be ordered to disperse unless their purpose is apparent.  The mandatory language in the enactment directs the police to issue an order without first making any inquiry about their possible purposes.  It matters not whether the reason that a gang member and his father, for example, might loiter near Wrigley Field is to rob an unsuspecting fan or just to get a glimpse of Sammy Sosa leaving the ballpark; in either event, if their purpose is not apparent to a nearby police officer, she mayindeed, she shallorder them to disperse.

				, at
				<span class="softbreak"></span>

        <p class="bodytext">
				
Quite so.  And the fact that this clear instruction to the officers encompasses a great deal of harmless behavior would be invalidating if that harmless behavior were constitutionally protected against abridgment, such as speech or the practice of religion.  Remaining in one place is 
				<em>
					not

				 so protected, and so (as already discussed) it is up to the citizens of Chicagonot usto decide whether the trade-off is worth it.

				The Court also assertsin apparent contradiction to the passage just quotedthat the apparent purpose test is too elastic because it presumably allows police officers to treat

				 violations as not warranting enforcement.

The problem, of course, well recognized by Chicagos City Council, is that the gang members cease their intimidating and unlawful behavior under the watchful eye of police officers, but return to it as soon as the police drive away.

				The fact is that the present ordinance is entirely clear in its application, cannot be violated except with full knowledge and intent, and vests no more discretion in the police than innumerable other measures authorizing police orders to preserve the public peace and safety.  As suggested by their tortured analyses, and by their suggested solutions that bear no relation to the identified constitutional problem, the majoritys real quarrel with the Chicago Ordinance is simply that it permits (or indeed requires) too much harmless conduct by innocent citizens to be proscribed.  As 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice OConnor
				</span>
				s concurrence says with disapprobation, the ordinance applies to hundreds of thousands of persons who are 
				<em>
					not

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				But in our democratic system, how much harmless conduct to proscribe is not a judgment to be made by the courts.  So long as constitutionally guaranteed rights are not affected, and so long as the proscription has a rational basis, 
				<em>
					all sorts
				</em>
				 of perfectly harmless activity by millions of perfectly innocent people can be forbiddenriding a motorcycle without a safety helmet, for example, starting a campfire in a national forest, or selling a safe and effective drug not yet approved by the FDA.  All of these acts are entirely innocent and harmless in themselves, but because of the 
				<em>
					risk
				</em>
				 of harm that they entail, the freedom to engage in them has been abridged.  The citizens of Chicago have decided that depriving themselves of the freedom to hang out with a gang member is necessary to eliminate pervasive gang crime and intimidationand that the elimination of the one is worth the deprivation of the other.  This Court has no business second-guessing either the degree of necessity or the fairness of the trade.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">756</a> (1974)
 (One to whose con-duct a statute clearly applies may not successfully challenge it for vagueness).  


The plurality asserts that in United States v. Salerno, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/481/739" class="subref" title="subref">481 U. S. 739</a> (1987)
, which I discuss in text immediately following this footnote, the Court entertained a facial challenge even though the defendants . . . did not claim that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to them.  Ante, at 11, n. 22.  That is not so.  The Court made it absolutely clear in Salerno that a facial challenge requires the assertion that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid, 481 U. S., at 745 (emphasis added).  The footnoted statement upon which the plurality relies (Nor have respondents claimed that the Act is unconstitutional because of the way it was applied to the particular facts of their case, id., at 745, n. 3) was obviously meant to convey the fact that the defendants were not making, in addition to their facial challenge, an alternative as-applied challengei.e., asserting that even if the statute was not unconstitutional in all its applications it was at least unconstitutional in its particular application to them.

						 Salerno, a criminal case, repudiated the Courts statement in Kolender v. Lawson, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/461/352" class="subref" title="subref">461 U. S. 352</a>, n. 8 (1983), to the effect that a facial challenge to a criminal statute could succeed even when [the statute] could conceivably have had some valid application.  Kolender seems to have confused the standard for 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> overbreadth challenges with the standard governing facial challenges on all other grounds.  See ibid. (citing the Courts articulation of the standard for 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> overbreadth challenges from Hoffman Estates, supra, at 494).  As Salerno noted, 481 U. S., at 745, the overbreadth doctrine is a specialized exception to the general rule for facial challenges, justified in light of the risk that an overbroad statute will chill free expression.  See, e.g., Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/413/601" class="subref" title="subref">413 U. S. 601</a>,

						 The plurality asserts that the Salerno standard for facial challenge has never been the decisive factor in any decision of this Court.  It means by that only this: in rejecting a facial challenge, the Court has never contented itself with identifying only one situation in which the challenged statute would be constitutional, but has mentioned several.  But that is not at all remarkable, and casts no doubt upon the validity of the principle that Salerno and these many other cases enunciated.  It is difficult to conceive of a statute that would be constitutional in only a single applicationand hard to resist mentioning more than one.


The plurality contends that it does not matter whether the Salerno standard is federal law, since facial challenge is a species of third-party standing, and federal limitations upon third-party standing do not apply in an appeal from a state decision which takes a broader view, as the Illinois Supreme Courts opinion did here.  Ante, at 11, n. 22.  This is quite wrong.  Disagreement over the Salerno rule is not a disagreement over the standing question of whether the person challenging the statute can raise the rights of third parties: under both Salerno and the plurality's rule he can.  The disagreement relates to how many third-party rights he must prove to be infringed by the statute before he can win: Salerno says all (in addition to his own rights), the plurality says many.  That is not a question of standing but of substantive law.  The notion that, if Salerno is the federal rule (a federal statute is not totally invalid unless it is invalid in all its applications), it can be altered by a state court (a federal statute is totally invalid if it is invalid in many of its applications), and that that alteration must be accepted by the Supreme Court of the United States is, to put it as gently as possible, remarkable.

						 The pluralitys explanation for ignoring these laws is that many of them carried severe penalties and, during the Reconstruction era, they had harsh consequences on African-American women and children.  Ante, at 910, n. 20.  Those severe penalties and those harsh consequences are certainly regrettable, but they in no way lessen (indeed, the harshness of penalty tends to increase) the capacity of these laws to prove that loitering was never regarded as a fundamental liberty.

						 Ante, at 9, n. 19.  The plurality bases its assertion of apparent concession upon a footnote in Part I of petitioners brief which reads: Of course, laws regulating social gatherings affect a liberty interest, and thus are subject to review under the rubric of substantive due process . . . . We address that doctrine in Part II below.  Brief for Petitioner 2122, n. 14.  If a careless reader were inclined to confuse the term social gatherings in this passage with loitering, his confusion would be eliminated by pursuing the reference to Part II of the brief, which says, in its introductory paragraph: [A]s we explain below, substantive due process does not support the courts novel holding that the Constitution secures the right to stand still on the public way even when one is not engaged in speech, assembly, or other conduct that enjoys affirmative constitutional protection.  Id., at 39.

						 The plurality says, ante, at 20, n. 35, that since it decides the case on the basis of procedural due process rather than substantive due process, I am mistaken in analyzing its opinion under the framework for substantive due process set out in Washington v. Glucksberg.  Ibid.  But I am not analyzing it under that framework.  I am simply assuming that when the plurality says (as an essential part of its reasoning) that the right to loiter for innocent purposes is . . . a part of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause it does not believe that the same word (liberty) means one thing for purposes of substantive due process and something else for purposes of procedural due process.  There is no authority for that startling proposition.  See Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/408/564" class="subref" title="subref">408 U. S. 564</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">572</a>575 (1972)
 (rejecting procedural-due-process claim for lack of liberty interest, and citing substantive-due-process cases).


The pluralitys opinion seeks to have it both ways, invoking the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>s august protection of liberty in defining the standard of certainty that it sets, but then, in identifying the conduct protected by that high standard, ignoring our extensive case-law defining liberty, and substituting, instead, all harmless and innocent conduct, ante, at 14.

						 I call it a suggestion because the plurality says only that the terms of the dispersal order compound the inadequacy of the notice, and acknowledges that they might not render the ordinance unconstitutionally vague if the definition of the forbidden conduct were clear.  Ante, at 15, 16.  This notion that a prescription (Disperse!) which is itself not unconstitutionally vague can somehow contribute to the unconstitutional vagueness of the entire scheme is full of mysterysuspending, as it does, the metaphysical principle that nothing can confer what it does not possess (nemo dat qui non habet).

						 Administrative interpretation and implementation of a regulation are … highly relevant to our [vagueness] analysis, for [i]n evaluating a facial challenge to a state law, a federal court must … consider any limiting construction that a state court or enforcement agency has proffered.   Ward v.

						 Justice Breyer asserts that one always has some apparent purpose, so that the policeman must interpret the words no apparent purpose as meaning no apparent purpose except for . . . .  Ante, at 12.  It is simply not true that one always has some apparent purposeand especially not true that one always has some apparent purpose in remaining at rest, for the simple reason that one often (indeed, perhaps usually) has no actual purpose in remaining at rest.  Remaining at rest will be a persons normal state, unless he has a purpose which causes him to move.  That is why one frequently reads of a persons wandering aimlessly (which is worthy of note) but not of a persons sitting aimlessly (which is not remarkable at all).  And that is why a synonym for purpose is motive: that which causes one to move.

						 The Court also speculates that a police officer may exercise his discretion to enforce the Ordinance and direct dispersal when (in the Courts view) the Ordinance is inapplicableviz., where there is an apparent purpose, but it is an unlawful one.  See ante, at 18.  No one in his right mind would read the phrase without any apparent purpose to mean anything other than without any apparent lawful purpose.  The implication that acts referred to approvingly in statutory language are lawful acts is routine.  The Court asserts that the Illinois Supreme Court has forced it into this interpretive inanity because, since it has not placed any limiting construction on the language in the ordinance, we must assume that the ordinance means what it says . . . .  Ante, at 19.  But the Illinois Supreme Court did not mention this particular interpretive issue, which has nothing to do with giving the Ordinance a limiting interpretation, and everything to do with giving it its ordinary legal meaning.

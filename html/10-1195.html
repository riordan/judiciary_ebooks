        <hr>
        <p class="bodytext">Consumer complaints about abuses of telephone technology—for example, computerized calls to private homes—prompted Congress to pass the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA or Act),
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/47/227.html" class="subref" title="subref">47 U. S. C. §227</a>.  Congress determined that federal legislation was needed because telemarketers, by operating interstate, were escaping state-law prohibitions on intrusive nuisance calls.  The Act bans certain invasive telemarketing practices and directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to prescribe implementing regulations.  It authorizes States to bring civil actions to enjoin prohibited practices and recover damages on their residents’ behalf,
47 U. S. C. A. §227(g)(1) (Supp. 2011), and provides that jurisdiction over these state-initiated suits lies exclusively in the U. S. district courts, §227(g)(2).  It also permits a private person to seek redress for violations of the Act or regulations “in an appropriate court of [a] State,” “if [such an action is] otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of [that] State.”  47 U. S. C. §§227(b)(3), (c)(5).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            
        
            
        Petitioner Mims filed a damages action in Federal District Court, alleging that respondent Arrow, seeking to collect a debt, violated the TCPA by repeatedly using an automatic telephone dialing system or prerecorded or artificial voice to call Mims’s cellular phone without his consent.  Mims invoked the court’s “federal question” jurisdiction, <em>i.e.</em>, its authority to adjudicate claims “arising under the . . . laws . . . of the United States,”
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1331.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1331</a>.  The District Court, affirmed by the Eleventh Circuit, dismissed Mims’s complaint for want of subject-matter jurisdiction, concluding that the TCPA had vested jurisdiction over private actions exclusively in state courts.</p>
        <p class="SYLCTE">
            <em>Held: </em>The TCPA’s permissive grant of jurisdiction to state courts does not deprive the U. S. district courts of federal-question jurisdiction over private TCPA suits.  Pp. 7–18.</p>
        <p class="SYLCTF">
            
        (a) Because federal law creates the right of action and provides the rules of decision, Mims’s TCPA claim, in §1331’s words, plainly “aris[es] under” the “laws . . . of the United States.”  Arrow agrees that this action arises under federal law, but urges that Congress vested exclusive adjudicatory authority over private TCPA actions in state courts.  In cases “arising under” federal law, there is a presumption of concurrent state-court jurisdiction, rebuttable if “Congress affirmatively ousts the state courts of jurisdiction over a particular federal claim.”  <em>Tafflin</em> v. <em>Levitt</em>,
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/493/455" class="subref" title="subref">493 U. S. 455</a>–459.  Arrow acknowledges the presumption, but maintains that §1331 creates no converse presumption in favor of federal-court jurisdiction.  Instead, Arrow urges, the TCPA, a later, more specific statute, displaces §1331, an earlier, more general prescription.  </p>
        <p class="SYLCTF">
            
        Section 1331 is not swept away so easily.  The principle that district courts possess federal-question jurisdiction under §1331 when federal law creates a private right of action and furnishes the substantive rules of decision endures unless Congress divests federal courts of their §1331 adjudicatory authority.  See, <em>e.g.,</em>
            <em>Verizon Md. Inc.</em> v. <em>Public Serv. Comm’n of Md.</em>,
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/535/635" class="subref" title="subref">535 U. S. 635</a>.  Accordingly, the District Court retains §1331 jurisdiction over Mims’s complaint unless the TCPA, expressly or by fair implication, excludes federal-court adjudication.  See <em>id., </em>at 644.  Pp. 7–10.</p>
        <p class="SYLCTF">
            
        (b) Arrow’s arguments do not persuade this Court that Congress eliminated §1331 jurisdiction over private TCPA actions.  Title
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/47/227.html#b_3" class="subref" title="subref">47 U. S. C. §227(b)(3)</a>’s language may be state-court oriented, but “the grant of jurisdiction to one court does not, of itself, imply that the jurisdiction is to be exclusive,” <em>United States</em> v. <em>Bank of New York &amp; Trust Co.</em>,
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/296/463" class="subref" title="subref">296 U. S. 463</a>.  Nothing in §227(b)(3)’s permissive language makes state-court jurisdiction exclusive, or otherwise purports to oust federal courts of their §1331 jurisdiction.  The provision does not state that a private plaintiff may bring a TCPA action “only” or “exclusively” in state court.  In contrast,
47 U. S. C. A. §227(g)(2) (Supp. 2011) vests “exclusive jurisdiction” over state-initiated TCPA suits in the federal courts.  Section 227(g)(2)’s exclusivity prescription “reinforce[s] the conclusion that [
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/47/227.html#b_3" class="subref" title="subref">47 U. S. C. §227(b)(3)</a>’s] silence . . . leaves the jurisdictional grant of §1331 untouched.  For where otherwise applicable jurisdiction was meant to be excluded, it was excluded expressly.”  <em>Verizon Md.</em>, 535 U. S., at 644.  </p>
        <p class="SYLCTF">
            
        Arrow argues that Congress had no reason to provide for a private action “in an appropriate [state] court,” §227(b)(3), if it did not mean to make the state forum exclusive, for state courts would have concurrent jurisdiction even if Congress had said nothing at all.  But, as already noted, Congress had simultaneously made federal-court jurisdiction exclusive in TCPA enforcement actions brought by state authorities, see
47 U. S. C. A. §227(g)(2) (Supp. 2011), and may simply have wanted to avoid any argument that federal jurisdiction was also exclusive for private actions.  Moreover, by providing that private actions may be brought in state court “if otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of [the] State,”
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/47/227.html#b_3" class="subref" title="subref">47 U. S. C. §227(b)(3)</a>, Congress arguably gave States leeway they would otherwise lack to decide whether to entertain TCPA claims.</p>
        <p class="SYLCTF">
            
        Arrow further asserts that making state-court jurisdiction over §227(b)(3) claims exclusive serves Congress’ objective of enabling States to control telemarketers whose interstate operations evaded state law.  Even so, jurisdiction conferred by
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1331.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1331</a> should hold firm against “mere implication flowing from subsequent legislation.”  <em>Colorado River Water Conservation Dist.</em> v. <em>United States</em>,
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/424/800" class="subref" title="subref">424 U. S. 800</a>, n. 15.  Furthermore, had Congress sought only to fill a gap in the States’ enforcement capabilities, it could have provided that out-of-state telemarketing calls directed into a State would be subject to the receiving State’s laws.  Instead, Congress enacted detailed, uniform, federal substantive prescriptions and provided for a regulatory regime administered by a federal agency.  </p>
        <p class="SYLCTF">
            
        Arrow’s reliance on a statement by Senator Hollings, the TCPA’s sponsor, is misplaced.  The remarks nowhere mention federal-court jurisdiction or otherwise suggest that
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/47/227.html#b_3" class="subref" title="subref">47 U. S. C. §227(b)(3)</a> is intended to divest federal courts of authority over TCPA claims.  Even if Hollings and other TCPA supporters expected private actions to proceed solely in state courts, their expectation would not control this Court’s judgment on §1331’s compass.  Arrow’s arguments that federal courts will be inundated by $500-per-violation TCPA claims or that defendants could use federal-court removal to force small-claims-court plaintiffs to abandon suit seem more imaginary than real.

				This case concerns enforcement, through private suits, of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA or Act), 
47 U. S. C. §227.  Voluminous consumer complaints about abuses of telephone technology—for example, computerized calls dispatched to private homes—prompted Congress to pass the TCPA.  Congress de- termined that federal legislation was needed because telemarketers, by operating interstate, were escaping state-law prohibitions on intrusive nuisance calls.  The Act bans certain practices invasive of privacy and directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission) to prescribe implementing regulations.  It authorizes States to bring civil actions to enjoin prohibited practices and to recover damages on their residents’ behalf.  The Commission must be notified of such suits and may intervene in them.  Jurisdiction over state-initiated TCPA suits, Congress provided, lies exclusively in the U. S. district courts.  Congress also provided for civil actions by private parties seeking redress for violations of the TCPA or of the Commission’s implementing regulations.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Petitioner Marcus D. Mims, complaining of multiple violations of the Act by respondent Arrow Financial Services, LLC (Arrow), a debt-collection agency, commenced an action for damages against Arrow in the U. S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.  Mims invoked the court’s “federal question” jurisdiction, i.e., its authority to adjudicate claims “arising under the . . . laws . . . of the United States,” 
28 U. S. C. §1331.  The District Court, affirmed by the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, dismissed Mims’s complaint for want of subject-matter jurisdiction.  Both courts relied on Congress’ specification, in the TCPA, that a private person may seek redress for violations of the Act (or of the Commission’s regulations thereunder) “in an appropriate court of [a] State,” “if [such an action is] otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of [that] State.”  47 U. S. C. §§227(b)(3), (c)(5).

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The question presented is whether Congress’ provision for private actions to enforce the TCPA renders state courts the exclusive arbiters of such actions.  We have long recognized that “[a] suit arises under the law that creates the cause of action.”  American Well Works Co. v. Layne &amp; Bowler Co., 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/241/257" class="subref" title="subref">241 U. S. 257</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">260</a> (1916)
.  Beyond doubt, the TCPA is a federal law that both creates the claim Mims has brought and supplies the substantive rules that will govern the case.  We find no convincing reason to read into the TCPA’s permissive grant of jurisdiction to state courts any barrier to the U. S. district courts’ exercise of the general federal-question jurisdiction they have possessed since 1875.  See Act of Mar. 3, 1875, §1, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">18</a>Stat.
470; 13D C. Wright, A. Miller, E. Cooper, &amp; R. Freer, Federal Practice and Procedure §3561, p. 163 (3d ed. 2008) (hereinafter Wright &amp; Miller).  We hold, therefore, that federal and state courts have concurrent jurisdiction over private suits arising under the TCPA.

				In enacting the TCPA, Congress made several findings relevant here.  “Unrestricted telemarketing,” Congress determined, “can be an intrusive invasion of privacy.”  TCPA, 105 Stat.  2394, note following 
47 U. S. C. §227 (Congressional Findings) (internal quotation marks omitted).  In particular, Congress reported, “[m]any consumers are outraged over the proliferation of intrusive, nuisance [telemarketing] calls to their homes.”  Ibid.  (internal quotation marks omitted).  “[A]utomated or prerecorded telephone calls” made to private residences, Congress found, were rightly regarded by recipients as “an invasion of privacy.”  Ibid.  (internal quotation marks omitted).  Although over half the States had enacted statutes restricting telemarketing, Congress believed that federal law was needed because “telemarketers [could] evade [state-law] prohibitions through interstate operations.”  Ibid.  (internal quotation marks omitted).  See also S. Rep. No. 102–178, p. 3 (1991) (“[B]ecause States do not have jurisdiction over interstate calls[,] [m]any States have expressed a desire for Federal legislation . . . .”).

				Subject to exceptions not pertinent here, the TCPA prin- cipally outlaws four practices.  First, the Act makes it unlawful to use an automatic telephone dialing system or an artificial or prerecorded voice message, without the prior express consent of the called party, to call any emergency telephone line, hospital patient, pager, cellular telephone, or other service for which the receiver is charged for the call.  See 
47 U. S. C. §227(b)(1)(A).  Sec-ond, the TCPA forbids using artificial or prerecorded voice messages to call residential telephone lines with- out prior express consent.  §227(b)(1)(B).  Third, the Act proscribes sending unsolicited advertisements to fax machines.  §227(b)(1)(C).  Fourth, it bans using automatic telephone dialing systems to engage two or more of a business’ telephone lines simultaneously.  §227(b)(1)(D).

				The TCPA delegates authority to the FCC to ban ar- tificial and prerecorded voice calls to businesses, §227(b)(2)(A), and to exempt particular types of calls from the law’s requirements, §§227(b)(2)(B), (C).  The Act also directs the FCC to prescribe regulations to protect the privacy of residential telephone subscribers, possibly through the creation of a national “do not call” system.  §227(c).

As earlier noted, see supra, at 4, 47 U. S. C. A. §227(g)(2) (Supp. 2011) vests “exclusive jurisdiction over [such] actions” in “[t]he district courts of the United States.”

				Arrow urges that Congress would have had no reason to provide for a private action “in an appropriate [state] court,” §227(b)(3), if it did not mean to make the state forum exclusive.  Had Congress said nothing at all about bringing private TCPA claims in state courts, Arrow observes, those courts would nevertheless have concurrent jurisdiction.  See supra, at 9.  True enough, but Con- gress had simultaneously provided for TCPA enforcement actions by state authorities, 47 U. S. C. A. §227(g) (Supp. 2011), and had made federal district courts exclusively competent in such cases, §227(g)(2).  Congress may simply have wanted to avoid any argument that in private actions, as in actions brought by State Attorneys General, “federal jurisdiction is exclusive.”  Brill, 427 F. 3d, at 451 (emphasis deleted) (citing Yellow Freight, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/494/820" class="subref" title="subref">494 U. S. 820</a> (holding, after 26 years of litigation, that claims under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 may be resolved in state as well as federal courts) and Tafflin,

Moreover, by providing that private actions may be brought in state court “if otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of [the] State,” 
47 U. S. C. §227(b)(3), Congress arguably gave States leeway they would otherwise lack to “decide for [themselves] whether to entertain claims under the [TCPA],” Brill, 427 F. 3d, at 451.  See Brief for Respondent 16 (Congress “le[ft] States free to decide what TCPA claims to allow.”).

				We are not persuaded, moreover, that Congress sought only to fill a gap in the States’ enforcement capabilities.  Had Congress so limited its sights, it could have passed a statute providing that out-of-state telemarketing calls directed into a State would be subject to the laws of the receiving State.  Congress did not enact such a law.  Instead, it enacted detailed, uniform, federal substantive prescriptions and provided for a regulatory regime administered by a federal agency.  See 
47 U. S. C. §227.  TCPA liability thus depends on violation of a federal statutory requirement or an FCC regulation, §§227(b)(3)(A), (c)(5), not on a violation of any state substantive law.

				“The substitute bill contains a private right-of-action provision that will make it easier for consumers to recover damages from receiving these computerized calls.  The provision would allow consumers to bring an action in State court against any entity that violates the bill.  The bill does not, because of constitutional constraints, dictate to the States which court in each State shall be the proper venue for such an action, as this is a matter for State legislators to determine.  Nevertheless, it is my hope that States will make it as easy as possible for consumers to bring such actions, preferably in small claims court. . . .

				“Small claims court or a similar court would allow the consumer to appear before the court without an attorney.  The amount of damages in this legislation is set to be fair to both the consumer and the telemarketer.  However, it would defeat the purposes of the bill if the attorneys’ costs to consumers of bringing an action were greater than the potential damages.  I thus expect that the States will act reasonably in permitting their citizens to go to court to enforce this bill.”  137 Cong. Rec. 30821–30822 (1991).

.  Second, Senator Hollings did not mention federal-court jurisdiction or otherwise suggest that 
47 U. S. C. §227(b)(3) is intended to divest federal courts of authority to hear TCPA claims.  Hollings no doubt believed that mine-run TCPA claims would be pursued most expeditiously in state small-claims court.

				  But one cannot glean from his statement any expectation that those courts, or state courts generally, would have exclusive jurisdiction over private actions alleging violations of the Act or of the FCC’s implementing regulations.  Third, even if we agreed with Arrow that Senator Hollings expected private TCPA actions to proceed solely in state courts, and even if other supporters shared his view, that expectation would not control our judgment on 
28 U. S. C. §1331’s compass.  Cf. Yellow Freight, 494 U. S., at 826 (“persuasive showing that most legislators, judges, and administrators . . . involved in the enactment, amendment, enforcement, and interpretation of Title VII expected that such litiga- tion would be processed exclusively in federal courts” did not overcome presumption of concurrent state-court jurisdiction).

				Among its arguments for state-court exclusivity, Arrow raises a concern about the impact on federal courts were we to uphold §1331 jurisdiction over private actions under the TCPA.  “[G]iven the enormous volume of telecommunications presenting potential claims,” Arrow projects, federal courts could be inundated by $500-per-violation TCPA claims.  Brief for Respondent 33.  “Moreover, if plaintiffs are free to bring TCPA claims in federal court under §1331, then defendants sued in state court would be equally free to remove those cases to federal court under 
28 U. S. C. §1441.”  Id., at 22–23.  Indeed, Arrow suggests, defendants could use removal as a mechanism to force small-claims-court plaintiffs to abandon suit rather than “figh[t] it out” in the “more expensive federal forum.”  Id., at 23.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Arrow’s floodgates argument assumes “a shocking degree of noncompliance” with the Act, Reply Brief 11, and seems to us more imaginary than real.  The current fed- eral district court civil filing fee is $350.  
28 U. S. C. §1914(a).  How likely is it that a party would bring a $500 claim in, or remove a $500 claim to, federal court?  Lexis and Westlaw searches turned up 65 TCPA claims removed to federal district courts in Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin since the Seventh Circuit held, in October 2005, that the Act does not confer exclusive jurisdiction on state courts.  All 65 cases were class actions, not individual cases removed from small-claims court.

				Nothing in the text, structure, purpose, or legislative history of the TCPA calls for displacement of the federal-question jurisdiction U. S. district courts ordinarily have under 
28 U. S. C. §1331.  In the absence of direction from Congress stronger than any Arrow has advanced, we apply the familiar default rule: Federal courts have §1331 jurisdiction over claims that arise under federal law.  Because federal law gives rise to the claim for relief Mims has stated and specifies the substantive rules of decision, the Eleventh Circuit erred in dismissing Mims’s case for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.

						 For a rare exception to the rule that a federal cause of action suffices to ground federal-question jurisdiction, see Shoshone Mining Co. v. Rutter, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/177/505" class="subref" title="subref">177 U. S. 505</a> (1900)

In Shoshone Mining, we held that a suit for a federal mining patent did not arise under federal law for jurisdictional purposes because “the right of possession” in controversy could be determined by “local rules or customs, or state statutes,” 177 U. S., at 509, or “may present simply a question of fact,” id., at 510.  Here, by contrast, the TCPA not only creates the claim for relief and designates the remedy; critically, the Act and regulations thereunder supply the governing substantive law.

						 Even when a right of action is created by state law, if the claim requires resolution of significant issues of federal law, the case may arise under federal law for

						 For TCPA actions brought by State Attorneys General, or “an[other] official or agency designated by a State,” 47 U. S. C. A. §227(g)(1) (Supp. 2011), Arrow points out, Congress specifically addressed venue, service of process, §227(g)(4), and potential conflicts between federal and state enforcement efforts, §227(g)(7).  No similar prescriptions appear in the section on private actions, 
47 U. S. C. §227(b)(3), for this obvious reason:
“[As] the general rules governing venue and service of process in the district courts are well established, see 
28 U. S. C. §1391(b); Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 4, 4.1, there was no need for Congress to reiterate them in section 227(b)(3).  The fact that venue and service of process are discussed in [47 U. S. C. A. §227(g)(4) (Supp. 2011)] and not [47 U. S. C. §]227(b)(3) simply indicates that Congress wished to make adjustments to the general rules in the former section and not the latter.  As for the conflict provision that appears in section [47 U. S. C. A. §227(g) (Supp. 2011)] but not [47 U. S. C. §]227(b)(3), it is hardly surprising that Congress would be concerned about agency conflicts in the section of the TCPA dealing with official state enforcement efforts but not in the section governing private lawsuits.”  ErieNet, Inc. v. Velocity Net, Inc., 156 F. 3d 513, 523 (CA3 1998) (Alito, J., dissenting).

						 The Supremacy Clause declares federal law the “supreme law of the land,” and state courts must enforce it “in the absence of a valid excuse.”  Howlett v. Rose, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/496/356" class="subref" title="subref">496 U. S. 356</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">370</a>, n. 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">16</a> (1990)
.  “An excuse that is inconsistent with or violates federal law is not a valid excuse: The Supremacy Clause forbids state courts to dissociate themselves from federal law because of disagreement with its content or a refusal to recognize the superior authority of its source.”  Id., at 371.  Without the “if otherwise permitted” language, 
47 U. S. C. §227(b)(3), there is little doubt that state courts would be obliged to hear TCPA claims.  See Testa v. Katt, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/330/386" class="subref" title="subref">330 U. S. 386</a>,

						 Although all courts of appeals to have considered the question have held that the TCPA does not bar district courts from exercising diver-sity jurisdiction under 
28 U. S. C. §1332, see, e.g., Gottlieb v. Carnival Corp., 436 F. 3d 335 (CA2 2006), at oral argument, Arrow’s counsel maintained that diversity jurisdiction “should go, too,” Tr. of Oral Arg. 39.  Were we to accept Arrow’s positions that diversity and federal-question jurisdiction are unavailable, and that state courts may refuse to hear TCPA claims, residents of States that choose not to hear TCPA claims would have no forum in which to sue.

						 The complaint in this very case, we note, could not have been brought in small-claims court.  Mims alleged some 12 calls, and sought treble damages ($1,500) for each.  See App. 9–14; Tr. of Oral Arg. 12.  The amount he sought to recover far exceeded the $5,000 ceiling on claims a Florida small-claims court can adjudicate.  See Fla. Small Claims Rule 7.010(b) (rev. ed. 2011).

        This case concerns enforcement, through private suits, of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA or Act),
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/47/227.html" class="subref" title="subref">47 U. S. C. §227</a>.  Voluminous consumer complaints about abuses of telephone technology—for example, computerized calls dispatched to private homes—prompted Congress to pass the TCPA.  Congress de-termined that federal legislation was needed because telemarketers, by operating interstate, were escaping state-law prohibitions on intrusive nuisance calls.  The Act bans certain practices invasive of privacy and directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission) to prescribe implementing regulations.  It authorizes States to bring civil actions to enjoin prohibited practices and to recover damages on their residents’ behalf.  The Commission must be notified of such suits and may intervene in them.  Jurisdiction over state-initiated TCPA suits, Congress provided, lies exclusively in the U. S. district courts.  Congress also provided for civil actions by private parties seeking redress for violations of the TCPA or of the Commission’s implementing regulations.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            
        Petitioner Marcus D. Mims, complaining of multiple violations of the Act by respondent Arrow Financial Services, LLC (Arrow), a debt-collection agency, commenced an action for damages against Arrow in the U. S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.  Mims invoked the court’s “federal question” jurisdiction, <em>i.e.</em>, its authority to adjudicate claims “arising under the . . . laws . . . ofthe United States,”
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1331.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1331</a>.  The District Court, affirmed by the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, dismissed Mims’s complaint for want of subject-matter jurisdiction.  Both courts relied on Congress’ specification, in the TCPA, that a private person may seek redress for violations of the Act (or of the Commission’s regulations thereunder) “in an appropriate court of [a] State,” “if [such an action is] otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of [that] State.”  47 U. S. C. §§227(b)(3), (c)(5).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            
        The question presented is whether Congress’ provision for private actions to enforce the TCPA renders state courts the <em>exclusive </em>arbiters of such actions.  We have long recognized that “[a] suit arises under the law that creates the cause of action.”  <em>American Well Works Co.</em> v. <em>Layne &amp; Bowler Co.</em>,
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/241/257" class="subref" title="subref">241 U. S. 257</a>,
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">260</a> (1916)
.  Beyond doubt, the TCPA is a federal law that both creates the claim Mims has brought and supplies the substantive rules that will govern the case.  We find no convincing reason to read into the TCPA’s permissive grant of jurisdiction to state courts any barrier to the U. S. district courts’ exercise of the general federal-question jurisdiction they have possessed since 1875.  See Act of Mar. 3, 1875, §1,
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">18</a>Stat.
470; 13D C. Wright, A. Miller, E. Cooper, &amp; R. Freer, Federal Practice and Procedure §3561, p. 163 (3d ed. 2008) (hereinafter Wright &amp; Miller).  We hold, therefore, that federal and state courts have concurrent jurisdiction over private suits arising under the TCPA.</p>

        In enacting the TCPA, Congress made several findings relevant here.  “Unrestricted telemarketing,” Congress determined, “can be an intrusive invasion of privacy.”  TCPA, 105 Stat.  2394, note following

        Subject to exceptions not pertinent here, the TCPA prin-cipally outlaws four practices.  First, the Act makes it unlawful to use an automatic telephone dialing systemor an artificial or prerecorded voice message, without the prior express consent of the called party, to call any emergency telephone line, hospital patient, pager, cellular telephone, or other service for which the receiver is charged for the call.  See

        Arrow agrees that this action arises under federal law, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 27, but urges that Congress vested exclusive adjudicatory authority over private TCPA actions in state courts.

        Arrow urges that Congress would have had no reason to provide for a private action “in an appropriate [state] court,” §227(b)(3), if it did not mean to make the state forum exclusive.  Had Congress said nothing at all about bringing private TCPA claims in state courts, Arrow observes, those courts would nevertheless have concurrent jurisdiction.  See<em> supra,</em> at 9.  True enough, but Con-gress had simultaneously provided for TCPA enforcement actions by state authorities, 47 U. S. C. A. §227(g) (Supp. 2011), and had made federal district courts exclusively competent in such cases, §227(g)(2).

The provision would allow consumers to bring an action in State court against any entity that violates the bill.  The bill does not, because of constitutional constraints, dictate to the States which court in each State shall be the proper venue for such an action, as this is a matter for State legislators to determine.

Third, even if we agreed with Arrow that Senator Hollings expected private TCPA actions to proceed solely in state courts, and even if other supporters shared his view, that expectation would not control our judgment on

        Among its arguments for state-court exclusivity, Arrow raises a concern about the impact on federal courts were we to uphold §1331 jurisdiction over private actions under the TCPA.  “[G]iven the enormous volume of telecommunications presenting potential claims,” Arrow projects, federal courts could be inundated by $500-per-violation TCPA claims.  Brief for Respondent 33.  “Moreover, if plaintiffs are free to bring TCPA claims in federal court under §1331, then defendants sued in state court would be equally free to remove those cases to federal court under

Indeed, Arrow suggests, defendants could use removal as a mechanism to force small-claims-court plaintiffs to abandon suit rather than “figh[t] it out” in the “more expensive federal forum.”  <em>Id.,</em> at 23.</p>

        Arrow’s floodgates argument assumes “a shocking degree of noncompliance” with the Act, Reply Brief 11, and seems to us more imaginary than real.  The current fed-eral district court civil filing fee is $350.

				Illinois State Trooper Daniel Gillette stopped respondent for speeding on an interstate highway.  When Gillette radioed the police dispatcher to report the stop, a second trooper, Craig Graham, a member of the Illinois State Police Drug Interdiction Team, overheard the transmission and immediately headed for the scene with his narcotics-detection dog.  When they arrived, respondents car was on the shoulder of the road and respondent was in Gillettes vehicle.  While Gillette was in the process of writing a warning ticket, Graham walked his dog around respondents car.  The dog alerted at the trunk.  Based on that alert, the officers searched the trunk, found marijuana, and arrested respondent.  The entire incident lasted less than 10 minutes.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Respondent was convicted of a narcotics offense and sentenced to 12 years imprisonment and a $256,136 fine.  The trial judge denied his motion to suppress the seized evidence and to quash his arrest.  He held that the officers had not unnecessarily prolonged the stop and that the dog alert was sufficiently reliable to provide probable cause to conduct the search.  Although the Appellate Court affirmed, the Illinois Supreme Court reversed, concluding that because the canine sniff was performed without any  specific and articulable facts  to suggest drug activity, the use of the dog unjustifiably enlarg[ed] the scope of a routine traffic stop into a drug investigation.  207 Ill. 2d 504, 510, 802 N.

				Illinois State Trooper Daniel Gillette stopped respondent for speeding on an interstate highway.  When Gillette radioed the police dispatcher to report the stop, a second trooper, Craig Graham, a member of the Illinois State Police Drug Interdiction Team, overheard the transmission and immediately headed for the scene with his narcotics-detection dog.  When they arrived, respondents car was on the shoulder of the road and respondent was in Gillettes vehicle.  While Gillette was in the process of writing a warning ticket, Graham walked his dog around respondents car.  The dog alerted at the trunk.  Based on that alert, the officers searched the trunk, found marijuana, and arrested respondent.  The entire incident lasted less than 10 minutes.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Respondent was convicted of a narcotics offense and sentenced to 12 years imprisonment and a $256,136 fine.  The trial judge denied his motion to suppress the seized evidence and to quash his arrest.  He held that the officers had not unnecessarily prolonged the stop and that the dog alert was sufficiently reliable to provide probable cause to conduct the search.  Although the Appellate Court affirmed, the Illinois Supreme Court reversed, concluding that because the canine sniff was performed without any  specific and articulable facts  to suggest drug activity, the use of the dog unjustifiably enlarg[ed] the scope of a routine traffic stop into a drug investigation.  207 Ill. 2d 504, 510, 802 N.

				Here, the initial seizure of respondent when he was stopped on the highway was based on probable cause, and was concededly lawful.  It is nevertheless clear that a seizure that is lawful at its inception can violate the

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">124</a> (1984)
.  A seizure that is justified solely by the interest in issuing a warning ticket to the driver can become unlawful if it is prolonged beyond the time reasonably required to complete that mission.  In an earlier case involving a dog sniff that occurred during an unreasonably prolonged traffic stop, the Illinois Supreme Court held that use of the dog and the subsequent discovery of contraband were the product of an unconstitutional seizure.

				 v.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In the state-court proceedings, however, the judges carefully reviewed the details of Officer Gillettes conversations with respondent and the precise timing of his radio transmissions to the dispatcher to determine whether he had improperly extended the duration of the stop to enable the dog sniff to occur.  We have not recounted those details because we accept the state courts conclusion that the duration of the stop in this case was entirely justified by the traffic offense and the ordinary inquiries incident to such a stop.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Despite this conclusion, the Illinois Supreme Court held that the initially lawful traffic stop became an unlawful seizure solely as a result of the canine sniff that occurred outside respondents stopped car.  That is, the court characterized the dog sniff as the cause rather than the consequence of a constitutional violation.  In its view, the use of the dog converted the citizen-police encounter from a lawful traffic stop into a drug investigation, and because the shift in purpose was not supported by any reasonable suspicion that respondent possessed narcotics, it was unlawful.  In our view, conducting a dog sniff would not change the character of a traffic stop that is lawful at its inception and otherwise executed in a reasonable manner, unless the dog sniff itself infringed respondents constitutionally protected interest in privacy.  Our cases hold that it did not.

				The infallible dog, however, is a creature of legal fiction.  Although the Supreme Court of Illinois did not get into the sniffing averages of drug dogs, their supposed infallibility is belied by judicial opinions describing well-trained animals sniffing and alerting with less than perfect accuracy, whether owing to errors by their handlers, the limitations of the dogs themselves, or even the pervasive contamination of currency by cocaine.  See, 
				<em>

Indeed, a study cited by Illinois in this case for the proposition that dog sniffs are generally reliable shows that dogs in artificial testing situations return false positives anywhere from 12.5 to 60% of the time, depending on the length of the search.  See Reply Brief for Petitioner 13; K. Garner et al., Duty Cycle of the Detector Dog: A Baseline Study 12 (Apr. 2001) (prepared under Federal Aviation Administration grant by the Institute for Biological Detection Systems of Auburn University).  In practical terms, the evidence is clear that the dog that alerts hundreds of times will be wrong dozens of times.

				Once the dogs fallibility is recognized, however, that ends the justification claimed in 
				<em>
					Place
				</em>
				 for treating the sniff as 
				<em>
					sui generis
				</em>
				 under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>: the sniff alert does not necessarily signal hidden contraband, and opening the container or enclosed space whose emanations the dog has sensed will not necessarily reveal contraband or any other evidence of crime.  This is not, of course, to deny that a dogs reaction may provide reasonable suspicion, or probable cause, to search the container or enclosure; the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> does not demand certainty of success to justify a search for evidence or contraband.  The point is simply that the sniff and alert cannot claim the certainty that 
				<em>
					Place
				</em>
				 assumed, both in treating the deliberate use of sniffing dogs as 
				<em>
					sui generis 
				</em>
				and then taking that characterization as a reason to say they are not searches subject to 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> scrutiny.  And when that aura of uniqueness disappears, there is no basis in 
				<em>
					Place
				</em>
				s reasoning, and no good reason otherwise, to ignore the actual function that dog sniffs perform.  They are conducted to obtain information about the contents of private spaces beyond anything that human senses could perceive, even when conventionally enhanced.  The information is not provided by independent third parties beyond the reach of constitutional limitations, but gathered by the governments own officers in order to justify searches of the traditional sort, which may or may not reveal evidence of crime but will disclose anything meant to be kept private in the area searched.  Thus in practice the governments use of a trained narcotics dog functions as a limited search to reveal undisclosed facts about private enclosures, to be used to justify a further and complete search of the enclosed area.  And given the fallibility of the dog, the sniff is the first step in a process that may disclose intimate details without revealing contraband, just as a thermal-imaging device might do, as described in 
				<em>
					Kyllo
				</em>
				 v.

					United States,

				 this sniff search must stand or fall on its being ancillary to the traffic stop that led up to it.  It is true that the police had probable cause to stop the car for an offense committed in the officers presence, which Caballes concedes could have justified his arrest.  See Brief for Respondent 31.  There is no occasion to consider authority incident to arrest, however, see

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> search occurred when federal agents analyzed powder they had already lawfully obtained.  The Court noted that because the test could only reveal whether the powder was cocaine, the owner had no legitimate privacy interest at stake.  466 U. S., at 123.  As already explained, however, the use of a sniffing dog in cases like this is significantly different and properly treated as a search that does indeed implicate

But in the case of the dog sniff, the dog does not smell the disclosed contraband; it smells a closed container.  An affirmative reaction therefore does not identify a substance the police already legitimately possess, but informs the police instead merely of a reasonable chance of finding contraband they have yet to put their hands on.  The police will then open the container and discover whatever lies within, be it marijuana or the owners private papers.  Thus, while 
				<em>
					Jacobsen
				</em>
				 could rely on the assumption that the enquiry in question would either show with certainty that a known substance was contraband or would reveal nothing more, both the certainty and the limit on disclosure that may follow are missing when the dog sniffs the car.

						 Kyllo was concerned with whether a search occurred when the police used a thermal-imaging device on a house to detect heat emanations associated with high-powered marijuana-growing lamps.  In concluding that using the device was a search, the Court stressed that the Government [may not] us[e] a device … to explore details of the home that would previously have been unknowable without physical intrusion.  533 U. S., at 40.  Any difference between the dwelling in Kyllo and the trunk of the car here may go to the issue of the reasonableness of the respective searches, but it has no bearing on the question of search or no search.  Nor is it significant that Kyllos imaging device would disclose personal details immediately, whereas they would be revealed only in the further step of opening the enclosed space following the dogs alert reaction; in practical terms the same values protected by the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> are at stake in each case.  The justifications required by the

						 Thus, in Place itself, the Government officials had independent grounds to suspect that the luggage in question contained contraband before they employed the dog sniff.  462 U.

						 It would also be error to claim that some variant of the plain-view doctrine excuses the lack of justification for the dog sniff in this case.  When an officer observes an object left by its owner in plain view, no search occurs because the owner has exhibited no intention to keep [the object] to himself. Katz v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/389/347" class="subref" title="subref">389 U. S. 347</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">361</a> (1967)
 (Harlan, J., concurring).  In contrast, when an individual conceals his possessions from the world, he has grounds to expect some degree of privacy.  While plain view may be enhanced somewhat by technology, see, e.g., Dow Chemical Co. v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/476/227" class="subref" title="subref">476 U. S. 227</a> (1986)
 (allowing for aerial surveillance of an industrial complex), there are limits.  As Kyllo v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/533/27" class="subref" title="subref">533 U. S. 27</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">33</a> (2001)
, explained in treating the thermal-imaging device as outside the plain-view doctrine, [w]e have previously reserved judgment as to how much technological enhancement of ordinary perception turns mere observation into a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> search.  While Kyllo laid special emphasis on the heightened privacy expectations that surround the home, closed car trunks are accorded some level of privacy protection.  See, e.g., New York v. Belton, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/453/454" class="subref" title="subref">453 U. S. 454</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">460</a>, n. 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">4</a> (1981)
 (holding that even a search incident to arrest in a vehicle does not itself permit a search of the trunk).  As a result, if 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> protections are to have meaning in the face of superhuman, yet fallible, techniques like the use of trained dogs, those techniques must be justified on the basis of their reasonableness, lest everything be deemed in plain view.

						 I should take care myself to reserve judgment about a possible case significantly unlike this one.  All of us are concerned not to prejudge a claim of authority to detect explosives and dangerous chemical or biological weapons that might be carried by a terrorist who prompts no individualized suspicion.  Suffice it to say here that what is a reasonable search depends in part on demonstrated risk.  Unreasonable sniff searches for marijuana are not necessarily unreasonable sniff searches for destructive or deadly material if suicide bombs are a societal risk.

				The infallible dog, however, is a creature of legal fiction.  Although the Supreme Court of Illinois did not get into the sniffing averages of drug dogs, their supposed infallibility is belied by judicial opinions describing well-trained animals sniffing and alerting with less than perfect accuracy, whether owing to errors by their handlers, the limitations of the dogs themselves, or even the pervasive contamination of currency by cocaine.  See, 
				<em>

				<em>

				<em>

Indeed, a study cited by Illinois in this case for the proposition that dog sniffs are generally reliable shows that dogs in artificial testing situations return false positives anywhere from 12.5 to 60% of the time, depending on the length of the search.  See Reply Brief for Petitioner 13; K. Garner et al., Duty Cycle of the Detector Dog: A Baseline Study 12 (Apr. 2001) (prepared under Federal Aviation Administration grant by the Institute for Biological Detection Systems of Auburn University).  In practical terms, the evidence is clear that the dog that alerts hundreds of times will be wrong dozens of times.

				Once the dogs fallibility is recognized, however, that ends the justification claimed in 
				<em>
					Place
				</em>
				 for treating the sniff as 
				<em>
					sui generis
				</em>
				 under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>: the sniff alert does not necessarily signal hidden contraband, and opening the container or enclosed space whose emanations the dog has sensed will not necessarily reveal contraband or any other evidence of crime.  This is not, of course, to deny that a dogs reaction may provide reasonable suspicion, or probable cause, to search the container or enclosure; the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> does not demand certainty of success to justify a search for evidence or contraband.  The point is simply that the sniff and alert cannot claim the certainty that 
				<em>
					Place
				</em>
				 assumed, both in treating the deliberate use of sniffing dogs as 
				<em>
					sui generis 
				</em>
				and then taking that characterization as a reason to say they are not searches subject to 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> scrutiny.  And when that aura of uniqueness disappears, there is no basis in 
				<em>
					Place
				</em>
				s reasoning, and no good reason otherwise, to ignore the actual function that dog sniffs perform.  They are conducted to obtain information about the contents of private spaces beyond anything that human senses could perceive, even when conventionally enhanced.  The information is not provided by independent third parties beyond the reach of constitutional limitations, but gathered by the governments own officers in order to justify searches of the traditional sort, which may or may not reveal evidence of crime but will disclose anything meant to be kept private in the area searched.  Thus in practice the governments use of a trained narcotics dog functions as a limited search to reveal undisclosed facts about private enclosures, to be used to justify a further and complete search of the enclosed area.  And given the fallibility of the dog, the sniff is the first step in a process that may disclose intimate details without revealing contraband, just as a thermal-imaging device might do, as described in 
				<em>
					Kyllo
				</em>
				 v.

					United States,

				It makes sense, then, to treat a sniff as the search that it amounts to in practice, and to rely on the body of our 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> cases, including 
				<em>

				, in deciding whether such a search is reasonable.  As a general proposition, using a dog to sniff for drugs is subject to the rule that the object of enforcing criminal laws does not, without more, justify suspicionless

            </a>
				 this sniff search must stand or fall on its being ancillary to the traffic stop that led up to it.  It is true that the police had probable cause to stop the car for an offense committed in the officers presence, which Caballes concedes could have justified his arrest.  See Brief for Respondent 31.  There is no occasion to consider authority incident to arrest, however, see

				, the Court found that no 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> search occurred when federal agents analyzed powder they had already lawfully obtained.  The Court noted that because the test could only reveal whether the powder was cocaine, the owner had no legitimate privacy interest at stake.  466 U. S., at 123.  As already explained, however, the use of a sniffing dog in cases like this is significantly different and properly treated as a search that does indeed implicate

But in the case of the dog sniff, the dog does not smell the disclosed contraband; it smells a closed container.  An affirmative reaction therefore does not identify a substance the police already legitimately possess, but informs the police instead merely of a reasonable chance of finding contraband they have yet to put their hands on.  The police will then open the container and discover whatever lies within, be it marijuana or the owners private papers.  Thus, while 
				<em>
					Jacobsen
				</em>
				 could rely on the assumption that the enquiry in question would either show with certainty that a known substance was contraband or would reveal nothing more, both the certainty and the limit on disclosure that may follow are missing when the dog sniffs the car.

						 Kyllo was concerned with whether a search occurred when the police used a thermal-imaging device on a house to detect heat emanations associated with high-powered marijuana-growing lamps.  In concluding that using the device was a search, the Court stressed that the Government [may not] us[e] a device … to explore details of the home that would previously have been unknowable without physical intrusion.  533 U. S., at 40.  Any difference between the dwelling in Kyllo and the trunk of the car here may go to the issue of the reasonableness of the respective searches, but it has no bearing on the question of search or no search.  Nor is it significant that Kyllos imaging device would disclose personal details immediately, whereas they would be revealed only in the further step of opening the enclosed space following the dogs alert reaction; in practical terms the same values protected by the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> are at stake in each case.  The justifications required by the

						 Thus, in Place itself, the Government officials had independent grounds to suspect that the luggage in question contained contraband before they employed the dog sniff.  462 U.

						 It would also be error to claim that some variant of the plain-view doctrine excuses the lack of justification for the dog sniff in this case.  When an officer observes an object left by its owner in plain view, no search occurs because the owner has exhibited no intention to keep [the object] to himself. Katz v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/389/347" class="subref" title="subref">389 U. S. 347</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">361</a> (1967)
 (Harlan, J., concurring).  In contrast, when an individual conceals his possessions from the world, he has grounds to expect some degree of privacy.  While plain view may be enhanced somewhat by technology, see, e.g., Dow Chemical Co. v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/476/227" class="subref" title="subref">476 U. S. 227</a> (1986)
 (allowing for aerial surveillance of an industrial complex), there are limits.  As Kyllo v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/533/27" class="subref" title="subref">533 U. S. 27</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">33</a> (2001)
, explained in treating the thermal-imaging device as outside the plain-view doctrine, [w]e have previously reserved judgment as to how much technological enhancement of ordinary perception turns mere observation into a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> search.  While Kyllo laid special emphasis on the heightened privacy expectations that surround the home, closed car trunks are accorded some level of privacy protection.  See, e.g., New York v. Belton, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/453/454" class="subref" title="subref">453 U. S. 454</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">460</a>, n. 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">4</a> (1981)
 (holding that even a search incident to arrest in a vehicle does not itself permit a search of the trunk).  As a result, if 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> protections are to have meaning in the face of superhuman, yet fallible, techniques like the use of trained dogs, those techniques must be justified on the basis of their reasonableness, lest everything be deemed in plain view.

						 I should take care myself to reserve judgment about a possible case significantly unlike this one.  All of us are concerned not to prejudge a claim of authority to detect explosives and dangerous chemical or biological weapons that might be carried by a terrorist who prompts no individualized suspicion.  Suffice it to say here that what is a reasonable search depends in part on demonstrated risk.  Unreasonable sniff searches for marijuana are not necessarily unreasonable sniff searches for destructive or deadly material if suicide bombs are a societal risk.

				The infallible dog, however, is a creature of legal fiction.  Although the Supreme Court of Illinois did not get into the sniffing averages of drug dogs, their supposed infallibility is belied by judicial opinions describing well-trained animals sniffing and alerting with less than perfect accuracy, whether owing to errors by their handlers, the limitations of the dogs themselves, or even the pervasive contamination of currency by cocaine.  See, 
				<em>

Indeed, a study cited by Illinois in this case for the proposition that dog sniffs are generally reliable shows that dogs in artificial testing situations return false positives anywhere from 12.5 to 60% of the time, depending on the length of the search.  See Reply Brief for Petitioner 13; K. Garner et al., Duty Cycle of the Detector Dog: A Baseline Study 12 (Apr. 2001) (prepared under Federal Aviation Administration grant by the Institute for Biological Detection Systems of Auburn University).  In practical terms, the evidence is clear that the dog that alerts hundreds of times will be wrong dozens of times.

				Once the dogs fallibility is recognized, however, that ends the justification claimed in 
				<em>
					Place
				</em>
				 for treating the sniff as 
				<em>
					sui generis
				</em>
				 under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>: the sniff alert does not necessarily signal hidden contraband, and opening the container or enclosed space whose emanations the dog has sensed will not necessarily reveal contraband or any other evidence of crime.  This is not, of course, to deny that a dogs reaction may provide reasonable suspicion, or probable cause, to search the container or enclosure; the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> does not demand certainty of success to justify a search for evidence or contraband.  The point is simply that the sniff and alert cannot claim the certainty that 
				<em>
					Place
				</em>
				 assumed, both in treating the deliberate use of sniffing dogs as 
				<em>
					sui generis 
				</em>
				and then taking that characterization as a reason to say they are not searches subject to 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> scrutiny.  And when that aura of uniqueness disappears, there is no basis in 
				<em>
					Place
				</em>
				s reasoning, and no good reason otherwise, to ignore the actual function that dog sniffs perform.  They are conducted to obtain information about the contents of private spaces beyond anything that human senses could perceive, even when conventionally enhanced.  The information is not provided by independent third parties beyond the reach of constitutional limitations, but gathered by the governments own officers in order to justify searches of the traditional sort, which may or may not reveal evidence of crime but will disclose anything meant to be kept private in the area searched.  Thus in practice the governments use of a trained narcotics dog functions as a limited search to reveal undisclosed facts about private enclosures, to be used to justify a further and complete search of the enclosed area.  And given the fallibility of the dog, the sniff is the first step in a process that may disclose intimate details without revealing contraband, just as a thermal-imaging device might do, as described in 
				<em>
					Kyllo
				</em>
				 v.

					United States,

				 this sniff search must stand or fall on its being ancillary to the traffic stop that led up to it.  It is true that the police had probable cause to stop the car for an offense committed in the officers presence, which Caballes concedes could have justified his arrest.  See Brief for Respondent 31.  There is no occasion to consider authority incident to arrest, however, see

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> search occurred when federal agents analyzed powder they had already lawfully obtained.  The Court noted that because the test could only reveal whether the powder was cocaine, the owner had no legitimate privacy interest at stake.  466 U. S., at 123.  As already explained, however, the use of a sniffing dog in cases like this is significantly different and properly treated as a search that does indeed implicate

But in the case of the dog sniff, the dog does not smell the disclosed contraband; it smells a closed container.  An affirmative reaction therefore does not identify a substance the police already legitimately possess, but informs the police instead merely of a reasonable chance of finding contraband they have yet to put their hands on.  The police will then open the container and discover whatever lies within, be it marijuana or the owners private papers.  Thus, while 
				<em>

				</em>
				 could rely on the assumption that the enquiry in question would either show with certainty that a known substance was contraband or would reveal nothing more, both the certainty and the limit on disclosure that may follow are missing when the dog sniffs the car.

						 Kyllo was concerned with whether a search occurred when the police used a thermal-imaging device on a house to detect heat emanations associated with high-powered marijuana-growing lamps.  In concluding that using the device was a search, the Court stressed that the Government [may not] us[e] a device … to explore details of the home that would previously have been unknowable without physical intrusion.  533 U. S., at 40.  Any difference between the dwelling in Kyllo and the trunk of the car here may go to the issue of the reasonableness of the respective searches, but it has no bearing on the question of search or no search.  Nor is it significant that Kyllos imaging device would disclose personal details immediately, whereas they would be revealed only in the further step of opening the enclosed space following the dogs alert reaction; in practical terms the same values protected by the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> are at stake in each case.  The justifications required by the

						 It would also be error to claim that some variant of the plain-view doctrine excuses the lack of justification for the dog sniff in this case.  When an officer observes an object left by its owner in plain view, no search occurs because the owner has exhibited no intention to keep [the object] to himself. Katz v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/389/347" class="subref" title="subref">389 U. S. 347</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">361</a> (1967)
 (Harlan, J., concurring).  In contrast, when an individual conceals his possessions from the world, he has grounds to expect some degree of privacy.  While plain view may be enhanced somewhat by technology, see, e.g., Dow Chemical Co. v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/476/227" class="subref" title="subref">476 U. S. 227</a> (1986)
 (allowing for aerial surveillance of an industrial complex), there are limits.  As Kyllo v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/533/27" class="subref" title="subref">533 U. S. 27</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">33</a> (2001)
, explained in treating the thermal-imaging device as outside the plain-view doctrine, [w]e have previously reserved judgment as to how much technological enhancement of ordinary perception turns mere observation into a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> search.  While Kyllo laid special emphasis on the heightened privacy expectations that surround the home, closed car trunks are accorded some level of privacy protection.  See, e.g., New York v. Belton, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/453/454" class="subref" title="subref">453 U. S. 454</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">460</a>, n. 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">4</a> (1981)
 (holding that even a search incident to arrest in a vehicle does not itself permit a search of the trunk).  As a result, if 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> protections are to have meaning in the face of superhuman, yet fallible, techniques like the use of trained dogs, those techniques must be justified on the basis of their reasonableness, lest everything be deemed in plain view.

						 I should take care myself to reserve judgment about a possible case significantly unlike this one.  All of us are concerned not to prejudge a claim of authority to detect explosives and dangerous chemical or biological weapons that might be carried by a terrorist who prompts no individualized suspicion.  Suffice it to say here that what is a reasonable search depends in part on demonstrated risk.  Unreasonable sniff searches for marijuana are not necessarily unreasonable sniff searches for destructive or deadly material if suicide bombs are a societal risk.

				The infallible dog, however, is a creature of legal fiction.  Although the Supreme Court of Illinois did not get into the sniffing averages of drug dogs, their supposed infallibility is belied by judicial opinions describing well-trained animals sniffing and alerting with less than perfect accuracy, whether owing to errors by their handlers, the limitations of the dogs themselves, or even the pervasive contamination of currency by cocaine.  See, 
				<em>

Indeed, a study cited by Illinois in this case for the proposition that dog sniffs are generally reliable shows that dogs in artificial testing situations return false positives anywhere from 12.5 to 60% of the time, depending on the length of the search.  See Reply Brief for Petitioner 13; K. Garner et al., Duty Cycle of the Detector Dog: A Baseline Study 12 (Apr. 2001) (prepared under Federal Aviation Administration grant by the Institute for Biological Detection Systems of Auburn University).  In practical terms, the evidence is clear that the dog that alerts hundreds of times will be wrong dozens of times.

				Once the dogs fallibility is recognized, however, that ends the justification claimed in 
				<em>
					Place
				</em>
				 for treating the sniff as 
				<em>
					sui generis
				</em>
				 under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>: the sniff alert does not necessarily signal hidden contraband, and opening the container or enclosed space whose emanations the dog has sensed will not necessarily reveal contraband or any other evidence of crime.  This is not, of course, to deny that a dogs reaction may provide reasonable suspicion, or probable cause, to search the container or enclosure; the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> does not demand certainty of success to justify a search for evidence or contraband.  The point is simply that the sniff and alert cannot claim the certainty that 
				<em>
					Place
				</em>
				 assumed, both in treating the deliberate use of sniffing dogs as 
				<em>
					sui generis 
				</em>
				and then taking that characterization as a reason to say they are not searches subject to 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> scrutiny.  And when that aura of uniqueness disappears, there is no basis in 
				<em>
					Place
				</em>
				s reasoning, and no good reason otherwise, to ignore the actual function that dog sniffs perform.  They are conducted to obtain information about the contents of private spaces beyond anything that human senses could perceive, even when conventionally enhanced.  The information is not provided by independent third parties beyond the reach of constitutional limitations, but gathered by the governments own officers in order to justify searches of the traditional sort, which may or may not reveal evidence of crime but will disclose anything meant to be kept private in the area searched.  Thus in practice the governments use of a trained narcotics dog functions as a limited search to reveal undisclosed facts about private enclosures, to be used to justify a further and complete search of the enclosed area.  And given the fallibility of the dog, the sniff is the first step in a process that may disclose intimate details without revealing contraband, just as a thermal-imaging device might do, as described in 
				<em>
					Kyllo
				</em>
				 v.

					United States,

				 this sniff search must stand or fall on its being ancillary to the traffic stop that led up to it.  It is true that the police had probable cause to stop the car for an offense committed in the officers presence, which Caballes concedes could have justified his arrest.  See Brief for Respondent 31.  There is no occasion to consider authority incident to arrest, however, see

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> search occurred when federal agents analyzed powder they had already lawfully obtained.  The Court noted that because the test could only reveal whether the powder was cocaine, the owner had no legitimate privacy interest at stake.  466 U. S., at 123.  As already explained, however, the use of a sniffing dog in cases like this is significantly different and properly treated as a search that does indeed implicate

But in the case of the dog sniff, the dog does not smell the disclosed contraband; it smells a closed container.  An affirmative reaction therefore does not identify a substance the police already legitimately possess, but informs the police instead merely of a reasonable chance of finding contraband they have yet to put their hands on.  The police will then open the container and discover whatever lies within, be it marijuana or the owners private papers.  Thus, while 
				<em>
					Jacobsen
				</em>
				 could rely on the assumption that the enquiry in question would either show with certainty that a known substance was contraband or would reveal nothing more, both the certainty and the limit on disclosure that may follow are missing when the dog sniffs the car.

						 Kyllo was concerned with whether a search occurred when the police used a thermal-imaging device on a house to detect heat emanations associated with high-powered marijuana-growing lamps.  In concluding that using the device was a search, the Court stressed that the Government [may not] us[e] a device … to explore details of the home that would previously have been unknowable without physical intrusion.  533 U. S., at 40.  Any difference between the dwelling in Kyllo and the trunk of the car here may go to the issue of the reasonableness of the respective searches, but it has no bearing on the question of search or no search.  Nor is it significant that Kyllos imaging device would disclose personal details immediately, whereas they would be revealed only in the further step of opening the enclosed space following the dogs alert reaction; in practical terms the same values protected by the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> are at stake in each case.  The justifications required by the

						 Thus, in Place itself, the Government officials had independent grounds to suspect that the luggage in question contained contraband before they employed the dog sniff.  462 U.

						 It would also be error to claim that some variant of the plain-view doctrine excuses the lack of justification for the dog sniff in this case.  When an officer observes an object left by its owner in plain view, no search occurs because the owner has exhibited no intention to keep [the object] to himself. Katz v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/389/347" class="subref" title="subref">389 U. S. 347</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">361</a> (1967)
 (Harlan, J., concurring).  In contrast, when an individual conceals his possessions from the world, he has grounds to expect some degree of privacy.  While plain view may be enhanced somewhat by technology, see, e.g., Dow Chemical Co. v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/476/227" class="subref" title="subref">476 U. S. 227</a> (1986)
 (allowing for aerial surveillance of an industrial complex), there are limits.  As Kyllo v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/533/27" class="subref" title="subref">533 U. S. 27</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">33</a> (2001)
, explained in treating the thermal-imaging device as outside the plain-view doctrine, [w]e have previously reserved judgment as to how much technological enhancement of ordinary perception turns mere observation into a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> search.  While Kyllo laid special emphasis on the heightened privacy expectations that surround the home, closed car trunks are accorded some level of privacy protection.  See, e.g., New York v. Belton, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/453/454" class="subref" title="subref">453 U. S. 454</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">460</a>, n. 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">4</a> (1981)
 (holding that even a search incident to arrest in a vehicle does not itself permit a search of the trunk).  As a result, if 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> protections are to have meaning in the face of superhuman, yet fallible, techniques like the use of trained dogs, those techniques must be justified on the basis of their reasonableness, lest everything be deemed in plain view.

						 I should take care myself to reserve judgment about a possible case significantly unlike this one.  All of us are concerned not to prejudge a claim of authority to detect explosives and dangerous chemical or biological weapons that might be carried by a terrorist who prompts no individualized suspicion.  Suffice it to say here that what is a reasonable search depends in part on demonstrated risk.  Unreasonable sniff searches for marijuana are not necessarily unreasonable sniff searches for destructive or deadly material if suicide bombs are a societal risk.

				The infallible dog, however, is a creature of legal fiction.  Although the Supreme Court of Illinois did not get into the sniffing averages of drug dogs, their supposed infallibility is belied by judicial opinions describing well-trained animals sniffing and alerting with less than perfect accuracy, whether owing to errors by their handlers, the limitations of the dogs themselves, or even the pervasive contamination of currency by cocaine.  See,

Indeed, a study cited by Illinois in this case for the proposition that dog sniffs are generally reliable shows that dogs in artificial testing situations return false positives anywhere from 12.5 to 60% of the time, depending on the length of the search.  See Reply Brief for Petitioner 13; K. Garner et al., Duty Cycle of the Detector Dog: A Baseline Study 12 (Apr. 2001) (prepared under Federal Aviation Administration grant by the Institute for Biological Detection Systems of Auburn University).  In practical terms, the evidence is clear that the dog that alerts hundreds of times will be wrong dozens of times.

				Once the dogs fallibility is recognized, however, that ends the justification claimed in 
				<em>
					Place
				</em>
				 for treating the sniff as 
				<em>
					sui generis
				</em>
				 under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>: the sniff alert does not necessarily signal hidden contraband, and opening the container or enclosed space whose emanations the dog has sensed will not necessarily reveal contraband or any other evidence of crime.  This is not, of course, to deny that a dogs reaction may provide reasonable suspicion, or probable cause, to search the container or enclosure; the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> does not demand certainty of success to justify a search for evidence or contraband.  The point is simply that the sniff and alert cannot claim the certainty that 
				<em>
					Place
				</em>
				 assumed, both in treating the deliberate use of sniffing dogs as 
				<em>
					sui generis 
				</em>
				and then taking that characterization as a reason to say they are not searches subject to 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> scrutiny.  And when that aura of uniqueness disappears, there is no basis in 
				<em>
					Place
				</em>
				s reasoning, and no good reason otherwise, to ignore the actual function that dog sniffs perform.  They are conducted to obtain information about the contents of private spaces beyond anything that human senses could perceive, even when conventionally enhanced.  The information is not provided by independent third parties beyond the reach of constitutional limitations, but gathered by the governments own officers in order to justify searches of the traditional sort, which may or may not reveal evidence of crime but will disclose anything meant to be kept private in the area searched.  Thus in practice the governments use of a trained narcotics dog functions as a limited search to reveal undisclosed facts about private enclosures, to be used to justify a further and complete search of the enclosed area.  And given the fallibility of the dog, the sniff is the first step in a process that may disclose intimate details without revealing contraband, just as a thermal-imaging device might do, as described in 
				<em>
					Kyllo
				</em>
				 v.

				 this sniff search must stand or fall on its being ancillary to the traffic stop that led up to it.  It is true that the police had probable cause to stop the car for an offense committed in the officers presence, which Caballes concedes could have justified his arrest.  See Brief for Respondent 31.  There is no occasion to consider authority incident to arrest, however, see

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> search occurred when federal agents analyzed powder they had already lawfully obtained.  The Court noted that because the test could only reveal whether the powder was cocaine, the owner had no legitimate privacy interest at stake.  466 U. S., at 123.  As already explained, however, the use of a sniffing dog in cases like this is significantly different and properly treated as a search that does indeed implicate

But in the case of the dog sniff, the dog does not smell the disclosed contraband; it smells a closed container.  An affirmative reaction therefore does not identify a substance the police already legitimately possess, but informs the police instead merely of a reasonable chance of finding contraband they have yet to put their hands on.  The police will then open the container and discover whatever lies within, be it marijuana or the owners private papers.  Thus, while 
				<em>

				</em>
				 could rely on the assumption that the enquiry in question would either show with certainty that a known substance was contraband or would reveal nothing more, both the certainty and the limit on disclosure that may follow are missing when the dog sniffs the car.

						 Kyllo was concerned with whether a search occurred when the police used a thermal-imaging device on a house to detect heat emanations associated with high-powered marijuana-growing lamps.  In concluding that using the device was a search, the Court stressed that the Government [may not] us[e] a device … to explore details of the home that would previously have been unknowable without physical intrusion.  533 U. S., at 40.  Any difference between the dwelling in Kyllo and the trunk of the car here may go to the issue of the reasonableness of the respective searches, but it has no bearing on the question of search or no search.  Nor is it significant that Kyllos imaging device would disclose personal details immediately, whereas they would be revealed only in the further step of opening the enclosed space following the dogs alert reaction; in practical terms the same values protected by the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> are at stake in each case.  The justifications required by the

						 Thus, in Place itself, the Government officials had independent grounds to suspect that the luggage in question contained contraband before they employed the dog sniff.  462 U.

						 It would also be error to claim that some variant of the plain-view doctrine excuses the lack of justification for the dog sniff in this case.  When an officer observes an object left by its owner in plain view, no search occurs because the owner has exhibited no intention to keep [the object] to himself. Katz v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/389/347" class="subref" title="subref">389 U. S. 347</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">361</a> (1967)
 (Harlan, J., concurring).  In contrast, when an individual conceals his possessions from the world, he has grounds to expect some degree of privacy.  While plain view may be enhanced somewhat by technology, see, e.g., Dow Chemical Co. v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/476/227" class="subref" title="subref">476 U. S. 227</a> (1986)
 (allowing for aerial surveillance of an industrial complex), there are limits.  As Kyllo v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/533/27" class="subref" title="subref">533 U. S. 27</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">33</a> (2001)
, explained in treating the thermal-imaging device as outside the plain-view doctrine, [w]e have previously reserved judgment as to how much technological enhancement of ordinary perception turns mere observation into a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> search.  While Kyllo laid special emphasis on the heightened privacy expectations that surround the home, closed car trunks are accorded some level of privacy protection.  See, e.g., New York v. Belton, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/453/454" class="subref" title="subref">453 U. S. 454</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">460</a>, n. 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">4</a> (1981)
 (holding that even a search incident to arrest in a vehicle does not itself permit a search of the trunk).  As a result, if 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> protections are to have meaning in the face of superhuman, yet fallible, techniques like the use of trained dogs, those techniques must be justified on the basis of their reasonableness, lest everything be deemed in plain view.

						 I should take care myself to reserve judgment about a possible case significantly unlike this one.  All of us are concerned not to prejudge a claim of authority to detect explosives and dangerous chemical or biological weapons that might be carried by a terrorist who prompts no individualized suspicion.  Suffice it to say here that what is a reasonable search depends in part on demonstrated risk.  Unreasonable sniff searches for marijuana are not necessarily unreasonable sniff searches for destructive or deadly material if suicide bombs are a societal risk.

				The infallible dog, however, is a creature of legal fiction.  Although the Supreme Court of Illinois did not get into the sniffing averages of drug dogs, their supposed infallibility is belied by judicial opinions describing well-trained animals sniffing and alerting with less than perfect accuracy, whether owing to errors by their handlers, the limitations of the dogs themselves, or even the pervasive contamination of currency by cocaine.  See,

Indeed, a study cited by Illinois in this case for the proposition that dog sniffs are generally reliable shows that dogs in artificial testing situations return false positives anywhere from 12.5 to 60% of the time, depending on the length of the search.  See Reply Brief for Petitioner 13; K. Garner et al., Duty Cycle of the Detector Dog: A Baseline Study 12 (Apr. 2001) (prepared under Federal Aviation Administration grant by the Institute for Biological Detection Systems of Auburn University).  In practical terms, the evidence is clear that the dog that alerts hundreds of times will be wrong dozens of times.

				Once the dogs fallibility is recognized, however, that ends the justification claimed in 
				<em>
					Place
				</em>
				 for treating the sniff as 
				<em>
					sui generis
				</em>
				 under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>: the sniff alert does not necessarily signal hidden contraband, and opening the container or enclosed space whose emanations the dog has sensed will not necessarily reveal contraband or any other evidence of crime.  This is not, of course, to deny that a dogs reaction may provide reasonable suspicion, or probable cause, to search the container or enclosure; the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> does not demand certainty of success to justify a search for evidence or contraband.  The point is simply that the sniff and alert cannot claim the certainty that 
				<em>
					Place
				</em>
				 assumed, both in treating the deliberate use of sniffing dogs as 
				<em>
					sui generis 
				</em>
				and then taking that characterization as a reason to say they are not searches subject to 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> scrutiny.  And when that aura of uniqueness disappears, there is no basis in 
				<em>
					Place
				</em>
				s reasoning, and no good reason otherwise, to ignore the actual function that dog sniffs perform.  They are conducted to obtain information about the contents of private spaces beyond anything that human senses could perceive, even when conventionally enhanced.  The information is not provided by independent third parties beyond the reach of constitutional limitations, but gathered by the governments own officers in order to justify searches of the traditional sort, which may or may not reveal evidence of crime but will disclose anything meant to be kept private in the area searched.  Thus in practice the governments use of a trained narcotics dog functions as a limited search to reveal undisclosed facts about private enclosures, to be used to justify a further and complete search of the enclosed area.  And given the fallibility of the dog, the sniff is the first step in a process that may disclose intimate details without revealing contraband, just as a thermal-imaging device might do, as described in 
				<em>
					Kyllo
				</em>
				 v.

				 this sniff search must stand or fall on its being ancillary to the traffic stop that led up to it.  It is true that the police had probable cause to stop the car for an offense committed in the officers presence, which Caballes concedes could have justified his arrest.  See Brief for Respondent 31.  There is no occasion to consider authority incident to arrest, however, see

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> search occurred when federal agents analyzed powder they had already lawfully obtained.  The Court noted that because the test could only reveal whether the powder was cocaine, the owner had no legitimate privacy interest at stake.  466 U. S., at 123.  As already explained, however, the use of a sniffing dog in cases like this is significantly different and properly treated as a search that does indeed implicate

But in the case of the dog sniff, the dog does not smell the disclosed contraband; it smells a closed container.  An affirmative reaction therefore does not identify a substance the police already legitimately possess, but informs the police instead merely of a reasonable chance of finding contraband they have yet to put their hands on.  The police will then open the container and discover whatever lies within, be it marijuana or the owners private papers.  Thus, while 
				<em>

				 could rely on the assumption that the enquiry in question would either show with certainty that a known substance was contraband or would reveal nothing more, both the certainty and the limit on disclosure that may follow are missing when the dog sniffs the car.

						 Kyllo was concerned with whether a search occurred when the police used a thermal-imaging device on a house to detect heat emanations associated with high-powered marijuana-growing lamps.  In concluding that using the device was a search, the Court stressed that the Government [may not] us[e] a device … to explore details of the home that would previously have been unknowable without physical intrusion.  533 U. S., at 40.  Any difference between the dwelling in Kyllo and the trunk of the car here may go to the issue of the reasonableness of the respective searches, but it has no bearing on the question of search or no search.  Nor is it significant that Kyllos imaging device would disclose personal details immediately, whereas they would be revealed only in the further step of opening the enclosed space following the dogs alert reaction; in practical terms the same values protected by the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> are at stake in each case.  The justifications required by the

						 Thus, in Place itself, the Government officials had independent grounds to suspect that the luggage in question contained contraband before they employed the dog sniff.  462 U.

						 It would also be error to claim that some variant of the plain-view doctrine excuses the lack of justification for the dog sniff in this case.  When an officer observes an object left by its owner in plain view, no search occurs because the owner has exhibited no intention to keep [the object] to himself. Katz v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/389/347" class="subref" title="subref">389 U. S. 347</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">361</a> (1967)
 (Harlan, J., concurring).  In contrast, when an individual conceals his possessions from the world, he has grounds to expect some degree of privacy.  While plain view may be enhanced somewhat by technology, see, e.g., Dow Chemical Co. v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/476/227" class="subref" title="subref">476 U. S. 227</a> (1986)
 (allowing for aerial surveillance of an industrial complex), there are limits.  As Kyllo v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/533/27" class="subref" title="subref">533 U. S. 27</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">33</a> (2001)
, explained in treating the thermal-imaging device as outside the plain-view doctrine, [w]e have previously reserved judgment as to how much technological enhancement of ordinary perception turns mere observation into a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> search.  While Kyllo laid special emphasis on the heightened privacy expectations that surround the home, closed car trunks are accorded some level of privacy protection.  See, e.g., New York v. Belton, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/453/454" class="subref" title="subref">453 U. S. 454</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">460</a>, n. 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">4</a> (1981)
 (holding that even a search incident to arrest in a vehicle does not itself permit a search of the trunk).  As a result, if 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> protections are to have meaning in the face of superhuman, yet fallible, techniques like the use of trained dogs, those techniques must be justified on the basis of their reasonableness, lest everything be deemed in plain view.

						 I should take care myself to reserve judgment about a possible case significantly unlike this one.  All of us are concerned not to prejudge a claim of authority to detect explosives and dangerous chemical or biological weapons that might be carried by a terrorist who prompts no individualized suspicion.  Suffice it to say here that what is a reasonable search depends in part on demonstrated risk.  Unreasonable sniff searches for marijuana are not necessarily unreasonable sniff searches for destructive or deadly material if suicide bombs are a societal risk.

				The infallible dog, however, is a creature of legal fiction.  Although the Supreme Court of Illinois did not get into the sniffing averages of drug dogs, their supposed infallibility is belied by judicial opinions describing well-trained animals sniffing and alerting with less than perfect accuracy, whether owing to errors by their handlers, the limitations of the dogs themselves, or even the pervasive contamination of currency by cocaine.  See,

Indeed, a study cited by Illinois in this case for the proposition that dog sniffs are generally reliable shows that dogs in artificial testing situations return false positives anywhere from 12.5 to 60% of the time, depending on the length of the search.  See Reply Brief for Petitioner 13; K. Garner et al., Duty Cycle of the Detector Dog: A Baseline Study 12 (Apr. 2001) (prepared under Federal Aviation Administration grant by the Institute for Biological Detection Systems of Auburn University).  In practical terms, the evidence is clear that the dog that alerts hundreds of times will be wrong dozens of times.

				Once the dogs fallibility is recognized, however, that ends the justification claimed in 
				<em>
					Place
				</em>
				 for treating the sniff as 
				<em>
					sui generis
				</em>
				 under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>: the sniff alert does not necessarily signal hidden contraband, and opening the container or enclosed space whose emanations the dog has sensed will not necessarily reveal contraband or any other evidence of crime.  This is not, of course, to deny that a dogs reaction may provide reasonable suspicion, or probable cause, to search the container or enclosure; the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> does not demand certainty of success to justify a search for evidence or contraband.  The point is simply that the sniff and alert cannot claim the certainty that 
				<em>
					Place
				</em>
				 assumed, both in treating the deliberate use of sniffing dogs as 
				<em>
					sui generis 
				</em>
				and then taking that characterization as a reason to say they are not searches subject to 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> scrutiny.  And when that aura of uniqueness disappears, there is no basis in 
				<em>
					Place
				</em>
				s reasoning, and no good reason otherwise, to ignore the actual function that dog sniffs perform.  They are conducted to obtain information about the contents of private spaces beyond anything that human senses could perceive, even when conventionally enhanced.  The information is not provided by independent third parties beyond the reach of constitutional limitations, but gathered by the governments own officers in order to justify searches of the traditional sort, which may or may not reveal evidence of crime but will disclose anything meant to be kept private in the area searched.  Thus in practice the governments use of a trained narcotics dog functions as a limited search to reveal undisclosed facts about private enclosures, to be used to justify a further and complete search of the enclosed area.  And given the fallibility of the dog, the sniff is the first step in a process that may disclose intimate details without revealing contraband, just as a thermal-imaging device might do, as described in 
				<em>
					Kyllo
				</em>
				 v.

				 this sniff search must stand or fall on its being ancillary to the traffic stop that led up to it.  It is true that the police had probable cause to stop the car for an offense committed in the officers presence, which Caballes concedes could have justified his arrest.  See Brief for Respondent 31.  There is no occasion to consider authority incident to arrest, however, see

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> search occurred when federal agents analyzed powder they had already lawfully obtained.  The Court noted that because the test could only reveal whether the powder was cocaine, the owner had no legitimate privacy interest at stake.  466 U. S., at 123.  As already explained, however, the use of a sniffing dog in cases like this is significantly different and properly treated as a search that does indeed implicate

But in the case of the dog sniff, the dog does not smell the disclosed contraband; it smells a closed container.  An affirmative reaction therefore does not identify a substance the police already legitimately possess, but informs the police instead merely of a reasonable chance of finding contraband they have yet to put their hands on.  The police will then open the container and discover whatever lies within, be it marijuana or the owners private papers.  Thus, while 
				<em>

				 could rely on the assumption that the enquiry in question would either show with certainty that a known substance was contraband or would reveal nothing more, both the certainty and the limit on disclosure that may follow are missing when the dog sniffs the car.

						 Kyllo was concerned with whether a search occurred when the police used a thermal-imaging device on a house to detect heat emanations associated with high-powered marijuana-growing lamps.  In concluding that using the device was a search, the Court stressed that the Government [may not] us[e] a device … to explore details of the home that would previously have been unknowable without physical intrusion.  533 U. S., at 40.  Any difference between the dwelling in Kyllo and the trunk of the car here may go to the issue of the reasonableness of the respective searches, but it has no bearing on the question of search or no search.  Nor is it significant that Kyllos imaging device would disclose personal details immediately, whereas they would be revealed only in the further step of opening the enclosed space following the dogs alert reaction; in practical terms the same values protected by the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> are at stake in each case.  The justifications required by the

						 It would also be error to claim that some variant of the plain-view doctrine excuses the lack of justification for the dog sniff in this case.  When an officer observes an object left by its owner in plain view, no search occurs because the owner has exhibited no intention to keep [the object] to himself. Katz v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/389/347" class="subref" title="subref">389 U. S. 347</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">361</a> (1967)
 (Harlan, J., concurring).  In contrast, when an individual conceals his possessions from the world, he has grounds to expect some degree of privacy.  While plain view may be enhanced somewhat by technology, see, e.g., Dow Chemical Co. v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/476/227" class="subref" title="subref">476 U. S. 227</a> (1986)
 (allowing for aerial surveillance of an industrial complex), there are limits.  As Kyllo v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/533/27" class="subref" title="subref">533 U. S. 27</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">33</a> (2001)
, explained in treating the thermal-imaging device as outside the plain-view doctrine, [w]e have previously reserved judgment as to how much technological enhancement of ordinary perception turns mere observation into a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> search.  While Kyllo laid special emphasis on the heightened privacy expectations that surround the home, closed car trunks are accorded some level of privacy protection.  See, e.g., New York v. Belton, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/453/454" class="subref" title="subref">453 U. S. 454</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">460</a>, n. 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">4</a> (1981)
 (holding that even a search incident to arrest in a vehicle does not itself permit a search of the trunk).  As a result, if 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> protections are to have meaning in the face of superhuman, yet fallible, techniques like the use of trained dogs, those techniques must be justified on the basis of their reasonableness, lest everything be deemed in plain view.

						 I should take care myself to reserve judgment about a possible case significantly unlike this one.  All of us are concerned not to prejudge a claim of authority to detect explosives and dangerous chemical or biological weapons that might be carried by a terrorist who prompts no individualized suspicion.  Suffice it to say here that what is a reasonable search depends in part on demonstrated risk.  Unreasonable sniff searches for marijuana are not necessarily unreasonable sniff searches for destructive or deadly material if suicide bombs are a societal risk.

				The infallible dog, however, is a creature of legal fiction.  Although the Supreme Court of Illinois did not get into the sniffing averages of drug dogs, their supposed infallibility is belied by judicial opinions describing well-trained animals sniffing and alerting with less than perfect accuracy, whether owing to errors by their handlers, the limitations of the dogs themselves, or even the pervasive contamination of currency by cocaine.  See,

Indeed, a study cited by Illinois in this case for the proposition that dog sniffs are generally reliable shows that dogs in artificial testing situations return false positives anywhere from 12.5 to 60% of the time, depending on the length of the search.  See Reply Brief for Petitioner 13; K. Garner et al., Duty Cycle of the Detector Dog: A Baseline Study 12 (Apr. 2001) (prepared under Federal Aviation Administration grant by the Institute for Biological Detection Systems of Auburn University).  In practical terms, the evidence is clear that the dog that alerts hundreds of times will be wrong dozens of times.

				Once the dogs fallibility is recognized, however, that ends the justification claimed in 
				<em>
					Place
				</em>
				 for treating the sniff as 
				<em>
					sui generis
				</em>
				 under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>: the sniff alert does not necessarily signal hidden contraband, and opening the container or enclosed space whose emanations the dog has sensed will not necessarily reveal contraband or any other evidence of crime.  This is not, of course, to deny that a dogs reaction may provide reasonable suspicion, or probable cause, to search the container or enclosure; the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> does not demand certainty of success to justify a search for evidence or contraband.  The point is simply that the sniff and alert cannot claim the certainty that 
				<em>
					Place
				</em>
				 assumed, both in treating the deliberate use of sniffing dogs as 
				<em>
					sui generis 
				</em>
				and then taking that characterization as a reason to say they are not searches subject to 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> scrutiny.  And when that aura of uniqueness disappears, there is no basis in 
				<em>
					Place
				</em>
				s reasoning, and no good reason otherwise, to ignore the actual function that dog sniffs perform.  They are conducted to obtain information about the contents of private spaces beyond anything that human senses could perceive, even when conventionally enhanced.  The information is not provided by independent third parties beyond the reach of constitutional limitations, but gathered by the governments own officers in order to justify searches of the traditional sort, which may or may not reveal evidence of crime but will disclose anything meant to be kept private in the area searched.  Thus in practice the governments use of a trained narcotics dog functions as a limited search to reveal undisclosed facts about private enclosures, to be used to justify a further and complete search of the enclosed area.  And given the fallibility of the dog, the sniff is the first step in a process that may disclose intimate details without revealing contraband, just as a thermal-imaging device might do, as described in 
				<em>
					Kyllo
				</em>
				 v.

				 this sniff search must stand or fall on its being ancillary to the traffic stop that led up to it.  It is true that the police had probable cause to stop the car for an offense committed in the officers presence, which Caballes concedes could have justified his arrest.  See Brief for Respondent 31.  There is no occasion to consider authority incident to arrest, however, see

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> search occurred when federal agents analyzed powder they had already lawfully obtained.  The Court noted that because the test could only reveal whether the powder was cocaine, the owner had no legitimate privacy interest at stake.  466 U. S., at 123.  As already explained, however, the use of a sniffing dog in cases like this is significantly different and properly treated as a search that does indeed implicate

But in the case of the dog sniff, the dog does not smell the disclosed contraband; it smells a closed container.  An affirmative reaction therefore does not identify a substance the police already legitimately possess, but informs the police instead merely of a reasonable chance of finding contraband they have yet to put their hands on.  The police will then open the container and discover whatever lies within, be it marijuana or the owners private papers.  Thus, while 
				<em>

				</em>
				 could rely on the assumption that the enquiry in question would either show with certainty that a known substance was contraband or would reveal nothing more, both the certainty and the limit on disclosure that may follow are missing when the dog sniffs the car.

						 Kyllo was concerned with whether a search occurred when the police used a thermal-imaging device on a house to detect heat emanations associated with high-powered marijuana-growing lamps.  In concluding that using the device was a search, the Court stressed that the Government [may not] us[e] a device … to explore details of the home that would previously have been unknowable without physical intrusion.  533 U. S., at 40.  Any difference between the dwelling in Kyllo and the trunk of the car here may go to the issue of the reasonableness of the respective searches, but it has no bearing on the question of search or no search.  Nor is it significant that Kyllos imaging device would disclose personal details immediately, whereas they would be revealed only in the further step of opening the enclosed space following the dogs alert reaction; in practical terms the same values protected by the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> are at stake in each case.  The justifications required by the

						 Thus, in Place itself, the Government officials had independent grounds to suspect that the luggage in question contained contraband before they employed the dog sniff.  462 U.

						 It would also be error to claim that some variant of the plain-view doctrine excuses the lack of justification for the dog sniff in this case.  When an officer observes an object left by its owner in plain view, no search occurs because the owner has exhibited no intention to keep [the object] to himself. Katz v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/389/347" class="subref" title="subref">389 U. S. 347</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">361</a> (1967)
 (Harlan, J., concurring).  In contrast, when an individual conceals his possessions from the world, he has grounds to expect some degree of privacy.  While plain view may be enhanced somewhat by technology, see, e.g., Dow Chemical Co. v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/476/227" class="subref" title="subref">476 U. S. 227</a> (1986)
 (allowing for aerial surveillance of an industrial complex), there are limits.  As Kyllo v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/533/27" class="subref" title="subref">533 U. S. 27</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">33</a> (2001)
, explained in treating the thermal-imaging device as outside the plain-view doctrine, [w]e have previously reserved judgment as to how much technological enhancement of ordinary perception turns mere observation into a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> search.  While Kyllo laid special emphasis on the heightened privacy expectations that surround the home, closed car trunks are accorded some level of privacy protection.  See, e.g., New York v. Belton, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/453/454" class="subref" title="subref">453 U. S. 454</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">460</a>, n. 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">4</a> (1981)
 (holding that even a search incident to arrest in a vehicle does not itself permit a search of the trunk).  As a result, if 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> protections are to have meaning in the face of superhuman, yet fallible, techniques like the use of trained dogs, those techniques must be justified on the basis of their reasonableness, lest everything be deemed in plain view.

						 I should take care myself to reserve judgment about a possible case significantly unlike this one.  All of us are concerned not to prejudge a claim of authority to detect explosives and dangerous chemical or biological weapons that might be carried by a terrorist who prompts no individualized suspicion.  Suffice it to say here that what is a reasonable search depends in part on demonstrated risk.  Unreasonable sniff searches for marijuana are not necessarily unreasonable sniff searches for destructive or deadly material if suicide bombs are a societal risk.

				The infallible dog, however, is a creature of legal fiction.  Although the Supreme Court of Illinois did not get into the sniffing averages of drug dogs, their supposed infallibility is belied by judicial opinions describing well-trained animals sniffing and alerting with less than perfect accuracy, whether owing to errors by their handlers, the limitations of the dogs themselves, or even the pervasive contamination of currency by cocaine.  See,

Indeed, a study cited by Illinois in this case for the proposition that dog sniffs are generally reliable shows that dogs in artificial testing situations return false positives anywhere from 12.5 to 60% of the time, depending on the length of the search.  See Reply Brief for Petitioner 13; K. Garner et al., Duty Cycle of the Detector Dog: A Baseline Study 12 (Apr. 2001) (prepared under Federal Aviation Administration grant by the Institute for Biological Detection Systems of Auburn University).  In practical terms, the evidence is clear that the dog that alerts hundreds of times will be wrong dozens of times.

				Once the dogs fallibility is recognized, however, that ends the justification claimed in 
				<em>
					Place
				</em>
				 for treating the sniff as 
				<em>
					sui generis
				</em>
				 under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>: the sniff alert does not necessarily signal hidden contraband, and opening the container or enclosed space whose emanations the dog has sensed will not necessarily reveal contraband or any other evidence of crime.  This is not, of course, to deny that a dogs reaction may provide reasonable suspicion, or probable cause, to search the container or enclosure; the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> does not demand certainty of success to justify a search for evidence or contraband.  The point is simply that the sniff and alert cannot claim the certainty that 
				<em>
					Place
				</em>
				 assumed, both in treating the deliberate use of sniffing dogs as 
				<em>
					sui generis 
				</em>
				and then taking that characterization as a reason to say they are not searches subject to 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> scrutiny.  And when that aura of uniqueness disappears, there is no basis in 
				<em>
					Place
				</em>
				s reasoning, and no good reason otherwise, to ignore the actual function that dog sniffs perform.  They are conducted to obtain information about the contents of private spaces beyond anything that human senses could perceive, even when conventionally enhanced.  The information is not provided by independent third parties beyond the reach of constitutional limitations, but gathered by the governments own officers in order to justify searches of the traditional sort, which may or may not reveal evidence of crime but will disclose anything meant to be kept private in the area searched.  Thus in practice the governments use of a trained narcotics dog functions as a limited search to reveal undisclosed facts about private enclosures, to be used to justify a further and complete search of the enclosed area.  And given the fallibility of the dog, the sniff is the first step in a process that may disclose intimate details without revealing contraband, just as a thermal-imaging device might do, as described in 
				<em>
					Kyllo
				</em>
				 v.

				 this sniff search must stand or fall on its being ancillary to the traffic stop that led up to it.  It is true that the police had probable cause to stop the car for an offense committed in the officers presence, which Caballes concedes could have justified his arrest.  See Brief for Respondent 31.  There is no occasion to consider authority incident to arrest, however, see

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> search occurred when federal agents analyzed powder they had already lawfully obtained.  The Court noted that because the test could only reveal whether the powder was cocaine, the owner had no legitimate privacy interest at stake.  466 U. S., at 123.  As already explained, however, the use of a sniffing dog in cases like this is significantly different and properly treated as a search that does indeed implicate

But in the case of the dog sniff, the dog does not smell the disclosed contraband; it smells a closed container.  An affirmative reaction therefore does not identify a substance the police already legitimately possess, but informs the police instead merely of a reasonable chance of finding contraband they have yet to put their hands on.  The police will then open the container and discover whatever lies within, be it marijuana or the owners private papers.  Thus, while 
				<em>

				</em>
				 could rely on the assumption that the enquiry in question would either show with certainty that a known substance was contraband or would reveal nothing more, both the certainty and the limit on disclosure that may follow are missing when the dog sniffs the car.

						 Kyllo was concerned with whether a search occurred when the police used a thermal-imaging device on a house to detect heat emanations associated with high-powered marijuana-growing lamps.  In concluding that using the device was a search, the Court stressed that the Government [may not] us[e] a device … to explore details of the home that would previously have been unknowable without physical intrusion.  533 U. S., at 40.  Any difference between the dwelling in Kyllo and the trunk of the car here may go to the issue of the reasonableness of the respective searches, but it has no bearing on the question of search or no search.  Nor is it significant that Kyllos imaging device would disclose personal details immediately, whereas they would be revealed only in the further step of opening the enclosed space following the dogs alert reaction; in practical terms the same values protected by the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> are at stake in each case.  The justifications required by the

						 Thus, in Place itself, the Government officials had independent grounds to suspect that the luggage in question contained contraband before they employed the dog sniff.  462 U.

						 It would also be error to claim that some variant of the plain-view doctrine excuses the lack of justification for the dog sniff in this case.  When an officer observes an object left by its owner in plain view, no search occurs because the owner has exhibited no intention to keep [the object] to himself. Katz v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/389/347" class="subref" title="subref">389 U. S. 347</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">361</a> (1967)
 (Harlan, J., concurring).  In contrast, when an individual conceals his possessions from the world, he has grounds to expect some degree of privacy.  While plain view may be enhanced somewhat by technology, see, e.g., Dow Chemical Co. v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/476/227" class="subref" title="subref">476 U. S. 227</a> (1986)
 (allowing for aerial surveillance of an industrial complex), there are limits.  As Kyllo v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/533/27" class="subref" title="subref">533 U. S. 27</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">33</a> (2001)
, explained in treating the thermal-imaging device as outside the plain-view doctrine, [w]e have previously reserved judgment as to how much technological enhancement of ordinary perception turns mere observation into a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> search.  While Kyllo laid special emphasis on the heightened privacy expectations that surround the home, closed car trunks are accorded some level of privacy protection.  See, e.g., New York v. Belton, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/453/454" class="subref" title="subref">453 U. S. 454</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">460</a>, n. 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">4</a> (1981)
 (holding that even a search incident to arrest in a vehicle does not itself permit a search of the trunk).  As a result, if 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> protections are to have meaning in the face of superhuman, yet fallible, techniques like the use of trained dogs, those techniques must be justified on the basis of their reasonableness, lest everything be deemed in plain view.

						 I should take care myself to reserve judgment about a possible case significantly unlike this one.  All of us are concerned not to prejudge a claim of authority to detect explosives and dangerous chemical or biological weapons that might be carried by a terrorist who prompts no individualized suspicion.  Suffice it to say here that what is a reasonable search depends in part on demonstrated risk.  Unreasonable sniff searches for marijuana are not necessarily unreasonable sniff searches for destructive or deadly material if suicide bombs are a societal risk.

				The infallible dog, however, is a creature of legal fiction.  Although the Supreme Court of Illinois did not get into the sniffing averages of drug dogs, their supposed infallibility is belied by judicial opinions describing well-trained animals sniffing and alerting with less than perfect accuracy, whether owing to errors by their handlers, the limitations of the dogs themselves, or even the pervasive contamination of currency by cocaine.  See,

Indeed, a study cited by Illinois in this case for the proposition that dog sniffs are generally reliable shows that dogs in artificial testing situations return false positives anywhere from 12.5 to 60% of the time, depending on the length of the search.  See Reply Brief for Petitioner 13; K. Garner et al., Duty Cycle of the Detector Dog: A Baseline Study 12 (Apr. 2001) (prepared under Federal Aviation Administration grant by the Institute for Biological Detection Systems of Auburn University).  In practical terms, the evidence is clear that the dog that alerts hundreds of times will be wrong dozens of times.

				Once the dogs fallibility is recognized, however, that ends the justification claimed in 
				<em>
					Place
				</em>
				 for treating the sniff as 
				<em>
					sui generis
				</em>
				 under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>: the sniff alert does not necessarily signal hidden contraband, and opening the container or enclosed space whose emanations the dog has sensed will not necessarily reveal contraband or any other evidence of crime.  This is not, of course, to deny that a dogs reaction may provide reasonable suspicion, or probable cause, to search the container or enclosure; the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> does not demand certainty of success to justify a search for evidence or contraband.  The point is simply that the sniff and alert cannot claim the certainty that 
				<em>
					Place
				</em>
				 assumed, both in treating the deliberate use of sniffing dogs as 
				<em>
					sui generis 
				</em>
				and then taking that characterization as a reason to say they are not searches subject to 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> scrutiny.  And when that aura of uniqueness disappears, there is no basis in 
				<em>
					Place
				</em>
				s reasoning, and no good reason otherwise, to ignore the actual function that dog sniffs perform.  They are conducted to obtain information about the contents of private spaces beyond anything that human senses could perceive, even when conventionally enhanced.  The information is not provided by independent third parties beyond the reach of constitutional limitations, but gathered by the governments own officers in order to justify searches of the traditional sort, which may or may not reveal evidence of crime but will disclose anything meant to be kept private in the area searched.  Thus in practice the governments use of a trained narcotics dog functions as a limited search to reveal undisclosed facts about private enclosures, to be used to justify a further and complete search of the enclosed area.  And given the fallibility of the dog, the sniff is the first step in a process that may disclose intimate details without revealing contraband, just as a thermal-imaging device might do, as described in 
				<em>
					Kyllo
				</em>
				 v.

				 this sniff search must stand or fall on its being ancillary to the traffic stop that led up to it.  It is true that the police had probable cause to stop the car for an offense committed in the officers presence, which Caballes concedes could have justified his arrest.  See Brief for Respondent 31.  There is no occasion to consider authority incident to arrest, however, see

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> search occurred when federal agents analyzed powder they had already lawfully obtained.  The Court noted that because the test could only reveal whether the powder was cocaine, the owner had no legitimate privacy interest at stake.  466 U. S., at 123.  As already explained, however, the use of a sniffing dog in cases like this is significantly different and properly treated as a search that does indeed implicate

But in the case of the dog sniff, the dog does not smell the disclosed contraband; it smells a closed container.  An affirmative reaction therefore does not identify a substance the police already legitimately possess, but informs the police instead merely of a reasonable chance of finding contraband they have yet to put their hands on.  The police will then open the container and discover whatever lies within, be it marijuana or the owners private papers.  Thus, while 
				<em>

				</em>
				 could rely on the assumption that the enquiry in question would either show with certainty that a known substance was contraband or would reveal nothing more, both the certainty and the limit on disclosure that may follow are missing when the dog sniffs the car.

						 Kyllo was concerned with whether a search occurred when the police used a thermal-imaging device on a house to detect heat emanations associated with high-powered marijuana-growing lamps.  In concluding that using the device was a search, the Court stressed that the Government [may not] us[e] a device … to explore details of the home that would previously have been unknowable without physical intrusion.  533 U. S., at 40.  Any difference between the dwelling in Kyllo and the trunk of the car here may go to the issue of the reasonableness of the respective searches, but it has no bearing on the question of search or no search.  Nor is it significant that Kyllos imaging device would disclose personal details immediately, whereas they would be revealed only in the further step of opening the enclosed space following the dogs alert reaction; in practical terms the same values protected by the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> are at stake in each case.  The justifications required by the

						 Thus, in Place itself, the Government officials had independent grounds to suspect that the luggage in question contained contraband before they employed the dog sniff.  462 U.

						 It would also be error to claim that some variant of the plain-view doctrine excuses the lack of justification for the dog sniff in this case.  When an officer observes an object left by its owner in plain view, no search occurs because the owner has exhibited no intention to keep [the object] to himself. Katz v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/389/347" class="subref" title="subref">389 U. S. 347</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">361</a> (1967)
 (Harlan, J., concurring).  In contrast, when an individual conceals his possessions from the world, he has grounds to expect some degree of privacy.  While plain view may be enhanced somewhat by technology, see, e.g., Dow Chemical Co. v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/476/227" class="subref" title="subref">476 U. S. 227</a> (1986)
 (allowing for aerial surveillance of an industrial complex), there are limits.  As Kyllo v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/533/27" class="subref" title="subref">533 U. S. 27</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">33</a> (2001)
, explained in treating the thermal-imaging device as outside the plain-view doctrine, [w]e have previously reserved judgment as to how much technological enhancement of ordinary perception turns mere observation into a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> search.  While Kyllo laid special emphasis on the heightened privacy expectations that surround the home, closed car trunks are accorded some level of privacy protection.  See, e.g., New York v. Belton, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/453/454" class="subref" title="subref">453 U. S. 454</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">460</a>, n. 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">4</a> (1981)
 (holding that even a search incident to arrest in a vehicle does not itself permit a search of the trunk).  As a result, if 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> protections are to have meaning in the face of superhuman, yet fallible, techniques like the use of trained dogs, those techniques must be justified on the basis of their reasonableness, lest everything be deemed in plain view.

						 I should take care myself to reserve judgment about a possible case significantly unlike this one.  All of us are concerned not to prejudge a claim of authority to detect explosives and dangerous chemical or biological weapons that might be carried by a terrorist who prompts no individualized suspicion.  Suffice it to say here that what is a reasonable search depends in part on demonstrated risk.  Unreasonable sniff searches for marijuana are not necessarily unreasonable sniff searches for destructive or deadly material if suicide bombs are a societal risk.

				The infallible dog, however, is a creature of legal fiction.  Although the Supreme Court of Illinois did not get into the sniffing averages of drug dogs, their supposed infallibility is belied by judicial opinions describing well-trained animals sniffing and alerting with less than perfect accuracy, whether owing to errors by their handlers, the limitations of the dogs themselves, or even the pervasive contamination of currency by cocaine.  See,

Indeed, a study cited by Illinois in this case for the proposition that dog sniffs are generally reliable shows that dogs in artificial testing situations return false positives anywhere from 12.5 to 60% of the time, depending on the length of the search.  See Reply Brief for Petitioner 13; K. Garner et al., Duty Cycle of the Detector Dog: A Baseline Study 12 (Apr. 2001) (prepared under Federal Aviation Administration grant by the Institute for Biological Detection Systems of Auburn University).  In practical terms, the evidence is clear that the dog that alerts hundreds of times will be wrong dozens of times.

				Once the dogs fallibility is recognized, however, that ends the justification claimed in 
				<em>
					Place
				</em>
				 for treating the sniff as 
				<em>
					sui generis
				</em>
				 under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>: the sniff alert does not necessarily signal hidden contraband, and opening the container or enclosed space whose emanations the dog has sensed will not necessarily reveal contraband or any other evidence of crime.  This is not, of course, to deny that a dogs reaction may provide reasonable suspicion, or probable cause, to search the container or enclosure; the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> does not demand certainty of success to justify a search for evidence or contraband.  The point is simply that the sniff and alert cannot claim the certainty that 
				<em>
					Place
				</em>
				 assumed, both in treating the deliberate use of sniffing dogs as 
				<em>
					sui generis 
				</em>
				and then taking that characterization as a reason to say they are not searches subject to 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> scrutiny.  And when that aura of uniqueness disappears, there is no basis in 
				<em>
					Place
				</em>
				s reasoning, and no good reason otherwise, to ignore the actual function that dog sniffs perform.  They are conducted to obtain information about the contents of private spaces beyond anything that human senses could perceive, even when conventionally enhanced.  The information is not provided by independent third parties beyond the reach of constitutional limitations, but gathered by the governments own officers in order to justify searches of the traditional sort, which may or may not reveal evidence of crime but will disclose anything meant to be kept private in the area searched.  Thus in practice the governments use of a trained narcotics dog functions as a limited search to reveal undisclosed facts about private enclosures, to be used to justify a further and complete search of the enclosed area.  And given the fallibility of the dog, the sniff is the first step in a process that may disclose intimate details without revealing contraband, just as a thermal-imaging device might do, as described in 
				<em>
					Kyllo
				</em>
				 v.

				 this sniff search must stand or fall on its being ancillary to the traffic stop that led up to it.  It is true that the police had probable cause to stop the car for an offense committed in the officers presence, which Caballes concedes could have justified his arrest.  See Brief for Respondent 31.  There is no occasion to consider authority incident to arrest, however, see

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> search occurred when federal agents analyzed powder they had already lawfully obtained.  The Court noted that because the test could only reveal whether the powder was cocaine, the owner had no legitimate privacy interest at stake.  466 U. S., at 123.  As already explained, however, the use of a sniffing dog in cases like this is significantly different and properly treated as a search that does indeed implicate

But in the case of the dog sniff, the dog does not smell the disclosed contraband; it smells a closed container.  An affirmative reaction therefore does not identify a substance the police already legitimately possess, but informs the police instead merely of a reasonable chance of finding contraband they have yet to put their hands on.  The police will then open the container and discover whatever lies within, be it marijuana or the owners private papers.  Thus, while 
				<em>

				</em>
				 could rely on the assumption that the enquiry in question would either show with certainty that a known substance was contraband or would reveal nothing more, both the certainty and the limit on disclosure that may follow are missing when the dog sniffs the car.

						 Kyllo was concerned with whether a search occurred when the police used a thermal-imaging device on a house to detect heat emanations associated with high-powered marijuana-growing lamps.  In concluding that using the device was a search, the Court stressed that the Government [may not] us[e] a device … to explore details of the home that would previously have been unknowable without physical intrusion.  533 U. S., at 40.  Any difference between the dwelling in Kyllo and the trunk of the car here may go to the issue of the reasonableness of the respective searches, but it has no bearing on the question of search or no search.  Nor is it significant that Kyllos imaging device would disclose personal details immediately, whereas they would be revealed only in the further step of opening the enclosed space following the dogs alert reaction; in practical terms the same values protected by the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> are at stake in each case.  The justifications required by the

						 Thus, in Place itself, the Government officials had independent grounds to suspect that the luggage in question contained contraband before they employed the dog sniff.  462 U.

						 It would also be error to claim that some variant of the plain-view doctrine excuses the lack of justification for the dog sniff in this case.  When an officer observes an object left by its owner in plain view, no search occurs because the owner has exhibited no intention to keep [the object] to himself. Katz v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/389/347" class="subref" title="subref">389 U. S. 347</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">361</a> (1967)
 (Harlan, J., concurring).  In contrast, when an individual conceals his possessions from the world, he has grounds to expect some degree of privacy.  While plain view may be enhanced somewhat by technology, see, e.g., Dow Chemical Co. v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/476/227" class="subref" title="subref">476 U. S. 227</a> (1986)
 (allowing for aerial surveillance of an industrial complex), there are limits.  As Kyllo v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/533/27" class="subref" title="subref">533 U. S. 27</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">33</a> (2001)
, explained in treating the thermal-imaging device as outside the plain-view doctrine, [w]e have previously reserved judgment as to how much technological enhancement of ordinary perception turns mere observation into a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> search.  While Kyllo laid special emphasis on the heightened privacy expectations that surround the home, closed car trunks are accorded some level of privacy protection.  See, e.g., New York v. Belton, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/453/454" class="subref" title="subref">453 U. S. 454</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">460</a>, n. 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">4</a> (1981)
 (holding that even a search incident to arrest in a vehicle does not itself permit a search of the trunk).  As a result, if 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> protections are to have meaning in the face of superhuman, yet fallible, techniques like the use of trained dogs, those techniques must be justified on the basis of their reasonableness, lest everything be deemed in plain view.

						 I should take care myself to reserve judgment about a possible case significantly unlike this one.  All of us are concerned not to prejudge a claim of authority to detect explosives and dangerous chemical or biological weapons that might be carried by a terrorist who prompts no individualized suspicion.  Suffice it to say here that what is a reasonable search depends in part on demonstrated risk.  Unreasonable sniff searches for marijuana are not necessarily unreasonable sniff searches for destructive or deadly material if suicide bombs are a societal risk.

				The infallible dog, however, is a creature of legal fiction.  Although the Supreme Court of Illinois did not get into the sniffing averages of drug dogs, their supposed infallibility is belied by judicial opinions describing well-trained animals sniffing and alerting with less than perfect accuracy, whether owing to errors by their handlers, the limitations of the dogs themselves, or even the pervasive contamination of currency by cocaine.  See, 
				<em>

				<em>

Indeed, a study cited by Illinois in this case for the proposition that dog sniffs are generally reliable shows that dogs in artificial testing situations return false positives anywhere from 12.5 to 60% of the time, depending on the length of the search.  See Reply Brief for Petitioner 13; K. Garner et al., Duty Cycle of the Detector Dog: A Baseline Study 12 (Apr. 2001) (prepared under Federal Aviation Administration grant by the Institute for Biological Detection Systems of Auburn University).  In practical terms, the evidence is clear that the dog that alerts hundreds of times will be wrong dozens of times.

				Once the dogs fallibility is recognized, however, that ends the justification claimed in 
				<em>
					Place
				</em>
				 for treating the sniff as 
				<em>
					sui generis
				</em>
				 under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>: the sniff alert does not necessarily signal hidden contraband, and opening the container or enclosed space whose emanations the dog has sensed will not necessarily reveal contraband or any other evidence of crime.  This is not, of course, to deny that a dogs reaction may provide reasonable suspicion, or probable cause, to search the container or enclosure; the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> does not demand certainty of success to justify a search for evidence or contraband.  The point is simply that the sniff and alert cannot claim the certainty that 
				<em>
					Place
				</em>
				 assumed, both in treating the deliberate use of sniffing dogs as 
				<em>
					sui generis 
				</em>
				and then taking that characterization as a reason to say they are not searches subject to 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> scrutiny.  And when that aura of uniqueness disappears, there is no basis in 
				<em>
					Place
				</em>
				s reasoning, and no good reason otherwise, to ignore the actual function that dog sniffs perform.  They are conducted to obtain information about the contents of private spaces beyond anything that human senses could perceive, even when conventionally enhanced.  The information is not provided by independent third parties beyond the reach of constitutional limitations, but gathered by the governments own officers in order to justify searches of the traditional sort, which may or may not reveal evidence of crime but will disclose anything meant to be kept private in the area searched.  Thus in practice the governments use of a trained narcotics dog functions as a limited search to reveal undisclosed facts about private enclosures, to be used to justify a further and complete search of the enclosed area.  And given the fallibility of the dog, the sniff is the first step in a process that may disclose intimate details without revealing contraband, just as a thermal-imaging device might do, as described in 
				<em>
					Kyllo

				 this sniff search must stand or fall on its being ancillary to the traffic stop that led up to it.  It is true that the police had probable cause to stop the car for an offense committed in the officers presence, which Caballes concedes could have justified his arrest.  See Brief for Respondent 31.  There is no occasion to consider authority incident to arrest, however, see

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> search occurred when federal agents analyzed powder they had already lawfully obtained.  The Court noted that because the test could only reveal whether the powder was cocaine, the owner had no legitimate privacy interest at stake.  466 U. S., at 123.  As already explained, however, the use of a sniffing dog in cases like this is significantly different and properly treated as a search that does indeed implicate

But in the case of the dog sniff, the dog does not smell the disclosed contraband; it smells a closed container.  An affirmative reaction therefore does not identify a substance the police already legitimately possess, but informs the police instead merely of a reasonable chance of finding contraband they have yet to put their hands on.  The police will then open the container and discover whatever lies within, be it marijuana or the owners private papers.  Thus, while 
				<em>
					Jacobsen
				</em>
				 could rely on the assumption that the enquiry in question would either show with certainty that a known substance was contraband or would reveal nothing more, both the certainty and the limit on disclosure that may follow are missing when the dog sniffs the car.

						 Kyllo was concerned with whether a search occurred when the police used a thermal-imaging device on a house to detect heat emanations associated with high-powered marijuana-growing lamps.  In concluding that using the device was a search, the Court stressed that the Government [may not] us[e] a device … to explore details of the home that would previously have been unknowable without physical intrusion.  533 U. S., at 40.  Any difference between the dwelling in Kyllo and the trunk of the car here may go to the issue of the reasonableness of the respective searches, but it has no bearing on the question of search or no search.  Nor is it significant that Kyllos imaging device would disclose personal details immediately, whereas they would be revealed only in the further step of opening the enclosed space following the dogs alert reaction; in practical terms the same values protected by the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> are at stake in each case.  The justifications required by the

						 Thus, in Place itself, the Government officials had independent grounds to suspect that the luggage in question contained contraband before they employed the dog sniff.  462 U.

						 It would also be error to claim that some variant of the plain-view doctrine excuses the lack of justification for the dog sniff in this case.  When an officer observes an object left by its owner in plain view, no search occurs because the owner has exhibited no intention to keep [the object] to himself. Katz v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/389/347" class="subref" title="subref">389 U. S. 347</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">361</a> (1967)
 (Harlan, J., concurring).  In contrast, when an individual conceals his possessions from the world, he has grounds to expect some degree of privacy.  While plain view may be enhanced somewhat by technology, see, e.g., Dow Chemical Co. v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/476/227" class="subref" title="subref">476 U. S. 227</a> (1986)
 (allowing for aerial surveillance of an industrial complex), there are limits.  As Kyllo v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/533/27" class="subref" title="subref">533 U. S. 27</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">33</a> (2001)
, explained in treating the thermal-imaging device as outside the plain-view doctrine, [w]e have previously reserved judgment as to how much technological enhancement of ordinary perception turns mere observation into a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> search.  While Kyllo laid special emphasis on the heightened privacy expectations that surround the home, closed car trunks are accorded some level of privacy protection.  See, e.g., New York v. Belton, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/453/454" class="subref" title="subref">453 U. S. 454</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">460</a>, n. 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">4</a> (1981)
 (holding that even a search incident to arrest in a vehicle does not itself permit a search of the trunk).  As a result, if 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> protections are to have meaning in the face of superhuman, yet fallible, techniques like the use of trained dogs, those techniques must be justified on the basis of their reasonableness, lest everything be deemed in plain view.

						 I should take care myself to reserve judgment about a possible case significantly unlike this one.  All of us are concerned not to prejudge a claim of authority to detect explosives and dangerous chemical or biological weapons that might be carried by a terrorist who prompts no individualized suspicion.  Suffice it to say here that what is a reasonable search depends in part on demonstrated risk.  Unreasonable sniff searches for marijuana are not necessarily unreasonable sniff searches for destructive or deadly material if suicide bombs are a societal risk.

				Under the False Claims Act (FCA), [a]ny person who, 
				<em>
					inter alia, 
				</em>
				knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, to an officer or employee of the United States Government … a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/31/3729.html#a_1" class="subref" title="subref">31 U. S. C. §3729(a)(1)</a>, is liable to the Government for a civil penalty, treble damages, and costs, §3729(a).  Although the Attorney General may sue under the FCA, a private person, known as a relator, may also bring a 
				<em>
					qui tam
				</em>
				 action in the name of the Government.  §3730(b).  The relator must inform the Justice Department of her intentions and keep the pleadings under seal while the Government decides whether to intervene and do its own litigating.  §3730(b)(2).  If the claim succeeds, the relators share may be up to 30 percent of the proceeds of the action, plus reasonable expenses, costs, and attorneys fees.  §3730(d).  This case involves a National Institute of Drug Abuse research grant to Cook County Hospital for a study that was later administered by a nonprofit research institute affiliated with the hospital.  Respondent Chandler, who ran the study for the institute, filed this 
				<em>
					qui tam
				</em>
				 action, claiming that Cook County (hereinafter County) and the institute had submitted false statements to obtain grant funds in violation of §3729(a)(1).  After this Court held in 
				<em>
					Vermont Agency of Natural Resources
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>

				<em>

				described as essentially punitive, 
				<em>

				(a) While §3729 does not define the term person, its meaning has remained unchanged since the original FCA was passed in 1863.  
				<em>
					Stevens
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 783, n. 12.  There is no doubt that the term then extended to corporations.  Indeed, this Court as early as 1826 in 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Amedy,
				</em>
				 11 Wheat. 392, 412, recognized the presumption that person also includes persons politic and incorporate.  Essentially conceding that private corporations were taken to be persons when the FCA was passed in 1863, the County argues that municipal corporations were not so understood until six years later, when the Court decided 
				<em>
					Cowles
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Mercer County,
				</em>
				 7 Wall. 118.  
				<em>
					Cowles
				</em>
				, however, was not an extension of principle but a natural recognition of the common understanding that municipal corporations and private ones were to be treated alike in terms of their legal status as persons capable of suing and being sued.  This explains how the Court in 
				<em>
					Cowles 
				</em>
				could conclude automatically and without discussion that municipal corporations, like private ones, should be treated as natural persons for virtually all purposes of constitutional and statutory analysis.  
				<em>

				<em>

            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/436/658" class="subref" title="subref">436 U. S. 658</a>.  Of course, the meaning of person recognized in 
				<em>
					Cowles
				</em>
				 was only a presumptive one, but neither the history nor the text of the original FCA provides contextual evidence that Congress intended to exclude municipalities from the class of persons covered by the FCA in 1863.  Pp. 48.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				(b) The False Claims Amendments Act of 1986 did not repeal municipal liability.  As part of an effort to modernize the FCA, the 1986 amendments raised the ceiling on damages recoverable under §3729(a) from double to treble.  Relying on the common law presumption against punitive damages for municipalities, see 
				<em>
					Newport
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Fact Concerts, Inc.,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/453/247" class="subref" title="subref">453 U. S. 247</a>, and n. 21, and on this Courts statement in 
				<em>
					Stevens, supra, 
				</em>
				at 784, 785, that the change from double to treble damages turned what had been a remedial provision into an essentially punitive one, the County argues that, even if municipalities were covered by the term person from 1863 to 1986, Congresss adoption of a punitive remedy entailed the elimination of municipal liability in 1986.  It does not follow from 
				<em>
					Stevens,
				</em>
				 however, that the punitive feature of FCA damages has the force to show congressional intent to repeal implicitly the existing definition of person.  To begin with, the FCAs damages multiplier has a compensatory function as well as a punitive one.  Most obviously, the statutes 
				<em>
					qui tam
				</em>
				 feature means that as much as 30 percent of the Governments recovery may go to a private relator who began the action.  Even when there is no 
				<em>
					qui tam
				</em>
				 relator to be paid, liability beyond actual damages may be necessary for full recovery, since the FCA has no separate provision for prejudgment interest or consequential damages.  The force of the treble damages remedys punitive nature in arguing against municipal liability is not as robust as it would be if that remedy were a pure penalty in all cases.  What is more, treble damages certainly does not equate with classic punitive damages, which leaves the jury with open-ended discretion over the amount, and so raises two concerns specific to municipal defendants: that local governments taxing power will make it an easy target for an unduly generous jury and that blameless or unknowing taxpayers will be unfairly taxed for the wrongdoing of local officials.  Neither of these concerns is serious in FCA cases.  The presumption against punitive damages thus brings only limited vigor to the Countys aid.  Working against the Countys position, however, is a different presumption, this one at full strength: the cardinal rule … that repeals by implication are disfavored.  
				<em>
					Posadas
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					National City Bank,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/296/497" class="subref" title="subref">296 U. S. 497</a>.  Inferring repeal of municipal liability from the increase in the damages ceiling from double to triple would be difficult in the abstract, but it is impossible given that the basic purpose of the 1986 amendments was to make the FCA a more useful tool against fraud in modern times.  Whether or not this was true in 1863, local governments now often administer or receive federal funds.  It is simply not plausible that Congress intended to repeal municipal liability 
				<em>
					sub silentio
				</em>
				 by the very Act it passed to strengthen the Governments hand in fighting false claims.  Pp. 813.

The relator must inform the Department of Justice of her intentions and keep the pleadings under seal for 60 days while the Government decides whether to intervene and do its own litigating.  §3730(b)(2); see also §3730(c).  If the claim succeeds, the defendant is liable to the Government for a civil penalty between $5,000 and $10,000 for each violation, treble damages (reducible to double damages for cooperative defendants), and costs.  §3729(a).

				The fraud in this case allegedly occurred in administering a $5 million grant from the National Institute of Drug Abuse to Cook County Hospital, owned and operated as the name implies, with the object of studying a treatment regimen for pregnant drug addicts.  The grant was subject to a variety of conditions, including the terms of a compliance plan meant to assure that the study would jibe with federal regulations for research on human subjects.  Administration of the study was later transferred to the Hektoen Institute for Medical Research, a nonprofit research organization affiliated with the hospital.  Respondent, Dr. Janet Chandler, ran the study from September 1993 until the institute fired her in January 1995.

				  Chandler said that the defendants had violated the grants express conditions, had failed to comply with the regulations on human-subject research, and had submitted false reports of what she called ghost research subjects.  Chandler also alleged that she was fired for reporting the fraud to doctors at the hospital and to the granting agency, rendering her dismissal a violation of both state law and the whistle-blower provision of the FCA, §3730(h).

This position accorded with the common understanding among contemporary commentators that corporations were persons in the general enjoyment of the capacity to sue and be sued.  See,

				 2 J. Bouvier, A Law Dictionary 332 (6th ed. 1856) (def. 2: The term person is also used to denote a corporation which is an artificial person); 1 S. Kyd, A Treatise on the Law of Corporations 13 (1793) (A

<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">16</a>Stat.
431, that the word person may extend and be applied to bodies politic and corporate … unless the context shows that [it was] intended to be used in a more limited sense.  Cf. J. Angell &amp; S. Ames, A Treatise on the Law of Private Corporations Aggregate 4 (rev. 3d ed. 1846) (The construction is, that when persons are mentioned in a statute, corporations are included if they fall within the general reason and design of the statute).

				First, it says that the statutory text is inherently inconsistent with local governmental liability, Brief for Petitioner 13, owing to the references of the original enactment to any person in the land or naval forces of the United States and any person not in the military or naval forces of the United States, together with a provision imposing criminal liability, including imprisonment, on defendants in the latter category, see Act of Mar. 2, 1863, ch. 67, §§1, 3,

				  But the old text merely shows that any person in the land or naval forces was directed at natural persons.

				The other contextual evidence cited by the County is the history of the FCA.  We recounted in 
				<em>

				 that Congresss primary concern in 1863 was  stopping the massive frauds perpetrated by large [private] contractors during the Civil War.   529 U. S., at 781 (quoting

, but adding [private]).  Local governments, the County says, were not players in the game of war profiteering that the FCA was meant to stop.  Of course, this is true, but in no way does it affect the fact that Congress wrote expansively, meaning to reach all types of fraud, without qualification, that might result in financial loss to the Government.

.  Whatever municipal corporations may have been doing in 1863, in 2003 local governments are commonly at the receiving end of all sorts of federal funding schemes and thus no less able than individuals or private corporations to impose on the federal fisc and exploit the exercise of the federal spending power.

				Nor is the application of this reading of the statute affected by the Countys alternative position, based on the evolution of the FCAs provisions for relief.  The Countys argument leads off, at least, with a sound premise about the historical tension between municipal liability and damages imposed as punishment.  Although it was well established in 1863 that a municipality, like a private corporation, was to be treated as a natural person subject to suit for a wide range of tortious activity, … this understanding did not extend to the award of punitive or exemplary damages,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">259</a>260 (1981)

				The County relies on this general statement in asking us to infer a remarkable consequence unstated in the 1986 amendments to the FCA.  As part of an effort to modernize the FCA, Congress then raised the fine from $2,000 to the current range of $5,000 to $10,000, and raised the ceiling on damages recoverable under §3729(a) from double to treble.

				<em>
					Stevens
				</em>
				, we spoke of this change as turning what had been a remedial provision into an essentially punitive one.  529 U. S., at 784, 785.  The County relies on this characterization to argue that, even if municipalities were covered by the term person from 1863 to 1986, Congresss adoption of a punitive remedy entailed the elimination of municipal liability in 1986.

				Although we did indeed find the punitive character of the treble damages provision a reason not to read person to include a State, see 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 785, it does not follow that the punitive feature has the force to show congressional intent to repeal implicitly the existing definition of that word, which included municipalities.  To begin with it is important to realize that treble damages have a compensatory side, serving remedial purposes in addition to punitive objectives.  See,

.  While the tipping point between pay-back and punishment defies general formulation, being dependent on the workings of a particular statute and the course of particular litigation, the facts about the FCA show that the damages multiplier has compensatory traits along with the punitive.  
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				There is no question that some liability beyond the amount of the fraud is usually necessary to compensate the Government completely for the costs, delays, and inconveniences occasioned by fraudulent claims.  
				<em>
					Bornstein,
				</em>
            <em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">445</a> (1989)
 (noting that the Governments injury includes not merely the amount of the fraud itself, but also ancillary costs, such as the costs of detection and investigation, that routinely attend the Governments efforts to root out deceptive practices directed at the public purse).  The most obvious indication that the treble damages ceiling has a remedial place under this statute is its 
				<em>
					qui tam
				</em>
				 feature with its possibility of diverting as much as 30 percent of the Governments recovery to a private relator who began the action.  In
				<em>
					 qui tam
				</em>
				 cases the rough difference between double and triple damages may well serve not to punish, but to quicken the self-interest of some private plaintiff who can spot violations and start litigating to compensate the Government, while benefiting himself as well.  See 
				<em>
					United States ex rel. Marcus
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Hess,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/317/537" class="subref" title="subref">317 U. S. 537</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">547</a> (1943)
.  The treble feature thus leaves the remaining double damages to provide elements of make-whole recovery beyond mere recoupment of the fraud.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Bornstein
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 315, and n. 11.  It may also be necessary for full recovery even when there is no 
				<em>
					qui tam
				</em>
				 relator to be paid.  The FCA has no separate provision for prejudgment interest, which is usually thought essential to compensation, see, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Kansas
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Colorado, 
				</em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">10</a>11 (2001)
, and might well be substantial given the FCAs long statute of limitations, §3731(b).  Nor does the FCA expressly provide for the consequential damages that typically come with recovery for fraud, see Restatement (Second) of Torts §549(1)(b), and Comment 
				<em>
					d
				</em>
				 (1976).

				Thus, although 
				<em>
					Stevens
				</em>
				 recognized that the FCAs treble damages remedy is still punitive in that recovery will exceed full compensation in a good many cases, the force of this punitive nature in arguing against municipal liability is not as robust as if it were a pure penalty in all cases.  Treble damages certainly does not equate with classic punitive damages, which leaves the jury with open-ended discretion over the amount and so raises two concerns specific to municipal defendants.  One is that a local governments taxing power makes it an easy target for an unduly generous jury.  See 
				<em>
					Newport
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra,
				</em>
				 at 270271.  But under the FCA, the jury is open to no such temptation; if it finds liability, its instruction is to return a verdict for actual damages, for which the court alone then determines any multiplier, just as the court alone sets any separate penalty.  §3729(a); see 277 F. 3d, at 978.  There is mitigation, also, for the second worry, that blameless or unknowing taxpayers will be unfairly taxed for the wrongdoing of local officials.  
				<em>
					Newport
				</em>
				, 453 U. S., at 267.  This very case shows how FCA liability may expose only local taxpayers who have already enjoyed the indirect benefit of the fraud, to the extent that the federal money has already been passed along in lower taxes or expanded services.  Cf. 
				<em>
					ibid.
				</em>
				  The question in such cases is whether the local taxpayer should make up for an undeserved benefit, or the federal taxpayer be permanently out of pocket, a question that can be answered in any given case, not by an opportunistic 
				<em>
					qui tam
				</em>
				 relator, but by a combination of the judges discretion and the Governments power to intervene and dismiss or settle an action, see §3730(c)(2).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The presumption against punitive damages thus brings only limited vigor to the Countys aid.  Working against the Countys position, however, is a different presumption, this one at full strength: the cardinal rule … that repeals by implication are disfavored.  
				<em>
					Posadas
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					National City Bank,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/296/497" class="subref" title="subref">296 U. S. 497</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">503</a> (1936)
.  Inferring repeal from legislative silence is hazardous at best, and error seems overwhelmingly likely in the notion that the 1986 amendments wordlessly redefined person to exclude municipalities.  The Countys argument, it must be remembered, is not merely that the treble damages feature of the 1986 amendments was meant to bypass municipal corporations; the argument is that the treble damages amendment must be read to eliminate the FCAs coverage of municipal corporations entirely, after being the statutory law for over a century.  This would be a hard case to make in the abstract, but it is impossible when we consider what is known about the object of the amendments in 1986.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The basic purpose of the 1986 amendments was to make the FCA a more useful tool against fraud in modern times.  S. Rep., at 2.  Because Congress was concerned about pervasive fraud in all Government programs, 
				<em>
					ibid.
				</em>
				, it allowed private parties to sue even based on information already in the Governments possession, see 
				<em>
					Hughes Aircraft Co.
				</em>
				 v.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">946</a> (1997)
; increased the Governments measure of recovery; and enhanced the incentives for relators to bring suit
				<em>
					.
				</em>
				  Yet the County urges that in so doing Congress made local governments, which today often administer or receive federal funds, immune not only from treble damages but from any liability whatsoever under the FCA.  Congress could have done that, of course, but it makes no sense to suggest Congress did it under its breath.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/529/765" class="subref" title="subref">529 U. S. 765</a> (2000)

						 The presumption against implied repeal also explains why two of the Countys subsidiary arguments cannot succeed here, despite the fact that we gave them credence in Stevens.  First, the County contrasts §3729 with the Civil Investigative Demand provision enacted as part of the 1986 amendments, §3733, which expressly includes both States and local governments in the definition of person.  In Stevens, supra, at 783784, we read that express reference in the later §3733 to confirm the reading of the earlier §3729, which was based on a common understanding in 1863 that person did not include a State; but person did presumptively include a municipality in 1863.


The County also argues it is not sensible to expose local governments to FCA liability but not to liability under the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act of 1986 (PFCRA), Pub. L. 99509, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">100</a>Stat.
1934 (codified at 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/31/3801.html" class="subref" title="subref">31 U. S. C. §3801</a> et seq.), a statute enacted just before the FCA amendments and designed to operate in tandem with the FCA.  Stevens, supra, at 786, n. 17.  The PFCRA prohibits the same conduct as the FCA and specifically defines a person subject to liability as any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or private organization.  §3801(a)(6).  Even assuming the County is correct that local governments are not covered by the PFCRA despite the term corporation, this is hardly a weighty argument for an implied repeal of municipal liability under the FCA, a separately enacted statute.

				The fraud in this case allegedly occurred in administering a $5 million grant from the National Institute of Drug Abuse to Cook County Hospital, owned and operated as the name implies, with the object of studying a treatment regimen for pregnant drug addicts.  The grant was subject to a variety of conditions, including the terms of a compliance plan meant to assure that the study would jibe with federal regulations for research on human subjects.  Administration of the study was later transferred to the Hektoen Institute for Medical Research, a nonprofit research organization affiliated with the hospital.  Respondent, Dr. Janet Chandler, ran the study from September 1993 until the institute fired her in January 1995.

				Essentially conceding that private corporations were taken to be persons when the FCA was passed in 1863, the County argues that municipal corporations were not so understood until six years later, when 
				<em>
					Cowles
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Mercer County,
				</em>
				 7 Wall. 118 (1869), applied the 
				<em>

				<em>
					Cowles
				</em>
				, however, was not an extension of principle but a natural recognition of an understanding going back at least to Coke, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, that municipal corporations and private ones were simply two species of body politic and corporate, treated alike in terms of their legal status as persons capable of suing and being sued.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 W. Glover, A Practical Treatise on the Law of Municipal Corporations 41 (1837) (Municipal corporations have, as an attribute necessarily and inseparably incident to every corporation, the ability [t]o sue and be sued, … and do all other acts as natural persons may); see also 1 J. Dillon, The Law of Municipal Corporations 92 (rev. 2d ed. 1873).  Indeed, [t]he archetypal American corporation of the eighteenth century [was] the municipality; only in the early nineteenth century did private corporations become widespread.  M. Horwitz, The Transformation of American Law, 17801860, p. 112 (1977).  This history explains how the Court in 
				<em>
					Cowles
				</em>
				 could conclude automatically and without discussion that municipal corporations, like private ones, should be treated as natural persons for virtually all purposes of constitutional and statutory analysis.

<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">16</a>Stat.
431, that the word person may extend and be applied to bodies politic and corporate … unless the context shows that [it was] intended to be used in a more limited sense.  Cf. J. Angell &amp; S.

				First, it says that the statutory text is inherently inconsistent with local governmental liability, Brief for Petitioner 13, owing to the references of the original enactment to any person in the land or naval forces of the United States and any person not in the military or naval forces of the United States, together with a provision imposing criminal liability, including imprisonment, on defendants in the latter category, see Act of Mar. 2, 1863, ch. 67, §§1, 3,

				  But the old text merely shows that any person in the land or naval forces was directed at natural persons.  The second phrase, covering all other persons, could not have been that limited, or even private corporations would be outside the FCAs coverage, a reading that not even the County espouses and one that we seriously doubted in

				The other contextual evidence cited by the County is the history of the FCA.  We recounted in 
				<em>
					Stevens
				</em>
				 that Congresss primary concern in 1863 was  stopping the massive frauds perpetrated by large [private] contractors during the Civil War.   529 U. S., at 781 (quoting

, but adding [private]).  Local governments, the County says, were not players in the game of war profiteering that the FCA was meant to stop.  Of course, this is true, but in no way does it affect the fact that Congress wrote expansively, meaning to reach all types of fraud, without qualification, that might result in financial loss to the Government.

.  Whatever municipal corporations may have been doing in 1863, in 2003 local governments are commonly at the receiving end of all sorts of federal funding schemes and thus no less able than individuals or private corporations to impose on the federal fisc and exploit the exercise of the federal spending power.  Cf.

				Nor is the application of this reading of the statute affected by the Countys alternative position, based on the evolution of the FCAs provisions for relief.  The Countys argument leads off, at least, with a sound premise about the historical tension between municipal liability and damages imposed as punishment.  Although it was well established in 1863 that a municipality, like a private corporation, was to be treated as a natural person subject to suit for a wide range of tortious activity, … this understanding did not extend to the award of punitive or exemplary damages,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">259</a>260 (1981)

				The County relies on this general statement in asking us to infer a remarkable consequence unstated in the 1986 amendments to the FCA.  As part of an effort to modernize the FCA, Congress then raised the fine from $2,000 to the current range of $5,000 to $10,000, and raised the ceiling on damages recoverable under §3729(a) from double to treble.

				<em>
					Stevens
				</em>
				, we spoke of this change as turning what had been a remedial provision into an essentially punitive one.  529 U. S., at 784, 785.  The County relies on this characterization to argue that, even if municipalities were covered by the term person from 1863 to 1986, Congresss adoption of a punitive remedy entailed the elimination of municipal liability in 1986.
			</p>

				Although we did indeed find the punitive character of the treble damages provision a reason not to read person to include a State, see 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 785, it does not follow that the punitive feature has the force to show congressional intent to repeal implicitly the existing definition of that word, which included municipalities.  To begin with it is important to realize that treble damages have a compensatory side, serving remedial purposes in addition to punitive objectives.  See,

.  While the tipping point between pay-back and punishment defies general formulation, being dependent on the workings of a particular statute and the course of particular litigation, the facts about the FCA show that the damages multiplier has compensatory traits along with the punitive.

				There is no question that some liability beyond the amount of the fraud is usually necessary to compensate the Government completely for the costs, delays, and inconveniences occasioned by fraudulent claims.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">445</a> (1989)
 (noting that the Governments injury includes not merely the amount of the fraud itself, but also ancillary costs, such as the costs of detection and investigation, that routinely attend the Governments efforts to root out deceptive practices directed at the public purse).  The most obvious indication that the treble damages ceiling has a remedial place under this statute is its 
				<em>
					qui tam
				</em>
				 feature with its possibility of diverting as much as 30 percent of the Governments recovery to a private relator who began the action.  In
				<em>
					 qui tam
				</em>
				 cases the rough difference between double and triple damages may well serve not to punish, but to quicken the self-interest of some private plaintiff who can spot violations and start litigating to compensate the Government, while benefiting himself as well.  See 
				<em>
					United States ex rel. Marcus
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Hess,
				</em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">547</a> (1943)
.  The treble feature thus leaves the remaining double damages to provide elements of make-whole recovery beyond mere recoupment of the fraud.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Bornstein
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 315, and n. 11.  It may also be necessary for full recovery even when there is no 
				<em>
					qui tam
				</em>
				 relator to be paid.  The FCA has no separate provision for prejudgment interest, which is usually thought essential to compensation, see, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Kansas
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Colorado,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">10</a>11 (2001)
, and might well be substantial given the FCAs long statute of limitations, §3731(b).  Nor does the FCA expressly provide for the consequential damages that typically come with recovery for fraud, see Restatement (Second) of Torts §549(1)(b), and Comment 
				<em>
					d
				</em>
				 (1976).

				Thus, although 
				<em>
					Stevens
				</em>
				 recognized that the FCAs treble damages remedy is still punitive in that recovery will exceed full compensation in a good many cases, the force of this punitive nature in arguing against municipal liability is not as robust as if it were a pure penalty in all cases.  Treble damages certainly does not equate with classic punitive damages, which leaves the jury with open-ended discretion over the amount and so raises two concerns specific to municipal defendants.  One is that a local governments taxing power makes it an easy target for an unduly generous jury.  See 
				<em>
					Newport
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra,
				</em>
				 at 270271.  But under the FCA, the jury is open to no such temptation; if it finds liability, its instruction is to return a verdict for actual damages, for which the court alone then determines any multiplier, just as the court alone sets any separate penalty.  §3729(a); see 277 F. 3d, at 978.  There is mitigation, also, for the second worry, that blameless or unknowing taxpayers will be unfairly taxed for the wrongdoing of local officials.  
				<em>
					Newport
				</em>
				, 453 U. S., at 267.  This very case shows how FCA liability may expose only local taxpayers who have already enjoyed the indirect benefit of the fraud, to the extent that the federal money has already been passed along in lower taxes or expanded services.  Cf. 
				<em>
					ibid.
				</em>
				  The question in such cases is whether the local taxpayer should make up for an undeserved benefit, or the federal taxpayer be permanently out of pocket, a question that can be answered in any given case, not by an opportunistic 
				<em>
					qui tam
				</em>
				 relator, but by a combination of the judges discretion and the Governments power to intervene and dismiss or settle an action, see §3730(c)(2).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The presumption against punitive damages thus brings only limited vigor to the Countys aid.  Working against the Countys position, however, is a different presumption, this one at full strength: the cardinal rule … that repeals by implication are disfavored.  
				<em>
					Posadas
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					National City Bank,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/296/497" class="subref" title="subref">296 U. S. 497</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">503</a> (1936)
.  Inferring repeal from legislative silence is hazardous at best, and error seems overwhelmingly likely in the notion that the 1986 amendments wordlessly redefined person to exclude municipalities.  The Countys argument, it must be remembered, is not merely that the treble damages feature of the 1986 amendments was meant to bypass municipal corporations; the argument is that the treble damages amendment must be read to eliminate the FCAs coverage of municipal corporations entirely, after being the statutory law for over a century.  This would be a hard case to make in the abstract, but it is impossible when we consider what is known about the object of the amendments in 1986.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The basic purpose of the 1986 amendments was to make the FCA a more useful tool against fraud in modern times.  S. Rep., at 2.  Because Congress was concerned about pervasive fraud in all Government programs, 
				<em>
					ibid.
				</em>
				, it allowed private parties to sue even based on information already in the Governments possession, see 
				<em>
					Hughes Aircraft Co.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">946</a> (1997)
; increased the Governments measure of recovery; and enhanced the incentives for relators to bring suit
				<em>
					.
				</em>
				  Yet the County urges that in so doing Congress made local governments, which today often administer or receive federal funds, immune not only from treble damages but from any liability whatsoever under the FCA.  Congress could have done that, of course, but it makes no sense to suggest Congress did it under its breath.

						 The County and some of its supporting amici urge a further distinction between full-fledged municipal corporations such as towns and cities, which were incorporated at the request of their inhabitants, and quasi corporations such as counties, which were unilateral creations of the State.  See Barnes v. District of Columbia, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/91/540" class="subref" title="subref">91 U. S. 540</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">552</a> (1876)
.  While the liability of quasi corporations at common law may have differed from that of municipal corporations, see ibid., both were treated equally as legal persons.  Indeed, Cowles itself applied to an Illinois county like Cook County.

						 The treble damages provision was, in a way, adopted by Congress as a substitute for consequential damages.  The Senate version of the bill proposed consequential damages on top of treble damages, while the House version proposed consequential damages plus double damages.  See S. Rep. No. 99345, p. 39 (1986) (hereinafter S. Rep.); H. R. Rep. No. 99660, p. 20 (1986).  Ultimately, the Senates treble figure was adopted and the consequential damages provision dropped.

						 Indeed, there is some evidence that Congress affirmatively endorsed municipal liability when it passed the 1986 amendments.  See S. Rep., at 8 (noting that [t]he term person is used in its broad sense to include partnerships, associations, and corporations … as well as States and political subdivisions thereof (citing, inter alia, Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs., 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/436/658" class="subref" title="subref">436 U. S. 658</a> (1978)
).  Although in Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v. United States ex rel. Stevens, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/529/765" class="subref" title="subref">529 U. S. 765</a> (2000)
, we considered this evidence insufficient to overcome the background presumption that States are not persons, in the present case the statement belies the Countys argument that Congress meant to change the contrary presumption applicable to local governments and to remove municipal liability.

					</p>
        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-11" href="#ZO-11ref">
						11
					</a>
						 The presumption against implied repeal also explains why two of the Countys subsidiary arguments cannot succeed here, despite the fact that we gave them credence in Stevens.  First, the County contrasts §3729 with the Civil Investigative Demand provision enacted as part of the 1986 amendments, §3733, which expressly includes both States and local governments in the definition of person.  In Stevens, supra, at 783784, we read that express reference in the later §3733 to confirm the reading of the earlier §3729, which was based on a common understanding in 1863 that person did not include a State; but person did presumptively include a municipality in 1863.


The County also argues it is not sensible to expose local governments to FCA liability but not to liability under the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act of 1986 (PFCRA), Pub. L. 99509, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">100</a>Stat.
1934 (codified at 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/31/3801.html" class="subref" title="subref">31 U. S. C. §3801</a> et seq.), a statute enacted just before the FCA amendments and designed to operate in tandem with the FCA.  Stevens, supra, at 786, n. 17.  The PFCRA prohibits the same conduct as the FCA and specifically defines a person subject to liability as any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or private organization.  §3801(a)(6).  Even assuming the County is correct that local governments are not covered by the PFCRA despite the term corporation, this is hardly a weighty argument for an implied repeal of municipal liability under the FCA, a separately enacted statute.

				The fraud in this case allegedly occurred in administering a $5 million grant from the National Institute of Drug Abuse to Cook County Hospital, owned and operated as the name implies, with the object of studying a treatment regimen for pregnant drug addicts.  The grant was subject to a variety of conditions, including the terms of a compliance plan meant to assure that the study would jibe with federal regulations for research on human subjects.  Administration of the study was later transferred to the Hektoen Institute for Medical Research, a nonprofit research organization affiliated with the hospital.

				Essentially conceding that private corporations were taken to be persons when the FCA was passed in 1863, the County argues that municipal corporations were not so understood until six years later, when 
				<em>

				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Mercer County,
				</em>
				 7 Wall. 118 (1869), applied the

				<em>
					Cowles
				</em>
				, however, was not an extension of principle but a natural recognition of an understanding going back at least to Coke, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, that municipal corporations and private ones were simply two species of body politic and corporate, treated alike in terms of their legal status as persons capable of suing and being sued.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 W. Glover, A Practical Treatise on the Law of Municipal Corporations 41 (1837) (Municipal corporations have, as an attribute necessarily and inseparably incident to every corporation, the ability [t]o sue and be sued, … and do all other acts as natural persons may); see also 1 J. Dillon, The Law of Municipal Corporations 92 (rev. 2d ed. 1873).  Indeed, [t]he archetypal American corporation of the eighteenth century [was] the municipality; only in the early nineteenth century did private corporations become widespread.  M. Horwitz, The Transformation of American Law, 17801860, p. 112 (1977).  This history explains how the Court in

431, that the word person may extend and be applied to bodies politic and corporate … unless the context shows that [it was] intended to be used in a more limited sense.  Cf. J. Angell &amp; S.

				First, it says that the statutory text is inherently inconsistent with local governmental liability, Brief for Petitioner 13, owing to the references of the original enactment to any person in the land or naval forces of the United States and any person not in the military or naval forces of the United States, together with a provision imposing criminal liability, including imprisonment, on defendants in the latter category, see Act of Mar. 2, 1863, ch. 67, §§1, 3,

				  But the old text merely shows that any person in the land or naval forces was directed at natural persons.

				The other contextual evidence cited by the County is the history of the FCA.  We recounted in 
				<em>

				</em>
				 that Congresss primary concern in 1863 was  stopping the massive frauds perpetrated by large [private] contractors during the Civil War.   529 U. S., at 781 (quoting

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">309</a> (1976)
, but adding [private]).  Local governments, the County says, were not players in the game of war profiteering that the FCA was meant to stop.  Of course, this is true, but in no way does it affect the fact that Congress wrote expansively, meaning to reach all types of fraud, without qualification, that might result in financial loss to the Government.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">232</a> (1968)
.  Whatever municipal corporations may have been doing in 1863, in 2003 local governments are commonly at the receiving end of all sorts of federal funding schemes and thus no less able than individuals or private corporations to impose on the federal fisc and exploit the exercise of the federal spending power.  Cf. 
				<em>

				Nor is the application of this reading of the statute affected by the Countys alternative position, based on the evolution of the FCAs provisions for relief.  The Countys argument leads off, at least, with a sound premise about the historical tension between municipal liability and damages imposed as punishment.  Although it was well established in 1863 that a municipality, like a private corporation, was to be treated as a natural person subject to suit for a wide range of tortious activity, … this understanding did not extend to the award of punitive or exemplary damages,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">259</a>260 (1981)

				The County relies on this general statement in asking us to infer a remarkable consequence unstated in the 1986 amendments to the FCA.  As part of an effort to modernize the FCA, Congress then raised the fine from $2,000 to the current range of $5,000 to $10,000, and raised the ceiling on damages recoverable under §3729(a) from double to treble.

				<em>
					Stevens
				</em>
				, we spoke of this change as turning what had been a remedial provision into an essentially punitive one.  529 U. S., at 784, 785.  The County relies on this characterization to argue that, even if municipalities were covered by the term person from 1863 to 1986, Congresss adoption of a punitive remedy entailed the elimination of municipal liability in 1986.

				Although we did indeed find the punitive character of the treble damages provision a reason not to read person to include a State, see 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 785, it does not follow that the punitive feature has the force to show congressional intent to repeal implicitly the existing definition of that word, which included municipalities.  To begin with it is important to realize that treble damages have a compensatory side, serving remedial purposes in addition to punitive objectives.  See,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">151</a> (1987)
.  While the tipping point between pay-back and punishment defies general formulation, being dependent on the workings of a particular statute and the course of particular litigation, the facts about the FCA show that the damages multiplier has compensatory traits along with the punitive.  
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				There is no question that some liability beyond the amount of the fraud is usually necessary to compensate the Government completely for the costs, delays, and inconveniences occasioned by fraudulent claims.  
				<em>

				</em>
            <em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">445</a> (1989)
 (noting that the Governments injury includes not merely the amount of the fraud itself, but also ancillary costs, such as the costs of detection and investigation, that routinely attend the Governments efforts to root out deceptive practices directed at the public purse).  The most obvious indication that the treble damages ceiling has a remedial place under this statute is its 
				<em>
					qui tam
				</em>
				 feature with its possibility of diverting as much as 30 percent of the Governments recovery to a private relator who began the action.  In
				<em>
					 qui tam
				</em>
				 cases the rough difference between double and triple damages may well serve not to punish, but to quicken the self-interest of some private plaintiff who can spot violations and start litigating to compensate the Government, while benefiting himself as well.  See 
				<em>
					United States ex rel. Marcus
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Hess,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/317/537" class="subref" title="subref">317 U. S. 537</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">547</a> (1943)
.  The treble feature thus leaves the remaining double damages to provide elements of make-whole recovery beyond mere recoupment of the fraud.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Bornstein
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 315, and n. 11.  It may also be necessary for full recovery even when there is no 
				<em>
					qui tam
				</em>
				 relator to be paid.  The FCA has no separate provision for prejudgment interest, which is usually thought essential to compensation, see, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Kansas
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Colorado, 
				</em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">10</a>11 (2001)
, and might well be substantial given the FCAs long statute of limitations, §3731(b).  Nor does the FCA expressly provide for the consequential damages that typically come with recovery for fraud, see Restatement (Second) of Torts §549(1)(b), and Comment 
				<em>
					d
				</em>
				 (1976).

				Thus, although 
				<em>
					Stevens
				</em>
				 recognized that the FCAs treble damages remedy is still punitive in that recovery will exceed full compensation in a good many cases, the force of this punitive nature in arguing against municipal liability is not as robust as if it were a pure penalty in all cases.  Treble damages certainly does not equate with classic punitive damages, which leaves the jury with open-ended discretion over the amount and so raises two concerns specific to municipal defendants.  One is that a local governments taxing power makes it an easy target for an unduly generous jury.  See 
				<em>
					Newport
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra,
				</em>
				 at 270271.  But under the FCA, the jury is open to no such temptation; if it finds liability, its instruction is to return a verdict for actual damages, for which the court alone then determines any multiplier, just as the court alone sets any separate penalty.  §3729(a); see 277 F. 3d, at 978.  There is mitigation, also, for the second worry, that blameless or unknowing taxpayers will be unfairly taxed for the wrongdoing of local officials.  
				<em>
					Newport
				</em>
				, 453 U. S., at 267.  This very case shows how FCA liability may expose only local taxpayers who have already enjoyed the indirect benefit of the fraud, to the extent that the federal money has already been passed along in lower taxes or expanded services.  Cf. 
				<em>
					ibid.
				</em>
				  The question in such cases is whether the local taxpayer should make up for an undeserved benefit, or the federal taxpayer be permanently out of pocket, a question that can be answered in any given case, not by an opportunistic 
				<em>
					qui tam
				</em>
				 relator, but by a combination of the judges discretion and the Governments power to intervene and dismiss or settle an action, see §3730(c)(2).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The presumption against punitive damages thus brings only limited vigor to the Countys aid.  Working against the Countys position, however, is a different presumption, this one at full strength: the cardinal rule … that repeals by implication are disfavored.  
				<em>
					Posadas
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					National City Bank,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/296/497" class="subref" title="subref">296 U. S. 497</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">503</a> (1936)
.  Inferring repeal from legislative silence is hazardous at best, and error seems overwhelmingly likely in the notion that the 1986 amendments wordlessly redefined person to exclude municipalities.  The Countys argument, it must be remembered, is not merely that the treble damages feature of the 1986 amendments was meant to bypass municipal corporations; the argument is that the treble damages amendment must be read to eliminate the FCAs coverage of municipal corporations entirely, after being the statutory law for over a century.  This would be a hard case to make in the abstract, but it is impossible when we consider what is known about the object of the amendments in 1986.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The basic purpose of the 1986 amendments was to make the FCA a more useful tool against fraud in modern times.  S. Rep., at 2.  Because Congress was concerned about pervasive fraud in all Government programs, 
				<em>
					ibid.
				</em>
				, it allowed private parties to sue even based on information already in the Governments possession, see 
				<em>
					Hughes Aircraft Co.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">946</a> (1997)
; increased the Governments measure of recovery; and enhanced the incentives for relators to bring suit
				<em>
					.
				</em>
				  Yet the County urges that in so doing Congress made local governments, which today often administer or receive federal funds, immune not only from treble damages but from any liability whatsoever under the FCA.  Congress could have done that, of course, but it makes no sense to suggest Congress did it under its breath.

						 If the Government does not intervene, the relator is entitled to 25 to 30 percent of the proceeds.  §3730(d)(2).

						 The County and some of its supporting amici urge a further distinction between full-fledged municipal corporations such as towns and cities, which were incorporated at the request of their inhabitants, and quasi corporations such as counties, which were unilateral creations of the State.  See Barnes v. District of Columbia, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/91/540" class="subref" title="subref">91 U. S. 540</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">552</a> (1876)
.  While the liability of quasi corporations at common law may have differed from that of municipal corporations, see ibid., both were treated equally as legal persons.  Indeed, Cowles itself applied to an Illinois county like Cook County.

						 The treble damages provision was, in a way, adopted by Congress as a substitute for consequential damages.  The Senate version of the bill proposed consequential damages on top of treble damages, while the House version proposed consequential damages plus double damages.  See S. Rep. No. 99345, p. 39 (1986) (hereinafter S. Rep.); H. R. Rep. No. 99660, p. 20 (1986).  Ultimately, the Senates treble figure was adopted and the consequential damages provision dropped.

						 Indeed, there is some evidence that Congress affirmatively endorsed municipal liability when it passed the 1986 amendments.  See S. Rep., at 8 (noting that [t]he term person is used in its broad sense to include partnerships, associations, and corporations … as well as States and political subdivisions thereof (citing, inter alia, Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs., 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/436/658" class="subref" title="subref">436 U. S. 658</a> (1978)
).  Although in Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v. United States ex rel. Stevens, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/529/765" class="subref" title="subref">529 U. S. 765</a> (2000)
, we considered this evidence insufficient to overcome the background presumption that States are not persons, in the present case the statement belies the Countys argument that Congress meant to change the contrary presumption applicable to local governments and to remove municipal liability.

					</p>
        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-11" href="#ZO-11ref">

						 The presumption against implied repeal also explains why two of the Countys subsidiary arguments cannot succeed here, despite the fact that we gave them credence in Stevens.  First, the County contrasts §3729 with the Civil Investigative Demand provision enacted as part of the 1986 amendments, §3733, which expressly includes both States and local governments in the definition of person.  In Stevens, supra, at 783784, we read that express reference in the later §3733 to confirm the reading of the earlier §3729, which was based on a common understanding in 1863 that person did not include a State; but person did presumptively include a municipality in 1863.


The County also argues it is not sensible to expose local governments to FCA liability but not to liability under the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act of 1986 (PFCRA), Pub. L. 99509, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">100</a>Stat.
1934 (codified at 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/31/3801.html" class="subref" title="subref">31 U. S. C. §3801</a> et seq.), a statute enacted just before the FCA amendments and designed to operate in tandem with the FCA.  Stevens, supra, at 786, n. 17.  The PFCRA prohibits the same conduct as the FCA and specifically defines a person subject to liability as any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or private organization.  §3801(a)(6).  Even assuming the County is correct that local governments are not covered by the PFCRA despite the term corporation, this is hardly a weighty argument for an implied repeal of municipal liability under the FCA, a separately enacted statute.

The relator must inform the Department of Justice of her intentions and keep the pleadings under seal for 60 days while the Government decides whether to intervene and do its own litigating.  §3730(b)(2); see also §3730(c).  If the claim succeeds, the defendant is liable to the Government for a civil penalty between $5,000 and $10,000 for each violation, treble damages (reducible to double damages for cooperative defendants), and costs.  §3729(a).

				The fraud in this case allegedly occurred in administering a $5 million grant from the National Institute of Drug Abuse to Cook County Hospital, owned and operated as the name implies, with the object of studying a treatment regimen for pregnant drug addicts.  The grant was subject to a variety of conditions, including the terms of a compliance plan meant to assure that the study would jibe with federal regulations for research on human subjects.  Administration of the study was later transferred to the Hektoen Institute for Medical Research, a nonprofit research organization affiliated with the hospital.  Respondent, Dr. Janet Chandler, ran the study from September 1993 until the institute fired her in January 1995.

				  Chandler said that the defendants had violated the grants express conditions, had failed to comply with the regulations on human-subject research, and had submitted false reports of what she called ghost research subjects.  Chandler also alleged that she was fired for reporting the fraud to doctors at the hospital and to the granting agency, rendering her dismissal a violation of both state law and the whistle-blower provision of the FCA, §3730(h).

This position accorded with the common understanding among contemporary commentators that corporations were persons in the general enjoyment of the capacity to sue and be sued.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 2 J. Bouvier, A Law Dictionary 332 (6th ed. 1856) (def. 2: The term person is also used to denote a corporation which is an artificial person); 1 S. Kyd, A Treatise on the Law of Corporations 13 (1793) (A

				Essentially conceding that private corporations were taken to be persons when the FCA was passed in 1863, the County argues that municipal corporations were not so understood until six years later, when 
				<em>
					Cowles
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Mercer County,
				</em>
				 7 Wall. 118 (1869), applied the 
				<em>

				<em>
					Cowles
				</em>
				, however, was not an extension of principle but a natural recognition of an understanding going back at least to Coke, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, that municipal corporations and private ones were simply two species of body politic and corporate, treated alike in terms of their legal status as persons capable of suing and being sued.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 W. Glover, A Practical Treatise on the Law of Municipal Corporations 41 (1837) (Municipal corporations have, as an attribute necessarily and inseparably incident to every corporation, the ability [t]o sue and be sued, … and do all other acts as natural persons may); see also 1 J. Dillon, The Law of Municipal Corporations 92 (rev. 2d ed. 1873).  Indeed, [t]he archetypal American corporation of the eighteenth century [was] the municipality; only in the early nineteenth century did private corporations become widespread.  M. Horwitz, The Transformation of American Law, 17801860, p. 112 (1977).  This history explains how the Court in 
				<em>
					Cowles
				</em>
				 could conclude automatically and without discussion that municipal corporations, like private ones, should be treated as natural persons for virtually all purposes of constitutional and statutory analysis.

431, that the word person may extend and be applied to bodies politic and corporate … unless the context shows that [it was] intended to be used in a more limited sense.  Cf. J. Angell &amp; S. Ames, A Treatise on the Law of Private Corporations Aggregate 4 (rev. 3d ed. 1846) (The construction is, that when persons are mentioned in a statute, corporations are included if they fall within the general reason and design of the statute).

				  But the old text merely shows that any person in the land or naval forces was directed at natural persons.

				The other contextual evidence cited by the County is the history of the FCA.  We recounted in

				 that Congresss primary concern in 1863 was  stopping the massive frauds perpetrated by large [private] contractors during the Civil War.   529 U. S., at 781 (quoting

, but adding [private]).  Local governments, the County says, were not players in the game of war profiteering that the FCA was meant to stop.  Of course, this is true, but in no way does it affect the fact that Congress wrote expansively, meaning to reach all types of fraud, without qualification, that might result in financial loss to the Government.

.  Whatever municipal corporations may have been doing in 1863, in 2003 local governments are commonly at the receiving end of all sorts of federal funding schemes and thus no less able than individuals or private corporations to impose on the federal fisc and exploit the exercise of the federal spending power.

				Nor is the application of this reading of the statute affected by the Countys alternative position, based on the evolution of the FCAs provisions for relief.  The Countys argument leads off, at least, with a sound premise about the historical tension between municipal liability and damages imposed as punishment.  Although it was well established in 1863 that a municipality, like a private corporation, was to be treated as a natural person subject to suit for a wide range of tortious activity, … this understanding did not extend to the award of punitive or exemplary damages,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">259</a>260 (1981)

				The County relies on this general statement in asking us to infer a remarkable consequence unstated in the 1986 amendments to the FCA.  As part of an effort to modernize the FCA, Congress then raised the fine from $2,000 to the current range of $5,000 to $10,000, and raised the ceiling on damages recoverable under §3729(a) from double to treble.

				<em>
					Stevens
				</em>
				, we spoke of this change as turning what had been a remedial provision into an essentially punitive one.  529 U. S., at 784, 785.  The County relies on this characterization to argue that, even if municipalities were covered by the term person from 1863 to 1986, Congresss adoption of a punitive remedy entailed the elimination of municipal liability in 1986.

				Although we did indeed find the punitive character of the treble damages provision a reason not to read person to include a State, see 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 785, it does not follow that the punitive feature has the force to show congressional intent to repeal implicitly the existing definition of that word, which included municipalities.  To begin with it is important to realize that treble damages have a compensatory side, serving remedial purposes in addition to punitive objectives.  See,

.  While the tipping point between pay-back and punishment defies general formulation, being dependent on the workings of a particular statute and the course of particular litigation, the facts about the FCA show that the damages multiplier has compensatory traits along with the punitive.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				There is no question that some liability beyond the amount of the fraud is usually necessary to compensate the Government completely for the costs, delays, and inconveniences occasioned by fraudulent claims.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">445</a> (1989)
 (noting that the Governments injury includes not merely the amount of the fraud itself, but also ancillary costs, such as the costs of detection and investigation, that routinely attend the Governments efforts to root out deceptive practices directed at the public purse).  The most obvious indication that the treble damages ceiling has a remedial place under this statute is its 
				<em>
					qui tam
				</em>
				 feature with its possibility of diverting as much as 30 percent of the Governments recovery to a private relator who began the action.  In
				<em>
					 qui tam
				</em>
				 cases the rough difference between double and triple damages may well serve not to punish, but to quicken the self-interest of some private plaintiff who can spot violations and start litigating to compensate the Government, while benefiting himself as well.  See 
				<em>
					United States ex rel. Marcus
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Hess,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/317/537" class="subref" title="subref">317 U. S. 537</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">547</a> (1943)
.  The treble feature thus leaves the remaining double damages to provide elements of make-whole recovery beyond mere recoupment of the fraud.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Bornstein
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 315, and n. 11.  It may also be necessary for full recovery even when there is no 
				<em>
					qui tam
				</em>
				 relator to be paid.  The FCA has no separate provision for prejudgment interest, which is usually thought essential to compensation, see, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Kansas
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Colorado, 
				</em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">10</a>11 (2001)
, and might well be substantial given the FCAs long statute of limitations, §3731(b).  Nor does the FCA expressly provide for the consequential damages that typically come with recovery for fraud, see Restatement (Second) of Torts §549(1)(b), and Comment 
				<em>
					d
				</em>
				 (1976).

				Thus, although 
				<em>
					Stevens
				</em>
				 recognized that the FCAs treble damages remedy is still punitive in that recovery will exceed full compensation in a good many cases, the force of this punitive nature in arguing against municipal liability is not as robust as if it were a pure penalty in all cases.  Treble damages certainly does not equate with classic punitive damages, which leaves the jury with open-ended discretion over the amount and so raises two concerns specific to municipal defendants.  One is that a local governments taxing power makes it an easy target for an unduly generous jury.  See 
				<em>
					Newport
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra,
				</em>
				 at 270271.  But under the FCA, the jury is open to no such temptation; if it finds liability, its instruction is to return a verdict for actual damages, for which the court alone then determines any multiplier, just as the court alone sets any separate penalty.  §3729(a); see 277 F. 3d, at 978.  There is mitigation, also, for the second worry, that blameless or unknowing taxpayers will be unfairly taxed for the wrongdoing of local officials.  
				<em>
					Newport
				</em>
				, 453 U. S., at 267.  This very case shows how FCA liability may expose only local taxpayers who have already enjoyed the indirect benefit of the fraud, to the extent that the federal money has already been passed along in lower taxes or expanded services.  Cf. 
				<em>
					ibid.
				</em>
				  The question in such cases is whether the local taxpayer should make up for an undeserved benefit, or the federal taxpayer be permanently out of pocket, a question that can be answered in any given case, not by an opportunistic 
				<em>
					qui tam
				</em>
				 relator, but by a combination of the judges discretion and the Governments power to intervene and dismiss or settle an action, see §3730(c)(2).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The presumption against punitive damages thus brings only limited vigor to the Countys aid.  Working against the Countys position, however, is a different presumption, this one at full strength: the cardinal rule … that repeals by implication are disfavored.  
				<em>
					Posadas
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					National City Bank,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/296/497" class="subref" title="subref">296 U. S. 497</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">503</a> (1936)
.  Inferring repeal from legislative silence is hazardous at best, and error seems overwhelmingly likely in the notion that the 1986 amendments wordlessly redefined person to exclude municipalities.  The Countys argument, it must be remembered, is not merely that the treble damages feature of the 1986 amendments was meant to bypass municipal corporations; the argument is that the treble damages amendment must be read to eliminate the FCAs coverage of municipal corporations entirely, after being the statutory law for over a century.  This would be a hard case to make in the abstract, but it is impossible when we consider what is known about the object of the amendments in 1986.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The basic purpose of the 1986 amendments was to make the FCA a more useful tool against fraud in modern times.  S. Rep., at 2.  Because Congress was concerned about pervasive fraud in all Government programs, 
				<em>
					ibid.
				</em>
				, it allowed private parties to sue even based on information already in the Governments possession, see 
				<em>
					Hughes Aircraft Co.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">946</a> (1997)
; increased the Governments measure of recovery; and enhanced the incentives for relators to bring suit
				<em>
					.
				</em>
				  Yet the County urges that in so doing Congress made local governments, which today often administer or receive federal funds, immune not only from treble damages but from any liability whatsoever under the FCA.  Congress could have done that, of course, but it makes no sense to suggest Congress did it under its breath.

						 Indeed, there is some evidence that Congress affirmatively endorsed municipal liability when it passed the 1986 amendments.  See S. Rep., at 8 (noting that [t]he term person is used in its broad sense to include partnerships, associations, and corporations … as well as States and political subdivisions thereof (citing, inter alia, Monell v.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/436/658" class="subref" title="subref">436 U. S. 658</a> (1978)

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/529/765" class="subref" title="subref">529 U. S. 765</a> (2000)

First, the County contrasts §3729 with the Civil Investigative Demand provision enacted as part of the 1986 amendments, §3733, which expressly includes both States and local governments in the definition of person.  In Stevens, supra, at 783784, we read that express reference in the later §3733 to confirm the reading of the earlier §3729, which was based on a common understanding in 1863 that person did not include a State; but person did presumptively include a municipality in 1863.


The County also argues it is not sensible to expose local governments to FCA liability but not to liability under the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act of 1986 (PFCRA), Pub. L. 99509, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">100</a>Stat.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/31/3801.html" class="subref" title="subref">31 U. S. C. §3801</a> et seq.), a statute enacted just before the FCA amendments and designed to operate in tandem with the FCA.  Stevens, supra, at 786, n. 17.  The PFCRA prohibits the same conduct as the FCA and specifically defines a person subject to liability as any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or private organization.  §3801(a)(6).  Even assuming the County is correct that local governments are not covered by the PFCRA despite the term corporation, this is hardly a weighty argument for an implied repeal of municipal liability under the FCA, a separately enacted statute.

				The fraud in this case allegedly occurred in administering a $5 million grant from the National Institute of Drug Abuse to Cook County Hospital, owned and operated as the name implies, with the object of studying a treatment regimen for pregnant drug addicts.  The grant was subject to a variety of conditions, including the terms of a compliance plan meant to assure that the study would jibe with federal regulations for research on human subjects.  Administration of the study was later transferred to the Hektoen Institute for Medical Research, a nonprofit research organization affiliated with the hospital.  Respondent, Dr. Janet Chandler, ran the study from September 1993 until the institute fired her in January 1995.

				Essentially conceding that private corporations were taken to be persons when the FCA was passed in 1863, the County argues that municipal corporations were not so understood until six years later, when 
				<em>
					Cowles
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Mercer County,
				</em>
				 7 Wall. 118 (1869), applied the 
				<em>

				<em>
					Cowles
				</em>
				, however, was not an extension of principle but a natural recognition of an understanding going back at least to Coke, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, that municipal corporations and private ones were simply two species of body politic and corporate, treated alike in terms of their legal status as persons capable of suing and being sued.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 W. Glover, A Practical Treatise on the Law of Municipal Corporations 41 (1837) (Municipal corporations have, as an attribute necessarily and inseparably incident to every corporation, the ability [t]o sue and be sued, … and do all other acts as natural persons may); see also 1 J. Dillon, The Law of Municipal Corporations 92 (rev. 2d ed. 1873).  Indeed, [t]he archetypal American corporation of the eighteenth century [was] the municipality; only in the early nineteenth century did private corporations become widespread.  M. Horwitz, The Transformation of American Law, 17801860, p. 112 (1977).  This history explains how the Court in 
				<em>
					Cowles
				</em>
				 could conclude automatically and without discussion that municipal corporations, like private ones, should be treated as natural persons for virtually all purposes of constitutional and statutory analysis.

<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">16</a>Stat.
431, that the word person may extend and be applied to bodies politic and corporate … unless the context shows that [it was] intended to be used in a more limited sense.  Cf. J. Angell &amp; S. Ames, A Treatise on the Law of Private Corporations Aggregate 4 (rev. 3d ed. 1846) (The construction is, that when persons are mentioned in a statute, corporations are included if they fall within the general reason and design of the statute).

				First, it says that the statutory text is inherently inconsistent with local governmental liability, Brief for Petitioner 13, owing to the references of the original enactment to any person in the land or naval forces of the United States and any person not in the military or naval forces of the United States, together with a provision imposing criminal liability, including imprisonment, on defendants in the latter category, see Act of Mar. 2, 1863, ch. 67, §§1, 3,

				  But the old text merely shows that any person in the land or naval forces was directed at natural persons.  The second phrase, covering all other persons, could not have been that limited, or even private corporations would be outside the FCAs coverage, a reading that not even the County espouses and one that we seriously doubted in

				, 529 U. S., at 782.  As for the FCAs reference to criminal liability, [t]he short answer is that it has not been regarded as anomalous to require compliance by municipalities with the substantive standards of … federal laws which impose [both civil and criminal] sanctions upon persons. 

				The other contextual evidence cited by the County is the history of the FCA.  We recounted in 
				<em>
					Stevens
				</em>
				 that Congresss primary concern in 1863 was  stopping the massive frauds perpetrated by large [private] contractors during the Civil War.   529 U. S., at 781 (quoting

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">309</a> (1976)
, but adding [private]).  Local governments, the County says, were not players in the game of war profiteering that the FCA was meant to stop.  Of course, this is true, but in no way does it affect the fact that Congress wrote expansively, meaning to reach all types of fraud, without qualification, that might result in financial loss to the Government.

.  Whatever municipal corporations may have been doing in 1863, in 2003 local governments are commonly at the receiving end of all sorts of federal funding schemes and thus no less able than individuals or private corporations to impose on the federal fisc and exploit the exercise of the federal spending power.  Cf.

				Nor is the application of this reading of the statute affected by the Countys alternative position, based on the evolution of the FCAs provisions for relief.  The Countys argument leads off, at least, with a sound premise about the historical tension between municipal liability and damages imposed as punishment.  Although it was well established in 1863 that a municipality, like a private corporation, was to be treated as a natural person subject to suit for a wide range of tortious activity, … this understanding did not extend to the award of punitive or exemplary damages,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">259</a>260 (1981)

				The County relies on this general statement in asking us to infer a remarkable consequence unstated in the 1986 amendments to the FCA.  As part of an effort to modernize the FCA, Congress then raised the fine from $2,000 to the current range of $5,000 to $10,000, and raised the ceiling on damages recoverable under §3729(a) from double to treble.

				<em>
					Stevens
				</em>
				, we spoke of this change as turning what had been a remedial provision into an essentially punitive one.  529 U. S., at 784, 785.  The County relies on this characterization to argue that, even if municipalities were covered by the term person from 1863 to 1986, Congresss adoption of a punitive remedy entailed the elimination of municipal liability in 1986.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Although we did indeed find the punitive character of the treble damages provision a reason not to read person to include a State, see 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 785, it does not follow that the punitive feature has the force to show congressional intent to repeal implicitly the existing definition of that word, which included municipalities.  To begin with it is important to realize that treble damages have a compensatory side, serving remedial purposes in addition to punitive objectives.  See,

.  While the tipping point between pay-back and punishment defies general formulation, being dependent on the workings of a particular statute and the course of particular litigation, the facts about the FCA show that the damages multiplier has compensatory traits along with the punitive.

				There is no question that some liability beyond the amount of the fraud is usually necessary to compensate the Government completely for the costs, delays, and inconveniences occasioned by fraudulent claims.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">445</a> (1989)
 (noting that the Governments injury includes not merely the amount of the fraud itself, but also ancillary costs, such as the costs of detection and investigation, that routinely attend the Governments efforts to root out deceptive practices directed at the public purse).  The most obvious indication that the treble damages ceiling has a remedial place under this statute is its 
				<em>
					qui tam
				</em>
				 feature with its possibility of diverting as much as 30 percent of the Governments recovery to a private relator who began the action.  In
				<em>
					 qui tam
				</em>
				 cases the rough difference between double and triple damages may well serve not to punish, but to quicken the self-interest of some private plaintiff who can spot violations and start litigating to compensate the Government, while benefiting himself as well.  See 
				<em>
					United States ex rel. Marcus
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Hess,
				</em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">547</a> (1943)
.  The treble feature thus leaves the remaining double damages to provide elements of make-whole recovery beyond mere recoupment of the fraud.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Bornstein
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 315, and n. 11.  It may also be necessary for full recovery even when there is no 
				<em>
					qui tam
				</em>
				 relator to be paid.  The FCA has no separate provision for prejudgment interest, which is usually thought essential to compensation, see, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Kansas
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Colorado,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">10</a>11 (2001)
, and might well be substantial given the FCAs long statute of limitations, §3731(b).  Nor does the FCA expressly provide for the consequential damages that typically come with recovery for fraud, see Restatement (Second) of Torts §549(1)(b), and Comment 
				<em>
					d
				</em>
				 (1976).

				Thus, although 
				<em>
					Stevens
				</em>
				 recognized that the FCAs treble damages remedy is still punitive in that recovery will exceed full compensation in a good many cases, the force of this punitive nature in arguing against municipal liability is not as robust as if it were a pure penalty in all cases.  Treble damages certainly does not equate with classic punitive damages, which leaves the jury with open-ended discretion over the amount and so raises two concerns specific to municipal defendants.  One is that a local governments taxing power makes it an easy target for an unduly generous jury.  See 
				<em>
					Newport
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra,
				</em>
				 at 270271.  But under the FCA, the jury is open to no such temptation; if it finds liability, its instruction is to return a verdict for actual damages, for which the court alone then determines any multiplier, just as the court alone sets any separate penalty.  §3729(a); see 277 F. 3d, at 978.  There is mitigation, also, for the second worry, that blameless or unknowing taxpayers will be unfairly taxed for the wrongdoing of local officials.  
				<em>
					Newport
				</em>
				, 453 U. S., at 267.  This very case shows how FCA liability may expose only local taxpayers who have already enjoyed the indirect benefit of the fraud, to the extent that the federal money has already been passed along in lower taxes or expanded services.  Cf. 
				<em>
					ibid.
				</em>
				  The question in such cases is whether the local taxpayer should make up for an undeserved benefit, or the federal taxpayer be permanently out of pocket, a question that can be answered in any given case, not by an opportunistic 
				<em>
					qui tam
				</em>
				 relator, but by a combination of the judges discretion and the Governments power to intervene and dismiss or settle an action, see §3730(c)(2).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The presumption against punitive damages thus brings only limited vigor to the Countys aid.  Working against the Countys position, however, is a different presumption, this one at full strength: the cardinal rule … that repeals by implication are disfavored.  
				<em>
					Posadas
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					National City Bank,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/296/497" class="subref" title="subref">296 U. S. 497</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">503</a> (1936)
.  Inferring repeal from legislative silence is hazardous at best, and error seems overwhelmingly likely in the notion that the 1986 amendments wordlessly redefined person to exclude municipalities.  The Countys argument, it must be remembered, is not merely that the treble damages feature of the 1986 amendments was meant to bypass municipal corporations; the argument is that the treble damages amendment must be read to eliminate the FCAs coverage of municipal corporations entirely, after being the statutory law for over a century.  This would be a hard case to make in the abstract, but it is impossible when we consider what is known about the object of the amendments in 1986.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The basic purpose of the 1986 amendments was to make the FCA a more useful tool against fraud in modern times.  S. Rep., at 2.  Because Congress was concerned about pervasive fraud in all Government programs, 
				<em>
					ibid.
				</em>
				, it allowed private parties to sue even based on information already in the Governments possession, see 
				<em>
					Hughes Aircraft Co.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					United States ex rel. Schumer,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">946</a> (1997)
; increased the Governments measure of recovery; and enhanced the incentives for relators to bring suit
				<em>
					.
				</em>
				  Yet the County urges that in so doing Congress made local governments, which today often administer or receive federal funds, immune not only from treble damages but from any liability whatsoever under the FCA.  Congress could have done that, of course, but it makes no sense to suggest Congress did it under its breath.

						 The County and some of its supporting amici urge a further distinction between full-fledged municipal corporations such as towns and cities, which were incorporated at the request of their inhabitants, and quasi corporations such as counties, which were unilateral creations of the State.  See Barnes v. District of Columbia, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/91/540" class="subref" title="subref">91 U. S. 540</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">552</a> (1876)
.  While the liability of quasi corporations at common law may have differed from that of municipal corporations, see ibid., both were treated equally as legal persons.  Indeed, Cowles itself applied to an Illinois county like Cook County.

						 The treble damages provision was, in a way, adopted by Congress as a substitute for consequential damages.  The Senate version of the bill proposed consequential damages on top of treble damages, while the House version proposed consequential damages plus double damages.  See S. Rep. No. 99345, p. 39 (1986) (hereinafter S. Rep.); H. R. Rep. No. 99660, p. 20 (1986).  Ultimately, the Senates treble figure was adopted and the consequential damages provision dropped.

						 Indeed, there is some evidence that Congress affirmatively endorsed municipal liability when it passed the 1986 amendments.  See S. Rep., at 8 (noting that [t]he term person is used in its broad sense to include partnerships, associations, and corporations … as well as States and political subdivisions thereof (citing, inter alia, Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs., 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/436/658" class="subref" title="subref">436 U. S. 658</a> (1978)
).  Although in Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v. United States ex rel. Stevens, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/529/765" class="subref" title="subref">529 U. S. 765</a> (2000)
, we considered this evidence insufficient to overcome the background presumption that States are not persons, in the present case the statement belies the Countys argument that Congress meant to change the contrary presumption applicable to local governments and to remove municipal liability.

        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-11" href="#ZO-11ref">

						 The presumption against implied repeal also explains why two of the Countys subsidiary arguments cannot succeed here, despite the fact that we gave them credence in Stevens.  First, the County contrasts §3729 with the Civil Investigative Demand provision enacted as part of the 1986 amendments, §3733, which expressly includes both States and local governments in the definition of person.  In Stevens, supra, at 783784, we read that express reference in the later §3733 to confirm the reading of the earlier §3729, which was based on a common understanding in 1863 that person did not include a State; but person did presumptively include a municipality in 1863.


The County also argues it is not sensible to expose local governments to FCA liability but not to liability under the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act of 1986 (PFCRA), Pub. L. 99509, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">100</a>Stat.
1934 (codified at 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/31/3801.html" class="subref" title="subref">31 U. S. C. §3801</a> et seq.), a statute enacted just before the FCA amendments and designed to operate in tandem with the FCA.  Stevens, supra, at 786, n. 17.  The PFCRA prohibits the same conduct as the FCA and specifically defines a person subject to liability as any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or private organization.  §3801(a)(6).  Even assuming the County is correct that local governments are not covered by the PFCRA despite the term corporation, this is hardly a weighty argument for an implied repeal of municipal liability under the FCA, a separately enacted statute.

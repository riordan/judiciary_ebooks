				Parts IIB and IIC are problematic for other reasons as well.  In Part IIB, the Court declines to resolve the Governments unitary-waters argument on the ground that it was not raised or decided below.  See

That the argument was not phrased in the same terms or argued with the same clarity does not mean it was not made.  I see no point in directing the Court of Appeals to consider an argument it has already rejected.

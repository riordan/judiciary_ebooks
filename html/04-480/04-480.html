				Respondent companies distribute free software that allows computer users to share electronic files through peer-to-peer networks, so called because the computers communicate directly with each other, not through central servers.  Although such networks can be used to share any type of digital file, recipients of respondents software have mostly used them to share copyrighted music and video files without authorization.  Seeking damages and an injunction, a group of movie studios and other copyright holders (hereinafter MGM) sued respondents for their users copyright infringements, alleging that respondents knowingly and intentionally distributed their software to enable users to infringe copyrighted works in violation of the Copyright Act.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				
				    
				Discovery revealed that billions of files are shared across peer-to-peer networks each month.  Respondents are aware that users employ their software primarily to download copyrighted files, although the decentralized networks do not reveal which files are copied, and when.  Respondents have sometimes learned about the infringement directly when users have e-mailed questions regarding copyrighted works, and respondents have replied with guidance.  Respondents are not merely passive recipients of information about infringement.  The record is replete with evidence that when they began to distribute their free software, each of them clearly voiced the objective that recipients use the software to download copyrighted works and took active steps to encourage infringement.  After the notorious file-sharing service, Napster, was sued by copyright holders for facilitating copyright infringement, both respondents promoted and marketed themselves as Napster alternatives.  They receive no revenue from users, but, instead, generate income by selling advertising space, then streaming the advertising to their users.  As the number of users increases, advertising opportunities are worth more.  There is no evidence that either respondent made an effort to filter copyrighted material from users downloads or otherwise to impede the sharing of copyrighted files.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				
				    
				While acknowledging that respondents users had directly infringed MGMs copyrights, the District Court nonetheless granted respondents summary judgment as to liability arising from distribution of their software.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed.  It read 
				<em>
					Sony Corp. of America
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Universal City Studios, Inc.
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/464/417" class="subref" title="subref">464 U. S. 417</a>, as holding that the distribution of a commercial product capable of substantial noninfringing uses could not give rise to contributory liability for infringement unless the distributor had actual knowledge of specific instances of infringement and failed to act on that knowledge.  Because the appeals court found respondents software to be capable of substantial noninfringing uses and because respondents had no actual knowledge of infringement owing to the softwares decentralized architecture, the court held that they were not liable.  It also held that they did not materially contribute to their users infringement because the users themselves searched for, retrieved, and stored the infringing files, with no involvement by respondents beyond providing the software in the first place.  Finally, the court held that respondents could not be held liable under a vicarious infringement theory because they did not monitor or control the softwares use, had no agreed-upon right or current ability to supervise its use, and had no independent duty to police infringement.

					Held: 
				</em>
				One who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright, as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement, going beyond mere distribution with knowledge of third-party action, is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties using the device, regardless of the devices lawful uses.  Pp. 1024.
			</p>
        <p class="SYLCTF">
				
				    
				(a) The tension between the competing values of supporting creativity through copyright protection and promoting technological innovation by limiting infringement liability is the subject of this case.  Despite offsetting considerations, the argument for imposing indirect liability here is powerful, given the number of infringing downloads that occur daily using respondents software.  When a widely shared product is used to commit infringement, it may be impossible to enforce rights in the protected work effectively against all direct infringers, so that the only practical alternative is to go against the devices distributor for secondary liability on a theory of contributory or vicarious infringement.  One infringes contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement, and infringes vicariously by profiting from direct infringement while declining to exercise the right to stop or limit it.  Although [t]he Copyright Act does not expressly render anyone liable for [anothers] infringement, 
				<em>
					Sony, 
				</em>
				464 U. S.
				<em>
					, 
				</em>
				at 434, these secondary liability doctrines emerged from common law principles and are well established in the law, 
				<em>
					e.g., id.
				</em>
				, at 486.  Pp. 1013. 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				(b) 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 addressed a claim that secondary liability for infringement can arise from the very distribution of a commercial product.  There, copyright holders sued Sony, the manufacturer of videocassette recorders, claiming that it was contributorily liable for the infringement that occurred when VCR owners taped copyrighted programs.  The evidence showed that the VCRs principal use was time-shifting, 
				<em>
					i.e.,
				</em>
				 taping a program for later viewing at a more convenient time, which the Court found to be a fair, noninfringing use.  464 U. S., at 423424.  Moreover, there was no evidence that Sony had desired to bring about taping in violation of copyright or taken active steps to increase its profits from unlawful taping.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 438.  On those facts, the only conceivable basis for liability was on a theory of contributory infringement through distribution of a product.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 439.  Because the VCR was capable of commercially significant noninfringing uses, the Court held that Sony was not liable.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 442.  This theory reflected patent laws traditional staple article of commerce doctrine that distribution of a component of a patented device will not violate the patent if it is suitable for use in other ways.  35 U. S. C §271(c).  The doctrine absolves the equivocal conduct of selling an item with lawful and unlawful uses and limits liability to instances of more acute fault.  In this case, the Ninth Circuit misread 
				<em>
					Sony 
				</em>
				to mean that when a product is capable of substantial lawful use, the producer cannot be held contributorily liable for third parties infringing use of it, even when an actual purpose to cause infringing use is shown, unless the distributors had specific knowledge of infringement at a time when they contributed to the infringement and failed to act upon that information.  
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 did not displace other secondary liability theories.  Pp. 1317. 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				(c) Nothing in 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 requires courts to ignore evidence of intent to promote infringement if such evidence exists.  It was never meant to foreclose rules of fault-based liability derived from the common law.  464 U. S., at 439.  Where evidence goes beyond a products characteristics or the knowledge that it may be put to infringing uses, and shows statements or actions directed to promoting infringement, 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				s staple-article rule will not preclude liability.  At common law a copyright or patent defendant who not only expected but invoked [infringing use] by advertisement was liable for infringement.  
				<em>
					Kalem Co.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Harper Brothers
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/222/55" class="subref" title="subref">222 U. S. 55</a>.  The rule on inducement of infringement as developed in the early cases is no different today.  Evidence of active steps taken to encourage direct infringement, such as advertising an infringing use or instructing how to engage in an infringing use, shows an affirmative intent that the product be used to infringe, and overcomes the laws reluctance to find liability when a defendant merely sells a commercial product suitable for some lawful use.  A rule that premises liability on purposeful, culpable expression and conduct does nothing to compromise legitimate commerce or discourage innovation having a lawful promise.  Pp. 1720. 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				(d) On the record presented, respondents unlawful objective is unmistakable.  The classic instance of inducement is by advertisement or solicitation that broadcasts a message designed to stimulate others to commit violations.  MGM argues persuasively that such a message is shown here.  Three features of the evidence of intent are particularly notable.  First, each of the respondents showed itself to be aiming to satisfy a known source of demand for copyright infringement, the market comprising former Napster users.  Respondents efforts to supply services to former Napster users indicate a principal, if not exclusive, intent to bring about infringement.  Second, neither respondent attempted to develop filtering tools or other mechanisms to diminish the infringing activity using their software.  While the Ninth Circuit treated that failure as irrelevant because respondents lacked an independent duty to monitor their users activity, this evidence underscores their intentional facilitation of their users infringement.  Third, respondents make money by selling advertising space, then by directing ads to the screens of computers employing their software.  The more their software is used, the more ads are sent out and the greater the advertising revenue.  Since the extent of the softwares use determines the gain to the distributors, the commercial sense of their enterprise turns on high-volume use, which the record shows is infringing.  This evidence alone would not justify an inference of unlawful intent, but its import is clear in the entire records context.  Pp. 2023. 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				(e) In addition to intent to bring about infringement and distribution of a device suitable for infringing use, the inducement theory requires evidence of actual infringement by recipients of the device, the software in this case.  There is evidence of such infringement on a gigantic scale.  Because substantial evidence supports MGM on all elements, summary judgment for respondents was error.  On remand, reconsideration of MGMs summary judgment motion will be in order.  Pp. 2324.

				The question is under what circumstances the distributor of a product capable of both lawful and unlawful use is liable for acts of copyright infringement by third parties using the product.  We hold that one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright, as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement, is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties.

				Respondents, Grokster, Ltd., and StreamCast Networks, Inc., defendants in the trial court, distribute free software products that allow computer users to share electronic files through peer-to-peer networks, so called because users computers communicate directly with each other, not through central servers.  The advantage of peer-to-peer networks over information networks of other types shows up in their substantial and growing popularity.  Because they need no central computer server to mediate the exchange of information or files among users, the high-bandwidth communications capacity for a server may be dispensed with, and the need for costly server storage space is eliminated.  Since copies of a file (particularly a popular one) are available on many users computers, file requests and retrievals may be faster than on other types of networks, and since file exchanges do not travel through a server, communications can take place between any computers that remain connected to the network without risk that a glitch in the server will disable the network in its entirety.  Given these benefits in security, cost, and efficiency, peer-to-peer networks are employed to store and distribute electronic files by universities, government agencies, corporations, and libraries, among others.

				Other users of peer-to-peer networks include individual recipients of Groksters and StreamCasts software, and although the networks that they enjoy through using the software can be used to share any type of digital file, they have prominently employed those networks in sharing copyrighted music and video files without authorization.  A group of copyright holders (MGM for short, but including motion picture studios, recording companies, songwriters, and music publishers) sued Grokster and StreamCast for their users copyright infringements, alleging that they knowingly and intentionally distributed their software to enable users to reproduce and distribute the copyrighted works in violation of the Copyright Act,

				Discovery during the litigation revealed the way the software worked, the business aims of each defendant company, and the predilections of the users.  Groksters eponymous software employs what is known as FastTrack technology, a protocol developed by others and licensed to Grokster.  StreamCast distributes a very similar product except that its software, called Morpheus, relies on what is known as Gnutella technology.
				<a name="ZO-3ref" href="#ZO-3" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>
					3
				</b>
                </sup>
            </a>
				  A user who downloads and installs either software possesses the protocol to send requests for files directly to the computers of others using software compatible with FastTrack or Gnutella.  On the FastTrack network opened by the Grokster software, the users request goes to a computer given an indexing capacity by the software and designated a supernode, or to some other computer with comparable power and capacity to collect temporary indexes of the files available on the computers of users connected to it.  The supernode (or indexing computer) searches its own index and may communicate the search request to other supernodes.  If the file is found, the supernode discloses its location to the computer requesting it, and the requesting user can download the file directly from the computer located.  The copied file is placed in a designated sharing folder on the requesting users computer, where it is available for other users to download in turn, along with any other file in that folder.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In the Gnutella network made available by Morpheus, the process is mostly the same, except that in some versions of the Gnutella protocol there are no supernodes.  In these versions, peer computers using the protocol communicate directly with each other.  When a user enters a search request into the Morpheus software, it sends the request to computers connected with it, which in turn pass the request along to other connected peers.  The search results are communicated to the requesting computer, and the user can download desired files directly from peers computers.  As this description indicates, Grokster and StreamCast use no servers to intercept the content of the search requests or to mediate the file transfers conducted by users of the software, there being no central point through which the substance of the communications passes in either direction.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Although Grokster and StreamCast do not therefore know when particular files are copied, a few searches using their software would show what is available on the networks the software reaches.  MGM commissioned a statistician to conduct a systematic search, and his study showed that nearly 90% of the files available for download on the FastTrack system were copyrighted works.

            </a>
				  Grokster and StreamCast dispute this figure, raising methodological problems and arguing that free copying even of copyrighted works may be authorized by the rightholders.  They also argue that potential noninfringing uses of their software are significant in kind, even if infrequent in practice.  Some musical performers, for example, have gained new audiences by distributing their copyrighted works for free across peer-to-peer networks, and some distributors of unprotected content have used peer-to-peer networks to disseminate files, Shakespeare being an example.  Indeed, StreamCast has given Morpheus users the opportunity to download the briefs in this very case, though their popularity has not been quantified.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				As for quantification, the parties anecdotal and statistical evidence entered thus far to show the content available on the FastTrack and Gnutella networks does not say much about which files are actually downloaded by users, and no one can say how often the software is used to obtain copies of unprotected material.  But MGMs evidence gives reason to think that the vast majority of users downloads are acts of infringement, and because well over 100 million copies of the software in question are known to have been downloaded, and billions of files are shared across the FastTrack and Gnutella networks each month, the probable scope of copyright infringement is staggering.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Grokster and StreamCast concede the infringement in most downloads, Brief for Respondents 10, n. 6, and it is uncontested that they are aware that users employ their software primarily to download copyrighted files, even if the decentralized FastTrack and Gnutella networks fail to reveal which files are being copied, and when.  From time to time, moreover, the companies have learned about their users infringement directly, as from users who have sent e-mail to each company with questions about playing copyrighted movies they had downloaded, to whom the companies have responded with guidance.

				Grokster and StreamCast are not, however, merely passive recipients of information about infringing use.  The record is replete with evidence that from the moment Grokster and StreamCast began to distribute their free software, each one clearly voiced the objective that recipients use it to download copyrighted works, and each took active steps to encourage infringement.

				The evidence that Grokster sought to capture the market of former Napster users is sparser but revealing, for Grokster launched its own OpenNap system called Swaptor and inserted digital codes into its Web site so that computer users using Web search engines to look for Napster or [f]ree filesharing would be directed to the Grokster Web site, where they could download the Grokster software.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In addition to this evidence of express promotion, marketing, and intent to promote further, the business models employed by Grokster and StreamCast confirm that their principal object was use of their software to download copyrighted works.  Grokster and StreamCast receive no revenue from users, who obtain the software itself for nothing.  Instead, both companies generate income by selling advertising space, and they stream the advertising to Grokster and Morpheus users while they are employing the programs.  As the number of users of each program increases, advertising opportunities become worth more.  Cf. App. 539, 804.  While there is doubtless some demand for free Shakespeare, the evidence shows that substantive volume is a function of free access to copyrighted work.  Users seeking Top 40 songs, for example, or the latest release by Modest Mouse, are certain to be far more numerous than those seeking a free Decameron, and Grokster and StreamCast translated that demand into dollars.

				Finally, there is no evidence that either company made an effort to filter copyrighted material from users downloads or otherwise impede the sharing of copyrighted files.

				After discovery, the parties on each side of the case cross-moved for summary judgment.  The District Court limited its consideration to the asserted liability of Grokster and StreamCast for distributing the current versions of their software, leaving aside whether either was liable for damages arising from 
				<em>
					past
				</em>
				 versions of their software, or from other past activities.  259 F. Supp. 2d 1029, 1033 (CD Cal. 2003).  The District Court held that those who used the Grokster and Morpheus software to download copyrighted media files directly infringed MGMs copyrights, a conclusion not contested on appeal, but the court nonetheless granted summary judgment in favor of Grokster and StreamCast as to any liability arising from distribution of the then current versions of their software.  Distributing that software gave rise to no liability in the courts view, because its use did not provide the distributors with actual knowledge of specific acts of infringement.

				The Court of Appeals affirmed.  380 F. 3d 1154 (CA9 2004).  In the courts analysis, a defendant was liable as a contributory infringer when it had knowledge of direct infringement and materially contributed to the infringement.  But the court read

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/464/417" class="subref" title="subref">464 U. S. 417</a> (1984)
, as holding that distribution of a commercial product capable of substantial noninfringing uses could not give rise to contributory liability for infringement unless the distributor had actual knowledge of specific instances of infringement and failed to act on that knowledge.  The fact that the software was capable of substantial noninfringing uses in the Ninth Circuits view meant that Grokster and StreamCast were not liable, because they had no such actual knowledge, owing to the decentralized architecture of their software.  The court also held that Grokster and StreamCast did not materially contribute to their users infringement because it was the users themselves who searched for, retrieved, and stored the infringing files, with no involvement by the defendants beyond providing the software in the first place.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Ninth Circuit also considered whether Grokster and StreamCast could be liable under a theory of vicarious infringement.  The court held against liability because the defendants did not monitor or control the use of the software, had no agreed-upon right or current ability to supervise its use, and had no independent duty to police infringement.  We granted certiorari.  543 U. S. ___ (2004).

				MGM and many of the

				The tension between the two values is the subject of this case, with its claim that digital distribution of copyrighted material threatens copyright holders as never before, because every copy is identical to the original, copying is easy, and many people (especially the young) use file-sharing software to download copyrighted works.  This very breadth of the softwares use may well draw the public directly into the debate over copyright policy, Peters, Brace Memorial Lecture: Copyright Enters the Public Domain, 51 J. Copyright Soc. 701, 705717 (2004) (address by Register of Copyrights), and the indications are that the ease of copying songs or movies using software like Groksters and Napsters is fostering disdain for copyright protection, Wu, When Code Isnt Law, 89 Va. L. Rev. 679, 724726 (2003).  As the case has been presented to us, these fears are said to be offset by the different concern that imposing liability, not only on infringers but on distributors of software based on its potential for unlawful use, could limit further development of beneficial technologies.

				The argument for imposing indirect liability in this case is, however, a powerful one, given the number of infringing downloads that occur every day using StreamCasts and Groksters software.  When a widely shared service or product is used to commit infringement, it may be impossible to enforce rights in the protected work effectively against all direct infringers, the only practical alternative being to go against the distributor of the copying device for secondary liability on a theory of contributory or vicarious infringement.

				Despite the currency of these principles of secondary liability, this Court has dealt with secondary copyright infringement in only one recent case, and because MGM has tailored its principal claim to our opinion there, a look at our earlier holding is in order.  In 
				<em>
					Sony Corp. 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					Universal City Studios
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, this Court addressed a claim that secondary liability for infringement can arise from the very distribution of a commercial product.  There, the product, novel at the time, was what we know today as the videocassette recorder or VCR.  Copyright holders sued Sony as the manufacturer, claiming it was contributorily liable for infringement that occurred when VCR owners taped copyrighted programs because it supplied the means used to infringe, and it had constructive knowledge that infringement would occur.  At the trial on the merits, the evidence showed that the principal use of the VCR was for  time-shifting,  or taping a program for later viewing at a more convenient time, which the Court found to be a fair, not an infringing, use.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 423424.  There was no evidence that Sony had expressed an object of bringing about taping in violation of copyright or had taken active steps to increase its profits from unlawful taping.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 438.  Although Sonys advertisements urged consumers to buy the VCR to  record favorite shows  or  build a library  of recorded programs,

				</em>
				, at 459 (
				<span class="smallcaps">

				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 424, 454455.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				On those facts, with no evidence of stated or indicated intent to promote infringing uses, the only conceivable basis for imposing liability was on a theory of contributory infringement arising from its sale of VCRs to consumers with knowledge that some would use them to infringe.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 439.  But because the VCR was capable of commercially significant noninfringing uses, we held the manufacturer could not be faulted solely on the basis of its distribution.

				This analysis reflected patent laws traditional staple article of commerce doctrine, now codified, that distribution of a component of a patented device will not violate the patent if it is suitable for use in other ways.

				The parties and many of the 
				<em>
					amici
				</em>
				 in this case think the key to resolving it is the 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 rule and, in particular, what it means for a product to be capable of commercially significant noninfringing uses. 
				<em>
					 Sony Corp.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Universal City Studios
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 442.  MGM advances the argument that granting summary judgment to Grokster and StreamCast as to their current activities gave too much weight to the value of innovative technology, and too little to the copyrights infringed by users of their software, given that 90% of works available on one of the networks was shown to be copyrighted.  Assuming the remaining 10% to be its noninfringing use, MGM says this should not qualify as substantial, and the Court should quantify Sony to the extent of holding that a product used principally for infringement does not qualify.  See Brief for Motion Picture Studio and Recording Company Petitioners 31.  As mentioned before, Grokster and StreamCast reply by citing evidence that their software can be used to reproduce public domain works, and they point to copyright holders who actually encourage copying.  Even if infringement is the principal practice with their software today, they argue, the noninfringing uses are significant and will grow.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We agree with MGM that the Court of Appeals misapplied 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				, which it read as limiting secondary liability quite beyond the circumstances to which the case applied.  
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 barred secondary liability based on presuming or imputing intent to cause infringement solely from the design or distribution of a product capable of substantial lawful use, which the distributor knows is in fact used for infringement.  The Ninth Circuit has read 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				s limitation to mean that whenever a product is capable of substantial lawful use, the producer can never be held contributorily liable for third parties infringing use of it; it read the rule as being this broad, even when an actual purpose to cause infringing use is shown by evidence independent of design and distribution of the product, unless the distributors had specific knowledge of infringement at a time at which they contributed to the infringement, and failed to act upon that information.  380 F. 3d, at 1162 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).  Because the Circuit found the StreamCast and Grokster software capable of substantial lawful use, it concluded on the basis of its reading of 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 that neither company could be held liable, since there was no showing that their software, being without any central server, afforded them knowledge of specific unlawful uses.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				This view of 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				, however, was error, converting the case from one about liability resting on imputed intent to one about liability on any theory.  Because 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 did not displace other theories of secondary liability, and because we find below that it was error to grant summary judgment to the companies on MGMs inducement claim, we  do not revisit 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 further, as MGM requests, to add a more quantified description of the point of balance between protection and commerce when liability rests solely on distribution with knowledge that unlawful use will occur.  It is enough to note that the Ninth Circuits judgment rested on an erroneous understanding of 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 and to leave further consideration of the 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 rule for a day when that may be required.

				 requires courts to ignore evidence of intent if there is such evidence, and the case was never meant to foreclose rules of fault-based liability derived from the common law.

				For the same reasons that 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 took the staple-article doctrine of patent law as a model for its copyright safe-harbor rule, the inducement rule, too, is a sensible one for copyright.  We adopt it here, holding that one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright, as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement, is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties.  We are, of course, mindful of the need to keep from trenching on regular commerce or discouraging the development of technologies with lawful and unlawful potential.  Accordingly, just as 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 did not find intentional inducement despite the knowledge of the VCR manufacturer that its device could be used to infringe, 464 U. S., at 439, n. 19, mere knowledge of infringing potential or of actual infringing uses would not be enough here to subject a distributor to liability.  Nor would ordinary acts incident to product distribution, such as offering customers technical support or product updates, support liability in themselves.  The inducement rule, instead, premises liability on purposeful, culpable expression and conduct, and thus does nothing to compromise legitimate commerce or discourage innovation having a lawful promise.

				The only apparent question about treating MGMs evidence as sufficient to withstand summary judgment under the theory of inducement goes to the need on MGMs part to adduce evidence that StreamCast and Grokster communicated an inducing message to their software users.  The classic instance of inducement is by advertisement or solicitation that broadcasts a message designed to stimulate others to commit violations.  MGM claims that such a message is shown here.  It is undisputed that StreamCast beamed onto the computer screens of users of Napster-compatible programs ads urging the adoption of its OpenNap program, which was designed, as its name implied, to invite the custom of patrons of Napster, then under attack in the courts for facilitating massive infringement.  Those who accepted StreamCasts OpenNap program were offered software to perform the same services, which a factfinder could conclude would readily have been understood in the Napster market as the ability to download copyrighted music files.  Grokster distributed an electronic newsletter containing links to articles promoting its softwares ability to access popular copyrighted music.  And anyone whose Napster or free file-sharing searches turned up a link to Grokster would have understood Grokster to be offering the same file-sharing ability as Napster, and to the same people who probably used Napster for infringing downloads; that would also have been the understanding of anyone offered Groksters suggestively named Swaptor software, its version of OpenNap.  And both companies communicated a clear message by responding affirmatively to requests for help in locating and playing copyrighted materials.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In StreamCasts case, of course, the evidence just described was supplemented by other unequivocal indications of unlawful purpose in the internal communications and advertising designs aimed at Napster users (When the lights went off at Napster … where did the users go?  App. 836 (ellipsis in original)).  Whether the messages were communicated is not to the point on this record.  The function of the message in the theory of inducement is to prove by a defendants own statements that his unlawful purpose disqualifies him from claiming protection (and incidentally to point to actual violators likely to be found among those who hear or read the message).  See 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 1719.  Proving that a message was sent out, then, is the preeminent but not exclusive way of showing that active steps were taken with the purpose of bringing about infringing acts, and of showing that infringing acts took place by using the device distributed.  Here, the summary judgment record is replete with other evidence that Grokster and StreamCast, unlike the manufacturer and distributor in 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				, acted with a purpose to cause copyright violations by use of software suitable for illegal use.  See 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 69.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Three features of this evidence of intent are particularly notable.  First, each company showed itself to be aiming to satisfy a known source of demand for copyright infringement, the market comprising former Napster users.  StreamCasts internal documents made constant reference to Napster, it initially distributed its Morpheus software through an OpenNap program compatible with Napster, it advertised its OpenNap program to Napster users, and its Morpheus software functions as Napster did except that it could be used to distribute more kinds of files, including copyrighted movies and software programs.  Groksters name is apparently derived from Napster, it too initially offered an OpenNap program, its softwares function is likewise comparable to Napsters, and it attempted to divert queries for Napster onto its own Web site.  Grokster and StreamCasts efforts to supply services to former Napster users, deprived of a mechanism to copy and distribute what were overwhelmingly infringing files, indicate a principal, if not exclusive, intent on the part of each to bring about infringement.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, this evidence of unlawful objective is given added significance by MGMs showing that neither company attempted to develop filtering tools or other mechanisms to diminish the infringing activity using their software.  While the Ninth Circuit treated the defendants failure to develop such tools as irrelevant because they lacked an independent duty to monitor their users activity, we think this evidence underscores Groksters and StreamCasts intentional facilitation of their users infringement.

            </a>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Third, there is a further complement to the direct evidence of unlawful objective.  It is useful to recall that StreamCast and Grokster make money by selling advertising space, by directing ads to the screens of computers employing their software.  As the record shows, the more the software is used, the more ads are sent out and the greater the advertising revenue becomes.  Since the extent of the softwares use determines the gain to the distributors, the commercial sense of their enterprise turns on high-volume use, which the record shows is infringing.
				<a name="ZO-13ref" href="#ZO-13" class="">
                <sup>

					13
				</b>
                </sup>
            </a>
				  This evidence alone would not justify an inference of unlawful intent, but viewed in the context of the entire record its import is clear.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The unlawful objective is unmistakable.
			</p>
        <p class="opcentered">
				B
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				In addition to intent to bring about infringement and distribution of a device suitable for infringing use, the inducement theory of course requires evidence of actual infringement by recipients of the device, the software in this case.  As the account of the facts indicates, there is evidence of infringement on a gigantic scale, and there is no serious issue of the adequacy of MGMs showing on this point in order to survive the companies summary judgment requests.  Although an exact calculation of infringing use, as a basis for a claim of damages, is subject to dispute, there is no question that the summary judgment evidence is at least adequate to entitle MGM to go forward with claims for damages and equitable relief.

				In sum, this case is significantly different from 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 and reliance on that case to rule in favor of StreamCast and Grokster was error.  
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 dealt with a claim of liability based solely on distributing a product with alternative lawful and unlawful uses, with knowledge that some users would follow the unlawful course.  The case struck a balance between the interests of protection and innovation by holding that the products capability of substantial lawful employment should bar the imputation of fault and consequent secondary liability for the unlawful acts of others.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				MGMs evidence in this case most obviously addresses a different basis of liability for distributing a product open to alternative uses.  Here, evidence of the distributors words and deeds going beyond distribution as such shows a purpose to cause and profit from third-party acts of copyright infringement.  If liability for inducing infringement is ultimately found, it will not be on the basis of presuming or imputing fault, but from inferring a patently illegal objective from statements and actions showing what that objective was.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				There is substantial evidence in MGMs favor on all elements of inducement, and summary judgment in favor of Grokster and StreamCast was error.  On remand, reconsideration of MGMs motion for summary judgment will be in order.

						 Peer-to-peer networks have disadvantages as well.  Searches on peer-to-peer networks may not reach and uncover all available files because search requests may not be transmitted to every computer on the network.  There may be redundant copies of popular files.  The creator of the software has no incentive to minimize storage or bandwidth consumption, the costs of which are borne by every user of the network.  Most relevant here, it is more difficult to control the content of files available for retrieval and the behavior of users.

Sony Corp., 480 F. Supp. 429, 457458 (CD Cal. 1979)).  In the present case MGM has argued a vicarious liability theory, which allows imposition of liability when the defendant profits directly from the infringement and has a right and ability to supervise the direct infringer, even if the defendant initially lacks knowledge of the infringement.  See, e.g., Shapiro, Bernstein &amp; Co. v. H. L. Green Co., 316 F. 2d 304, 308 (CA2 1963); Dreamland Ball Room, Inc. v. Shapiro, Bernstein &amp; Co., 36 F. 2d 354, 355 (CA7 1929).  Because we resolve the case based on an inducement theory, there is no need to analyze separately MGMs vicarious liability theory.

						 Grokster and StreamCast contend that any theory of liability based on their conduct is not properly before this Court because the rulings in the trial and appellate courts dealt only with the present versions of their software, not past acts … that allegedly encouraged infringement or assisted … known acts of infringement.  Brief for Respondents 14; see also id., at 34.  This contention misapprehends the basis for their potential liability.  It is not only that encouraging a particular consumer to infringe a copyright can give rise to secondary liability for the infringement that results.  Inducement liability goes beyond that, and the distribution of a product can itself give rise to liability where evidence shows that the distributor intended and encouraged the product to be used to infringe.  In such a case, the culpable act is not merely the encouragement of infringement but also the distribution of the tool intended for infringing use.  See Kalem Co. v. Harper Brothers,

				Respondents, Grokster, Ltd., and StreamCast Networks, Inc., defendants in the trial court, distribute free software products that allow computer users to share electronic files through peer-to-peer networks, so called because users computers communicate directly with each other, not through central servers.  The advantage of peer-to-peer networks over information networks of other types shows up in their substantial and growing popularity.  Because they need no central computer server to mediate the exchange of information or files among users, the high-bandwidth communications capacity for a server may be dispensed with, and the need for costly server storage space is eliminated.  Since copies of a file (particularly a popular one) are available on many users computers, file requests and retrievals may be faster than on other types of networks, and since file exchanges do not travel through a server, communications can take place between any computers that remain connected to the network without risk that a glitch in the server will disable the network in its entirety.  Given these benefits in security, cost, and efficiency, peer-to-peer networks are employed to store and distribute electronic files by universities, government agencies, corporations, and libraries, among others.

				Other users of peer-to-peer networks include individual recipients of Groksters and StreamCasts software, and although the networks that they enjoy through using the software can be used to share any type of digital file, they have prominently employed those networks in sharing copyrighted music and video files without authorization.  A group of copyright holders (MGM for short, but including motion picture studios, recording companies, songwriters, and music publishers) sued Grokster and StreamCast for their users copyright infringements, alleging that they knowingly and intentionally distributed their software to enable users to reproduce and distribute the copyrighted works in violation of the Copyright Act,

				Discovery during the litigation revealed the way the software worked, the business aims of each defendant company, and the predilections of the users.  Groksters eponymous software employs what is known as FastTrack technology, a protocol developed by others and licensed to Grokster.  StreamCast distributes a very similar product except that its software, called Morpheus, relies on what is known as Gnutella technology.

            </a>
				  A user who downloads and installs either software possesses the protocol to send requests for files directly to the computers of others using software compatible with FastTrack or Gnutella.  On the FastTrack network opened by the Grokster software, the users request goes to a computer given an indexing capacity by the software and designated a supernode, or to some other computer with comparable power and capacity to collect temporary indexes of the files available on the computers of users connected to it.  The supernode (or indexing computer) searches its own index and may communicate the search request to other supernodes.  If the file is found, the supernode discloses its location to the computer requesting it, and the requesting user can download the file directly from the computer located.  The copied file is placed in a designated sharing folder on the requesting users computer, where it is available for other users to download in turn, along with any other file in that folder.
			</p>

				In the Gnutella network made available by Morpheus, the process is mostly the same, except that in some versions of the Gnutella protocol there are no supernodes.  In these versions, peer computers using the protocol communicate directly with each other.  When a user enters a search request into the Morpheus software, it sends the request to computers connected with it, which in turn pass the request along to other connected peers.  The search results are communicated to the requesting computer, and the user can download desired files directly from peers computers.  As this description indicates, Grokster and StreamCast use no servers to intercept the content of the search requests or to mediate the file transfers conducted by users of the software, there being no central point through which the substance of the communications passes in either direction.

				Although Grokster and StreamCast do not therefore know when particular files are copied, a few searches using their software would show what is available on the networks the software reaches.  MGM commissioned a statistician to conduct a systematic search, and his study showed that nearly 90% of the files available for download on the FastTrack system were copyrighted works.

				  Grokster and StreamCast dispute this figure, raising methodological problems and arguing that free copying even of copyrighted works may be authorized by the rightholders.  They also argue that potential noninfringing uses of their software are significant in kind, even if infrequent in practice.  Some musical performers, for example, have gained new audiences by distributing their copyrighted works for free across peer-to-peer networks, and some distributors of unprotected content have used peer-to-peer networks to disseminate files, Shakespeare being an example.  Indeed, StreamCast has given Morpheus users the opportunity to download the briefs in this very case, though their popularity has not been quantified.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				As for quantification, the parties anecdotal and statistical evidence entered thus far to show the content available on the FastTrack and Gnutella networks does not say much about which files are actually downloaded by users, and no one can say how often the software is used to obtain copies of unprotected material.  But MGMs evidence gives reason to think that the vast majority of users downloads are acts of infringement, and because well over 100 million copies of the software in question are known to have been downloaded, and billions of files are shared across the FastTrack and Gnutella networks each month, the probable scope of copyright infringement is staggering.

				Grokster and StreamCast concede the infringement in most downloads, Brief for Respondents 10, n. 6, and it is uncontested that they are aware that users employ their software primarily to download copyrighted files, even if the decentralized FastTrack and Gnutella networks fail to reveal which files are being copied, and when.  From time to time, moreover, the companies have learned about their users infringement directly, as from users who have sent e-mail to each company with questions about playing copyrighted movies they had downloaded, to whom the companies have responded with guidance.

				Grokster and StreamCast are not, however, merely passive recipients of information about infringing use.  The record is replete with evidence that from the moment Grokster and StreamCast began to distribute their free software, each one clearly voiced the objective that recipients use it to download copyrighted works, and each took active steps to encourage infringement.

				After the notorious file-sharing service, Napster, was sued by copyright holders for facilitation of copyright infringement, 
				<em>
					A &amp; M Records, Inc.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Napster, Inc.
				</em>
				, 114 F. Supp. 2d 896 (ND Cal. 2000), affd in part, revd in part, 239 F. 3d 1004 (CA9 2001), StreamCast gave away a software program of a kind known as OpenNap, designed as compatible with the Napster program and open to Napster users for downloading files from other Napster and OpenNap users computers.  Evidence indicates that [i]t was always [StreamCasts] intent to use [its OpenNap network] to be able to capture email addresses of [its] initial target market so that [it] could promote [its] StreamCast Morpheus interface to them, App. 861; indeed, the OpenNap program was engineered  to leverage Napsters 50 million user base,  
				<em>

				, at 746.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				StreamCast monitored both the number of users downloading its OpenNap program and the number of music files they downloaded.  
				<em>

				, at 859, 863, 866.  It also used the resulting OpenNap network to distribute copies of the Morpheus software and to encourage users to adopt it.  
				<em>

				, at 861, 867, 1039.  Internal company documents indicate that StreamCast hoped to attract large numbers of former Napster users if that company was shut down by court order or otherwise, and that StreamCast planned to be the next Napster.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 861.  A kit developed by StreamCast to be delivered to advertisers, for example, contained press articles about StreamCasts potential to capture former Napster users, 
				<em>

				</em>
				, at 568572, and it introduced itself to some potential advertisers as a company which is similar to what Napster was, 
				<em>

				</em>
				., at 884.  It broadcast banner advertisements to users of other Napster-compatible software, urging them to adopt its OpenNap.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 586.  An internal e-mail from a company executive stated:  We have put this network in place so that when Napster pulls the plug on their free service … or if the Court orders them shut down prior to that … we will be positioned to capture the flood of their 32 million users that will be actively looking for an alternative. 

				Thus, StreamCast developed promotional materials to market its service as the best Napster alternative.

				  StreamCast even planned to flaunt the illegal uses of its software; when it launched the OpenNap network, the chief technology officer of the company averred that [t]he goal is to get in trouble with the law and get sued.  Its the best way to get in the new[s].

				The evidence that Grokster sought to capture the market of former Napster users is sparser but revealing, for Grokster launched its own OpenNap system called Swaptor and inserted digital codes into its Web site so that computer users using Web search engines to look for Napster or [f]ree filesharing would be directed to the Grokster Web site, where they could download the Grokster software.

					Id
				</em>
				., at 848.  Morpheus in fact allowed users to search specifically for Top 40 songs, 
				<em>

				, at 735, which were inevitably copyrighted.  Similarly, Grokster sent users a newsletter promoting its ability to provide particular, popular copyrighted materials.  Brief for Motion Picture Studio and Recording Company Petitioners 78.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In addition to this evidence of express promotion, marketing, and intent to promote further, the business models employed by Grokster and StreamCast confirm that their principal object was use of their software to download copyrighted works.  Grokster and StreamCast receive no revenue from users, who obtain the software itself for nothing.  Instead, both companies generate income by selling advertising space, and they stream the advertising to Grokster and Morpheus users while they are employing the programs.  As the number of users of each program increases, advertising opportunities become worth more.  Cf. App. 539, 804.  While there is doubtless some demand for free Shakespeare, the evidence shows that substantive volume is a function of free access to copyrighted work.  Users seeking Top 40 songs, for example, or the latest release by Modest Mouse, are certain to be far more numerous than those seeking a free Decameron, and Grokster and StreamCast translated that demand into dollars.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Finally, there is no evidence that either company made an effort to filter copyrighted material from users downloads or otherwise impede the sharing of copyrighted files.  Although Grokster appears to have sent e-mails warning users about infringing content when it received threatening notice from the copyright holders, it never blocked anyone from continuing to use its software to share copyrighted files.

				After discovery, the parties on each side of the case cross-moved for summary judgment.  The District Court limited its consideration to the asserted liability of Grokster and StreamCast for distributing the current versions of their software, leaving aside whether either was liable for damages arising from 
				<em>
					past
				</em>
				 versions of their software, or from other past activities.  259 F. Supp. 2d 1029, 1033 (CD Cal. 2003).  The District Court held that those who used the Grokster and Morpheus software to download copyrighted media files directly infringed MGMs copyrights, a conclusion not contested on appeal, but the court nonetheless granted summary judgment in favor of Grokster and StreamCast as to any liability arising from distribution of the then current versions of their software.  Distributing that software gave rise to no liability in the courts view, because its use did not provide the distributors with actual knowledge of specific acts of infringement.

				The Court of Appeals affirmed.  380 F. 3d 1154 (CA9 2004).  In the courts analysis, a defendant was liable as a contributory infringer when it had knowledge of direct infringement and materially contributed to the infringement.  But the court read 
				<em>

				<em>

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/464/417" class="subref" title="subref">464 U. S. 417</a> (1984)
, as holding that distribution of a commercial product capable of substantial noninfringing uses could not give rise to contributory liability for infringement unless the distributor had actual knowledge of specific instances of infringement and failed to act on that knowledge.  The fact that the software was capable of substantial noninfringing uses in the Ninth Circuits view meant that Grokster and StreamCast were not liable, because they had no such actual knowledge, owing to the decentralized architecture of their software.  The court also held that Grokster and StreamCast did not materially contribute to their users infringement because it was the users themselves who searched for, retrieved, and stored the infringing files, with no involvement by the defendants beyond providing the software in the first place.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Ninth Circuit also considered whether Grokster and StreamCast could be liable under a theory of vicarious infringement.  The court held against liability because the defendants did not monitor or control the use of the software, had no agreed-upon right or current ability to supervise its use, and had no independent duty to police infringement.  We granted certiorari.  543 U. S. ___ (2004).

				MGM and many of the 
				<em>

				</em>
				 fault the Court of Appealss holding for upsetting a sound balance between the respective values of supporting creative pursuits through copyright protection and promoting innovation in new communication technologies by limiting the incidence of liability for copyright infringement.

				The tension between the two values is the subject of this case, with its claim that digital distribution of copyrighted material threatens copyright holders as never before, because every copy is identical to the original, copying is easy, and many people (especially the young) use file-sharing software to download copyrighted works.  This very breadth of the softwares use may well draw the public directly into the debate over copyright policy, Peters, Brace Memorial Lecture: Copyright Enters the Public Domain, 51 J. Copyright Soc. 701, 705717 (2004) (address by Register of Copyrights), and the indications are that the ease of copying songs or movies using software like Groksters and Napsters is fostering disdain for copyright protection, Wu, When Code Isnt Law, 89 Va. L. Rev. 679, 724726 (2003).  As the case has been presented to us, these fears are said to be offset by the different concern that imposing liability, not only on infringers but on distributors of software based on its potential for unlawful use, could limit further development of beneficial technologies.

				The argument for imposing indirect liability in this case is, however, a powerful one, given the number of infringing downloads that occur every day using StreamCasts and Groksters software.  When a widely shared service or product is used to commit infringement, it may be impossible to enforce rights in the protected work effectively against all direct infringers, the only practical alternative being to go against the distributor of the copying device for secondary liability on a theory of contributory or vicarious infringement.

				Despite the currency of these principles of secondary liability, this Court has dealt with secondary copyright infringement in only one recent case, and because MGM has tailored its principal claim to our opinion there, a look at our earlier holding is in order.  In 
				<em>
					Sony Corp. 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					Universal City Studios
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, this Court addressed a claim that secondary liability for infringement can arise from the very distribution of a commercial product.  There, the product, novel at the time, was what we know today as the videocassette recorder or VCR.  Copyright holders sued Sony as the manufacturer, claiming it was contributorily liable for infringement that occurred when VCR owners taped copyrighted programs because it supplied the means used to infringe, and it had constructive knowledge that infringement would occur.  At the trial on the merits, the evidence showed that the principal use of the VCR was for  time-shifting,  or taping a program for later viewing at a more convenient time, which the Court found to be a fair, not an infringing, use.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 423424.  There was no evidence that Sony had expressed an object of bringing about taping in violation of copyright or had taken active steps to increase its profits from unlawful taping.  
				<em>

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				On those facts, with no evidence of stated or indicated intent to promote infringing uses, the only conceivable basis for imposing liability was on a theory of contributory infringement arising from its sale of VCRs to consumers with knowledge that some would use them to infringe.  
				<em>
					Id.

				The parties and many of the 
				<em>
					amici
				</em>
				 in this case think the key to resolving it is the 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 rule and, in particular, what it means for a product to be capable of commercially significant noninfringing uses. 
				<em>
					 Sony Corp.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Universal City Studios
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 442.  MGM advances the argument that granting summary judgment to Grokster and StreamCast as to their current activities gave too much weight to the value of innovative technology, and too little to the copyrights infringed by users of their software, given that 90% of works available on one of the networks was shown to be copyrighted.  Assuming the remaining 10% to be its noninfringing use, MGM says this should not qualify as substantial, and the Court should quantify Sony to the extent of holding that a product used principally for infringement does not qualify.  See Brief for Motion Picture Studio and Recording Company Petitioners 31.  As mentioned before, Grokster and StreamCast reply by citing evidence that their software can be used to reproduce public domain works, and they point to copyright holders who actually encourage copying.  Even if infringement is the principal practice with their software today, they argue, the noninfringing uses are significant and will grow.

				We agree with MGM that the Court of Appeals misapplied 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				, which it read as limiting secondary liability quite beyond the circumstances to which the case applied.  
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 barred secondary liability based on presuming or imputing intent to cause infringement solely from the design or distribution of a product capable of substantial lawful use, which the distributor knows is in fact used for infringement.  The Ninth Circuit has read 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				s limitation to mean that whenever a product is capable of substantial lawful use, the producer can never be held contributorily liable for third parties infringing use of it; it read the rule as being this broad, even when an actual purpose to cause infringing use is shown by evidence independent of design and distribution of the product, unless the distributors had specific knowledge of infringement at a time at which they contributed to the infringement, and failed to act upon that information.  380 F. 3d, at 1162 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).  Because the Circuit found the StreamCast and Grokster software capable of substantial lawful use, it concluded on the basis of its reading of 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 that neither company could be held liable, since there was no showing that their software, being without any central server, afforded them knowledge of specific unlawful uses.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				This view of 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				, however, was error, converting the case from one about liability resting on imputed intent to one about liability on any theory.  Because 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 did not displace other theories of secondary liability, and because we find below that it was error to grant summary judgment to the companies on MGMs inducement claim, we  do not revisit 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 further, as MGM requests, to add a more quantified description of the point of balance between protection and commerce when liability rests solely on distribution with knowledge that unlawful use will occur.  It is enough to note that the Ninth Circuits judgment rested on an erroneous understanding of 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 and to leave further consideration of the 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 rule for a day when that may be required.

				For the same reasons that 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 took the staple-article doctrine of patent law as a model for its copyright safe-harbor rule, the inducement rule, too, is a sensible one for copyright.  We adopt it here, holding that one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright, as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement, is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties.  We are, of course, mindful of the need to keep from trenching on regular commerce or discouraging the development of technologies with lawful and unlawful potential.  Accordingly, just as 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 did not find intentional inducement despite the knowledge of the VCR manufacturer that its device could be used to infringe, 464 U. S., at 439, n. 19, mere knowledge of infringing potential or of actual infringing uses would not be enough here to subject a distributor to liability.  Nor would ordinary acts incident to product distribution, such as offering customers technical support or product updates, support liability in themselves.  The inducement rule, instead, premises liability on purposeful, culpable expression and conduct, and thus does nothing to compromise legitimate commerce or discourage innovation having a lawful promise.

				The only apparent question about treating MGMs evidence as sufficient to withstand summary judgment under the theory of inducement goes to the need on MGMs part to adduce evidence that StreamCast and Grokster communicated an inducing message to their software users.  The classic instance of inducement is by advertisement or solicitation that broadcasts a message designed to stimulate others to commit violations.  MGM claims that such a message is shown here.  It is undisputed that StreamCast beamed onto the computer screens of users of Napster-compatible programs ads urging the adoption of its OpenNap program, which was designed, as its name implied, to invite the custom of patrons of Napster, then under attack in the courts for facilitating massive infringement.  Those who accepted StreamCasts OpenNap program were offered software to perform the same services, which a factfinder could conclude would readily have been understood in the Napster market as the ability to download copyrighted music files.  Grokster distributed an electronic newsletter containing links to articles promoting its softwares ability to access popular copyrighted music.  And anyone whose Napster or free file-sharing searches turned up a link to Grokster would have understood Grokster to be offering the same file-sharing ability as Napster, and to the same people who probably used Napster for infringing downloads; that would also have been the understanding of anyone offered Groksters suggestively named Swaptor software, its version of OpenNap.  And both companies communicated a clear message by responding affirmatively to requests for help in locating and playing copyrighted materials.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In StreamCasts case, of course, the evidence just described was supplemented by other unequivocal indications of unlawful purpose in the internal communications and advertising designs aimed at Napster users (When the lights went off at Napster … where did the users go?  App. 836 (ellipsis in original)).  Whether the messages were communicated is not to the point on this record.  The function of the message in the theory of inducement is to prove by a defendants own statements that his unlawful purpose disqualifies him from claiming protection (and incidentally to point to actual violators likely to be found among those who hear or read the message).  See 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 1719.  Proving that a message was sent out, then, is the preeminent but not exclusive way of showing that active steps were taken with the purpose of bringing about infringing acts, and of showing that infringing acts took place by using the device distributed.  Here, the summary judgment record is replete with other evidence that Grokster and StreamCast, unlike the manufacturer and distributor in 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				, acted with a purpose to cause copyright violations by use of software suitable for illegal use.  See 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 69.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Three features of this evidence of intent are particularly notable.  First, each company showed itself to be aiming to satisfy a known source of demand for copyright infringement, the market comprising former Napster users.  StreamCasts internal documents made constant reference to Napster, it initially distributed its Morpheus software through an OpenNap program compatible with Napster, it advertised its OpenNap program to Napster users, and its Morpheus software functions as Napster did except that it could be used to distribute more kinds of files, including copyrighted movies and software programs.  Groksters name is apparently derived from Napster, it too initially offered an OpenNap program, its softwares function is likewise comparable to Napsters, and it attempted to divert queries for Napster onto its own Web site.  Grokster and StreamCasts efforts to supply services to former Napster users, deprived of a mechanism to copy and distribute what were overwhelmingly infringing files, indicate a principal, if not exclusive, intent on the part of each to bring about infringement.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, this evidence of unlawful objective is given added significance by MGMs showing that neither company attempted to develop filtering tools or other mechanisms to diminish the infringing activity using their software.  While the Ninth Circuit treated the defendants failure to develop such tools as irrelevant because they lacked an independent duty to monitor their users activity, we think this evidence underscores Groksters and StreamCasts intentional facilitation of their users infringement.

            </a>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Third, there is a further complement to the direct evidence of unlawful objective.  It is useful to recall that StreamCast and Grokster make money by selling advertising space, by directing ads to the screens of computers employing their software.  As the record shows, the more the software is used, the more ads are sent out and the greater the advertising revenue becomes.  Since the extent of the softwares use determines the gain to the distributors, the commercial sense of their enterprise turns on high-volume use, which the record shows is infringing.
				<a name="ZO-13ref" href="#ZO-13" class="">
                <sup>

					13
				</b>
                </sup>
            </a>
				  This evidence alone would not justify an inference of unlawful intent, but viewed in the context of the entire record its import is clear.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The unlawful objective is unmistakable.
			</p>
        <p class="opcentered">
				B
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				In addition to intent to bring about infringement and distribution of a device suitable for infringing use, the inducement theory of course requires evidence of actual infringement by recipients of the device, the software in this case.  As the account of the facts indicates, there is evidence of infringement on a gigantic scale, and there is no serious issue of the adequacy of MGMs showing on this point in order to survive the companies summary judgment requests.  Although an exact calculation of infringing use, as a basis for a claim of damages, is subject to dispute, there is no question that the summary judgment evidence is at least adequate to entitle MGM to go forward with claims for damages and equitable relief.

				In sum, this case is significantly different from 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 and reliance on that case to rule in favor of StreamCast and Grokster was error.  
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 dealt with a claim of liability based solely on distributing a product with alternative lawful and unlawful uses, with knowledge that some users would follow the unlawful course.  The case struck a balance between the interests of protection and innovation by holding that the products capability of substantial lawful employment should bar the imputation of fault and consequent secondary liability for the unlawful acts of others.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				MGMs evidence in this case most obviously addresses a different basis of liability for distributing a product open to alternative uses.  Here, evidence of the distributors words and deeds going beyond distribution as such shows a purpose to cause and profit from third-party acts of copyright infringement.  If liability for inducing infringement is ultimately found, it will not be on the basis of presuming or imputing fault, but from inferring a patently illegal objective from statements and actions showing what that objective was.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				There is substantial evidence in MGMs favor on all elements of inducement, and summary judgment in favor of Grokster and StreamCast was error.  On remand, reconsideration of MGMs motion for summary judgment will be in order.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

						 Peer-to-peer networks have disadvantages as well.  Searches on peer-to-peer networks may not reach and uncover all available files because search requests may not be transmitted to every computer on the network.  There may be redundant copies of popular files.  The creator of the software has no incentive to minimize storage or bandwidth consumption, the costs of which are borne by every user of the network.  Most relevant here, it is more difficult to control the content of files available for retrieval and the behavior of users.

[R]easoned analysis of [the Sony plaintiffs contributory infringement claim] necessarily entails consideration of arguments and case law which may also be forwarded under the other labels, and indeed the parties … rely upon such arguments and authority in support of their respective positions on the issue of contributory infringement, id., at 435, n. 17 (quoting Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Sony Corp., 480 F. Supp. 429, 457458 (CD Cal. 1979)).  In the present case MGM has argued a vicarious liability theory, which allows imposition of liability when the defendant profits directly from the infringement and has a right and ability to supervise the direct infringer, even if the defendant initially lacks knowledge of the infringement.  See, e.g., Shapiro, Bernstein &amp; Co. v. H. L. Green Co., 316 F. 2d 304, 308 (CA2 1963); Dreamland Ball Room, Inc. v. Shapiro, Bernstein &amp; Co., 36 F. 2d 354, 355 (CA7 1929).  Because we resolve the case based on an inducement theory, there is no need to analyze separately MGMs vicarious liability theory.

						 Of course, in the absence of other evidence of intent, a court would be unable to find contributory infringement liability merely based on a failure to take affirmative steps to prevent infringement, if the device otherwise was capable of substantial noninfringing uses.

						 Grokster and StreamCast contend that any theory of liability based on their conduct is not properly before this Court because the rulings in the trial and appellate courts dealt only with the present versions of their software, not past acts … that allegedly encouraged infringement or assisted … known acts of infringement.  Brief for Respondents 14; see also id., at 34.  This contention misapprehends the basis for their potential liability.  It is not only that encouraging a particular consumer to infringe a copyright can give rise to secondary liability for the infringement that results.  Inducement liability goes beyond that, and the distribution of a product can itself give rise to liability where evidence shows that the distributor intended and encouraged the product to be used to infringe.  In such a case, the culpable act is not merely the encouragement of infringement but also the distribution of the tool intended for infringing use.  See Kalem Co. v. Harper Brothers,

				The question is under what circumstances the distributor of a product capable of both lawful and unlawful use is liable for acts of copyright infringement by third parties using the product.  We hold that one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright, as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement, is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties.

				Respondents, Grokster, Ltd., and StreamCast Networks, Inc., defendants in the trial court, distribute free software products that allow computer users to share electronic files through peer-to-peer networks, so called because users computers communicate directly with each other, not through central servers.  The advantage of peer-to-peer networks over information networks of other types shows up in their substantial and growing popularity.  Because they need no central computer server to mediate the exchange of information or files among users, the high-bandwidth communications capacity for a server may be dispensed with, and the need for costly server storage space is eliminated.  Since copies of a file (particularly a popular one) are available on many users computers, file requests and retrievals may be faster than on other types of networks, and since file exchanges do not travel through a server, communications can take place between any computers that remain connected to the network without risk that a glitch in the server will disable the network in its entirety.  Given these benefits in security, cost, and efficiency, peer-to-peer networks are employed to store and distribute electronic files by universities, government agencies, corporations, and libraries, among others.

				Other users of peer-to-peer networks include individual recipients of Groksters and StreamCasts software, and although the networks that they enjoy through using the software can be used to share any type of digital file, they have prominently employed those networks in sharing copyrighted music and video files without authorization.  A group of copyright holders (MGM for short, but including motion picture studios, recording companies, songwriters, and music publishers) sued Grokster and StreamCast for their users copyright infringements, alleging that they knowingly and intentionally distributed their software to enable users to reproduce and distribute the copyrighted works in violation of the Copyright Act,

				Discovery during the litigation revealed the way the software worked, the business aims of each defendant company, and the predilections of the users.  Groksters eponymous software employs what is known as FastTrack technology, a protocol developed by others and licensed to Grokster.  StreamCast distributes a very similar product except that its software, called Morpheus, relies on what is known as Gnutella technology.
				<a name="ZO-3ref" href="#ZO-3" class="">

                </sup>
            </a>
				  A user who downloads and installs either software possesses the protocol to send requests for files directly to the computers of others using software compatible with FastTrack or Gnutella.  On the FastTrack network opened by the Grokster software, the users request goes to a computer given an indexing capacity by the software and designated a supernode, or to some other computer with comparable power and capacity to collect temporary indexes of the files available on the computers of users connected to it.  The supernode (or indexing computer) searches its own index and may communicate the search request to other supernodes.  If the file is found, the supernode discloses its location to the computer requesting it, and the requesting user can download the file directly from the computer located.  The copied file is placed in a designated sharing folder on the requesting users computer, where it is available for other users to download in turn, along with any other file in that folder.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In the Gnutella network made available by Morpheus, the process is mostly the same, except that in some versions of the Gnutella protocol there are no supernodes.  In these versions, peer computers using the protocol communicate directly with each other.  When a user enters a search request into the Morpheus software, it sends the request to computers connected with it, which in turn pass the request along to other connected peers.  The search results are communicated to the requesting computer, and the user can download desired files directly from peers computers.  As this description indicates, Grokster and StreamCast use no servers to intercept the content of the search requests or to mediate the file transfers conducted by users of the software, there being no central point through which the substance of the communications passes in either direction.

				Although Grokster and StreamCast do not therefore know when particular files are copied, a few searches using their software would show what is available on the networks the software reaches.  MGM commissioned a statistician to conduct a systematic search, and his study showed that nearly 90% of the files available for download on the FastTrack system were copyrighted works.

				  Grokster and StreamCast dispute this figure, raising methodological problems and arguing that free copying even of copyrighted works may be authorized by the rightholders.  They also argue that potential noninfringing uses of their software are significant in kind, even if infrequent in practice.  Some musical performers, for example, have gained new audiences by distributing their copyrighted works for free across peer-to-peer networks, and some distributors of unprotected content have used peer-to-peer networks to disseminate files, Shakespeare being an example.  Indeed, StreamCast has given Morpheus users the opportunity to download the briefs in this very case, though their popularity has not been quantified.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				As for quantification, the parties anecdotal and statistical evidence entered thus far to show the content available on the FastTrack and Gnutella networks does not say much about which files are actually downloaded by users, and no one can say how often the software is used to obtain copies of unprotected material.  But MGMs evidence gives reason to think that the vast majority of users downloads are acts of infringement, and because well over 100 million copies of the software in question are known to have been downloaded, and billions of files are shared across the FastTrack and Gnutella networks each month, the probable scope of copyright infringement is staggering.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Grokster and StreamCast concede the infringement in most downloads, Brief for Respondents 10, n. 6, and it is uncontested that they are aware that users employ their software primarily to download copyrighted files, even if the decentralized FastTrack and Gnutella networks fail to reveal which files are being copied, and when.  From time to time, moreover, the companies have learned about their users infringement directly, as from users who have sent e-mail to each company with questions about playing copyrighted movies they had downloaded, to whom the companies have responded with guidance.

				Grokster and StreamCast are not, however, merely passive recipients of information about infringing use.  The record is replete with evidence that from the moment Grokster and StreamCast began to distribute their free software, each one clearly voiced the objective that recipients use it to download copyrighted works, and each took active steps to encourage infringement.

				After the notorious file-sharing service, Napster, was sued by copyright holders for facilitation of copyright infringement, 
				<em>
					A &amp; M Records, Inc.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Napster, Inc.
				</em>
				, 114 F. Supp. 2d 896 (ND Cal. 2000), affd in part, revd in part, 239 F. 3d 1004 (CA9 2001), StreamCast gave away a software program of a kind known as OpenNap, designed as compatible with the Napster program and open to Napster users for downloading files from other Napster and OpenNap users computers.  Evidence indicates that [i]t was always [StreamCasts] intent to use [its OpenNap network] to be able to capture email addresses of [its] initial target market so that [it] could promote [its] StreamCast Morpheus interface to them, App. 861; indeed, the OpenNap program was engineered  to leverage Napsters 50 million user base,  
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 746.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				StreamCast monitored both the number of users downloading its OpenNap program and the number of music files they downloaded.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 859, 863, 866.  It also used the resulting OpenNap network to distribute copies of the Morpheus software and to encourage users to adopt it.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 861, 867, 1039.  Internal company documents indicate that StreamCast hoped to attract large numbers of former Napster users if that company was shut down by court order or otherwise, and that StreamCast planned to be the next Napster.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 861.  A kit developed by StreamCast to be delivered to advertisers, for example, contained press articles about StreamCasts potential to capture former Napster users, 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 568572, and it introduced itself to some potential advertisers as a company which is similar to what Napster was, 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 884.  It broadcast banner advertisements to users of other Napster-compatible software, urging them to adopt its OpenNap.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 586.  An internal e-mail from a company executive stated:  We have put this network in place so that when Napster pulls the plug on their free service … or if the Court orders them shut down prior to that … we will be positioned to capture the flood of their 32 million users that will be actively looking for an alternative. 

				Thus, StreamCast developed promotional materials to market its service as the best Napster alternative.  One proposed advertisement read: Napster Inc. has announced that it will soon begin charging you a fee.  Thats if the courts dont order it shut down first.  What will you do to get around it?

				  StreamCast even planned to flaunt the illegal uses of its software; when it launched the OpenNap network, the chief technology officer of the company averred that [t]he goal is to get in trouble with the law and get sued.  Its the best way to get in the new[s].

				The evidence that Grokster sought to capture the market of former Napster users is sparser but revealing, for Grokster launched its own OpenNap system called Swaptor and inserted digital codes into its Web site so that computer users using Web search engines to look for Napster or [f]ree filesharing would be directed to the Grokster Web site, where they could download the Grokster software.

				<em>

				</em>
				., at 868.  The point, of course, would be to attract users of a mind to infringe, just as it would be with their promotional materials developed showing copyrighted songs as examples of the kinds of files available through Morpheus.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 848.  Morpheus in fact allowed users to search specifically for Top 40 songs, 
				<em>
					id.

				, at 735, which were inevitably copyrighted.  Similarly, Grokster sent users a newsletter promoting its ability to provide particular, popular copyrighted materials.  Brief for Motion Picture Studio and Recording Company Petitioners 78.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In addition to this evidence of express promotion, marketing, and intent to promote further, the business models employed by Grokster and StreamCast confirm that their principal object was use of their software to download copyrighted works.  Grokster and StreamCast receive no revenue from users, who obtain the software itself for nothing.  Instead, both companies generate income by selling advertising space, and they stream the advertising to Grokster and Morpheus users while they are employing the programs.  As the number of users of each program increases, advertising opportunities become worth more.  Cf. App. 539, 804.  While there is doubtless some demand for free Shakespeare, the evidence shows that substantive volume is a function of free access to copyrighted work.  Users seeking Top 40 songs, for example, or the latest release by Modest Mouse, are certain to be far more numerous than those seeking a free Decameron, and Grokster and StreamCast translated that demand into dollars.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Finally, there is no evidence that either company made an effort to filter copyrighted material from users downloads or otherwise impede the sharing of copyrighted files.  Although Grokster appears to have sent e-mails warning users about infringing content when it received threatening notice from the copyright holders, it never blocked anyone from continuing to use its software to share copyrighted files.

				After discovery, the parties on each side of the case cross-moved for summary judgment.  The District Court limited its consideration to the asserted liability of Grokster and StreamCast for distributing the current versions of their software, leaving aside whether either was liable for damages arising from 
				<em>
					past
				</em>
				 versions of their software, or from other past activities.  259 F. Supp. 2d 1029, 1033 (CD Cal. 2003).  The District Court held that those who used the Grokster and Morpheus software to download copyrighted media files directly infringed MGMs copyrights, a conclusion not contested on appeal, but the court nonetheless granted summary judgment in favor of Grokster and StreamCast as to any liability arising from distribution of the then current versions of their software.  Distributing that software gave rise to no liability in the courts view, because its use did not provide the distributors with actual knowledge of specific acts of infringement.  Case No. CV 01 08541 SVW (PJWx) (CD Cal., June 18, 2003), App. 1213.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The Court of Appeals affirmed.  380 F. 3d 1154 (CA9 2004).  In the courts analysis, a defendant was liable as a contributory infringer when it had knowledge of direct infringement and materially contributed to the infringement.  But the court read 
				<em>

				<em>

				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/464/417" class="subref" title="subref">464 U. S. 417</a> (1984)
, as holding that distribution of a commercial product capable of substantial noninfringing uses could not give rise to contributory liability for infringement unless the distributor had actual knowledge of specific instances of infringement and failed to act on that knowledge.  The fact that the software was capable of substantial noninfringing uses in the Ninth Circuits view meant that Grokster and StreamCast were not liable, because they had no such actual knowledge, owing to the decentralized architecture of their software.  The court also held that Grokster and StreamCast did not materially contribute to their users infringement because it was the users themselves who searched for, retrieved, and stored the infringing files, with no involvement by the defendants beyond providing the software in the first place.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Ninth Circuit also considered whether Grokster and StreamCast could be liable under a theory of vicarious infringement.  The court held against liability because the defendants did not monitor or control the use of the software, had no agreed-upon right or current ability to supervise its use, and had no independent duty to police infringement.  We granted certiorari.  543 U. S. ___ (2004).

				MGM and many of the

				 fault the Court of Appealss holding for upsetting a sound balance between the respective values of supporting creative pursuits through copyright protection and promoting innovation in new communication technologies by limiting the incidence of liability for copyright infringement.

				The tension between the two values is the subject of this case, with its claim that digital distribution of copyrighted material threatens copyright holders as never before, because every copy is identical to the original, copying is easy, and many people (especially the young) use file-sharing software to download copyrighted works.  This very breadth of the softwares use may well draw the public directly into the debate over copyright policy, Peters, Brace Memorial Lecture: Copyright Enters the Public Domain, 51 J. Copyright Soc. 701, 705717 (2004) (address by Register of Copyrights), and the indications are that the ease of copying songs or movies using software like Groksters and Napsters is fostering disdain for copyright protection, Wu, When Code Isnt Law, 89 Va. L. Rev. 679, 724726 (2003).  As the case has been presented to us, these fears are said to be offset by the different concern that imposing liability, not only on infringers but on distributors of software based on its potential for unlawful use, could limit further development of beneficial technologies.

				The argument for imposing indirect liability in this case is, however, a powerful one, given the number of infringing downloads that occur every day using StreamCasts and Groksters software.  When a widely shared service or product is used to commit infringement, it may be impossible to enforce rights in the protected work effectively against all direct infringers, the only practical alternative being to go against the distributor of the copying device for secondary liability on a theory of contributory or vicarious infringement.

				Despite the currency of these principles of secondary liability, this Court has dealt with secondary copyright infringement in only one recent case, and because MGM has tailored its principal claim to our opinion there, a look at our earlier holding is in order.  In 
				<em>
					Sony Corp. 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					Universal City Studios
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra

				, this Court addressed a claim that secondary liability for infringement can arise from the very distribution of a commercial product.  There, the product, novel at the time, was what we know today as the videocassette recorder or VCR.  Copyright holders sued Sony as the manufacturer, claiming it was contributorily liable for infringement that occurred when VCR owners taped copyrighted programs because it supplied the means used to infringe, and it had constructive knowledge that infringement would occur.  At the trial on the merits, the evidence showed that the principal use of the VCR was for  time-shifting,  or taping a program for later viewing at a more convenient time, which the Court found to be a fair, not an infringing, use.  
				<em>

				The parties and many of the 
				<em>
					amici
				</em>
				 in this case think the key to resolving it is the 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 rule and, in particular, what it means for a product to be capable of commercially significant noninfringing uses. 
				<em>
					 Sony Corp.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Universal City Studios
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 442.  MGM advances the argument that granting summary judgment to Grokster and StreamCast as to their current activities gave too much weight to the value of innovative technology, and too little to the copyrights infringed by users of their software, given that 90% of works available on one of the networks was shown to be copyrighted.  Assuming the remaining 10% to be its noninfringing use, MGM says this should not qualify as substantial, and the Court should quantify Sony to the extent of holding that a product used principally for infringement does not qualify.  See Brief for Motion Picture Studio and Recording Company Petitioners 31.  As mentioned before, Grokster and StreamCast reply by citing evidence that their software can be used to reproduce public domain works, and they point to copyright holders who actually encourage copying.  Even if infringement is the principal practice with their software today, they argue, the noninfringing uses are significant and will grow.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We agree with MGM that the Court of Appeals misapplied 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				, which it read as limiting secondary liability quite beyond the circumstances to which the case applied.  
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 barred secondary liability based on presuming or imputing intent to cause infringement solely from the design or distribution of a product capable of substantial lawful use, which the distributor knows is in fact used for infringement.  The Ninth Circuit has read 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				s limitation to mean that whenever a product is capable of substantial lawful use, the producer can never be held contributorily liable for third parties infringing use of it; it read the rule as being this broad, even when an actual purpose to cause infringing use is shown by evidence independent of design and distribution of the product, unless the distributors had specific knowledge of infringement at a time at which they contributed to the infringement, and failed to act upon that information.  380 F. 3d, at 1162 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).  Because the Circuit found the StreamCast and Grokster software capable of substantial lawful use, it concluded on the basis of its reading of 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 that neither company could be held liable, since there was no showing that their software, being without any central server, afforded them knowledge of specific unlawful uses.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				This view of 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				, however, was error, converting the case from one about liability resting on imputed intent to one about liability on any theory.  Because 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 did not displace other theories of secondary liability, and because we find below that it was error to grant summary judgment to the companies on MGMs inducement claim, we  do not revisit 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 further, as MGM requests, to add a more quantified description of the point of balance between protection and commerce when liability rests solely on distribution with knowledge that unlawful use will occur.  It is enough to note that the Ninth Circuits judgment rested on an erroneous understanding of 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 and to leave further consideration of the 
				<em>

				For the same reasons that 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 took the staple-article doctrine of patent law as a model for its copyright safe-harbor rule, the inducement rule, too, is a sensible one for copyright.  We adopt it here, holding that one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright, as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement, is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties.  We are, of course, mindful of the need to keep from trenching on regular commerce or discouraging the development of technologies with lawful and unlawful potential.  Accordingly, just as 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 did not find intentional inducement despite the knowledge of the VCR manufacturer that its device could be used to infringe, 464 U. S., at 439, n. 19, mere knowledge of infringing potential or of actual infringing uses would not be enough here to subject a distributor to liability.  Nor would ordinary acts incident to product distribution, such as offering customers technical support or product updates, support liability in themselves.  The inducement rule, instead, premises liability on purposeful, culpable expression and conduct, and thus does nothing to compromise legitimate commerce or discourage innovation having a lawful promise.

				The only apparent question about treating MGMs evidence as sufficient to withstand summary judgment under the theory of inducement goes to the need on MGMs part to adduce evidence that StreamCast and Grokster communicated an inducing message to their software users.  The classic instance of inducement is by advertisement or solicitation that broadcasts a message designed to stimulate others to commit violations.  MGM claims that such a message is shown here.  It is undisputed that StreamCast beamed onto the computer screens of users of Napster-compatible programs ads urging the adoption of its OpenNap program, which was designed, as its name implied, to invite the custom of patrons of Napster, then under attack in the courts for facilitating massive infringement.  Those who accepted StreamCasts OpenNap program were offered software to perform the same services, which a factfinder could conclude would readily have been understood in the Napster market as the ability to download copyrighted music files.  Grokster distributed an electronic newsletter containing links to articles promoting its softwares ability to access popular copyrighted music.  And anyone whose Napster or free file-sharing searches turned up a link to Grokster would have understood Grokster to be offering the same file-sharing ability as Napster, and to the same people who probably used Napster for infringing downloads; that would also have been the understanding of anyone offered Groksters suggestively named Swaptor software, its version of OpenNap.  And both companies communicated a clear message by responding affirmatively to requests for help in locating and playing copyrighted materials.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In StreamCasts case, of course, the evidence just described was supplemented by other unequivocal indications of unlawful purpose in the internal communications and advertising designs aimed at Napster users (When the lights went off at Napster … where did the users go?  App. 836 (ellipsis in original)).  Whether the messages were communicated is not to the point on this record.  The function of the message in the theory of inducement is to prove by a defendants own statements that his unlawful purpose disqualifies him from claiming protection (and incidentally to point to actual violators likely to be found among those who hear or read the message).  See 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 1719.  Proving that a message was sent out, then, is the preeminent but not exclusive way of showing that active steps were taken with the purpose of bringing about infringing acts, and of showing that infringing acts took place by using the device distributed.  Here, the summary judgment record is replete with other evidence that Grokster and StreamCast, unlike the manufacturer and distributor in 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				, acted with a purpose to cause copyright violations by use of software suitable for illegal use.  See 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 69.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Three features of this evidence of intent are particularly notable.  First, each company showed itself to be aiming to satisfy a known source of demand for copyright infringement, the market comprising former Napster users.  StreamCasts internal documents made constant reference to Napster, it initially distributed its Morpheus software through an OpenNap program compatible with Napster, it advertised its OpenNap program to Napster users, and its Morpheus software functions as Napster did except that it could be used to distribute more kinds of files, including copyrighted movies and software programs.  Groksters name is apparently derived from Napster, it too initially offered an OpenNap program, its softwares function is likewise comparable to Napsters, and it attempted to divert queries for Napster onto its own Web site.  Grokster and StreamCasts efforts to supply services to former Napster users, deprived of a mechanism to copy and distribute what were overwhelmingly infringing files, indicate a principal, if not exclusive, intent on the part of each to bring about infringement.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, this evidence of unlawful objective is given added significance by MGMs showing that neither company attempted to develop filtering tools or other mechanisms to diminish the infringing activity using their software.  While the Ninth Circuit treated the defendants failure to develop such tools as irrelevant because they lacked an independent duty to monitor their users activity, we think this evidence underscores Groksters and StreamCasts intentional facilitation of their users infringement.

            </a>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Third, there is a further complement to the direct evidence of unlawful objective.  It is useful to recall that StreamCast and Grokster make money by selling advertising space, by directing ads to the screens of computers employing their software.  As the record shows, the more the software is used, the more ads are sent out and the greater the advertising revenue becomes.  Since the extent of the softwares use determines the gain to the distributors, the commercial sense of their enterprise turns on high-volume use, which the record shows is infringing.
				<a name="ZO-13ref" href="#ZO-13" class="">
                <sup>

                </sup>
            </a>
				  This evidence alone would not justify an inference of unlawful intent, but viewed in the context of the entire record its import is clear.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The unlawful objective is unmistakable.
			</p>
        <p class="opcentered">
				B
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				In addition to intent to bring about infringement and distribution of a device suitable for infringing use, the inducement theory of course requires evidence of actual infringement by recipients of the device, the software in this case.  As the account of the facts indicates, there is evidence of infringement on a gigantic scale, and there is no serious issue of the adequacy of MGMs showing on this point in order to survive the companies summary judgment requests.  Although an exact calculation of infringing use, as a basis for a claim of damages, is subject to dispute, there is no question that the summary judgment evidence is at least adequate to entitle MGM to go forward with claims for damages and equitable relief.

				In sum, this case is significantly different from 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 and reliance on that case to rule in favor of StreamCast and Grokster was error.  
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 dealt with a claim of liability based solely on distributing a product with alternative lawful and unlawful uses, with knowledge that some users would follow the unlawful course.  The case struck a balance between the interests of protection and innovation by holding that the products capability of substantial lawful employment should bar the imputation of fault and consequent secondary liability for the unlawful acts of others.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				MGMs evidence in this case most obviously addresses a different basis of liability for distributing a product open to alternative uses.  Here, evidence of the distributors words and deeds going beyond distribution as such shows a purpose to cause and profit from third-party acts of copyright infringement.  If liability for inducing infringement is ultimately found, it will not be on the basis of presuming or imputing fault, but from inferring a patently illegal objective from statements and actions showing what that objective was.

        <p class="bodytext">

(StreamCast itself was urged by an associate to get [its] technology written down and [its intellectual property] protected.  App. 866.)  On the other hand the widespread distribution of creative works through improved technologies may enable the synthesis of new works or generate audiences for emerging artists.  See Eldred v.

, that  the lines between direct infringement, contributory infringement and vicarious liability are not clearly drawn … .  [R]easoned analysis of [the Sony plaintiffs contributory infringement claim] necessarily entails consideration of arguments and case law which may also be forwarded under the other labels, and indeed the parties … rely upon such arguments and authority in support of their respective positions on the issue of contributory infringement, id., at 435, n. 17 (quoting Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Sony Corp., 480 F. Supp. 429, 457458 (CD Cal. 1979)).  In the present case MGM has argued a vicarious liability theory, which allows imposition of liability when the defendant profits directly from the infringement and has a right and ability to supervise the direct infringer, even if the defendant initially lacks knowledge of the infringement.  See, e.g., Shapiro, Bernstein &amp; Co. v. H. L. Green Co., 316 F. 2d 304, 308 (CA2 1963); Dreamland Ball Room, Inc. v. Shapiro, Bernstein &amp; Co., 36 F. 2d 354, 355 (CA7 1929).  Because we resolve the case based on an inducement theory, there is no need to analyze separately MGMs vicarious liability theory.

						 Of course, in the absence of other evidence of intent, a court would be unable to find contributory infringement liability merely based on a failure to take affirmative steps to prevent infringement, if the device otherwise was capable of substantial noninfringing uses.

						 Grokster and StreamCast contend that any theory of liability based on their conduct is not properly before this Court because the rulings in the trial and appellate courts dealt only with the present versions of their software, not past acts … that allegedly encouraged infringement or assisted … known acts of infringement.  Brief for Respondents 14; see also id., at 34.  This contention misapprehends the basis for their potential liability.  It is not only that encouraging a particular consumer to infringe a copyright can give rise to secondary liability for the infringement that results.  Inducement liability goes beyond that, and the distribution of a product can itself give rise to liability where evidence shows that the distributor intended and encouraged the product to be used to infringe.  In such a case, the culpable act is not merely the encouragement of infringement but also the distribution of the tool intended for infringing use.  See Kalem Co. v. Harper Brothers,

				The question is under what circumstances the distributor of a product capable of both lawful and unlawful use is liable for acts of copyright infringement by third parties using the product.  We hold that one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright, as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement, is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties.

				Respondents, Grokster, Ltd., and StreamCast Networks, Inc., defendants in the trial court, distribute free software products that allow computer users to share electronic files through peer-to-peer networks, so called because users computers communicate directly with each other, not through central servers.  The advantage of peer-to-peer networks over information networks of other types shows up in their substantial and growing popularity.  Because they need no central computer server to mediate the exchange of information or files among users, the high-bandwidth communications capacity for a server may be dispensed with, and the need for costly server storage space is eliminated.  Since copies of a file (particularly a popular one) are available on many users computers, file requests and retrievals may be faster than on other types of networks, and since file exchanges do not travel through a server, communications can take place between any computers that remain connected to the network without risk that a glitch in the server will disable the network in its entirety.  Given these benefits in security, cost, and efficiency, peer-to-peer networks are employed to store and distribute electronic files by universities, government agencies, corporations, and libraries, among others.

				Other users of peer-to-peer networks include individual recipients of Groksters and StreamCasts software, and although the networks that they enjoy through using the software can be used to share any type of digital file, they have prominently employed those networks in sharing copyrighted music and video files without authorization.  A group of copyright holders (MGM for short, but including motion picture studios, recording companies, songwriters, and music publishers) sued Grokster and StreamCast for their users copyright infringements, alleging that they knowingly and intentionally distributed their software to enable users to reproduce and distribute the copyrighted works in violation of the Copyright Act,

				Discovery during the litigation revealed the way the software worked, the business aims of each defendant company, and the predilections of the users.  Groksters eponymous software employs what is known as FastTrack technology, a protocol developed by others and licensed to Grokster.  StreamCast distributes a very similar product except that its software, called Morpheus, relies on what is known as Gnutella technology.
				<a name="ZO-3ref" href="#ZO-3" class="">

                </sup>
            </a>
				  A user who downloads and installs either software possesses the protocol to send requests for files directly to the computers of others using software compatible with FastTrack or Gnutella.  On the FastTrack network opened by the Grokster software, the users request goes to a computer given an indexing capacity by the software and designated a supernode, or to some other computer with comparable power and capacity to collect temporary indexes of the files available on the computers of users connected to it.  The supernode (or indexing computer) searches its own index and may communicate the search request to other supernodes.  If the file is found, the supernode discloses its location to the computer requesting it, and the requesting user can download the file directly from the computer located.  The copied file is placed in a designated sharing folder on the requesting users computer, where it is available for other users to download in turn, along with any other file in that folder.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In the Gnutella network made available by Morpheus, the process is mostly the same, except that in some versions of the Gnutella protocol there are no supernodes.  In these versions, peer computers using the protocol communicate directly with each other.  When a user enters a search request into the Morpheus software, it sends the request to computers connected with it, which in turn pass the request along to other connected peers.  The search results are communicated to the requesting computer, and the user can download desired files directly from peers computers.  As this description indicates, Grokster and StreamCast use no servers to intercept the content of the search requests or to mediate the file transfers conducted by users of the software, there being no central point through which the substance of the communications passes in either direction.

				Although Grokster and StreamCast do not therefore know when particular files are copied, a few searches using their software would show what is available on the networks the software reaches.  MGM commissioned a statistician to conduct a systematic search, and his study showed that nearly 90% of the files available for download on the FastTrack system were copyrighted works.

				  Grokster and StreamCast dispute this figure, raising methodological problems and arguing that free copying even of copyrighted works may be authorized by the rightholders.  They also argue that potential noninfringing uses of their software are significant in kind, even if infrequent in practice.  Some musical performers, for example, have gained new audiences by distributing their copyrighted works for free across peer-to-peer networks, and some distributors of unprotected content have used peer-to-peer networks to disseminate files, Shakespeare being an example.  Indeed, StreamCast has given Morpheus users the opportunity to download the briefs in this very case, though their popularity has not been quantified.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				As for quantification, the parties anecdotal and statistical evidence entered thus far to show the content available on the FastTrack and Gnutella networks does not say much about which files are actually downloaded by users, and no one can say how often the software is used to obtain copies of unprotected material.  But MGMs evidence gives reason to think that the vast majority of users downloads are acts of infringement, and because well over 100 million copies of the software in question are known to have been downloaded, and billions of files are shared across the FastTrack and Gnutella networks each month, the probable scope of copyright infringement is staggering.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Grokster and StreamCast concede the infringement in most downloads, Brief for Respondents 10, n. 6, and it is uncontested that they are aware that users employ their software primarily to download copyrighted files, even if the decentralized FastTrack and Gnutella networks fail to reveal which files are being copied, and when.  From time to time, moreover, the companies have learned about their users infringement directly, as from users who have sent e-mail to each company with questions about playing copyrighted movies they had downloaded, to whom the companies have responded with guidance.

				Grokster and StreamCast are not, however, merely passive recipients of information about infringing use.  The record is replete with evidence that from the moment Grokster and StreamCast began to distribute their free software, each one clearly voiced the objective that recipients use it to download copyrighted works, and each took active steps to encourage infringement.

				After the notorious file-sharing service, Napster, was sued by copyright holders for facilitation of copyright infringement,

Supp. 2d 896 (ND Cal. 2000), affd in part, revd in part, 239 F. 3d 1004 (CA9 2001), StreamCast gave away a software program of a kind known as OpenNap, designed as compatible with the Napster program and open to Napster users for downloading files from other Napster and OpenNap users computers.  Evidence indicates that [i]t was always [StreamCasts] intent to use [its OpenNap network] to be able to capture email addresses of [its] initial target market so that [it] could promote [its] StreamCast Morpheus interface to them, App. 861; indeed, the OpenNap program was engineered  to leverage Napsters 50 million user base,  
				<em>
					id.

				, at 746.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				StreamCast monitored both the number of users downloading its OpenNap program and the number of music files they downloaded.  
				<em>

				, at 859, 863, 866.  It also used the resulting OpenNap network to distribute copies of the Morpheus software and to encourage users to adopt it.

				, at 861, 867, 1039.  Internal company documents indicate that StreamCast hoped to attract large numbers of former Napster users if that company was shut down by court order or otherwise, and that StreamCast planned to be the next Napster.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 861.  A kit developed by StreamCast to be delivered to advertisers, for example, contained press articles about StreamCasts potential to capture former Napster users, 
				<em>

				, at 568572, and it introduced itself to some potential advertisers as a company which is similar to what Napster was,

				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 586.  An internal e-mail from a company executive stated:  We have put this network in place so that when Napster pulls the plug on their free service … or if the Court orders them shut down prior to that … we will be positioned to capture the flood of their 32 million users that will be actively looking for an alternative. 

				The evidence that Grokster sought to capture the market of former Napster users is sparser but revealing, for Grokster launched its own OpenNap system called Swaptor and inserted digital codes into its Web site so that computer users using Web search engines to look for Napster or [f]ree filesharing would be directed to the Grokster Web site, where they could download the Grokster software.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In addition to this evidence of express promotion, marketing, and intent to promote further, the business models employed by Grokster and StreamCast confirm that their principal object was use of their software to download copyrighted works.  Grokster and StreamCast receive no revenue from users, who obtain the software itself for nothing.  Instead, both companies generate income by selling advertising space, and they stream the advertising to Grokster and Morpheus users while they are employing the programs.  As the number of users of each program increases, advertising opportunities become worth more.  Cf. App. 539, 804.  While there is doubtless some demand for free Shakespeare, the evidence shows that substantive volume is a function of free access to copyrighted work.  Users seeking Top 40 songs, for example, or the latest release by Modest Mouse, are certain to be far more numerous than those seeking a free Decameron, and Grokster and StreamCast translated that demand into dollars.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Finally, there is no evidence that either company made an effort to filter copyrighted material from users downloads or otherwise impede the sharing of copyrighted files.  Although Grokster appears to have sent e-mails warning users about infringing content when it received threatening notice from the copyright holders, it never blocked anyone from continuing to use its software to share copyrighted files.

				After discovery, the parties on each side of the case cross-moved for summary judgment.  The District Court limited its consideration to the asserted liability of Grokster and StreamCast for distributing the current versions of their software, leaving aside whether either was liable for damages arising from 
				<em>
					past
				</em>
				 versions of their software, or from other past activities.  259 F. Supp. 2d 1029, 1033 (CD Cal. 2003).  The District Court held that those who used the Grokster and Morpheus software to download copyrighted media files directly infringed MGMs copyrights, a conclusion not contested on appeal, but the court nonetheless granted summary judgment in favor of Grokster and StreamCast as to any liability arising from distribution of the then current versions of their software.  Distributing that software gave rise to no liability in the courts view, because its use did not provide the distributors with actual knowledge of specific acts of infringement.  Case No. CV 01 08541 SVW (PJWx) (CD Cal., June 18, 2003), App. 1213.

				The Court of Appeals affirmed.  380 F. 3d 1154 (CA9 2004).  In the courts analysis, a defendant was liable as a contributory infringer when it had knowledge of direct infringement and materially contributed to the infringement.  But the court read

, as holding that distribution of a commercial product capable of substantial noninfringing uses could not give rise to contributory liability for infringement unless the distributor had actual knowledge of specific instances of infringement and failed to act on that knowledge.  The fact that the software was capable of substantial noninfringing uses in the Ninth Circuits view meant that Grokster and StreamCast were not liable, because they had no such actual knowledge, owing to the decentralized architecture of their software.  The court also held that Grokster and StreamCast did not materially contribute to their users infringement because it was the users themselves who searched for, retrieved, and stored the infringing files, with no involvement by the defendants beyond providing the software in the first place.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Ninth Circuit also considered whether Grokster and StreamCast could be liable under a theory of vicarious infringement.  The court held against liability because the defendants did not monitor or control the use of the software, had no agreed-upon right or current ability to supervise its use, and had no independent duty to police infringement.

				The tension between the two values is the subject of this case, with its claim that digital distribution of copyrighted material threatens copyright holders as never before, because every copy is identical to the original, copying is easy, and many people (especially the young) use file-sharing software to download copyrighted works.  This very breadth of the softwares use may well draw the public directly into the debate over copyright policy, Peters, Brace Memorial Lecture: Copyright Enters the Public Domain, 51 J. Copyright Soc. 701, 705717 (2004) (address by Register of Copyrights), and the indications are that the ease of copying songs or movies using software like Groksters and Napsters is fostering disdain for copyright protection, Wu, When Code Isnt Law, 89 Va. L. Rev. 679, 724726 (2003).  As the case has been presented to us, these fears are said to be offset by the different concern that imposing liability, not only on infringers but on distributors of software based on its potential for unlawful use, could limit further development of beneficial technologies.

				The argument for imposing indirect liability in this case is, however, a powerful one, given the number of infringing downloads that occur every day using StreamCasts and Groksters software.  When a widely shared service or product is used to commit infringement, it may be impossible to enforce rights in the protected work effectively against all direct infringers, the only practical alternative being to go against the distributor of the copying device for secondary liability on a theory of contributory or vicarious infringement.

				Despite the currency of these principles of secondary liability, this Court has dealt with secondary copyright infringement in only one recent case, and because MGM has tailored its principal claim to our opinion there, a look at our earlier holding is in order.  In 
				<em>
					Sony Corp. 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					Universal City Studios
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, this Court addressed a claim that secondary liability for infringement can arise from the very distribution of a commercial product.  There, the product, novel at the time, was what we know today as the videocassette recorder or VCR.  Copyright holders sued Sony as the manufacturer, claiming it was contributorily liable for infringement that occurred when VCR owners taped copyrighted programs because it supplied the means used to infringe, and it had constructive knowledge that infringement would occur.  At the trial on the merits, the evidence showed that the principal use of the VCR was for  time-shifting,  or taping a program for later viewing at a more convenient time, which the Court found to be a fair, not an infringing, use.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 423424.  There was no evidence that Sony had expressed an object of bringing about taping in violation of copyright or had taken active steps to increase its profits from unlawful taping.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 438.  Although Sonys advertisements urged consumers to buy the VCR to  record favorite shows  or  build a library  of recorded programs, 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 459 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					B
				</span>
				lackmun
				<span class="smallcaps">

				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 424, 454455.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				On those facts, with no evidence of stated or indicated intent to promote infringing uses, the only conceivable basis for imposing liability was on a theory of contributory infringement arising from its sale of VCRs to consumers with knowledge that some would use them to infringe.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 439.  But because the VCR was capable of commercially significant noninfringing uses, we held the manufacturer could not be faulted solely on the basis of its distribution.

				This analysis reflected patent laws traditional staple article of commerce doctrine, now codified, that distribution of a component of a patented device will not violate the patent if it is suitable for use in other ways.

Conversely, the doctrine absolves the equivocal conduct of selling an item with substantial lawful as well as unlawful uses, and limits liability to instances of more acute fault than the mere understanding that some of ones products will be misused.

				The parties and many of the 
				<em>
					amici
				</em>
				 in this case think the key to resolving it is the 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 rule and, in particular, what it means for a product to be capable of commercially significant noninfringing uses. 
				<em>
					 Sony Corp.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Universal City Studios
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 442.  MGM advances the argument that granting summary judgment to Grokster and StreamCast as to their current activities gave too much weight to the value of innovative technology, and too little to the copyrights infringed by users of their software, given that 90% of works available on one of the networks was shown to be copyrighted.  Assuming the remaining 10% to be its noninfringing use, MGM says this should not qualify as substantial, and the Court should quantify Sony to the extent of holding that a product used principally for infringement does not qualify.  See Brief for Motion Picture Studio and Recording Company Petitioners 31.  As mentioned before, Grokster and StreamCast reply by citing evidence that their software can be used to reproduce public domain works, and they point to copyright holders who actually encourage copying.  Even if infringement is the principal practice with their software today, they argue, the noninfringing uses are significant and will grow.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We agree with MGM that the Court of Appeals misapplied 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				, which it read as limiting secondary liability quite beyond the circumstances to which the case applied.  
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 barred secondary liability based on presuming or imputing intent to cause infringement solely from the design or distribution of a product capable of substantial lawful use, which the distributor knows is in fact used for infringement.  The Ninth Circuit has read 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				s limitation to mean that whenever a product is capable of substantial lawful use, the producer can never be held contributorily liable for third parties infringing use of it; it read the rule as being this broad, even when an actual purpose to cause infringing use is shown by evidence independent of design and distribution of the product, unless the distributors had specific knowledge of infringement at a time at which they contributed to the infringement, and failed to act upon that information.  380 F. 3d, at 1162 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).  Because the Circuit found the StreamCast and Grokster software capable of substantial lawful use, it concluded on the basis of its reading of 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 that neither company could be held liable, since there was no showing that their software, being without any central server, afforded them knowledge of specific unlawful uses.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				This view of 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				, however, was error, converting the case from one about liability resting on imputed intent to one about liability on any theory.  Because 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 did not displace other theories of secondary liability, and because we find below that it was error to grant summary judgment to the companies on MGMs inducement claim, we  do not revisit 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 further, as MGM requests, to add a more quantified description of the point of balance between protection and commerce when liability rests solely on distribution with knowledge that unlawful use will occur.  It is enough to note that the Ninth Circuits judgment rested on an erroneous understanding of 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 and to leave further consideration of the 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 rule for a day when that may be required.

				For the same reasons that 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 took the staple-article doctrine of patent law as a model for its copyright safe-harbor rule, the inducement rule, too, is a sensible one for copyright.  We adopt it here, holding that one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright, as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement, is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties.  We are, of course, mindful of the need to keep from trenching on regular commerce or discouraging the development of technologies with lawful and unlawful potential.  Accordingly, just as 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 did not find intentional inducement despite the knowledge of the VCR manufacturer that its device could be used to infringe, 464 U. S., at 439, n. 19, mere knowledge of infringing potential or of actual infringing uses would not be enough here to subject a distributor to liability.  Nor would ordinary acts incident to product distribution, such as offering customers technical support or product updates, support liability in themselves.  The inducement rule, instead, premises liability on purposeful, culpable expression and conduct, and thus does nothing to compromise legitimate commerce or discourage innovation having a lawful promise.

				The only apparent question about treating MGMs evidence as sufficient to withstand summary judgment under the theory of inducement goes to the need on MGMs part to adduce evidence that StreamCast and Grokster communicated an inducing message to their software users.  The classic instance of inducement is by advertisement or solicitation that broadcasts a message designed to stimulate others to commit violations.  MGM claims that such a message is shown here.  It is undisputed that StreamCast beamed onto the computer screens of users of Napster-compatible programs ads urging the adoption of its OpenNap program, which was designed, as its name implied, to invite the custom of patrons of Napster, then under attack in the courts for facilitating massive infringement.  Those who accepted StreamCasts OpenNap program were offered software to perform the same services, which a factfinder could conclude would readily have been understood in the Napster market as the ability to download copyrighted music files.  Grokster distributed an electronic newsletter containing links to articles promoting its softwares ability to access popular copyrighted music.  And anyone whose Napster or free file-sharing searches turned up a link to Grokster would have understood Grokster to be offering the same file-sharing ability as Napster, and to the same people who probably used Napster for infringing downloads; that would also have been the understanding of anyone offered Groksters suggestively named Swaptor software, its version of OpenNap.  And both companies communicated a clear message by responding affirmatively to requests for help in locating and playing copyrighted materials.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In StreamCasts case, of course, the evidence just described was supplemented by other unequivocal indications of unlawful purpose in the internal communications and advertising designs aimed at Napster users (When the lights went off at Napster … where did the users go?  App. 836 (ellipsis in original)).  Whether the messages were communicated is not to the point on this record.  The function of the message in the theory of inducement is to prove by a defendants own statements that his unlawful purpose disqualifies him from claiming protection (and incidentally to point to actual violators likely to be found among those who hear or read the message).  See 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 1719.  Proving that a message was sent out, then, is the preeminent but not exclusive way of showing that active steps were taken with the purpose of bringing about infringing acts, and of showing that infringing acts took place by using the device distributed.  Here, the summary judgment record is replete with other evidence that Grokster and StreamCast, unlike the manufacturer and distributor in 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				, acted with a purpose to cause copyright violations by use of software suitable for illegal use.  See 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 69.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Three features of this evidence of intent are particularly notable.  First, each company showed itself to be aiming to satisfy a known source of demand for copyright infringement, the market comprising former Napster users.  StreamCasts internal documents made constant reference to Napster, it initially distributed its Morpheus software through an OpenNap program compatible with Napster, it advertised its OpenNap program to Napster users, and its Morpheus software functions as Napster did except that it could be used to distribute more kinds of files, including copyrighted movies and software programs.  Groksters name is apparently derived from Napster, it too initially offered an OpenNap program, its softwares function is likewise comparable to Napsters, and it attempted to divert queries for Napster onto its own Web site.  Grokster and StreamCasts efforts to supply services to former Napster users, deprived of a mechanism to copy and distribute what were overwhelmingly infringing files, indicate a principal, if not exclusive, intent on the part of each to bring about infringement.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, this evidence of unlawful objective is given added significance by MGMs showing that neither company attempted to develop filtering tools or other mechanisms to diminish the infringing activity using their software.  While the Ninth Circuit treated the defendants failure to develop such tools as irrelevant because they lacked an independent duty to monitor their users activity, we think this evidence underscores Groksters and StreamCasts intentional facilitation of their users infringement.

            </a>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Third, there is a further complement to the direct evidence of unlawful objective.  It is useful to recall that StreamCast and Grokster make money by selling advertising space, by directing ads to the screens of computers employing their software.  As the record shows, the more the software is used, the more ads are sent out and the greater the advertising revenue becomes.  Since the extent of the softwares use determines the gain to the distributors, the commercial sense of their enterprise turns on high-volume use, which the record shows is infringing.

				In addition to intent to bring about infringement and distribution of a device suitable for infringing use, the inducement theory of course requires evidence of actual infringement by recipients of the device, the software in this case.  As the account of the facts indicates, there is evidence of infringement on a gigantic scale, and there is no serious issue of the adequacy of MGMs showing on this point in order to survive the companies summary judgment requests.  Although an exact calculation of infringing use, as a basis for a claim of damages, is subject to dispute, there is no question that the summary judgment evidence is at least adequate to entitle MGM to go forward with claims for damages and equitable relief.

				 dealt with a claim of liability based solely on distributing a product with alternative lawful and unlawful uses, with knowledge that some users would follow the unlawful course.  The case struck a balance between the interests of protection and innovation by holding that the products capability of substantial lawful employment should bar the imputation of fault and consequent secondary liability for the unlawful acts of others.

				MGMs evidence in this case most obviously addresses a different basis of liability for distributing a product open to alternative uses.  Here, evidence of the distributors words and deeds going beyond distribution as such shows a purpose to cause and profit from third-party acts of copyright infringement.  If liability for inducing infringement is ultimately found, it will not be on the basis of presuming or imputing fault, but from inferring a patently illegal objective from statements and actions showing what that objective was.

						 Peer-to-peer networks have disadvantages as well.  Searches on peer-to-peer networks may not reach and uncover all available files because search requests may not be transmitted to every computer on the network.  There may be redundant copies of popular files.  The creator of the software has no incentive to minimize storage or bandwidth consumption, the costs of which are borne by every user of the network.  Most relevant here, it is more difficult to control the content of files available for retrieval and the behavior of users.

						 The mutual exclusivity of these values should not be overstated, however.

[R]easoned analysis of [the Sony plaintiffs contributory infringement claim] necessarily entails consideration of arguments and case law which may also be forwarded under the other labels, and indeed the parties … rely upon such arguments and authority in support of their respective positions on the issue of contributory infringement, id., at 435, n. 17 (quoting Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Sony Corp., 480 F. Supp. 429, 457458 (CD Cal. 1979)).  In the present case MGM has argued a vicarious liability theory, which allows imposition of liability when the defendant profits directly from the infringement and has a right and ability to supervise the direct infringer, even if the defendant initially lacks knowledge of the infringement.  See, e.g., Shapiro, Bernstein &amp; Co. v. H. L. Green Co., 316 F. 2d 304, 308 (CA2 1963); Dreamland Ball Room, Inc. v. Shapiro, Bernstein &amp; Co., 36 F. 2d 354, 355 (CA7 1929).  Because we resolve the case based on an inducement theory, there is no need to analyze separately MGMs vicarious liability theory.

						 Of course, in the absence of other evidence of intent, a court would be unable to find contributory infringement liability merely based on a failure to take affirmative steps to prevent infringement, if the device otherwise was capable of substantial noninfringing uses.

						 Grokster and StreamCast contend that any theory of liability based on their conduct is not properly before this Court because the rulings in the trial and appellate courts dealt only with the present versions of their software, not past acts … that allegedly encouraged infringement or assisted … known acts of infringement.  Brief for Respondents 14; see also id., at 34.  This contention misapprehends the basis for their potential liability.  It is not only that encouraging a particular consumer to infringe a copyright can give rise to secondary liability for the infringement that results.  Inducement liability goes beyond that, and the distribution of a product can itself give rise to liability where evidence shows that the distributor intended and encouraged the product to be used to infringe.  In such a case, the culpable act is not merely the encouragement of infringement but also the distribution of the tool intended for infringing use.  See Kalem Co. v. Harper Brothers,

				The question is under what circumstances the distributor of a product capable of both lawful and unlawful use is liable for acts of copyright infringement by third parties using the product.  We hold that one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright, as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement, is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties.

				Respondents, Grokster, Ltd., and StreamCast Networks, Inc., defendants in the trial court, distribute free software products that allow computer users to share electronic files through peer-to-peer networks, so called because users computers communicate directly with each other, not through central servers.  The advantage of peer-to-peer networks over information networks of other types shows up in their substantial and growing popularity.  Because they need no central computer server to mediate the exchange of information or files among users, the high-bandwidth communications capacity for a server may be dispensed with, and the need for costly server storage space is eliminated.  Since copies of a file (particularly a popular one) are available on many users computers, file requests and retrievals may be faster than on other types of networks, and since file exchanges do not travel through a server, communications can take place between any computers that remain connected to the network without risk that a glitch in the server will disable the network in its entirety.  Given these benefits in security, cost, and efficiency, peer-to-peer networks are employed to store and distribute electronic files by universities, government agencies, corporations, and libraries, among others.

				Other users of peer-to-peer networks include individual recipients of Groksters and StreamCasts software, and although the networks that they enjoy through using the software can be used to share any type of digital file, they have prominently employed those networks in sharing copyrighted music and video files without authorization.  A group of copyright holders (MGM for short, but including motion picture studios, recording companies, songwriters, and music publishers) sued Grokster and StreamCast for their users copyright infringements, alleging that they knowingly and intentionally distributed their software to enable users to reproduce and distribute the copyrighted works in violation of the Copyright Act,

				Discovery during the litigation revealed the way the software worked, the business aims of each defendant company, and the predilections of the users.  Groksters eponymous software employs what is known as FastTrack technology, a protocol developed by others and licensed to Grokster.  StreamCast distributes a very similar product except that its software, called Morpheus, relies on what is known as Gnutella technology.
				<a name="ZO-3ref" href="#ZO-3" class="">

                </sup>
            </a>
				  A user who downloads and installs either software possesses the protocol to send requests for files directly to the computers of others using software compatible with FastTrack or Gnutella.  On the FastTrack network opened by the Grokster software, the users request goes to a computer given an indexing capacity by the software and designated a supernode, or to some other computer with comparable power and capacity to collect temporary indexes of the files available on the computers of users connected to it.  The supernode (or indexing computer) searches its own index and may communicate the search request to other supernodes.  If the file is found, the supernode discloses its location to the computer requesting it, and the requesting user can download the file directly from the computer located.  The copied file is placed in a designated sharing folder on the requesting users computer, where it is available for other users to download in turn, along with any other file in that folder.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In the Gnutella network made available by Morpheus, the process is mostly the same, except that in some versions of the Gnutella protocol there are no supernodes.  In these versions, peer computers using the protocol communicate directly with each other.  When a user enters a search request into the Morpheus software, it sends the request to computers connected with it, which in turn pass the request along to other connected peers.  The search results are communicated to the requesting computer, and the user can download desired files directly from peers computers.  As this description indicates, Grokster and StreamCast use no servers to intercept the content of the search requests or to mediate the file transfers conducted by users of the software, there being no central point through which the substance of the communications passes in either direction.

				Although Grokster and StreamCast do not therefore know when particular files are copied, a few searches using their software would show what is available on the networks the software reaches.  MGM commissioned a statistician to conduct a systematic search, and his study showed that nearly 90% of the files available for download on the FastTrack system were copyrighted works.

				  Grokster and StreamCast dispute this figure, raising methodological problems and arguing that free copying even of copyrighted works may be authorized by the rightholders.  They also argue that potential noninfringing uses of their software are significant in kind, even if infrequent in practice.  Some musical performers, for example, have gained new audiences by distributing their copyrighted works for free across peer-to-peer networks, and some distributors of unprotected content have used peer-to-peer networks to disseminate files, Shakespeare being an example.  Indeed, StreamCast has given Morpheus users the opportunity to download the briefs in this very case, though their popularity has not been quantified.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				As for quantification, the parties anecdotal and statistical evidence entered thus far to show the content available on the FastTrack and Gnutella networks does not say much about which files are actually downloaded by users, and no one can say how often the software is used to obtain copies of unprotected material.  But MGMs evidence gives reason to think that the vast majority of users downloads are acts of infringement, and because well over 100 million copies of the software in question are known to have been downloaded, and billions of files are shared across the FastTrack and Gnutella networks each month, the probable scope of copyright infringement is staggering.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Grokster and StreamCast concede the infringement in most downloads, Brief for Respondents 10, n. 6, and it is uncontested that they are aware that users employ their software primarily to download copyrighted files, even if the decentralized FastTrack and Gnutella networks fail to reveal which files are being copied, and when.  From time to time, moreover, the companies have learned about their users infringement directly, as from users who have sent e-mail to each company with questions about playing copyrighted movies they had downloaded, to whom the companies have responded with guidance.

				Grokster and StreamCast are not, however, merely passive recipients of information about infringing use.

Evidence indicates that [i]t was always [StreamCasts] intent to use [its OpenNap network] to be able to capture email addresses of [its] initial target market so that [it] could promote [its] StreamCast Morpheus interface to them, App. 861; indeed, the OpenNap program was engineered  to leverage Napsters 50 million user base, 

				In addition to this evidence of express promotion, marketing, and intent to promote further, the business models employed by Grokster and StreamCast confirm that their principal object was use of their software to download copyrighted works.  Grokster and StreamCast receive no revenue from users, who obtain the software itself for nothing.  Instead, both companies generate income by selling advertising space, and they stream the advertising to Grokster and Morpheus users while they are employing the programs.  As the number of users of each program increases, advertising opportunities become worth more.  Cf. App. 539, 804.  While there is doubtless some demand for free Shakespeare, the evidence shows that substantive volume is a function of free access to copyrighted work.  Users seeking Top 40 songs, for example, or the latest release by Modest Mouse, are certain to be far more numerous than those seeking a free Decameron, and Grokster and StreamCast translated that demand into dollars.

				Finally, there is no evidence that either company made an effort to filter copyrighted material from users downloads or otherwise impede the sharing of copyrighted files.  Although Grokster appears to have sent e-mails warning users about infringing content when it received threatening notice from the copyright holders, it never blocked anyone from continuing to use its software to share copyrighted files.

				After discovery, the parties on each side of the case cross-moved for summary judgment.  The District Court limited its consideration to the asserted liability of Grokster and StreamCast for distributing the current versions of their software, leaving aside whether either was liable for damages arising from 
				<em>
					past
				</em>
				 versions of their software, or from other past activities.  259 F. Supp. 2d 1029, 1033 (CD Cal. 2003).  The District Court held that those who used the Grokster and Morpheus software to download copyrighted media files directly infringed MGMs copyrights, a conclusion not contested on appeal, but the court nonetheless granted summary judgment in favor of Grokster and StreamCast as to any liability arising from distribution of the then current versions of their software.  Distributing that software gave rise to no liability in the courts view, because its use did not provide the distributors with actual knowledge of specific acts of infringement.  Case No. CV 01 08541 SVW (PJWx) (CD Cal., June 18, 2003), App. 1213.

				The Court of Appeals affirmed.  380 F. 3d 1154 (CA9 2004).  In the courts analysis, a defendant was liable as a contributory infringer when it had knowledge of direct infringement and materially contributed to the infringement.  But the court read

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/464/417" class="subref" title="subref">464 U. S. 417</a> (1984)
, as holding that distribution of a commercial product capable of substantial noninfringing uses could not give rise to contributory liability for infringement unless the distributor had actual knowledge of specific instances of infringement and failed to act on that knowledge.  The fact that the software was capable of substantial noninfringing uses in the Ninth Circuits view meant that Grokster and StreamCast were not liable, because they had no such actual knowledge, owing to the decentralized architecture of their software.  The court also held that Grokster and StreamCast did not materially contribute to their users infringement because it was the users themselves who searched for, retrieved, and stored the infringing files, with no involvement by the defendants beyond providing the software in the first place.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Ninth Circuit also considered whether Grokster and StreamCast could be liable under a theory of vicarious infringement.  The court held against liability because the defendants did not monitor or control the use of the software, had no agreed-upon right or current ability to supervise its use, and had no independent duty to police infringement.  We granted certiorari.  543 U. S. ___ (2004).

				MGM and many of the

				 fault the Court of Appealss holding for upsetting a sound balance between the respective values of supporting creative pursuits through copyright protection and promoting innovation in new communication technologies by limiting the incidence of liability for copyright infringement.

				The tension between the two values is the subject of this case, with its claim that digital distribution of copyrighted material threatens copyright holders as never before, because every copy is identical to the original, copying is easy, and many people (especially the young) use file-sharing software to download copyrighted works.  This very breadth of the softwares use may well draw the public directly into the debate over copyright policy, Peters, Brace Memorial Lecture: Copyright Enters the Public Domain, 51 J. Copyright Soc. 701, 705717 (2004) (address by Register of Copyrights), and the indications are that the ease of copying songs or movies using software like Groksters and Napsters is fostering disdain for copyright protection, Wu, When Code Isnt Law, 89 Va. L. Rev. 679, 724726 (2003).  As the case has been presented to us, these fears are said to be offset by the different concern that imposing liability, not only on infringers but on distributors of software based on its potential for unlawful use, could limit further development of beneficial technologies.

				The argument for imposing indirect liability in this case is, however, a powerful one, given the number of infringing downloads that occur every day using StreamCasts and Groksters software.  When a widely shared service or product is used to commit infringement, it may be impossible to enforce rights in the protected work effectively against all direct infringers, the only practical alternative being to go against the distributor of the copying device for secondary liability on a theory of contributory or vicarious infringement.

				Despite the currency of these principles of secondary liability, this Court has dealt with secondary copyright infringement in only one recent case, and because MGM has tailored its principal claim to our opinion there, a look at our earlier holding is in order.  In 
				<em>
					Sony Corp. 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					Universal City Studios
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, this Court addressed a claim that secondary liability for infringement can arise from the very distribution of a commercial product.  There, the product, novel at the time, was what we know today as the videocassette recorder or VCR.  Copyright holders sued Sony as the manufacturer, claiming it was contributorily liable for infringement that occurred when VCR owners taped copyrighted programs because it supplied the means used to infringe, and it had constructive knowledge that infringement would occur.  At the trial on the merits, the evidence showed that the principal use of the VCR was for  time-shifting,  or taping a program for later viewing at a more convenient time, which the Court found to be a fair, not an infringing, use.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 423424.  There was no evidence that Sony had expressed an object of bringing about taping in violation of copyright or had taken active steps to increase its profits from unlawful taping.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 438.  Although Sonys advertisements urged consumers to buy the VCR to  record favorite shows  or  build a library  of recorded programs, 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 459 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					B
				</span>
				lackmun
				<span class="smallcaps">

				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 424, 454455.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				On those facts, with no evidence of stated or indicated intent to promote infringing uses, the only conceivable basis for imposing liability was on a theory of contributory infringement arising from its sale of VCRs to consumers with knowledge that some would use them to infringe.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 439.  But because the VCR was capable of commercially significant noninfringing uses, we held the manufacturer could not be faulted solely on the basis of its distribution.

				This analysis reflected patent laws traditional staple article of commerce doctrine, now codified, that distribution of a component of a patented device will not violate the patent if it is suitable for use in other ways.

				The parties and many of the 
				<em>
					amici
				</em>
				 in this case think the key to resolving it is the 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 rule and, in particular, what it means for a product to be capable of commercially significant noninfringing uses. 
				<em>
					 Sony Corp.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Universal City Studios
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 442.  MGM advances the argument that granting summary judgment to Grokster and StreamCast as to their current activities gave too much weight to the value of innovative technology, and too little to the copyrights infringed by users of their software, given that 90% of works available on one of the networks was shown to be copyrighted.  Assuming the remaining 10% to be its noninfringing use, MGM says this should not qualify as substantial, and the Court should quantify Sony to the extent of holding that a product used principally for infringement does not qualify.  See Brief for Motion Picture Studio and Recording Company Petitioners 31.  As mentioned before, Grokster and StreamCast reply by citing evidence that their software can be used to reproduce public domain works, and they point to copyright holders who actually encourage copying.  Even if infringement is the principal practice with their software today, they argue, the noninfringing uses are significant and will grow.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We agree with MGM that the Court of Appeals misapplied 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				, which it read as limiting secondary liability quite beyond the circumstances to which the case applied.  
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 barred secondary liability based on presuming or imputing intent to cause infringement solely from the design or distribution of a product capable of substantial lawful use, which the distributor knows is in fact used for infringement.  The Ninth Circuit has read 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				s limitation to mean that whenever a product is capable of substantial lawful use, the producer can never be held contributorily liable for third parties infringing use of it; it read the rule as being this broad, even when an actual purpose to cause infringing use is shown by evidence independent of design and distribution of the product, unless the distributors had specific knowledge of infringement at a time at which they contributed to the infringement, and failed to act upon that information.  380 F. 3d, at 1162 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).  Because the Circuit found the StreamCast and Grokster software capable of substantial lawful use, it concluded on the basis of its reading of 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 that neither company could be held liable, since there was no showing that their software, being without any central server, afforded them knowledge of specific unlawful uses.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				This view of 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				, however, was error, converting the case from one about liability resting on imputed intent to one about liability on any theory.  Because 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 did not displace other theories of secondary liability, and because we find below that it was error to grant summary judgment to the companies on MGMs inducement claim, we  do not revisit 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 further, as MGM requests, to add a more quantified description of the point of balance between protection and commerce when liability rests solely on distribution with knowledge that unlawful use will occur.  It is enough to note that the Ninth Circuits judgment rested on an erroneous understanding of 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 and to leave further consideration of the 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 rule for a day when that may be required.

				For the same reasons that 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 took the staple-article doctrine of patent law as a model for its copyright safe-harbor rule, the inducement rule, too, is a sensible one for copyright.  We adopt it here, holding that one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright, as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement, is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties.  We are, of course, mindful of the need to keep from trenching on regular commerce or discouraging the development of technologies with lawful and unlawful potential.  Accordingly, just as 
				<em>

				 did not find intentional inducement despite the knowledge of the VCR manufacturer that its device could be used to infringe, 464 U. S., at 439, n. 19, mere knowledge of infringing potential or of actual infringing uses would not be enough here to subject a distributor to liability.  Nor would ordinary acts incident to product distribution, such as offering customers technical support or product updates, support liability in themselves.  The inducement rule, instead, premises liability on purposeful, culpable expression and conduct, and thus does nothing to compromise legitimate commerce or discourage innovation having a lawful promise.

				The only apparent question about treating MGMs evidence as sufficient to withstand summary judgment under the theory of inducement goes to the need on MGMs part to adduce evidence that StreamCast and Grokster communicated an inducing message to their software users.  The classic instance of inducement is by advertisement or solicitation that broadcasts a message designed to stimulate others to commit violations.  MGM claims that such a message is shown here.  It is undisputed that StreamCast beamed onto the computer screens of users of Napster-compatible programs ads urging the adoption of its OpenNap program, which was designed, as its name implied, to invite the custom of patrons of Napster, then under attack in the courts for facilitating massive infringement.  Those who accepted StreamCasts OpenNap program were offered software to perform the same services, which a factfinder could conclude would readily have been understood in the Napster market as the ability to download copyrighted music files.  Grokster distributed an electronic newsletter containing links to articles promoting its softwares ability to access popular copyrighted music.  And anyone whose Napster or free file-sharing searches turned up a link to Grokster would have understood Grokster to be offering the same file-sharing ability as Napster, and to the same people who probably used Napster for infringing downloads; that would also have been the understanding of anyone offered Groksters suggestively named Swaptor software, its version of OpenNap.  And both companies communicated a clear message by responding affirmatively to requests for help in locating and playing copyrighted materials.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In StreamCasts case, of course, the evidence just described was supplemented by other unequivocal indications of unlawful purpose in the internal communications and advertising designs aimed at Napster users (When the lights went off at Napster … where did the users go?  App. 836 (ellipsis in original)).  Whether the messages were communicated is not to the point on this record.  The function of the message in the theory of inducement is to prove by a defendants own statements that his unlawful purpose disqualifies him from claiming protection (and incidentally to point to actual violators likely to be found among those who hear or read the message).  See 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 1719.  Proving that a message was sent out, then, is the preeminent but not exclusive way of showing that active steps were taken with the purpose of bringing about infringing acts, and of showing that infringing acts took place by using the device distributed.  Here, the summary judgment record is replete with other evidence that Grokster and StreamCast, unlike the manufacturer and distributor in 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				, acted with a purpose to cause copyright violations by use of software suitable for illegal use.  See 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 69.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Three features of this evidence of intent are particularly notable.  First, each company showed itself to be aiming to satisfy a known source of demand for copyright infringement, the market comprising former Napster users.  StreamCasts internal documents made constant reference to Napster, it initially distributed its Morpheus software through an OpenNap program compatible with Napster, it advertised its OpenNap program to Napster users, and its Morpheus software functions as Napster did except that it could be used to distribute more kinds of files, including copyrighted movies and software programs.  Groksters name is apparently derived from Napster, it too initially offered an OpenNap program, its softwares function is likewise comparable to Napsters, and it attempted to divert queries for Napster onto its own Web site.  Grokster and StreamCasts efforts to supply services to former Napster users, deprived of a mechanism to copy and distribute what were overwhelmingly infringing files, indicate a principal, if not exclusive, intent on the part of each to bring about infringement.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, this evidence of unlawful objective is given added significance by MGMs showing that neither company attempted to develop filtering tools or other mechanisms to diminish the infringing activity using their software.  While the Ninth Circuit treated the defendants failure to develop such tools as irrelevant because they lacked an independent duty to monitor their users activity, we think this evidence underscores Groksters and StreamCasts intentional facilitation of their users infringement.

            </a>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Third, there is a further complement to the direct evidence of unlawful objective.  It is useful to recall that StreamCast and Grokster make money by selling advertising space, by directing ads to the screens of computers employing their software.  As the record shows, the more the software is used, the more ads are sent out and the greater the advertising revenue becomes.  Since the extent of the softwares use determines the gain to the distributors, the commercial sense of their enterprise turns on high-volume use, which the record shows is infringing.

                </sup>
            </a>
				  This evidence alone would not justify an inference of unlawful intent, but viewed in the context of the entire record its import is clear.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The unlawful objective is unmistakable.

				B
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				In addition to intent to bring about infringement and distribution of a device suitable for infringing use, the inducement theory of course requires evidence of actual infringement by recipients of the device, the software in this case.  As the account of the facts indicates, there is evidence of infringement on a gigantic scale, and there is no serious issue of the adequacy of MGMs showing on this point in order to survive the companies summary judgment requests.  Although an exact calculation of infringing use, as a basis for a claim of damages, is subject to dispute, there is no question that the summary judgment evidence is at least adequate to entitle MGM to go forward with claims for damages and equitable relief.

				In sum, this case is significantly different from 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 and reliance on that case to rule in favor of StreamCast and Grokster was error.  
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 dealt with a claim of liability based solely on distributing a product with alternative lawful and unlawful uses, with knowledge that some users would follow the unlawful course.  The case struck a balance between the interests of protection and innovation by holding that the products capability of substantial lawful employment should bar the imputation of fault and consequent secondary liability for the unlawful acts of others.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				MGMs evidence in this case most obviously addresses a different basis of liability for distributing a product open to alternative uses.  Here, evidence of the distributors words and deeds going beyond distribution as such shows a purpose to cause and profit from third-party acts of copyright infringement.  If liability for inducing infringement is ultimately found, it will not be on the basis of presuming or imputing fault, but from inferring a patently illegal objective from statements and actions showing what that objective was.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				There is substantial evidence in MGMs favor on all elements of inducement, and summary judgment in favor of Grokster and StreamCast was error.  On remand, reconsideration of MGMs motion for summary judgment will be in order.

						 Peer-to-peer networks have disadvantages as well.  Searches on peer-to-peer networks may not reach and uncover all available files because search requests may not be transmitted to every computer on the network.  There may be redundant copies of popular files.  The creator of the software has no incentive to minimize storage or bandwidth consumption, the costs of which are borne by every user of the network.  Most relevant here, it is more difficult to control the content of files available for retrieval and the behavior of users.

Sony Corp., 480 F. Supp. 429, 457458 (CD Cal. 1979)).  In the present case MGM has argued a vicarious liability theory, which allows imposition of liability when the defendant profits directly from the infringement and has a right and ability to supervise the direct infringer, even if the defendant initially lacks knowledge of the infringement.  See, e.g., Shapiro, Bernstein &amp; Co. v. H. L. Green Co., 316 F. 2d 304, 308 (CA2 1963); Dreamland Ball Room, Inc. v. Shapiro, Bernstein &amp; Co., 36 F. 2d 354, 355 (CA7 1929).

						 Of course, in the absence of other evidence of intent, a court would be unable to find contributory infringement liability merely based on a failure to take affirmative steps to prevent infringement, if the device otherwise was capable of substantial noninfringing uses.

						 Grokster and StreamCast contend that any theory of liability based on their conduct is not properly before this Court because the rulings in the trial and appellate courts dealt only with the present versions of their software, not past acts … that allegedly encouraged infringement or assisted … known acts of infringement.  Brief for Respondents 14; see also id., at 34.  This contention misapprehends the basis for their potential liability.  It is not only that encouraging a particular consumer to infringe a copyright can give rise to secondary liability for the infringement that results.  Inducement liability goes beyond that, and the distribution of a product can itself give rise to liability where evidence shows that the distributor intended and encouraged the product to be used to infringe.  In such a case, the culpable act is not merely the encouragement of infringement but also the distribution of the tool intended for infringing use.  See Kalem Co. v. Harper Brothers,

				At bottom, however labeled, the question in this case is whether Grokster and StreamCast are liable for the direct infringing acts of others.  Liability under our jurisprudence may be predicated on actively encouraging (or inducing) infringement through specific acts (as the Courts opinion develops) or on distributing a product distributees use to infringe copyrights, if the product is not capable of substantial or commercially significant noninfringing uses.

				The staple article of commerce doctrine applied to copyright, the Court stated, must strike a balance between a copyright holders legitimate demand for effectivenot merely symbolicprotection of the statutory monopoly, and the rights of others freely to engage in substantially unrelated areas of commerce.  
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				, 464 U. S., at 442. 
				<em>

				Accordingly, the Court held, the sale of copying equipment, like the sale of other articles of commerce, does not constitute contributory infringement if the product is widely used for legitimate, unobjectionable purposes.  Indeed, it need merely be capable of substantial noninfringing uses.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  Thus, to resolve the 
				<em>

				case, the Court explained, it had to determine whether the Betamax is capable of commercially significant noninfringing uses.  Ibid.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				To answer that question, the Court considered whether a significant number of [potential uses of the Betamax were] noninfringing.  Ibid.
				  The Court homed in on one potential useprivate, noncommercial time-shifting of television programs in the home (
				<em>
					i.e.

				The Ninth Circuit went astray, I will endeavor to explain, when that court granted summary judgment to Grokster and StreamCast on the charge of contributory liability based on distribution of their software products.  Relying on its earlier opinion in

				 v. 
				<em>

				</em>
				, 239 F. 3d 1004 (CA9 2001), the Court of Appeals held that if substantial noninfringing use was shown, the copyright owner would be required to show that the defendant had reasonable knowledge of specific infringing files.  380 F. 3d 1154, 1161 (CA9 2004).  A careful examination of the record, the court concluded, indicates that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to noninfringing use.  
				<em>

				  The appeals court pointed to the band Wilco, which made one of its albums available for free downloading, to other recording artists who may have authorized free distribution of their music through the Internet, and to public domain literary works and films available through Groksters and StreamCasts software.

				The District Court declared it undisputed that there are substantial noninfringing uses for Defendants software, thus obviating the need for further proceedings.  259 F. Supp. 2d, at 1035.  This conclusion appears to rest almost entirely on the collection of declarations submitted by Grokster and StreamCast.

						 Justice Breyer finds in Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/464/417" class="subref" title="subref">464 U. S. 417</a> (1984)
, a clear rule permitting contributory liability for copyright infringement based on distribution of a product only when the product will be used almost exclusively to infringe copyrights.  Post, at 910.  But cf. Sony, 464 U. S., at 442 (recognizing copyright holders legitimate demand for effectivenot merely symbolicprotection).  Sony, as I read it, contains no clear, near-exclusivity test.  Nor have Courts of Appeals unanimously recognized Justice Breyers clear rule.  Compare A&amp;M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc., 239 F. 3d 1004, 1021 (CA9 2001) ([E]vidence of actual knowledge of specific acts of infringement is required to hold a computer system operator liable for contributory copyright infringement.), with In re Aimster Copyright Litigation, 334 F. 3d 643, 649650 (CA7 2003) ([W]hen a supplier is offering a product or service that has noninfringing as well as infringing uses, some estimate of the respective magnitudes of these uses is necessary for a finding of contributory infringement. …  But the balancing of costs and benefits is necessary only in a case in which substantial noninfringing uses, present or prospective, are demonstrated.).  See also Matthew Bender &amp; Co., Inc. v. West Pub. Co., 158 F. 3d 693, 707 (CA2 1998) (The Supreme Court applied [the Sony] test to prevent copyright holders from leveraging the copyrights in their original work to control distribution of … products that might be used incidentally for infringement, but that had substantial noninfringing uses… .  The same rationale applies here [to products] that have substantial, predominant and noninfringing uses as tools for research and citation.).  All Members of the Court agree, moreover, that the Court of Appeals misapplied Sony, at least to the extent it read that decision to limit secondary liability to a hardly-ever category, quite beyond the circumstances to which the case applied.  Ante, at 16.

						 Grokster and StreamCast, in the Court of Appeals view, would be entitled to summary judgment unless MGM could show that that the software companies had knowledge of specific acts of infringement and failed to act on that knowledgea standard the court held MGM could not meet.  380 F. 3d, at 11621163.

						 Justice Breyer finds support for summary judgment in this motley collection of declarations and in a survey conducted by an expert retained by MGM.  Post, at 48.  That survey identified 75% of the files available through Grokster as copyrighted works owned or controlled by the plaintiffs, and 15% of the files as works likely copyrighted.  App. 439.  As to the remaining 10% of the files, there was not enough information to form reasonable conclusions either as to what those files even consisted of, and/or whether they were infringing or non-infringing.  App. 479.  Even assuming, as Justice Breyer does, that the Sony Court would have absolved Sony of contributory liability solely on the basis of the use of the Betamax for authorized time-shifting, post, at 34, summary judgment is not inevitably appropriate here.  Sony stressed that the plaintiffs there owned well below 10% of copyrighted television programming, 464 U. S., at 443, and found, based on trial testimony from representatives of the four major sports leagues and other individuals authorized to consent to home-recording of their copyrighted broadcasts, that a similar percentage of program copying was authorized, id., at 424.  Here, the plaintiffs allegedly control copyrights for 70% or 75% of the material exchanged through the Grokster and StreamCast software, 380 F. 3d, at 1158; App. 439, and the District Court does not appear to have relied on comparable testimony about authorized copying from copyright holders.

				I concur in the Courts decision, which vacates in full the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,

.  There is here at least a genuine issue as to [a] material fact, Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(c), on the liability of Grokster or StreamCast, not only for actively inducing copyright infringement, but also or alternatively, based on the distribution of their software products, for contributory copyright infringement.  On neither score was summary judgment for Grokster and StreamCast warranted.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				At bottom, however labeled, the question in this case is whether Grokster and StreamCast are liable for the direct infringing acts of others.  Liability under our jurisprudence may be predicated on actively encouraging (or inducing) infringement through specific acts (as the Courts opinion develops) or on distributing a product distributees use to infringe copyrights, if the product is not capable of substantial or commercially significant noninfringing uses.

					Sony,

				464 U. S., at 442; see also 3 M. Nimmer &amp; D. Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright §12.04[A][2] (2005).  While the two categories overlap, they capture different culpable behavior.  Long coexisting, both are now codified in patent law.  Compare 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/35/271.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">35 U. S. C. §271(b)</a> (active inducement liability), with §271(c) (contributory liability for distribution of a product not suitable for substantial noninfringing use).

				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/464/417" class="subref" title="subref">464 U.

Drawing an analogy to the staple article of commerce doctrine from patent law, the 
				<em>
					Sony

				Court observed that the sale of an article … adapted to [a patent] infringing use does not suffice to make the seller a contributory infringer if the article is also adapted to other and lawful uses.

				The staple article of commerce doctrine applied to copyright, the Court stated, must strike a balance between a copyright holders legitimate demand for effectivenot merely symbolicprotection of the statutory monopoly, and the rights of others freely to engage in substantially unrelated areas of commerce.  
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				, 464 U. S., at 442. 
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				Accordingly, the Court held, the sale of copying equipment, like the sale of other articles of commerce, does not constitute contributory infringement if the product is widely used for legitimate, unobjectionable purposes.  Indeed, it need merely be capable of substantial noninfringing uses.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  Thus, to resolve the 
				<em>
					Sony 
				</em>
				case, the Court explained, it had to determine whether the Betamax is capable of commercially significant noninfringing uses.  Ibid.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				To answer that question, the Court considered whether a significant number of [potential uses of the Betamax were] noninfringing.  Ibid.
				  The Court homed in on one potential useprivate, noncommercial time-shifting of television programs in the home (
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, recording a broadcast TV program for later personal viewing).  Time-shifting was noninfringing, the Court concluded, because in some cases trial testimony showed it was authorized by the copyright holder, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 443447, and in others it qualified as legitimate fair use, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 447455.  Most purchasers used the Betamax principally to engage in time-shifting, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 421, 423, a use that plainly satisfie[d] the Courts standard, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 442.  Thus, there was no need in 
				<em>
					Sony 
				</em>
				to give precise content to the question of how much [actual or potential] use is commercially significant.  
				<em>

				</em>
				  Further development was left for later days and cases.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Ninth Circuit went astray, I will endeavor to explain, when that court granted summary judgment to Grokster and StreamCast on the charge of contributory liability based on distribution of their software products.  Relying on its earlier opinion in 
				<em>
					A&amp;M Records, Inc.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Napster, Inc.
				</em>
				, 239 F. 3d 1004 (CA9 2001), the Court of Appeals held that if substantial noninfringing use was shown, the copyright owner would be required to show that the defendant had reasonable knowledge of specific infringing files.  380 F. 3d 1154, 1161 (CA9 2004).  A careful examination of the record, the court concluded, indicates that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to noninfringing use.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  The appeals court pointed to the band Wilco, which made one of its albums available for free downloading, to other recording artists who may have authorized free distribution of their music through the Internet, and to public domain literary works and films available through Groksters and StreamCasts software.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  Although it acknowledged MGMs assertion that the vast majority of the software use is for copyright infringement, the court concluded that Groksters and StreamCasts proffered evidence met 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				s requirement that a product need only be 
				<em>
					capable
				</em>
				 of substantial noninfringing uses.  380 F. 3d, at 1162.

						 Justice Breyer finds support for summary judgment in this motley collection of declarations and in a survey conducted by an expert retained by MGM.  Post, at 48.  That survey identified 75% of the files available through Grokster as copyrighted works owned or controlled by the plaintiffs, and 15% of the files as works likely copyrighted.  App. 439.  As to the remaining 10% of the files, there was not enough information to form reasonable conclusions either as to what those files even consisted of, and/or whether they were infringing or non-infringing.  App. 479.  Even assuming, as Justice Breyer does, that the Sony Court would have absolved Sony of contributory liability solely on the basis of the use of the Betamax for authorized time-shifting, post, at 34, summary judgment is not inevitably appropriate here.  Sony stressed that the plaintiffs there owned well below 10% of copyrighted television programming, 464 U. S., at 443, and found, based on trial testimony from representatives of the four major sports leagues and other individuals authorized to consent to home-recording of their copyrighted broadcasts, that a similar percentage of program copying was authorized, id., at 424.  Here, the plaintiffs allegedly control copyrights for 70% or 75% of the material exchanged through the Grokster and StreamCast software, 380 F. 3d, at 1158; App. 439, and the District Court does not appear to have relied on comparable testimony about authorized copying from copyright holders.

.  There is here at least a genuine issue as to [a] material fact, Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(c), on the liability of Grokster or StreamCast, not only for actively inducing copyright infringement, but also or alternatively, based on the distribution of their software products, for contributory copyright infringement.  On neither score was summary judgment for Grokster and StreamCast warranted.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				At bottom, however labeled, the question in this case is whether Grokster and StreamCast are liable for the direct infringing acts of others.  Liability under our jurisprudence may be predicated on actively encouraging (or inducing) infringement through specific acts (as the Courts opinion develops) or on distributing a product distributees use to infringe copyrights, if the product is not capable of substantial or commercially significant noninfringing uses.

					Sony,

				464 U. S., at 442; see also 3 M. Nimmer &amp; D. Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright §12.04[A][2] (2005).  While the two categories overlap, they capture different culpable behavior.  Long coexisting, both are now codified in patent law.  Compare 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/35/271.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">35 U. S. C. §271(b)</a> (active inducement liability), with §271(c) (contributory liability for distribution of a product not suitable for substantial noninfringing use).

				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/464/417" class="subref" title="subref">464 U. S. 417</a>, the Court considered Sonys liability for selling the Betamax video cassette recorder.  It did so enlightened by a full trial record.  Drawing an analogy to the staple article of commerce doctrine from patent law, the 
				<em>
					Sony 
				</em>
				Court observed that the sale of an article … adapted to [a patent] infringing use does not suffice to make the seller a contributory infringer if the article is also adapted to other and lawful uses.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The staple article of commerce doctrine applied to copyright, the Court stated, must strike a balance between a copyright holders legitimate demand for effectivenot merely symbolicprotection of the statutory monopoly, and the rights of others freely to engage in substantially unrelated areas of commerce.  
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				, 464 U. S., at 442. 
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				Accordingly, the Court held, the sale of copying equipment, like the sale of other articles of commerce, does not constitute contributory infringement if the product is widely used for legitimate, unobjectionable purposes.  Indeed, it need merely be capable of substantial noninfringing uses.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  Thus, to resolve the 
				<em>
					Sony 
				</em>
				case, the Court explained, it had to determine whether the Betamax is capable of commercially significant noninfringing uses.  Ibid.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				To answer that question, the Court considered whether a significant number of [potential uses of the Betamax were] noninfringing.  Ibid.
				  The Court homed in on one potential useprivate, noncommercial time-shifting of television programs in the home (
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, recording a broadcast TV program for later personal viewing).  Time-shifting was noninfringing, the Court concluded, because in some cases trial testimony showed it was authorized by the copyright holder, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 443447, and in others it qualified as legitimate fair use, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 447455.  Most purchasers used the Betamax principally to engage in time-shifting, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 421, 423, a use that plainly satisfie[d] the Courts standard, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 442.  Thus, there was no need in 
				<em>
					Sony 
				</em>
				to give precise content to the question of how much [actual or potential] use is commercially significant.  
				<em>
					Ibid.&lt;footcall num="1"&gt;
				</em>
				  Further development was left for later days and cases.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Ninth Circuit went astray, I will endeavor to explain, when that court granted summary judgment to Grokster and StreamCast on the charge of contributory liability based on distribution of their software products.  Relying on its earlier opinion in 
				<em>
					A&amp;M Records, Inc.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Napster, Inc.
				</em>
				, 239 F. 3d 1004 (CA9 2001), the Court of Appeals held that if substantial noninfringing use was shown, the copyright owner would be required to show that the defendant had reasonable knowledge of specific infringing files.  380 F. 3d 1154, 1161 (CA9 2004).  A careful examination of the record, the court concluded, indicates that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to noninfringing use.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  The appeals court pointed to the band Wilco, which made one of its albums available for free downloading, to other recording artists who may have authorized free distribution of their music through the Internet, and to public domain literary works and films available through Groksters and StreamCasts software.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  Although it acknowledged MGMs assertion that the vast majority of the software use is for copyright infringement, the court concluded that Groksters and StreamCasts proffered evidence met 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				s requirement that a product need only be 
				<em>
					capable
				</em>
				 of substantial noninfringing uses.  380 F. 3d, at 1162.

				This case differs markedly from 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				.  Cf. Peters, Brace Memorial Lecture: Copyright Enters the Public Domain, 51 J. Copyright Soc. 701, 724 (2004) (The 
				<em>
					Grokster 
				</em>
				panels reading of 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 is the broadest that any court has given it … .).  Here, there has been no finding of any fair use and little beyond anecdotal evidence of noninfringing uses.  In finding the Grokster and StreamCast software products capable of substantial noninfringing uses, the District Court and the Court of Appeals appear to have relied largely on declarations submitted by the defendants.  These declarations include assertions (some of them hearsay) that a number of copyright owners authorize distribution of their works on the Internet and that some public domain material is available through peer-to-peer networks including those accessed through Groksters and StreamCasts software.  380 F. 3d, at 1161; 259 F. Supp. 2d 1029, 10351036 (CD Cal. 2003); App. 125171.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The District Court declared it undisputed that there are substantial noninfringing uses for Defendants software, thus obviating the need for further proceedings.  259 F. Supp. 2d, at 1035.  This conclusion appears to rest almost entirely on the collection of declarations submitted by Grokster and StreamCast.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				   Review of these declarations reveals mostly anecdotal evidence, sometimes obtained second-hand, of authorized copyrighted works or public domain works available online and shared through peer-to-peer networks, and general statements about the benefits of peer-to-peer technology.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 Decl. of Janis Ian ¶13, App. 128 (P2P technologies offer musicians an alternative channel for promotion and distribution.); Decl. of Gregory Newby ¶12,
				<em>
					 id.,
				</em>
				 at 136 (Numerous authorized and public domain Project Gutenberg eBooks are made available on Morpheus, Kazaa, Gnutella, Grokster, and similar software products.); Decl. of Aram Sinnreich ¶6, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 151 (file sharing seems to have a net positive impact on music sales); Decl. of John Busher ¶8, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 166 (I estimate that Acoustica generates sales of between $1,000 and $10,000 per month as a result of the distribution of its trialware software through the Gnutella and FastTrack Networks.); Decl. of Patricia D. Hoekman ¶¶34, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 169170 (search on Morpheus for President Bush speeches found several video recordings, searches for Declaration of Independence and Bible found various documents and declarant was able to download a copy of the Declaration); Decl. of Sean L. Mayers ¶11, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 67 (Existing open, decentralized peer-to-peer file-sharing networks … offer content owners distinct business advantages over alternate online distribution technologies.).  Compare Decl. of Brewster Kahle ¶20, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 142 (Those who download the Prelinger films … are entitled to redistribute those files, and the Archive welcomes their redistribution by the Morpheus-Grokster-KaZaa community of users.), with Deposition of Brewster Kahle, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 396403 (Sept. 18, 2002) (testifying that he has no knowledge of any person downloading a Prelinger film using Morpheus, Grokster, or KaZaA).  Compare also Decl. of Richard Prelinger ¶17, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 147 ([W]e welcome further redistribution of the Prelinger films … by individuals using peer-to-peer software products like Morpheus, KaZaA and Grokster.), with Deposition of Richard Prelinger, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 410411 (Oct. 1, 2002) (Q. What is your understanding of Grokster?  A. I have no understanding of Grokster… . Q. Do you know whether any user of the Grokster software has made available to share any Prelinger film?  A. No.).  See also Deposition of Aram Sinnreich, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 390 (Sept. 25, 2002) (testimony about the band Wilco based on [t]he press and industry news groups and scuttlebutt.).  These declarations do not support summary judgment in the face of evidence, proffered by MGM, of overwhelming use of Groksters and StreamCasts software for infringement.

Even if the absolute number of noninfringing files copied using the Grokster and StreamCast software is large, it does not follow that the products are therefore put to substantial noninfringing uses and are thus immune from liability.  The number of noninfringing copies may be reflective of, and dwarfed by, the huge total volume of files shared.  Further, the District Court and the Court of Appeals did not sharply distinguish between uses of Groksters and StreamCasts software products (which this case is about) and uses of peer-to-peer technology generally (which this case is not about).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In sum, when the record in this case was developed, there was evidence that Groksters and StreamCasts products were, and had been for some time, overwhelmingly used to infringe, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 46; App. 434439, 476481, and that this infringement was the overwhelming source of revenue from the products, 
				<em>
					ante, 
				</em>
				at 89; 259 F. Supp. 2d, at 10431044.  Fairly appraised, the evidence was insufficient to demonstrate, beyond genuine debate, a reasonable prospect that substantial or commercially significant noninfringing uses were likely to develop over time.  On this record, the District Court should not have ruled dispositively on the contributory infringement charge by granting summary judgment to Grokster and StreamCast.

				The staple article of commerce doctrine applied to copyright, the Court stated, must strike a balance between a copyright holders legitimate demand for effectivenot merely symbolicprotection of the statutory monopoly, and the rights of others freely to engage in substantially unrelated areas of commerce.  
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				, 464 U. S., at 442. 
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				Accordingly, the Court held, the sale of copying equipment, like the sale of other articles of commerce, does not constitute contributory infringement if the product is widely used for legitimate, unobjectionable purposes.  Indeed, it need merely be capable of substantial noninfringing uses.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  Thus, to resolve the 
				<em>
					Sony 
				</em>
				case, the Court explained, it had to determine whether the Betamax is capable of commercially significant noninfringing uses.  Ibid.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				To answer that question, the Court considered whether a significant number of [potential uses of the Betamax were] noninfringing.  Ibid.
				  The Court homed in on one potential useprivate, noncommercial time-shifting of television programs in the home (
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, recording a broadcast TV program for later personal viewing).  Time-shifting was noninfringing, the Court concluded, because in some cases trial testimony showed it was authorized by the copyright holder, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 443447, and in others it qualified as legitimate fair use, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 447455.  Most purchasers used the Betamax principally to engage in time-shifting, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 421, 423, a use that plainly satisfie[d] the Courts standard, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 442.  Thus, there was no need in 
				<em>
					Sony 
				</em>
				to give precise content to the question of how much [actual or potential] use is commercially significant.  
				<em>

				</em>
				  Further development was left for later days and cases.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Ninth Circuit went astray, I will endeavor to explain, when that court granted summary judgment to Grokster and StreamCast on the charge of contributory liability based on distribution of their software products.  Relying on its earlier opinion in 
				<em>
					A&amp;M Records, Inc.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Napster, Inc.
				</em>
				, 239 F. 3d 1004 (CA9 2001), the Court of Appeals held that if substantial noninfringing use was shown, the copyright owner would be required to show that the defendant had reasonable knowledge of specific infringing files.  380 F. 3d 1154, 1161 (CA9 2004).  A careful examination of the record, the court concluded, indicates that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to noninfringing use.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  The appeals court pointed to the band Wilco, which made one of its albums available for free downloading, to other recording artists who may have authorized free distribution of their music through the Internet, and to public domain literary works and films available through Groksters and StreamCasts software.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  Although it acknowledged MGMs assertion that the vast majority of the software use is for copyright infringement, the court concluded that Groksters and StreamCasts proffered evidence met 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				s requirement that a product need only be 
				<em>
					capable
				</em>
				 of substantial noninfringing uses.  380 F. 3d, at 1162.

				This case differs markedly from 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				.  Cf. Peters, Brace Memorial Lecture: Copyright Enters the Public Domain, 51 J. Copyright Soc. 701, 724 (2004) (The 
				<em>
					Grokster 
				</em>
				panels reading of 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 is the broadest that any court has given it … .).  Here, there has been no finding of any fair use and little beyond anecdotal evidence of noninfringing uses.  In finding the Grokster and StreamCast software products capable of substantial noninfringing uses, the District Court and the Court of Appeals appear to have relied largely on declarations submitted by the defendants.  These declarations include assertions (some of them hearsay) that a number of copyright owners authorize distribution of their works on the Internet and that some public domain material is available through peer-to-peer networks including those accessed through Groksters and StreamCasts software.  380 F. 3d, at 1161; 259 F. Supp. 2d 1029, 10351036 (CD Cal. 2003); App. 125171.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The District Court declared it undisputed that there are substantial noninfringing uses for Defendants software, thus obviating the need for further proceedings.  259 F. Supp. 2d, at 1035.  This conclusion appears to rest almost entirely on the collection of declarations submitted by Grokster and StreamCast.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				   Review of these declarations reveals mostly anecdotal evidence, sometimes obtained second-hand, of authorized copyrighted works or public domain works available online and shared through peer-to-peer networks, and general statements about the benefits of peer-to-peer technology.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,

				<em>

				</em>
				 at 151 (file sharing seems to have a net positive impact on music sales); Decl. of John Busher ¶8,

				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 169170 (search on Morpheus for President Bush speeches found several video recordings, searches for Declaration of Independence and Bible found various documents and declarant was able to download a copy of the Declaration); Decl. of Sean L. Mayers ¶11, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 67 (Existing open, decentralized peer-to-peer file-sharing networks … offer content owners distinct business advantages over alternate online distribution technologies.).  Compare Decl. of Brewster Kahle ¶20, 
				<em>

				</em>
				 at 142 (Those who download the Prelinger films … are entitled to redistribute those files, and the Archive welcomes their redistribution by the Morpheus-Grokster-KaZaa community of users.), with Deposition of Brewster Kahle, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 396403 (Sept. 18, 2002) (testifying that he has no knowledge of any person downloading a Prelinger film using Morpheus, Grokster, or KaZaA).  Compare also Decl. of Richard Prelinger ¶17, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 147 ([W]e welcome further redistribution of the Prelinger films … by individuals using peer-to-peer software products like Morpheus, KaZaA and Grokster.), with Deposition of Richard Prelinger, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 410411 (Oct. 1, 2002) (Q. What is your understanding of Grokster?  A. I have no understanding of Grokster… . Q. Do you know whether any user of the Grokster software has made available to share any Prelinger film?  A. No.).  See also Deposition of Aram Sinnreich, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 390 (Sept. 25, 2002) (testimony about the band Wilco based on [t]he press and industry news groups and scuttlebutt.).  These declarations do not support summary judgment in the face of evidence, proffered by MGM, of overwhelming use of Groksters and StreamCasts software for infringement.

Even if the absolute number of noninfringing files copied using the Grokster and StreamCast software is large, it does not follow that the products are therefore put to substantial noninfringing uses and are thus immune from liability.  The number of noninfringing copies may be reflective of, and dwarfed by, the huge total volume of files shared.  Further, the District Court and the Court of Appeals did not sharply distinguish between uses of Groksters and StreamCasts software products (which this case is about) and uses of peer-to-peer technology generally (which this case is not about).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In sum, when the record in this case was developed, there was evidence that Groksters and StreamCasts products were, and had been for some time, overwhelmingly used to infringe, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 46; App. 434439, 476481, and that this infringement was the overwhelming source of revenue from the products, 
				<em>
					ante, 
				</em>
				at 89; 259 F. Supp. 2d, at 10431044.  Fairly appraised, the evidence was insufficient to demonstrate, beyond genuine debate, a reasonable prospect that substantial or commercially significant noninfringing uses were likely to develop over time.  On this record, the District Court should not have ruled dispositively on the contributory infringement charge by granting summary judgment to Grokster and StreamCast.

				If, on remand, the case is not resolved on summary judgment in favor of MGM based on Grokster and StreamCast actively inducing infringement, the Court of Appeals, I would emphasize, should reconsider, on a fuller record, its interpretation of

, a clear rule permitting contributory liability for copyright infringement based on distribution of a product only when the product will be used almost exclusively to infringe copyrights.  Post, at 910.  But cf. Sony, 464 U. S., at 442 (recognizing copyright holders legitimate demand for effectivenot merely symbolicprotection).  Sony, as I read it, contains no clear, near-exclusivity test.  Nor have Courts of Appeals unanimously recognized Justice Breyers clear rule.  Compare A&amp;M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc., 239 F. 3d 1004, 1021 (CA9 2001) ([E]vidence of actual knowledge of specific acts of infringement is required to hold a computer system operator liable for contributory copyright infringement.), with In re Aimster Copyright Litigation, 334 F. 3d 643, 649650 (CA7 2003) ([W]hen a supplier is offering a product or service that has noninfringing as well as infringing uses, some estimate of the respective magnitudes of these uses is necessary for a finding of contributory infringement. …  But the balancing of costs and benefits is necessary only in a case in which substantial noninfringing uses, present or prospective, are demonstrated.).  See also Matthew Bender &amp; Co., Inc. v. West Pub. Co., 158 F. 3d 693, 707 (CA2 1998) (The Supreme Court applied [the Sony] test to prevent copyright holders from leveraging the copyrights in their original work to control distribution of … products that might be used incidentally for infringement, but that had substantial noninfringing uses… .  The same rationale applies here [to products] that have substantial, predominant and noninfringing uses as tools for research and citation.).  All Members of the Court agree, moreover, that the Court of Appeals misapplied Sony, at least to the extent it read that decision to limit secondary liability to a hardly-ever category, quite beyond the circumstances to which the case applied.  Ante, at 16.

						 Grokster and StreamCast, in the Court of Appeals view, would be entitled to summary judgment unless MGM could show that that the software companies had knowledge of specific acts of infringement and failed to act on that knowledgea standard the court held MGM could not meet.  380 F. 3d, at 11621163.

						 Justice Breyer finds support for summary judgment in this motley collection of declarations and in a survey conducted by an expert retained by MGM.  Post, at 48.  That survey identified 75% of the files available through Grokster as copyrighted works owned or controlled by the plaintiffs, and 15% of the files as works likely copyrighted.  App. 439.  As to the remaining 10% of the files, there was not enough information to form reasonable conclusions either as to what those files even consisted of, and/or whether they were infringing or non-infringing.  App. 479.  Even assuming, as Justice Breyer does, that the Sony Court would have absolved Sony of contributory liability solely on the basis of the use of the Betamax for authorized time-shifting, post, at 34, summary judgment is not inevitably appropriate here.  Sony stressed that the plaintiffs there owned well below 10% of copyrighted television programming, 464 U. S., at 443, and found, based on trial testimony from representatives of the four major sports leagues and other individuals authorized to consent to home-recording of their copyrighted broadcasts, that a similar percentage of program copying was authorized, id., at 424.  Here, the plaintiffs allegedly control copyrights for 70% or 75% of the material exchanged through the Grokster and StreamCast software, 380 F. 3d, at 1158; App. 439, and the District Court does not appear to have relied on comparable testimony about authorized copying from copyright holders.

These declarations include assertions (some of them hearsay) that a number of copyright owners authorize distribution of their works on the Internet and that some public domain material is available through peer-to-peer networks including those accessed through Groksters and StreamCasts software.  380 F. 3d, at 1161; 259 F.

				The District Court declared it undisputed that there are substantial noninfringing uses for Defendants software, thus obviating the need for further proceedings.  259 F. Supp. 2d, at 1035.  This conclusion appears to rest almost entirely on the collection of declarations submitted by Grokster and StreamCast.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				   Review of these declarations reveals mostly anecdotal evidence, sometimes obtained second-hand, of authorized copyrighted works or public domain works available online and shared through peer-to-peer networks, and general statements about the benefits of peer-to-peer technology.  See, 
				<em>

				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 169170 (search on Morpheus for President Bush speeches found several video recordings, searches for Declaration of Independence and Bible found various documents and declarant was able to download a copy of the Declaration); Decl. of Sean L. Mayers ¶11, 
				<em>

				</em>
				 at 67 (Existing open, decentralized peer-to-peer file-sharing networks … offer content owners distinct business advantages over alternate online distribution technologies.).  Compare Decl. of Brewster Kahle ¶20, 
				<em>

				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 396403 (Sept. 18, 2002) (testifying that he has no knowledge of any person downloading a Prelinger film using Morpheus, Grokster, or KaZaA).  Compare also Decl. of Richard Prelinger ¶17, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 147 ([W]e welcome further redistribution of the Prelinger films … by individuals using peer-to-peer software products like Morpheus, KaZaA and Grokster.), with Deposition of Richard Prelinger, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 410411 (Oct. 1, 2002) (Q. What is your understanding of Grokster?  A. I have no understanding of Grokster… . Q. Do you know whether any user of the Grokster software has made available to share any Prelinger film?  A. No.).  See also Deposition of Aram Sinnreich, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 390 (Sept. 25, 2002) (testimony about the band Wilco based on [t]he press and industry news groups and scuttlebutt.).  These declarations do not support summary judgment in the face of evidence, proffered by MGM, of overwhelming use of Groksters and StreamCasts software for infringement.

Even if the absolute number of noninfringing files copied using the Grokster and StreamCast software is large, it does not follow that the products are therefore put to substantial noninfringing uses and are thus immune from liability.  The number of noninfringing copies may be reflective of, and dwarfed by, the huge total volume of files shared.  Further, the District Court and the Court of Appeals did not sharply distinguish between uses of Groksters and StreamCasts software products (which this case is about) and uses of peer-to-peer technology generally (which this case is not about).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In sum, when the record in this case was developed, there was evidence that Groksters and StreamCasts products were, and had been for some time, overwhelmingly used to infringe, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 46; App. 434439, 476481, and that this infringement was the overwhelming source of revenue from the products, 
				<em>
					ante, 
				</em>
				at 89; 259 F. Supp. 2d, at 10431044.  Fairly appraised, the evidence was insufficient to demonstrate, beyond genuine debate, a reasonable prospect that substantial or commercially significant noninfringing uses were likely to develop over time.  On this record, the District Court should not have ruled dispositively on the contributory infringement charge by granting summary judgment to Grokster and StreamCast.

						 Justice Breyer finds in Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/464/417" class="subref" title="subref">464 U. S. 417</a> (1984)
, a clear rule permitting contributory liability for copyright infringement based on distribution of a product only when the product will be used almost exclusively to infringe copyrights.  Post, at 910.  But cf. Sony, 464 U. S., at 442 (recognizing copyright holders legitimate demand for effectivenot merely symbolicprotection).  Sony, as I read it, contains no clear, near-exclusivity test.  Nor have Courts of Appeals unanimously recognized Justice Breyers clear rule.  Compare A&amp;M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc., 239 F. 3d 1004, 1021 (CA9 2001) ([E]vidence of actual knowledge of specific acts of infringement is required to hold a computer system operator liable for contributory copyright infringement.), with In re Aimster Copyright Litigation, 334 F. 3d 643, 649650 (CA7 2003) ([W]hen a supplier is offering a product or service that has noninfringing as well as infringing uses, some estimate of the respective magnitudes of these uses is necessary for a finding of contributory infringement. …  But the balancing of costs and benefits is necessary only in a case in which substantial noninfringing uses, present or prospective, are demonstrated.).  See also Matthew Bender &amp; Co., Inc. v. West Pub. Co., 158 F. 3d 693, 707 (CA2 1998) (The Supreme Court applied [the Sony] test to prevent copyright holders from leveraging the copyrights in their original work to control distribution of … products that might be used incidentally for infringement, but that had substantial noninfringing uses… .  The same rationale applies here [to products] that have substantial, predominant and noninfringing uses as tools for research and citation.).  All Members of the Court agree, moreover, that the Court of Appeals misapplied Sony, at least to the extent it read that decision to limit secondary liability to a hardly-ever category, quite beyond the circumstances to which the case applied.  Ante, at 16.

						 Grokster and StreamCast, in the Court of Appeals view, would be entitled to summary judgment unless MGM could show that that the software companies had knowledge of specific acts of infringement and failed to act on that knowledgea standard the court held MGM could not meet.  380 F. 3d, at 11621163.

						 Justice Breyer finds support for summary judgment in this motley collection of declarations and in a survey conducted by an expert retained by MGM.  Post, at 48.  That survey identified 75% of the files available through Grokster as copyrighted works owned or controlled by the plaintiffs, and 15% of the files as works likely copyrighted.  App. 439.  As to the remaining 10% of the files, there was not enough information to form reasonable conclusions either as to what those files even consisted of, and/or whether they were infringing or non-infringing.  App. 479.  Even assuming, as Justice Breyer does, that the Sony Court would have absolved Sony of contributory liability solely on the basis of the use of the Betamax for authorized time-shifting, post, at 34, summary judgment is not inevitably appropriate here.  Sony stressed that the plaintiffs there owned well below 10% of copyrighted television programming, 464 U. S., at 443, and found, based on trial testimony from representatives of the four major sports leagues and other individuals authorized to consent to home-recording of their copyrighted broadcasts, that a similar percentage of program copying was authorized, id., at 424.  Here, the plaintiffs allegedly control copyrights for 70% or 75% of the material exchanged through the Grokster and StreamCast software, 380 F. 3d, at 1158; App. 439, and the District Court does not appear to have relied on comparable testimony about authorized copying from copyright holders.

.  There is here at least a genuine issue as to [a] material fact, Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(c), on the liability of Grokster or StreamCast, not only for actively inducing copyright infringement, but also or alternatively, based on the distribution of their software products, for contributory copyright infringement.  On neither score was summary judgment for Grokster and StreamCast warranted.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				At bottom, however labeled, the question in this case is whether Grokster and StreamCast are liable for the direct infringing acts of others.  Liability under our jurisprudence may be predicated on actively encouraging (or inducing) infringement through specific acts (as the Courts opinion develops) or on distributing a product distributees use to infringe copyrights, if the product is not capable of substantial or commercially significant noninfringing uses.

						 Justice Breyer finds in Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/464/417" class="subref" title="subref">464 U. S. 417</a> (1984)
, a clear rule permitting contributory liability for copyright infringement based on distribution of a product only when the product will be used almost exclusively to infringe copyrights.  Post, at 910.  But cf. Sony, 464 U. S., at 442 (recognizing copyright holders legitimate demand for effectivenot merely symbolicprotection).  Sony, as I read it, contains no clear, near-exclusivity test.  Nor have Courts of Appeals unanimously recognized Justice Breyers clear rule.  Compare A&amp;M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc., 239 F. 3d 1004, 1021 (CA9 2001) ([E]vidence of actual knowledge of specific acts of infringement is required to hold a computer system operator liable for contributory copyright infringement.), with In re Aimster Copyright Litigation, 334 F. 3d 643, 649650 (CA7 2003) ([W]hen a supplier is offering a product or service that has noninfringing as well as infringing uses, some estimate of the respective magnitudes of these uses is necessary for a finding of contributory infringement. …  But the balancing of costs and benefits is necessary only in a case in which substantial noninfringing uses, present or prospective, are demonstrated.).  See also Matthew Bender &amp; Co., Inc. v. West Pub. Co., 158 F. 3d 693, 707 (CA2 1998) (The Supreme Court applied [the Sony] test to prevent copyright holders from leveraging the copyrights in their original work to control distribution of … products that might be used incidentally for infringement, but that had substantial noninfringing uses… .  The same rationale applies here [to products] that have substantial, predominant and noninfringing uses as tools for research and citation.).  All Members of the Court agree, moreover, that the Court of Appeals misapplied Sony, at least to the extent it read that decision to limit secondary liability to a hardly-ever category, quite beyond the circumstances to which the case applied.  Ante, at 16.

						 Grokster and StreamCast, in the Court of Appeals view, would be entitled to summary judgment unless MGM could show that that the software companies had knowledge of specific acts of infringement and failed to act on that knowledgea standard the court held MGM could not meet.  380 F. 3d, at 11621163.

						 Justice Breyer finds support for summary judgment in this motley collection of declarations and in a survey conducted by an expert retained by MGM.  Post, at 48.  That survey identified 75% of the files available through Grokster as copyrighted works owned or controlled by the plaintiffs, and 15% of the files as works likely copyrighted.  App. 439.  As to the remaining 10% of the files, there was not enough information to form reasonable conclusions either as to what those files even consisted of, and/or whether they were infringing or non-infringing.  App. 479.  Even assuming, as Justice Breyer does, that the Sony Court would have absolved Sony of contributory liability solely on the basis of the use of the Betamax for authorized time-shifting, post, at 34, summary judgment is not inevitably appropriate here.  Sony stressed that the plaintiffs there owned well below 10% of copyrighted television programming, 464 U. S., at 443, and found, based on trial testimony from representatives of the four major sports leagues and other individuals authorized to consent to home-recording of their copyrighted broadcasts, that a similar percentage of program copying was authorized, id., at 424.  Here, the plaintiffs allegedly control copyrights for 70% or 75% of the material exchanged through the Grokster and StreamCast software, 380 F. 3d, at 1158; App. 439, and the District Court does not appear to have relied on comparable testimony about authorized copying from copyright holders.

Supp. 2d 1029, 1036 (CD Cal. 2003); accord 380 F. 3d, at 1161, is, to say the least, dubious.  In the courts below and in this Court, MGM has continuously disputed any such conclusion.

				I concur in the Courts decision, which vacates in full the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,

				 v. 
				<em>

            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/464/417" class="subref" title="subref">464 U. S. 417</a> (1984)
.  There is here at least a genuine issue as to [a] material fact, Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(c), on the liability of Grokster or StreamCast, not only for actively inducing copyright infringement, but also or alternatively, based on the distribution of their software products, for contributory copyright infringement.  On neither score was summary judgment for Grokster and StreamCast warranted.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				At bottom, however labeled, the question in this case is whether Grokster and StreamCast are liable for the direct infringing acts of others.  Liability under our jurisprudence may be predicated on actively encouraging (or inducing) infringement through specific acts (as the Courts opinion develops) or on distributing a product distributees use to infringe copyrights, if the product is not capable of substantial or commercially significant noninfringing uses.

					Sony,

				464 U. S., at 442; see also 3 M. Nimmer &amp; D. Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright §12.04[A][2] (2005).  While the two categories overlap, they capture different culpable behavior.  Long coexisting, both are now codified in patent law.  Compare 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/35/271.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">35 U. S. C. §271(b)</a> (active inducement liability), with §271(c) (contributory liability for distribution of a product not suitable for substantial noninfringing use).

				In

				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/464/417" class="subref" title="subref">464 U. S. 417</a>, the Court considered Sonys liability for selling the Betamax video cassette recorder.  It did so enlightened by a full trial record.  Drawing an analogy to the staple article of commerce doctrine from patent law, the 
				<em>
					Sony 
				</em>
				Court observed that the sale of an article … adapted to [a patent] infringing use does not suffice to make the seller a contributory infringer if the article is also adapted to other and lawful uses.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The staple article of commerce doctrine applied to copyright, the Court stated, must strike a balance between a copyright holders legitimate demand for effectivenot merely symbolicprotection of the statutory monopoly, and the rights of others freely to engage in substantially unrelated areas of commerce.  
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				, 464 U. S., at 442. 
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				Accordingly, the Court held, the sale of copying equipment, like the sale of other articles of commerce, does not constitute contributory infringement if the product is widely used for legitimate, unobjectionable purposes.  Indeed, it need merely be capable of substantial noninfringing uses.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  Thus, to resolve the 
				<em>
					Sony 
				</em>
				case, the Court explained, it had to determine whether the Betamax is capable of commercially significant noninfringing uses.  Ibid.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				To answer that question, the Court considered whether a significant number of [potential uses of the Betamax were] noninfringing.  Ibid.
				  The Court homed in on one potential useprivate, noncommercial time-shifting of television programs in the home (
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, recording a broadcast TV program for later personal viewing).  Time-shifting was noninfringing, the Court concluded, because in some cases trial testimony showed it was authorized by the copyright holder, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 443447, and in others it qualified as legitimate fair use, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 447455.  Most purchasers used the Betamax principally to engage in time-shifting, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 421, 423, a use that plainly satisfie[d] the Courts standard, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 442.  Thus, there was no need in 
				<em>
					Sony 
				</em>
				to give precise content to the question of how much [actual or potential] use is commercially significant.  
				<em>
					Ibid.&lt;footcall num="1"&gt;
				</em>
				  Further development was left for later days and cases.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Ninth Circuit went astray, I will endeavor to explain, when that court granted summary judgment to Grokster and StreamCast on the charge of contributory liability based on distribution of their software products.  Relying on its earlier opinion in 
				<em>
					A&amp;M Records, Inc.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Napster, Inc.
				</em>
				, 239 F. 3d 1004 (CA9 2001), the Court of Appeals held that if substantial noninfringing use was shown, the copyright owner would be required to show that the defendant had reasonable knowledge of specific infringing files.  380 F. 3d 1154, 1161 (CA9 2004).  A careful examination of the record, the court concluded, indicates that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to noninfringing use.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  The appeals court pointed to the band Wilco, which made one of its albums available for free downloading, to other recording artists who may have authorized free distribution of their music through the Internet, and to public domain literary works and films available through Groksters and StreamCasts software.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  Although it acknowledged MGMs assertion that the vast majority of the software use is for copyright infringement, the court concluded that Groksters and StreamCasts proffered evidence met 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				s requirement that a product need only be 
				<em>
					capable
				</em>
				 of substantial noninfringing uses.  380 F. 3d, at 1162.

				This case differs markedly from 
				<em>
					Sony

				.  Cf. Peters, Brace Memorial Lecture: Copyright Enters the Public Domain, 51 J. Copyright Soc. 701, 724 (2004) (The 
				<em>

				panels reading of 
				<em>

				</em>
				 is the broadest that any court has given it … .).  Here, there has been no finding of any fair use and little beyond anecdotal evidence of noninfringing uses.  In finding the Grokster and StreamCast software products capable of substantial noninfringing uses, the District Court and the Court of Appeals appear to have relied largely on declarations submitted by the defendants.  These declarations include assertions (some of them hearsay) that a number of copyright owners authorize distribution of their works on the Internet and that some public domain material is available through peer-to-peer networks including those accessed through Groksters and StreamCasts software.  380 F. 3d, at 1161; 259 F.

				The District Court declared it undisputed that there are substantial noninfringing uses for Defendants software, thus obviating the need for further proceedings.  259 F. Supp. 2d, at 1035.  This conclusion appears to rest almost entirely on the collection of declarations submitted by Grokster and StreamCast.

, a clear rule permitting contributory liability for copyright infringement based on distribution of a product only when the product will be used almost exclusively to infringe copyrights.  Post, at 910.  But cf. Sony, 464 U. S., at 442 (recognizing copyright holders legitimate demand for effectivenot merely symbolicprotection).  Sony, as I read it, contains no clear, near-exclusivity test.  Nor have Courts of Appeals unanimously recognized Justice Breyers clear rule.  Compare A&amp;M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc., 239 F. 3d 1004, 1021 (CA9 2001) ([E]vidence of actual knowledge of specific acts of infringement is required to hold a computer system operator liable for contributory copyright infringement.), with In re Aimster Copyright Litigation, 334 F. 3d 643, 649650 (CA7 2003) ([W]hen a supplier is offering a product or service that has noninfringing as well as infringing uses, some estimate of the respective magnitudes of these uses is necessary for a finding of contributory infringement. …  But the balancing of costs and benefits is necessary only in a case in which substantial noninfringing uses, present or prospective, are demonstrated.).  See also Matthew Bender &amp; Co., Inc. v. West Pub. Co., 158 F. 3d 693, 707 (CA2 1998) (The Supreme Court applied [the Sony] test to prevent copyright holders from leveraging the copyrights in their original work to control distribution of … products that might be used incidentally for infringement, but that had substantial noninfringing uses… .  The same rationale applies here [to products] that have substantial, predominant and noninfringing uses as tools for research and citation.).  All Members of the Court agree, moreover, that the Court of Appeals misapplied Sony, at least to the extent it read that decision to limit secondary liability to a hardly-ever category, quite beyond the circumstances to which the case applied.  Ante, at 16.

						 Justice Breyer finds support for summary judgment in this motley collection of declarations and in a survey conducted by an expert retained by MGM.  Post, at 48.  That survey identified 75% of the files available through Grokster as copyrighted works owned or controlled by the plaintiffs, and 15% of the files as works likely copyrighted.  App. 439.  As to the remaining 10% of the files, there was not enough information to form reasonable conclusions either as to what those files even consisted of, and/or whether they were infringing or non-infringing.  App. 479.  Even assuming, as Justice Breyer does, that the Sony Court would have absolved Sony of contributory liability solely on the basis of the use of the Betamax for authorized time-shifting, post, at 34, summary judgment is not inevitably appropriate here.  Sony stressed that the plaintiffs there owned well below 10% of copyrighted television programming, 464 U. S., at 443, and found, based on trial testimony from representatives of the four major sports leagues and other individuals authorized to consent to home-recording of their copyrighted broadcasts, that a similar percentage of program copying was authorized, id., at 424.  Here, the plaintiffs allegedly control copyrights for 70% or 75% of the material exchanged through the Grokster and StreamCast software, 380 F. 3d, at 1158; App. 439, and the District Court does not appear to have relied on comparable testimony about authorized copying from copyright holders.

				I concur in the Courts decision, which vacates in full the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,

				<em>

				 v. 
				<em>
					Universal City Studios, Inc.,

            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/464/417" class="subref" title="subref">464 U. S. 417</a> (1984)
.  There is here at least a genuine issue as to [a] material fact, Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(c), on the liability of Grokster or StreamCast, not only for actively inducing copyright infringement, but also or alternatively, based on the distribution of their software products, for contributory copyright infringement.  On neither score was summary judgment for Grokster and StreamCast warranted.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				At bottom, however labeled, the question in this case is whether Grokster and StreamCast are liable for the direct infringing acts of others.  Liability under our jurisprudence may be predicated on actively encouraging (or inducing) infringement through specific acts (as the Courts opinion develops) or on distributing a product distributees use to infringe copyrights, if the product is not capable of substantial or commercially significant noninfringing uses.  
				<em>
					Sony,

				464 U. S., at 442; see also 3 M. Nimmer &amp; D. Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright §12.04[A][2] (2005).  While the two categories overlap, they capture different culpable behavior.  Long coexisting, both are now codified in patent law.  Compare 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/35/271.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">35 U. S. C. §271(b)</a> (active inducement liability), with §271(c) (contributory liability for distribution of a product not suitable for substantial noninfringing use).

				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/464/417" class="subref" title="subref">464 U. S. 417</a>, the Court considered Sonys liability for selling the Betamax video cassette recorder.  It did so enlightened by a full trial record.  Drawing an analogy to the staple article of commerce doctrine from patent law, the 
				<em>
					Sony 
				</em>
				Court observed that the sale of an article … adapted to [a patent] infringing use does not suffice to make the seller a contributory infringer if the article is also adapted to other and lawful uses.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The staple article of commerce doctrine applied to copyright, the Court stated, must strike a balance between a copyright holders legitimate demand for effectivenot merely symbolicprotection of the statutory monopoly, and the rights of others freely to engage in substantially unrelated areas of commerce.  
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				, 464 U. S., at 442. 
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				Accordingly, the Court held, the sale of copying equipment, like the sale of other articles of commerce, does not constitute contributory infringement if the product is widely used for legitimate, unobjectionable purposes.  Indeed, it need merely be capable of substantial noninfringing uses.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  Thus, to resolve the 
				<em>
					Sony 
				</em>
				case, the Court explained, it had to determine whether the Betamax is capable of commercially significant noninfringing uses.  Ibid.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				To answer that question, the Court considered whether a significant number of [potential uses of the Betamax were] noninfringing.  Ibid.
				  The Court homed in on one potential useprivate, noncommercial time-shifting of television programs in the home (
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, recording a broadcast TV program for later personal viewing).  Time-shifting was noninfringing, the Court concluded, because in some cases trial testimony showed it was authorized by the copyright holder, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 443447, and in others it qualified as legitimate fair use, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 447455.  Most purchasers used the Betamax principally to engage in time-shifting, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 421, 423, a use that plainly satisfie[d] the Courts standard, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 442.  Thus, there was no need in 
				<em>
					Sony 
				</em>
				to give precise content to the question of how much [actual or potential] use is commercially significant.  
				<em>
					Ibid.&lt;footcall num="1"&gt;
				</em>
				  Further development was left for later days and cases.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Ninth Circuit went astray, I will endeavor to explain, when that court granted summary judgment to Grokster and StreamCast on the charge of contributory liability based on distribution of their software products.  Relying on its earlier opinion in 
				<em>
					A&amp;M Records, Inc.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Napster, Inc.
				</em>
				, 239 F. 3d 1004 (CA9 2001), the Court of Appeals held that if substantial noninfringing use was shown, the copyright owner would be required to show that the defendant had reasonable knowledge of specific infringing files.  380 F. 3d 1154, 1161 (CA9 2004).  A careful examination of the record, the court concluded, indicates that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to noninfringing use.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  The appeals court pointed to the band Wilco, which made one of its albums available for free downloading, to other recording artists who may have authorized free distribution of their music through the Internet, and to public domain literary works and films available through Groksters and StreamCasts software.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  Although it acknowledged MGMs assertion that the vast majority of the software use is for copyright infringement, the court concluded that Groksters and StreamCasts proffered evidence met 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				s requirement that a product need only be 
				<em>
					capable
				</em>
				 of substantial noninfringing uses.  380 F. 3d, at 1162.

				This case differs markedly from 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				.  Cf. Peters, Brace Memorial Lecture: Copyright Enters the Public Domain, 51 J. Copyright Soc. 701, 724 (2004) (The 
				<em>
					Grokster 
				</em>
				panels reading of 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 is the broadest that any court has given it … .).  Here, there has been no finding of any fair use and little beyond anecdotal evidence of noninfringing uses.  In finding the Grokster and StreamCast software products capable of substantial noninfringing uses, the District Court and the Court of Appeals appear to have relied largely on declarations submitted by the defendants.  These declarations include assertions (some of them hearsay) that a number of copyright owners authorize distribution of their works on the Internet and that some public domain material is available through peer-to-peer networks including those accessed through Groksters and StreamCasts software.  380 F. 3d, at 1161; 259 F. Supp. 2d 1029, 10351036 (CD Cal. 2003); App. 125171.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The District Court declared it undisputed that there are substantial noninfringing uses for Defendants software, thus obviating the need for further proceedings.  259 F. Supp. 2d, at 1035.  This conclusion appears to rest almost entirely on the collection of declarations submitted by Grokster and StreamCast.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				   Review of these declarations reveals mostly anecdotal evidence, sometimes obtained second-hand, of authorized copyrighted works or public domain works available online and shared through peer-to-peer networks, and general statements about the benefits of peer-to-peer technology.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 Decl. of Janis Ian ¶13, App. 128 (P2P technologies offer musicians an alternative channel for promotion and distribution.); Decl. of Gregory Newby ¶12,
				<em>
					 id.,
				</em>
				 at 136 (Numerous authorized and public domain Project Gutenberg eBooks are made available on Morpheus, Kazaa, Gnutella, Grokster, and similar software products.); Decl. of Aram Sinnreich ¶6, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 151 (file sharing seems to have a net positive impact on music sales); Decl. of John Busher ¶8, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 166 (I estimate that Acoustica generates sales of between $1,000 and $10,000 per month as a result of the distribution of its trialware software through the Gnutella and FastTrack Networks.); Decl. of Patricia D. Hoekman ¶¶34, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 169170 (search on Morpheus for President Bush speeches found several video recordings, searches for Declaration of Independence and Bible found various documents and declarant was able to download a copy of the Declaration); Decl. of Sean L. Mayers ¶11, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 67 (Existing open, decentralized peer-to-peer file-sharing networks … offer content owners distinct business advantages over alternate online distribution technologies.).  Compare Decl. of Brewster Kahle ¶20, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 142 (Those who download the Prelinger films … are entitled to redistribute those files, and the Archive welcomes their redistribution by the Morpheus-Grokster-KaZaa community of users.), with Deposition of Brewster Kahle, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 396403 (Sept. 18, 2002) (testifying that he has no knowledge of any person downloading a Prelinger film using Morpheus, Grokster, or KaZaA).  Compare also Decl. of Richard Prelinger ¶17, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 147 ([W]e welcome further redistribution of the Prelinger films … by individuals using peer-to-peer software products like Morpheus, KaZaA and Grokster.), with Deposition of Richard Prelinger, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 410411 (Oct. 1, 2002) (Q. What is your understanding of Grokster?  A. I have no understanding of Grokster… . Q. Do you know whether any user of the Grokster software has made available to share any Prelinger film?  A. No.).  See also Deposition of Aram Sinnreich, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 390 (Sept. 25, 2002) (testimony about the band Wilco based on [t]he press and industry news groups and scuttlebutt.).  These declarations do not support summary judgment in the face of evidence, proffered by MGM, of overwhelming use of Groksters and StreamCasts software for infringement.

Even if the absolute number of noninfringing files copied using the Grokster and StreamCast software is large, it does not follow that the products are therefore put to substantial noninfringing uses and are thus immune from liability.  The number of noninfringing copies may be reflective of, and dwarfed by, the huge total volume of files shared.  Further, the District Court and the Court of Appeals did not sharply distinguish between uses of Groksters and StreamCasts software products (which this case is about) and uses of peer-to-peer technology generally (which this case is not about).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In sum, when the record in this case was developed, there was evidence that Groksters and StreamCasts products were, and had been for some time, overwhelmingly used to infringe, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 46; App. 434439, 476481, and that this infringement was the overwhelming source of revenue from the products, 
				<em>
					ante, 
				</em>
				at 89; 259 F. Supp. 2d, at 10431044.  Fairly appraised, the evidence was insufficient to demonstrate, beyond genuine debate, a reasonable prospect that substantial or commercially significant noninfringing uses were likely to develop over time.  On this record, the District Court should not have ruled dispositively on the contributory infringement charge by granting summary judgment to Grokster and StreamCast.

				The staple article of commerce doctrine applied to copyright, the Court stated, must strike a balance between a copyright holders legitimate demand for effectivenot merely symbolicprotection of the statutory monopoly, and the rights of others freely to engage in substantially unrelated areas of commerce.  
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				, 464 U. S., at 442. 
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				Accordingly, the Court held, the sale of copying equipment, like the sale of other articles of commerce, does not constitute contributory infringement if the product is widely used for legitimate, unobjectionable purposes.  Indeed, it need merely be capable of substantial noninfringing uses.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  Thus, to resolve the 
				<em>
					Sony 
				</em>
				case, the Court explained, it had to determine whether the Betamax is capable of commercially significant noninfringing uses.  Ibid.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				To answer that question, the Court considered whether a significant number of [potential uses of the Betamax were] noninfringing.  Ibid.
				  The Court homed in on one potential useprivate, noncommercial time-shifting of television programs in the home (
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, recording a broadcast TV program for later personal viewing).  Time-shifting was noninfringing, the Court concluded, because in some cases trial testimony showed it was authorized by the copyright holder, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 443447, and in others it qualified as legitimate fair use, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 447455.  Most purchasers used the Betamax principally to engage in time-shifting, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 421, 423, a use that plainly satisfie[d] the Courts standard, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 442.  Thus, there was no need in 
				<em>
					Sony 
				</em>
				to give precise content to the question of how much [actual or potential] use is commercially significant.

				The Ninth Circuit went astray, I will endeavor to explain, when that court granted summary judgment to Grokster and StreamCast on the charge of contributory liability based on distribution of their software products.  Relying on its earlier opinion in 
				<em>
					A&amp;M Records, Inc.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Napster, Inc.
				</em>
				, 239 F. 3d 1004 (CA9 2001), the Court of Appeals held that if substantial noninfringing use was shown, the copyright owner would be required to show that the defendant had reasonable knowledge of specific infringing files.  380 F. 3d 1154, 1161 (CA9 2004).  A careful examination of the record, the court concluded, indicates that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to noninfringing use.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  The appeals court pointed to the band Wilco, which made one of its albums available for free downloading, to other recording artists who may have authorized free distribution of their music through the Internet, and to public domain literary works and films available through Groksters and StreamCasts software.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  Although it acknowledged MGMs assertion that the vast majority of the software use is for copyright infringement, the court concluded that Groksters and StreamCasts proffered evidence met 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				s requirement that a product need only be 
				<em>
					capable
				</em>
				 of substantial noninfringing uses.  380 F. 3d, at 1162.

				This case differs markedly from 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				.  Cf. Peters, Brace Memorial Lecture: Copyright Enters the Public Domain, 51 J. Copyright Soc. 701, 724 (2004) (The 
				<em>
					Grokster 
				</em>
				panels reading of 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 is the broadest that any court has given it … .).  Here, there has been no finding of any fair use and little beyond anecdotal evidence of noninfringing uses.  In finding the Grokster and StreamCast software products capable of substantial noninfringing uses, the District Court and the Court of Appeals appear to have relied largely on declarations submitted by the defendants.  These declarations include assertions (some of them hearsay) that a number of copyright owners authorize distribution of their works on the Internet and that some public domain material is available through peer-to-peer networks including those accessed through Groksters and StreamCasts software.  380 F. 3d, at 1161; 259 F. Supp. 2d 1029, 10351036 (CD Cal. 2003); App. 125171.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The District Court declared it undisputed that there are substantial noninfringing uses for Defendants software, thus obviating the need for further proceedings.  259 F. Supp. 2d, at 1035.  This conclusion appears to rest almost entirely on the collection of declarations submitted by Grokster and StreamCast.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				   Review of these declarations reveals mostly anecdotal evidence, sometimes obtained second-hand, of authorized copyrighted works or public domain works available online and shared through peer-to-peer networks, and general statements about the benefits of peer-to-peer technology.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>

				<em>

				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 151 (file sharing seems to have a net positive impact on music sales); Decl. of John Busher ¶8, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 166 (I estimate that Acoustica generates sales of between $1,000 and $10,000 per month as a result of the distribution of its trialware software through the Gnutella and FastTrack Networks.); Decl. of Patricia D. Hoekman ¶¶34, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 169170 (search on Morpheus for President Bush speeches found several video recordings, searches for Declaration of Independence and Bible found various documents and declarant was able to download a copy of the Declaration); Decl. of Sean L. Mayers ¶11, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 67 (Existing open, decentralized peer-to-peer file-sharing networks … offer content owners distinct business advantages over alternate online distribution technologies.).  Compare Decl. of Brewster Kahle ¶20, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 142 (Those who download the Prelinger films … are entitled to redistribute those files, and the Archive welcomes their redistribution by the Morpheus-Grokster-KaZaa community of users.), with Deposition of Brewster Kahle, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 396403 (Sept. 18, 2002) (testifying that he has no knowledge of any person downloading a Prelinger film using Morpheus, Grokster, or KaZaA).  Compare also Decl. of Richard Prelinger ¶17, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 147 ([W]e welcome further redistribution of the Prelinger films … by individuals using peer-to-peer software products like Morpheus, KaZaA and Grokster.), with Deposition of Richard Prelinger, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 410411 (Oct. 1, 2002) (Q. What is your understanding of Grokster?  A. I have no understanding of Grokster… . Q. Do you know whether any user of the Grokster software has made available to share any Prelinger film?  A. No.).  See also Deposition of Aram Sinnreich, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 390 (Sept. 25, 2002) (testimony about the band Wilco based on [t]he press and industry news groups and scuttlebutt.).  These declarations do not support summary judgment in the face of evidence, proffered by MGM, of overwhelming use of Groksters and StreamCasts software for infringement.

Even if the absolute number of noninfringing files copied using the Grokster and StreamCast software is large, it does not follow that the products are therefore put to substantial noninfringing uses and are thus immune from liability.  The number of noninfringing copies may be reflective of, and dwarfed by, the huge total volume of files shared.  Further, the District Court and the Court of Appeals did not sharply distinguish between uses of Groksters and StreamCasts software products (which this case is about) and uses of peer-to-peer technology generally (which this case is not about).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In sum, when the record in this case was developed, there was evidence that Groksters and StreamCasts products were, and had been for some time, overwhelmingly used to infringe, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 46; App. 434439, 476481, and that this infringement was the overwhelming source of revenue from the products, 
				<em>
					ante, 
				</em>
				at 89; 259 F. Supp. 2d, at 10431044.  Fairly appraised, the evidence was insufficient to demonstrate, beyond genuine debate, a reasonable prospect that substantial or commercially significant noninfringing uses were likely to develop over time.  On this record, the District Court should not have ruled dispositively on the contributory infringement charge by granting summary judgment to Grokster and StreamCast.

				If, on remand, the case is not resolved on summary judgment in favor of MGM based on Grokster and StreamCast actively inducing infringement, the Court of Appeals, I would emphasize, should reconsider, on a fuller record, its interpretation of

					Sony

				s product distribution holding.

						 Justice Breyer finds in Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/464/417" class="subref" title="subref">464 U. S. 417</a> (1984)
, a clear rule permitting contributory liability for copyright infringement based on distribution of a product only when the product will be used almost exclusively to infringe copyrights.  Post, at 910.  But cf. Sony, 464 U. S., at 442 (recognizing copyright holders legitimate demand for effectivenot merely symbolicprotection).  Sony, as I read it, contains no clear, near-exclusivity test.  Nor have Courts of Appeals unanimously recognized Justice Breyers clear rule.  Compare A&amp;M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc., 239 F. 3d 1004, 1021 (CA9 2001) ([E]vidence of actual knowledge of specific acts of infringement is required to hold a computer system operator liable for contributory copyright infringement.), with In re Aimster Copyright Litigation, 334 F. 3d 643, 649650 (CA7 2003) ([W]hen a supplier is offering a product or service that has noninfringing as well as infringing uses, some estimate of the respective magnitudes of these uses is necessary for a finding of contributory infringement. …  But the balancing of costs and benefits is necessary only in a case in which substantial noninfringing uses, present or prospective, are demonstrated.).  See also Matthew Bender &amp; Co., Inc. v. West Pub. Co., 158 F. 3d 693, 707 (CA2 1998) (The Supreme Court applied [the Sony] test to prevent copyright holders from leveraging the copyrights in their original work to control distribution of … products that might be used incidentally for infringement, but that had substantial noninfringing uses… .  The same rationale applies here [to products] that have substantial, predominant and noninfringing uses as tools for research and citation.).  All Members of the Court agree, moreover, that the Court of Appeals misapplied Sony, at least to the extent it read that decision to limit secondary liability to a hardly-ever category, quite beyond the circumstances to which the case applied.  Ante, at 16.

						 Grokster and StreamCast, in the Court of Appeals view, would be entitled to summary judgment unless MGM could show that that the software companies had knowledge of specific acts of infringement and failed to act on that knowledgea standard the court held MGM could not meet.  380 F. 3d, at 11621163.

						 Justice Breyer finds support for summary judgment in this motley collection of declarations and in a survey conducted by an expert retained by MGM.  Post, at 48.  That survey identified 75% of the files available through Grokster as copyrighted works owned or controlled by the plaintiffs, and 15% of the files as works likely copyrighted.  App. 439.  As to the remaining 10% of the files, there was not enough information to form reasonable conclusions either as to what those files even consisted of, and/or whether they were infringing or non-infringing.  App. 479.  Even assuming, as Justice Breyer does, that the Sony Court would have absolved Sony of contributory liability solely on the basis of the use of the Betamax for authorized time-shifting, post, at 34, summary judgment is not inevitably appropriate here.  Sony stressed that the plaintiffs there owned well below 10% of copyrighted television programming, 464 U. S., at 443, and found, based on trial testimony from representatives of the four major sports leagues and other individuals authorized to consent to home-recording of their copyrighted broadcasts, that a similar percentage of program copying was authorized, id., at 424.  Here, the plaintiffs allegedly control copyrights for 70% or 75% of the material exchanged through the Grokster and StreamCast software, 380 F. 3d, at 1158; App. 439, and the District Court does not appear to have relied on comparable testimony about authorized copying from copyright holders.

				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 390 (Sept. 25, 2002) (testimony about the band Wilco based on [t]he press and industry news groups and scuttlebutt.).  These declarations do not support summary judgment in the face of evidence, proffered by MGM, of overwhelming use of Groksters and StreamCasts software for infringement.

Even if the absolute number of noninfringing files copied using the Grokster and StreamCast software is large, it does not follow that the products are therefore put to substantial noninfringing uses and are thus immune from liability.  The number of noninfringing copies may be reflective of, and dwarfed by, the huge total volume of files shared.  Further, the District Court and the Court of Appeals did not sharply distinguish between uses of Groksters and StreamCasts software products (which this case is about) and uses of peer-to-peer technology generally (which this case is not about).

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In sum, when the record in this case was developed, there was evidence that Groksters and StreamCasts products were, and had been for some time, overwhelmingly used to infringe, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 46; App. 434439, 476481, and that this infringement was the overwhelming source of revenue from the products, 
				<em>
					ante, 
				</em>
				at 89; 259 F. Supp. 2d, at 10431044.  Fairly appraised, the evidence was insufficient to demonstrate, beyond genuine debate, a reasonable prospect that substantial or commercially significant noninfringing uses were likely to develop over time.  On this record, the District Court should not have ruled dispositively on the contributory infringement charge by granting summary judgment to Grokster and StreamCast.

						 Justice Breyer finds in Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/464/417" class="subref" title="subref">464 U. S. 417</a> (1984)
, a clear rule permitting contributory liability for copyright infringement based on distribution of a product only when the product will be used almost exclusively to infringe copyrights.  Post, at 910.  But cf. Sony, 464 U. S., at 442 (recognizing copyright holders legitimate demand for effectivenot merely symbolicprotection).  Sony, as I read it, contains no clear, near-exclusivity test.  Nor have Courts of Appeals unanimously recognized Justice Breyers clear rule.  Compare A&amp;M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc., 239 F. 3d 1004, 1021 (CA9 2001) ([E]vidence of actual knowledge of specific acts of infringement is required to hold a computer system operator liable for contributory copyright infringement.), with In re Aimster Copyright Litigation, 334 F. 3d 643, 649650 (CA7 2003) ([W]hen a supplier is offering a product or service that has noninfringing as well as infringing uses, some estimate of the respective magnitudes of these uses is necessary for a finding of contributory infringement. …  But the balancing of costs and benefits is necessary only in a case in which substantial noninfringing uses, present or prospective, are demonstrated.).  See also Matthew Bender &amp; Co., Inc. v. West Pub. Co., 158 F. 3d 693, 707 (CA2 1998) (The Supreme Court applied [the Sony] test to prevent copyright holders from leveraging the copyrights in their original work to control distribution of … products that might be used incidentally for infringement, but that had substantial noninfringing uses… .  The same rationale applies here [to products] that have substantial, predominant and noninfringing uses as tools for research and citation.).  All Members of the Court agree, moreover, that the Court of Appeals misapplied Sony, at least to the extent it read that decision to limit secondary liability to a hardly-ever category, quite beyond the circumstances to which the case applied.  Ante, at 16.

						 Grokster and StreamCast, in the Court of Appeals view, would be entitled to summary judgment unless MGM could show that that the software companies had knowledge of specific acts of infringement and failed to act on that knowledgea standard the court held MGM could not meet.  380 F. 3d, at 11621163.

						 Justice Breyer finds support for summary judgment in this motley collection of declarations and in a survey conducted by an expert retained by MGM.  Post, at 48.  That survey identified 75% of the files available through Grokster as copyrighted works owned or controlled by the plaintiffs, and 15% of the files as works likely copyrighted.  App. 439.  As to the remaining 10% of the files, there was not enough information to form reasonable conclusions either as to what those files even consisted of, and/or whether they were infringing or non-infringing.  App. 479.  Even assuming, as Justice Breyer does, that the Sony Court would have absolved Sony of contributory liability solely on the basis of the use of the Betamax for authorized time-shifting, post, at 34, summary judgment is not inevitably appropriate here.  Sony stressed that the plaintiffs there owned well below 10% of copyrighted television programming, 464 U. S., at 443, and found, based on trial testimony from representatives of the four major sports leagues and other individuals authorized to consent to home-recording of their copyrighted broadcasts, that a similar percentage of program copying was authorized, id., at 424.  Here, the plaintiffs allegedly control copyrights for 70% or 75% of the material exchanged through the Grokster and StreamCast software, 380 F. 3d, at 1158; App. 439, and the District Court does not appear to have relied on comparable testimony about authorized copying from copyright holders.

.  There is here at least a genuine issue as to [a] material fact, Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(c), on the liability of Grokster or StreamCast, not only for actively inducing copyright infringement, but also or alternatively, based on the distribution of their software products, for contributory copyright infringement.  On neither score was summary judgment for Grokster and StreamCast warranted.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				At bottom, however labeled, the question in this case is whether Grokster and StreamCast are liable for the direct infringing acts of others.  Liability under our jurisprudence may be predicated on actively encouraging (or inducing) infringement through specific acts (as the Courts opinion develops) or on distributing a product distributees use to infringe copyrights, if the product is not capable of substantial or commercially significant noninfringing uses.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/35/271.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">35 U. S. C. §271(b)</a> (active inducement liability), with §271(c) (contributory liability for distribution of a product not suitable for substantial noninfringing use).

Drawing an analogy to the staple article of commerce doctrine from patent law, the

				The staple article of commerce doctrine applied to copyright, the Court stated, must strike a balance between a copyright holders legitimate demand for effectivenot merely symbolicprotection of the statutory monopoly, and the rights of others freely to engage in substantially unrelated areas of commerce.  
				<em>
					Sony

But cf. Sony, 464 U. S., at 442 (recognizing copyright holders legitimate demand for effectivenot merely symbolicprotection).  Sony, as I read it, contains no clear, near-exclusivity test.  Nor have Courts of Appeals unanimously recognized Justice Breyers clear rule.  Compare A&amp;M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc., 239 F. 3d 1004, 1021 (CA9 2001) ([E]vidence of actual knowledge of specific acts of infringement is required to hold a computer system operator liable for contributory copyright infringement.), with In re Aimster Copyright Litigation, 334 F. 3d 643, 649650 (CA7 2003) ([W]hen a supplier is offering a product or service that has noninfringing as well as infringing uses, some estimate of the respective magnitudes of these uses is necessary for a finding of contributory infringement. …  But the balancing of costs and benefits is necessary only in a case in which substantial noninfringing uses, present or prospective, are demonstrated.).  See also Matthew Bender &amp; Co., Inc. v. West Pub.

The same rationale applies here [to products] that have substantial, predominant and noninfringing uses as tools for research and citation.).  All Members of the Court agree, moreover, that the Court of Appeals misapplied Sony, at least to the extent it read that decision to limit secondary liability to a hardly-ever category, quite beyond the circumstances to which the case applied.  Ante, at 16.

						 Justice Breyer finds support for summary judgment in this motley collection of declarations and in a survey conducted by an expert retained by MGM.  Post, at 48.  That survey identified 75% of the files available through Grokster as copyrighted works owned or controlled by the plaintiffs, and 15% of the files as works likely copyrighted.  App. 439.  As to the remaining 10% of the files, there was not enough information to form reasonable conclusions either as to what those files even consisted of, and/or whether they were infringing or non-infringing.  App. 479.  Even assuming, as Justice Breyer does, that the Sony Court would have absolved Sony of contributory liability solely on the basis of the use of the Betamax for authorized time-shifting, post, at 34, summary judgment is not inevitably appropriate here.  Sony stressed that the plaintiffs there owned well below 10% of copyrighted television programming, 464 U. S., at 443, and found, based on trial testimony from representatives of the four major sports leagues and other individuals authorized to consent to home-recording of their copyrighted broadcasts, that a similar percentage of program copying was authorized, id., at 424.  Here, the plaintiffs allegedly control copyrights for 70% or 75% of the material exchanged through the Grokster and StreamCast software, 380 F. 3d, at 1158; App. 439, and the District Court does not appear to have relied on comparable testimony about authorized copying from copyright holders.

.  There is here at least a genuine issue as to [a] material fact, Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(c), on the liability of Grokster or StreamCast, not only for actively inducing copyright infringement, but also or alternatively, based on the distribution of their software products, for contributory copyright infringement.  On neither score was summary judgment for Grokster and StreamCast warranted.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				At bottom, however labeled, the question in this case is whether Grokster and StreamCast are liable for the direct infringing acts of others.  Liability under our jurisprudence may be predicated on actively encouraging (or inducing) infringement through specific acts (as the Courts opinion develops) or on distributing a product distributees use to infringe copyrights, if the product is not capable of substantial or commercially significant noninfringing uses.

					Sony,

				464 U. S., at 442; see also 3 M. Nimmer &amp; D. Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright §12.04[A][2] (2005).  While the two categories overlap, they capture different culpable behavior.  Long coexisting, both are now codified in patent law.  Compare 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/35/271.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">35 U. S. C. §271(b)</a> (active inducement liability), with §271(c) (contributory liability for distribution of a product not suitable for substantial noninfringing use).

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/464/417" class="subref" title="subref">464 U.

Drawing an analogy to the staple article of commerce doctrine from patent law, the 
				<em>
					Sony

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The staple article of commerce doctrine applied to copyright, the Court stated, must strike a balance between a copyright holders legitimate demand for effectivenot merely symbolicprotection of the statutory monopoly, and the rights of others freely to engage in substantially unrelated areas of commerce.  
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				, 464 U. S., at 442. 
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				Accordingly, the Court held, the sale of copying equipment, like the sale of other articles of commerce, does not constitute contributory infringement if the product is widely used for legitimate, unobjectionable purposes.  Indeed, it need merely be capable of substantial noninfringing uses.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  Thus, to resolve the 
				<em>
					Sony 
				</em>
				case, the Court explained, it had to determine whether the Betamax is capable of commercially significant noninfringing uses.  Ibid.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				To answer that question, the Court considered whether a significant number of [potential uses of the Betamax were] noninfringing.  Ibid.
				  The Court homed in on one potential useprivate, noncommercial time-shifting of television programs in the home (
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, recording a broadcast TV program for later personal viewing).  Time-shifting was noninfringing, the Court concluded, because in some cases trial testimony showed it was authorized by the copyright holder, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 443447, and in others it qualified as legitimate fair use, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 447455.  Most purchasers used the Betamax principally to engage in time-shifting, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 421, 423, a use that plainly satisfie[d] the Courts standard, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 442.  Thus, there was no need in 
				<em>
					Sony 
				</em>
				to give precise content to the question of how much [actual or potential] use is commercially significant.  
				<em>
					Ibid.&lt;footcall num="1"&gt;
				</em>
				  Further development was left for later days and cases.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Ninth Circuit went astray, I will endeavor to explain, when that court granted summary judgment to Grokster and StreamCast on the charge of contributory liability based on distribution of their software products.  Relying on its earlier opinion in 
				<em>
					A&amp;M Records, Inc.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Napster, Inc.
				</em>
				, 239 F. 3d 1004 (CA9 2001), the Court of Appeals held that if substantial noninfringing use was shown, the copyright owner would be required to show that the defendant had reasonable knowledge of specific infringing files.  380 F. 3d 1154, 1161 (CA9 2004).  A careful examination of the record, the court concluded, indicates that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to noninfringing use.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  The appeals court pointed to the band Wilco, which made one of its albums available for free downloading, to other recording artists who may have authorized free distribution of their music through the Internet, and to public domain literary works and films available through Groksters and StreamCasts software.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  Although it acknowledged MGMs assertion that the vast majority of the software use is for copyright infringement, the court concluded that Groksters and StreamCasts proffered evidence met 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				s requirement that a product need only be 
				<em>
					capable
				</em>
				 of substantial noninfringing uses.  380 F. 3d, at 1162.

				This case differs markedly from 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				.  Cf. Peters, Brace Memorial Lecture: Copyright Enters the Public Domain, 51 J. Copyright Soc. 701, 724 (2004) (The 
				<em>

				panels reading of 
				<em>
					Sony
				</em>
				 is the broadest that any court has given it … .).  Here, there has been no finding of any fair use and little beyond anecdotal evidence of noninfringing uses.  In finding the Grokster and StreamCast software products capable of substantial noninfringing uses, the District Court and the Court of Appeals appear to have relied largely on declarations submitted by the defendants.  These declarations include assertions (some of them hearsay) that a number of copyright owners authorize distribution of their works on the Internet and that some public domain material is available through peer-to-peer networks including those accessed through Groksters and StreamCasts software.  380 F. 3d, at 1161; 259 F.

				The District Court declared it undisputed that there are substantial noninfringing uses for Defendants software, thus obviating the need for further proceedings.  259 F. Supp. 2d, at 1035.  This conclusion appears to rest almost entirely on the collection of declarations submitted by Grokster and StreamCast.  
				<em>

Napster, Inc., 239 F. 3d 1004, 1021 (CA9 2001) ([E]vidence of actual knowledge of specific acts of infringement is required to hold a computer system operator liable for contributory copyright infringement.), with In re Aimster Copyright Litigation, 334 F. 3d 643, 649650 (CA7 2003) ([W]hen a supplier is offering a product or service that has noninfringing as well as infringing uses, some estimate of the respective magnitudes of these uses is necessary for a finding of contributory infringement. …  But the balancing of costs and benefits is necessary only in a case in which substantial noninfringing uses, present or prospective, are demonstrated.).  See also Matthew Bender &amp; Co., Inc. v. West Pub. Co., 158 F. 3d 693, 707 (CA2 1998) (The Supreme Court applied [the Sony] test to prevent copyright holders from leveraging the copyrights in their original work to control distribution of … products that might be used incidentally for infringement, but that had substantial noninfringing uses… .  The same rationale applies here [to products] that have substantial, predominant and noninfringing uses as tools for research and citation.).  All Members of the Court agree, moreover, that the Court of Appeals misapplied Sony, at least to the extent it read that decision to limit secondary liability to a hardly-ever category, quite beyond the circumstances to which the case applied.  Ante, at 16.

						 Grokster and StreamCast, in the Court of Appeals view, would be entitled to summary judgment unless MGM could show that that the software companies had knowledge of specific acts of infringement and failed to act on that knowledgea standard the court held MGM could not meet.  380 F. 3d, at 11621163.

						 Justice Breyer finds support for summary judgment in this motley collection of declarations and in a survey conducted by an expert retained by MGM.  Post, at 48.  That survey identified 75% of the files available through Grokster as copyrighted works owned or controlled by the plaintiffs, and 15% of the files as works likely copyrighted.  App. 439.  As to the remaining 10% of the files, there was not enough information to form reasonable conclusions either as to what those files even consisted of, and/or whether they were infringing or non-infringing.  App. 479.  Even assuming, as Justice Breyer does, that the Sony Court would have absolved Sony of contributory liability solely on the basis of the use of the Betamax for authorized time-shifting, post, at 34, summary judgment is not inevitably appropriate here.  Sony stressed that the plaintiffs there owned well below 10% of copyrighted television programming, 464 U. S., at 443, and found, based on trial testimony from representatives of the four major sports leagues and other individuals authorized to consent to home-recording of their copyrighted broadcasts, that a similar percentage of program copying was authorized, id., at 424.  Here, the plaintiffs allegedly control copyrights for 70% or 75% of the material exchanged through the Grokster and StreamCast software, 380 F. 3d, at 1158; App. 439, and the District Court does not appear to have relied on comparable testimony about authorized copying from copyright holders.

						 The District Courts conclusion that [p]laintiffs do not dispute that Defendants software is being used, and could be used, for substantial noninfringing purposes, 259 F. Supp. 2d 1029, 1036 (CD Cal. 2003); accord 380 F. 3d, at 1161, is, to say the least, dubious.  In the courts below and in this Court, MGM has continuously disputed any such conclusion.  Brief for Motion Picture Studio and Recording Company Petitioners 3038; Brief for MGM Plaintiffs-Appellants in No. 0355894, etc. (CA9), p. 41; App. 356357, 361365.

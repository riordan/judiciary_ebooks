				Petitioners, hoteliers in respondent city, initiated this litigation over the application of an ordinance requiring them to pay a $567,000 fee for converting residential rooms to tourist rooms.  They initially sought mandamus in California state court, but that action was stayed when they filed suit in Federal District Court asserting, 
				<em>
					inter alia
				</em>
				, facial and as-applied challenges to the ordinance under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a>s Takings Clause.  Although the District Court granted the city summary judgment, the Ninth Circuit abstained from ruling on the facial challenge under 
				<em>
					Railroad Commn of Tex.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Pullman Co.
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/312/496" class="subref" title="subref">312 U. S. 496</a>, because the pending state mandamus action could moot the federal question.  The court did, however, affirm the District Courts ruling that the as-applied claim was unripe.  Back in state court, petitioners attempted to reserve the right to return to federal court for adjudication of their federal takings claims.  Ultimately, the California courts rejected petitioners various state-law takings claims, and they returned to the Federal District Court, advancing a series of federal takings claims that depended on issues identical to those previously resolved in the state courts.  In order to avoid being barred from suit by the general rule of issue preclusion, petitioners asked the District Court to exempt their federal takings claims from the reach of the full faith and credit statute, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1738.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1738</a>.  Relying on the 
				<em>
					Williamson County Regional Planning Commn 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					Hamilton Bank of Johnson City
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/473/172" class="subref" title="subref">473 U. S. 172</a>, holding that takings claims are not ripe until a State fails to provide adequate compensation for the taking, petitioners argued that, unless courts disregard §1738 in takings cases, plaintiffs will be forced to litigate their claims in state court without any realistic possibility of ever obtaining federal review.  Holding, 
				<em>
					inter alia,
				</em>
				 that petitioners facial attack was barred by issue preclusion, the District Court reasoned that §1738 requires federal courts to give preclusive effect to any state-court judgment that would have such effect under the States laws.  The court added that because California courts had interpreted the relevant substantive state takings law coextensively with federal law, petitioners federal claims constituted the same claims the state courts had already resolved.  Affirming, the Ninth Circuit rejected petitioners contention that general preclusion principles should be cast aside whenever plaintiffs must litigate in state court under 
				<em>
					Pullman
				</em>
				 and/or 
				<em>
					Williamson County
				</em>
				.

            <em>
					Held:
				</em>
				 This Court will not create an exception to the full faith and credit statute in order to provide a federal forum for litigants seeking to advance federal takings claims.  Pp. 1123.
				    
				
			</p>
        <p class="SYLCTF">
				
				    
				(a) The Court rejects petitioners contention that whenever plaintiffs reserve their federal takings claims in state court under 
				<em>
					England
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Louisiana Bd. of Medical Examiners
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/375/411" class="subref" title="subref">375 U. S. 411</a>, federal courts should review the reserved federal claims 
				<em>
					de novo
				</em>
				, regardless of what issues the state court may have decided or how it may have decided them.  The 
				<em>
					England 
				</em>
				Courts discussion of the typical case in which reservations of federal issues are appropriate makes clear that the decision was aimed at cases fundamentally distinct from petitioners.  
				<em>
					England 
				</em>
				cases generally involve federal constitutional challenges to a state statute that can be avoided if a state court construes the statute in a particular manner.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 420.  In such cases, the purpose of abstention is not to afford state courts an opportunity to adjudicate an issue that is functionally identical to the federal question, but to avoid resolving the federal question by encouraging a state-law determination that may moot the federal controversy.  See 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 416417, and n. 7.  Additionally, the Court made clear that the effective reservation of a federal claim was dependent on the condition that plaintiffs take no action to broaden the scope of the state courts review beyond deciding the antecedent state-law issue
				<em>
					.  Id.,
				</em>
				 at 419.  Because the Ninth Circuit invoked 
				<em>
					Pullman 
				</em>
				abstention after determining that a ripe federal question existed as to the petitioners facial takings challenge, they were entitled to insulate from preclusive effect that one federal issue while they returned to state court to resolve their mandamus petition.  Petitioners, however, chose to advance broader issues than the limited ones in the mandamus petition, putting forth facial and as-applied takings challenges to the city ordinance in their state action.  By doing so, they effectively asked the state court to resolve the same federal issue they had previously asked it to reserve.  
				<em>
					England 
				</em>
				does not support the exercise of any such right.  Petitioners as-applied takings claims fare no better.  The Ninth Circuit found those claims unripe under 
				<em>
					Williamson County, 
				</em>
				and therefore affirmed their dismissal.  They were never properly before the District Court, and there was no reason to expect that they could be relitigated in full if advanced in the state proceedings.  Pp. 1117.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				(b) Federal courts are not free to disregard §1738 simply to guarantee that all takings plaintiffs can have their day in federal court.  Petitioners misplace their reliance on the Second Circuits 
				<em>
					Santini 
				</em>
				decision, which held that parties who are forced to litigate their state-law takings claims in state court pursuant to 
				<em>
					Williamson County
				</em>
				 cannot be precluded from having those very claims resolved by a federal court.  The 
				<em>
					Santini
				</em>
				 courts reasoning is unpersuasive for several reasons.  First, both petitioners and 
				<em>
					Santini
				</em>
				 ultimately depend on an assumption that plaintiffs have a right to vindicate their federal claims in a federal forum.  This Court has repeatedly held to the contrary.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Allen
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					McCurry
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/449/90" class="subref" title="subref">449 U. S. 90</a>.  Second, petitioners argument assumes that courts may simply create exceptions to §1738 wherever they deem them appropriate.  However, this Court has held that no such exception will be recognized unless a later statute contains an express or implied partial repeal.  
				<em>
					E.g., Kremer
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Chemical Constr. Corp.
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/456/461" class="subref" title="subref">456 U. S. 461</a>.  Congress has not expressed any intent to exempt federal takings claims from §1738.  Third, petitioners have overstated 
				<em>
					Williamson County
				</em>
				s reach throughout this litigation.  Because they were never required to ripen in state court their claim that the city ordinance was facially invalid for failure to substantially advance a legitimate state interest, see 
				<em>
					Yee 
				</em>
				v.
				<em>
					 Escondido,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/503/519" class="subref" title="subref">503 U. S. 519</a>, they could have raised the heart of their facial takings challenges directly in federal court.  With respect to those federal claims that did require ripening, petitioners are incorrect that 
				<em>
					Williamson County
				</em>
				 precludes state courts from hearing simultaneously a plaintiffs request for compensation under state law together with a claim that, in the alternative, the denial of compensation would violate the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> of the Federal Constitution.  Pp. 1723.

				I agree that the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed.  Whatever the reasons for petitioners chosen course of litigation in the state courts, it is quite clear that they are now precluded by the full faith and credit statute,

				In 
				<em>
					Williamson County
				</em>
				, the respondent land developer filed a §1983 suit in federal court alleging a regulatory takings claim after a regional planning commission disapproved respondents plat proposals, but before respondent appealed that decision to the zoning board of appeals.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 181182.  Rather than reaching the merits, we found the claim was brought prematurely.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 200.  We first held that the claim was not ripe until the government entity charged with implementing the regulations [had] reached a final decision regarding the application of the regulations to the property at issue.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 186.  Because respondent failed to seek variances from the planning commission or the zoning board of appeals, we decided that respondent had failed to meet the final-decision requirement.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 187191.  We then noted a second reason the taking claim [was] not yet ripe: respondent did not seek compensation through the procedures the State [had] provided for doing so.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 194.  Until the claimant had received a final denial of compensation through all available state procedures, such as by an inverse condemnation action, we said he could not claim a violation of the Just Compensation Clause.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 195196.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It is not clear to me that 
				<em>
					Williamson County
				</em>
				 was correct in demanding that, once a government entity has reached a final decision with respect to a claimants property, the claimant must seek compensation in state court before bringing a federal takings claim in federal court.  The Court in
				<em>
					 Williamson County
				</em>
				 purported to interpret the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> in divining this state-litigation requirement.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 194, n. 13 (The nature of the constitutional right . . . requires that a property owner utilize procedures for obtaining compensation before bringing a §1983 action).  More recently, we have referred to it as merely a prudential requirement.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">733</a>734 (1997)
.  It is not obvious that either constitutional or prudential principles require claimants to utilize all state compensation procedures before they can bring a federal takings claim.  Cf.

				The Court today attempts to shore up the state-litigation requirement by referring to

				 v.

					McNary,

            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/454/100" class="subref" title="subref">454 U. S. 100</a> (1981)

				<em>
					Ante

				, at 2223.  There, we held that the principle of comity (reflected in the Tax Injunction Act, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1341.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1341</a>) bars taxpayers from asserting §1983 claims against the validity of state tax systems in federal courts.  454 U. S., at 116.  Our decision that such suits must be brought in state court was driven by the unique and sensitive interests at stake when federal courts confront claims that States acted impermissibly in administering their own tax systems.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 102103, 107113.  Those historically grounded, federalism-based concerns had led to a longstanding, fundamental principle of comity between federal courts and state governments . . . , particularly in the area of state taxation, a principle which predated the enactment of §1983 itself.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 103, 107114.  We decided that those interests favored requiring that taxpayers bring challenges to the validity of state tax systems in state court, despite the strong interests favoring federal- court review of alleged constitutional violations by state officials.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 115116.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court today makes no claim that any such longstanding principle of comity toward state courts in handling federal takings claims existed at the time 
				<em>
					Williamson County
				</em>
				 was decided, nor that one has since developed.  The Court does remark, however, that state courts are more familiar with the issues involved in local land-use and zoning regulations, and it suggests that this makes it proper to relegate federal takings claims to state court.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 23.  But it is not apparent that any such expertise matches the type of historically grounded, federalism-based interests we found necessary to our decision in 
				<em>
					Fair Assessment
				</em>
				.  In any event, the Court has not explained why we should hand authority over federal takings claims to state courts, based simply on their relative familiarity with local land-use decisions and proceedings, while allowing plaintiffs to proceed directly to federal court in cases involving, for example, challenges to municipal land-use regulations based on the

				Finally, 
				<em>
					Williamson County
				</em>
				s state-litigation rule has created some real anomalies, justifying our revisiting the issue.  For example, our holding today ensures that litigants who go to state court to seek compensation will likely be unable later to assert their federal takings claims in federal court.

				, at 22.  And, even if preclusion law would not block a litigants claim, the

				In 
				<em>
					Williamson County
				</em>
				, the respondent land developer filed a §1983 suit in federal court alleging a regulatory takings claim after a regional planning commission disapproved respondents plat proposals, but before respondent appealed that decision to the zoning board of appeals.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 181182.  Rather than reaching the merits, we found the claim was brought prematurely.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 200.  We first held that the claim was not ripe until the government entity charged with implementing the regulations [had] reached a final decision regarding the application of the regulations to the property at issue.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 186.  Because respondent failed to seek variances from the planning commission or the zoning board of appeals, we decided that respondent had failed to meet the final-decision requirement.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 187191.  We then noted a second reason the taking claim [was] not yet ripe: respondent did not seek compensation through the procedures the State [had] provided for doing so.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 194.  Until the claimant had received a final denial of compensation through all available state procedures, such as by an inverse condemnation action, we said he could not claim a violation of the Just Compensation Clause.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 195196.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It is not clear to me that 
				<em>
					Williamson County
				</em>
				 was correct in demanding that, once a government entity has reached a final decision with respect to a claimants property, the claimant must seek compensation in state court before bringing a federal takings claim in federal court.  The Court in
				<em>
					 Williamson County
				</em>
				 purported to interpret the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> in divining this state-litigation requirement.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 194, n. 13 (The nature of the constitutional right . . . requires that a property owner utilize procedures for obtaining compensation before bringing a §1983 action).  More recently, we have referred to it as merely a prudential requirement.  
				<em>
					Suitum

				 v. 
				<em>
					Tahoe Regional Planning Agency,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">733</a>734 (1997)
.  It is not obvious that either constitutional or prudential principles require claimants to utilize all state compensation procedures before they can bring a federal takings claim.  Cf. 
				<em>

				<em>

				The Court today attempts to shore up the state-litigation requirement by referring to

            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/454/100" class="subref" title="subref">454 U. S. 100</a> (1981)

				<em>
					Ante

				, at 2223.  There, we held that the principle of comity (reflected in the Tax Injunction Act, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1341.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1341</a>) bars taxpayers from asserting §1983 claims against the validity of state tax systems in federal courts.  454 U. S., at 116.  Our decision that such suits must be brought in state court was driven by the unique and sensitive interests at stake when federal courts confront claims that States acted impermissibly in administering their own tax systems.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 102103, 107113.  Those historically grounded, federalism-based concerns had led to a longstanding, fundamental principle of comity between federal courts and state governments . . . , particularly in the area of state taxation, a principle which predated the enactment of §1983 itself.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 103, 107114.  We decided that those interests favored requiring that taxpayers bring challenges to the validity of state tax systems in state court, despite the strong interests favoring federal- court review of alleged constitutional violations by state officials.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 115116.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court today makes no claim that any such longstanding principle of comity toward state courts in handling federal takings claims existed at the time 
				<em>
					Williamson County
				</em>
				 was decided, nor that one has since developed.  The Court does remark, however, that state courts are more familiar with the issues involved in local land-use and zoning regulations, and it suggests that this makes it proper to relegate federal takings claims to state court.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 23.  But it is not apparent that any such expertise matches the type of historically grounded, federalism-based interests we found necessary to our decision in 
				<em>
					Fair Assessment
				</em>
				.  In any event, the Court has not explained why we should hand authority over federal takings claims to state courts, based simply on their relative familiarity with local land-use decisions and proceedings, while allowing plaintiffs to proceed directly to federal court in cases involving, for example, challenges to municipal land-use regulations based on the

				Finally, 
				<em>
					Williamson County
				</em>
				s state-litigation rule has created some real anomalies, justifying our revisiting the issue.  For example, our holding today ensures that litigants who go to state court to seek compensation will likely be unable later to assert their federal takings claims in federal court.

				<em>
					Williamson County

				Finally, 
				<em>
					Williamson County
				</em>
				s state-litigation rule has created some real anomalies, justifying our revisiting the issue.  For example, our holding today ensures that litigants who go to state court to seek compensation will likely be unable later to assert their federal takings claims in federal court.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 22.  And, even if preclusion law would not block a litigants claim, the 
				<em>
					Rooker
				</em>
				-
				<em>
					Feldman
				</em>
				 doctrine might, insofar as 
				<em>
					Williamson County
				</em>
				 can be read to characterize the state courts denial of compensation as a required element of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> takings claim.  See 
				<em>
					Exxon Mobil Corp.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Saudi Basic Industries Corp.
				</em>
				, 544 U. S. ___ (2005).  As the Court recognizes, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 22, 
				<em>
					Williamson
				</em>
            <em>
					County
				</em>
				 all but guarantees that claimants will be unable to utilize the federal courts to enforce the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a>s just compensation guarantee.  The basic principle that state courts are competent to enforce federal rights and to adjudicate federal takings claims is sound, see 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 23, and would apply to any number of federal claims.  Cf. 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2254.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2254</a> (providing for limited federal habeas review of state-court adjudications of alleged violations of the Constitution).  But that principle does not explain why federal takings claims in particular should be singled out to be confined to state court, in the absence of any asserted justification or congressional directive.

				I joined the opinion of the Court in 
				<em>
					Williamson County
				</em>
				.  But further reflection and experience lead me to think that the justifications for its state-litigation requirement are suspect, while its impact on takings plaintiffs is dramatic.  Here, no court below has addressed the correctness of 
				<em>
					Williamson County
				</em>
				, neither party has asked us to reconsider it, and resolving the issue could not benefit petitioners.  In an appropriate case, I believe the Court should reconsider whether plaintiffs asserting a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> takings claim based on the final decision of a state or local government entity must first seek compensation in state courts.

						 In creating the state-litigation rule, the Court, in addition to relying on the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a>s text, analogized to Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/467/986" class="subref" title="subref">467 U. S. 986</a> (1984)

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/451/527" class="subref" title="subref">451 U. S. 527</a> (1981)
.  As several of petitioners amici in this case have urged, those cases provided limited support for the state-litigation requirement.  See Brief for Defenders of Property Rights et al. as Amici Curiae 912; Brief for Elizabeth J. Neumont et al. as Amici Curiae 1014.

						 Indeed, in some States the courts themselves apply the state-litigation requirement from Williamson County Regional Planning Commn v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/473/172" class="subref" title="subref">473 U. S. 172</a> (1985)
, refusing to entertain any federal takings claim until the claimant receives a final denial of compensation through all the available state procedures.  See, e.g., Breneric Assoc. v. City of Del Mar, 69 Cal. App. 4th 166, 188189, 81 Cal. Rptr. 2d 324, 338339 (1998); Melillo v. City of New Haven, 249 Conn. 138, 154, n. 28, 732 A. 2d 133, 138, n. 28 (1999).  This precludes litigants from asserting their federal takings claim even in state court.  The Court tries to avoid this anomaly by asserting that, for plaintiffs attempting to raise a federal takings claim in state court as an alternative to their state claims, Williamson County does not command that the state courts themselves impose the state-litigation requirement.  Ante, at 2122.  But that is so only if Williamson Countys state-litigation requirement is merely a prudential rule, and not a constitutional mandate, a question that the Court today conspicuously leaves open.

				In 
				<em>
					Williamson County
				</em>
				, the respondent land developer filed a §1983 suit in federal court alleging a regulatory takings claim after a regional planning commission disapproved respondents plat proposals, but before respondent appealed that decision to the zoning board of appeals.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 181182.  Rather than reaching the merits, we found the claim was brought prematurely.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 200.  We first held that the claim was not ripe until the government entity charged with implementing the regulations [had] reached a final decision regarding the application of the regulations to the property at issue.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 186.  Because respondent failed to seek variances from the planning commission or the zoning board of appeals, we decided that respondent had failed to meet the final-decision requirement.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 187191.  We then noted a second reason the taking claim [was] not yet ripe: respondent did not seek compensation through the procedures the State [had] provided for doing so.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 194.  Until the claimant had received a final denial of compensation through all available state procedures, such as by an inverse condemnation action, we said he could not claim a violation of the Just Compensation Clause.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 195196.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It is not clear to me that 
				<em>
					Williamson County
				</em>
				 was correct in demanding that, once a government entity has reached a final decision with respect to a claimants property, the claimant must seek compensation in state court before bringing a federal takings claim in federal court.  The Court in
				<em>
					 Williamson County
				</em>
				 purported to interpret the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> in divining this state-litigation requirement.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 194, n. 13 (The nature of the constitutional right . . . requires that a property owner utilize procedures for obtaining compensation before bringing a §1983 action).  More recently, we have referred to it as merely a prudential requirement.  
				<em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">733</a>734 (1997)
.  It is not obvious that either constitutional or prudential principles require claimants to utilize all state compensation procedures before they can bring a federal takings claim.  Cf.

            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/454/100" class="subref" title="subref">454 U. S. 100</a> (1981)

				<em>
					Ante

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1341.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1341</a>) bars taxpayers from asserting §1983 claims against the validity of state tax systems in federal courts.  454 U. S., at 116.  Our decision that such suits must be brought in state court was driven by the unique and sensitive interests at stake when federal courts confront claims that States acted impermissibly in administering their own tax systems.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 102103, 107113.  Those historically grounded, federalism-based concerns had led to a longstanding, fundamental principle of comity between federal courts and state governments . . . , particularly in the area of state taxation, a principle which predated the enactment of §1983 itself.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 103, 107114.  We decided that those interests favored requiring that taxpayers bring challenges to the validity of state tax systems in state court, despite the strong interests favoring federal- court review of alleged constitutional violations by state officials.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 115116.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court today makes no claim that any such longstanding principle of comity toward state courts in handling federal takings claims existed at the time 
				<em>
					Williamson County
				</em>
				 was decided, nor that one has since developed.  The Court does remark, however, that state courts are more familiar with the issues involved in local land-use and zoning regulations, and it suggests that this makes it proper to relegate federal takings claims to state court.  
				<em>

				, at 23.  But it is not apparent that any such expertise matches the type of historically grounded, federalism-based interests we found necessary to our decision in 
				<em>
					Fair Assessment
				</em>
				.  In any event, the Court has not explained why we should hand authority over federal takings claims to state courts, based simply on their relative familiarity with local land-use decisions and proceedings, while allowing plaintiffs to proceed directly to federal court in cases involving, for example, challenges to municipal land-use regulations based on the

Those historically grounded, federalism-based concerns had led to a longstanding, fundamental principle of comity between federal courts and state governments . . . , particularly in the area of state taxation, a principle which predated the enactment of §1983 itself.

				The Court today makes no claim that any such longstanding principle of comity toward state courts in handling federal takings claims existed at the time 
				<em>
					Williamson County
				</em>
				 was decided, nor that one has since developed.  The Court does remark, however, that state courts are more familiar with the issues involved in local land-use and zoning regulations, and it suggests that this makes it proper to relegate federal takings claims to state court.  
				<em>
					Ante

				, at 23.  But it is not apparent that any such expertise matches the type of historically grounded, federalism-based interests we found necessary to our decision in 
				<em>

				.  In any event, the Court has not explained why we should hand authority over federal takings claims to state courts, based simply on their relative familiarity with local land-use decisions and proceedings, while allowing plaintiffs to proceed directly to federal court in cases involving, for example, challenges to municipal land-use regulations based on the

				Finally, 
				<em>
					Williamson County
				</em>
				s state-litigation rule has created some real anomalies, justifying our revisiting the issue.  For example, our holding today ensures that litigants who go to state court to seek compensation will likely be unable later to assert their federal takings claims in federal court.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 22.  And, even if preclusion law would not block a litigants claim, the 
				<em>
					Rooker
				</em>
				-
				<em>
					Feldman
				</em>
				 doctrine might, insofar as 
				<em>
					Williamson County
				</em>
				 can be read to characterize the state courts denial of compensation as a required element of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> takings claim.  See 
				<em>
					Exxon Mobil Corp.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Saudi Basic Industries Corp.
				</em>
				, 544 U. S. ___ (2005).  As the Court recognizes, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 22, 
				<em>
					Williamson
				</em>
            <em>
					County
				</em>
				 all but guarantees that claimants will be unable to utilize the federal courts to enforce the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a>s just compensation guarantee.  The basic principle that state courts are competent to enforce federal rights and to adjudicate federal takings claims is sound, see 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 23, and would apply to any number of federal claims.  Cf. 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2254.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2254</a> (providing for limited federal habeas review of state-court adjudications of alleged violations of the Constitution).  But that principle does not explain why federal takings claims in particular should be singled out to be confined to state court, in the absence of any asserted justification or congressional directive.

				I joined the opinion of the Court in 
				<em>
					Williamson County
				</em>
				.  But further reflection and experience lead me to think that the justifications for its state-litigation requirement are suspect, while its impact on takings plaintiffs is dramatic.  Here, no court below has addressed the correctness of 
				<em>
					Williamson County
				</em>
				, neither party has asked us to reconsider it, and resolving the issue could not benefit petitioners.  In an appropriate case, I believe the Court should reconsider whether plaintiffs asserting a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> takings claim based on the final decision of a state or local government entity must first seek compensation in state courts.

						 In creating the state-litigation rule, the Court, in addition to relying on the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a>s text, analogized to Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/467/986" class="subref" title="subref">467 U. S. 986</a> (1984)

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/451/527" class="subref" title="subref">451 U. S. 527</a> (1981)
.  As several of petitioners amici in this case have urged, those cases provided limited support for the state-litigation requirement.  See Brief for Defenders of Property Rights et al. as Amici Curiae 912; Brief for Elizabeth J. Neumont et al. as Amici Curiae 1014.

						 Indeed, in some States the courts themselves apply the state-litigation requirement from Williamson County Regional Planning Commn v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/473/172" class="subref" title="subref">473 U. S. 172</a> (1985)
, refusing to entertain any federal takings claim until the claimant receives a final denial of compensation through all the available state procedures.  See, e.g., Breneric Assoc. v. City of Del Mar, 69 Cal. App. 4th 166, 188189, 81 Cal. Rptr. 2d 324, 338339 (1998); Melillo v. City of New Haven, 249 Conn. 138, 154, n. 28, 732 A. 2d 133, 138, n. 28 (1999).  This precludes litigants from asserting their federal takings claim even in state court.  The Court tries to avoid this anomaly by asserting that, for plaintiffs attempting to raise a federal takings claim in state court as an alternative to their state claims, Williamson County does not command that the state courts themselves impose the state-litigation requirement.  Ante, at 2122.  But that is so only if Williamson Countys state-litigation requirement is merely a prudential rule, and not a constitutional mandate, a question that the Court today conspicuously leaves open.

				In 
				<em>
					Williamson County
				</em>
				, the respondent land developer filed a §1983 suit in federal court alleging a regulatory takings claim after a regional planning commission disapproved respondents plat proposals, but before respondent appealed that decision to the zoning board of appeals.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 181182.  Rather than reaching the merits, we found the claim was brought prematurely.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 200.  We first held that the claim was not ripe until the government entity charged with implementing the regulations [had] reached a final decision regarding the application of the regulations to the property at issue.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 186.  Because respondent failed to seek variances from the planning commission or the zoning board of appeals, we decided that respondent had failed to meet the final-decision requirement.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 187191.  We then noted a second reason the taking claim [was] not yet ripe: respondent did not seek compensation through the procedures the State [had] provided for doing so.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 194.  Until the claimant had received a final denial of compensation through all available state procedures, such as by an inverse condemnation action, we said he could not claim a violation of the Just Compensation Clause.  
				<em>
					Id.

				, at 195196.

				It is not clear to me that 
				<em>
					Williamson County
				</em>
				 was correct in demanding that, once a government entity has reached a final decision with respect to a claimants property, the claimant must seek compensation in state court before bringing a federal takings claim in federal court.  The Court in
				<em>
					 Williamson County
				</em>
				 purported to interpret the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> in divining this state-litigation requirement.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 194, n. 13 (The nature of the constitutional right . . . requires that a property owner utilize procedures for obtaining compensation before bringing a §1983 action).  More recently, we have referred to it as merely a prudential requirement.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">733</a>734 (1997)

				<em>

            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/454/100" class="subref" title="subref">454 U. S. 100</a> (1981)

				<em>
					Ante

				, at 2223.  There, we held that the principle of comity (reflected in the Tax Injunction Act, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1341.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1341</a>) bars taxpayers from asserting §1983 claims against the validity of state tax systems in federal courts.  454 U. S., at 116.  Our decision that such suits must be brought in state court was driven by the unique and sensitive interests at stake when federal courts confront claims that States acted impermissibly in administering their own tax systems.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 102103, 107113.  Those historically grounded, federalism-based concerns had led to a longstanding, fundamental principle of comity between federal courts and state governments . . . , particularly in the area of state taxation, a principle which predated the enactment of §1983 itself.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 103, 107114.  We decided that those interests favored requiring that taxpayers bring challenges to the validity of state tax systems in state court, despite the strong interests favoring federal- court review of alleged constitutional violations by state officials.

				, at 115116.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court today makes no claim that any such longstanding principle of comity toward state courts in handling federal takings claims existed at the time 
				<em>
					Williamson County
				</em>
				 was decided, nor that one has since developed.  The Court does remark, however, that state courts are more familiar with the issues involved in local land-use and zoning regulations, and it suggests that this makes it proper to relegate federal takings claims to state court.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 23.  But it is not apparent that any such expertise matches the type of historically grounded, federalism-based interests we found necessary to our decision in 
				<em>
					Fair Assessment
				</em>
				.  In any event, the Court has not explained why we should hand authority over federal takings claims to state courts, based simply on their relative familiarity with local land-use decisions and proceedings, while allowing plaintiffs to proceed directly to federal court in cases involving, for example, challenges to municipal land-use regulations based on the

				Finally, 
				<em>
					Williamson County
				</em>
				s state-litigation rule has created some real anomalies, justifying our revisiting the issue.  For example, our holding today ensures that litigants who go to state court to seek compensation will likely be unable later to assert their federal takings claims in federal court.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 22.  And, even if preclusion law would not block a litigants claim, the 
				<em>
					Rooker
				</em>
				-
				<em>
					Feldman
				</em>
				 doctrine might, insofar as 
				<em>
					Williamson County
				</em>
				 can be read to characterize the state courts denial of compensation as a required element of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> takings claim.  See 
				<em>
					Exxon Mobil Corp.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Saudi Basic Industries Corp.
				</em>
				, 544 U. S. ___ (2005).  As the Court recognizes, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 22, 
				<em>
					Williamson
				</em>
            <em>
					County
				</em>
				 all but guarantees that claimants will be unable to utilize the federal courts to enforce the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a>s just compensation guarantee.  The basic principle that state courts are competent to enforce federal rights and to adjudicate federal takings claims is sound, see 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 23, and would apply to any number of federal claims.  Cf. 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2254.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2254</a> (providing for limited federal habeas review of state-court adjudications of alleged violations of the Constitution).  But that principle does not explain why federal takings claims in particular should be singled out to be confined to state court, in the absence of any asserted justification or congressional directive.

				I joined the opinion of the Court in 
				<em>
					Williamson County
				</em>
				.  But further reflection and experience lead me to think that the justifications for its state-litigation requirement are suspect, while its impact on takings plaintiffs is dramatic.  Here, no court below has addressed the correctness of 
				<em>
					Williamson County
				</em>
				, neither party has asked us to reconsider it, and resolving the issue could not benefit petitioners.  In an appropriate case, I believe the Court should reconsider whether plaintiffs asserting a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> takings claim based on the final decision of a state or local government entity must first seek compensation in state courts.

						 In creating the state-litigation rule, the Court, in addition to relying on the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a>s text, analogized to Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/467/986" class="subref" title="subref">467 U. S. 986</a> (1984)

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/451/527" class="subref" title="subref">451 U. S. 527</a> (1981)
.  As several of petitioners amici in this case have urged, those cases provided limited support for the state-litigation requirement.  See Brief for Defenders of Property Rights et al. as Amici Curiae 912; Brief for Elizabeth J. Neumont et al. as Amici Curiae 1014.

						 Indeed, in some States the courts themselves apply the state-litigation requirement from Williamson County Regional Planning Commn v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/473/172" class="subref" title="subref">473 U. S. 172</a> (1985)
, refusing to entertain any federal takings claim until the claimant receives a final denial of compensation through all the available state procedures.  See, e.g., Breneric Assoc. v. City of Del Mar, 69 Cal. App. 4th 166, 188189, 81 Cal. Rptr. 2d 324, 338339 (1998); Melillo v. City of New Haven, 249 Conn. 138, 154, n. 28, 732 A. 2d 133, 138, n. 28 (1999).  This precludes litigants from asserting their federal takings claim even in state court.  The Court tries to avoid this anomaly by asserting that, for plaintiffs attempting to raise a federal takings claim in state court as an alternative to their state claims, Williamson County does not command that the state courts themselves impose the state-litigation requirement.  Ante, at 2122.  But that is so only if Williamson Countys state-litigation requirement is merely a prudential rule, and not a constitutional mandate, a question that the Court today conspicuously leaves open.

				The Court today makes no claim that any such longstanding principle of comity toward state courts in handling federal takings claims existed at the time

						 Indeed, in some States the courts themselves apply the state-litigation requirement from Williamson County Regional Planning Commn v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/473/172" class="subref" title="subref">473 U. S. 172</a> (1985)
, refusing to entertain any federal takings claim until the claimant receives a final denial of compensation through all the available state procedures.  See, e.g., Breneric Assoc. v. City of Del Mar, 69 Cal. App. 4th 166, 188189, 81 Cal. Rptr. 2d 324, 338339 (1998); Melillo v. City of New Haven, 249 Conn. 138, 154, n. 28, 732 A. 2d 133, 138, n. 28 (1999).  This precludes litigants from asserting their federal takings claim even in state court.  The Court tries to avoid this anomaly by asserting that, for plaintiffs attempting to raise a federal takings claim in state court as an alternative to their state claims, Williamson County does not command that the state courts themselves impose the state-litigation requirement.  Ante, at 2122.  But that is so only if Williamson Countys state-litigation requirement is merely a prudential rule, and not a constitutional mandate, a question that the Court today conspicuously leaves open.

				In 
				<em>
					Williamson County
				</em>
				, the respondent land developer filed a §1983 suit in federal court alleging a regulatory takings claim after a regional planning commission disapproved respondents plat proposals, but before respondent appealed that decision to the zoning board of appeals.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 181182.  Rather than reaching the merits, we found the claim was brought prematurely.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 200.  We first held that the claim was not ripe until the government entity charged with implementing the regulations [had] reached a final decision regarding the application of the regulations to the property at issue.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 186.  Because respondent failed to seek variances from the planning commission or the zoning board of appeals, we decided that respondent had failed to meet the final-decision requirement.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 187191.  We then noted a second reason the taking claim [was] not yet ripe: respondent did not seek compensation through the procedures the State [had] provided for doing so.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 194.  Until the claimant had received a final denial of compensation through all available state procedures, such as by an inverse condemnation action, we said he could not claim a violation of the Just Compensation Clause.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 195196.

				It is not clear to me that 
				<em>
					Williamson County
				</em>
				 was correct in demanding that, once a government entity has reached a final decision with respect to a claimants property, the claimant must seek compensation in state court before bringing a federal takings claim in federal court.  The Court in
				<em>
					 Williamson County
				</em>
				 purported to interpret the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> in divining this state-litigation requirement.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 194, n. 13 (The nature of the constitutional right . . . requires that a property owner utilize procedures for obtaining compensation before bringing a §1983 action).  More recently, we have referred to it as merely a prudential requirement.  
				<em>
					Suitum
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Tahoe Regional Planning Agency,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">733</a>734 (1997)

				In 
				<em>
					Williamson County
				</em>
				, the respondent land developer filed a §1983 suit in federal court alleging a regulatory takings claim after a regional planning commission disapproved respondents plat proposals, but before respondent appealed that decision to the zoning board of appeals.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 181182.  Rather than reaching the merits, we found the claim was brought prematurely.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 200.  We first held that the claim was not ripe until the government entity charged with implementing the regulations [had] reached a final decision regarding the application of the regulations to the property at issue.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 186.  Because respondent failed to seek variances from the planning commission or the zoning board of appeals, we decided that respondent had failed to meet the final-decision requirement.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 187191.  We then noted a second reason the taking claim [was] not yet ripe: respondent did not seek compensation through the procedures the State [had] provided for doing so.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 194.  Until the claimant had received a final denial of compensation through all available state procedures, such as by an inverse condemnation action, we said he could not claim a violation of the Just Compensation Clause.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 195196.

				It is not clear to me that 
				<em>
					Williamson County
				</em>
				 was correct in demanding that, once a government entity has reached a final decision with respect to a claimants property, the claimant must seek compensation in state court before bringing a federal takings claim in federal court.  The Court in
				<em>
					 Williamson County
				</em>
				 purported to interpret the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> in divining this state-litigation requirement.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 194, n. 13 (The nature of the constitutional right . . . requires that a property owner utilize procedures for obtaining compensation before bringing a §1983 action).  More recently, we have referred to it as merely a prudential requirement.  
				<em>

				<em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">733</a>734 (1997)
.  It is not obvious that either constitutional or prudential principles require claimants to utilize all state compensation procedures before they can bring a federal takings claim.  Cf.

				The Court today attempts to shore up the state-litigation requirement by referring to

				 v.

            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/454/100" class="subref" title="subref">454 U. S. 100</a> (1981)

				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 2223.  There, we held that the principle of comity (reflected in the Tax Injunction Act, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1341.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1341</a>) bars taxpayers from asserting §1983 claims against the validity of state tax systems in federal courts.  454 U. S., at 116.  Our decision that such suits must be brought in state court was driven by the unique and sensitive interests at stake when federal courts confront claims that States acted impermissibly in administering their own tax systems.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 102103, 107113.  Those historically grounded, federalism-based concerns had led to a longstanding, fundamental principle of comity between federal courts and state governments . . . , particularly in the area of state taxation, a principle which predated the enactment of §1983 itself.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 103, 107114.  We decided that those interests favored requiring that taxpayers bring challenges to the validity of state tax systems in state court, despite the strong interests favoring federal- court review of alleged constitutional violations by state officials.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 115116.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court today makes no claim that any such longstanding principle of comity toward state courts in handling federal takings claims existed at the time 
				<em>
					Williamson County
				</em>
				 was decided, nor that one has since developed.  The Court does remark, however, that state courts are more familiar with the issues involved in local land-use and zoning regulations, and it suggests that this makes it proper to relegate federal takings claims to state court.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 23.  But it is not apparent that any such expertise matches the type of historically grounded, federalism-based interests we found necessary to our decision in 
				<em>
					Fair Assessment
				</em>
				.  In any event, the Court has not explained why we should hand authority over federal takings claims to state courts, based simply on their relative familiarity with local land-use decisions and proceedings, while allowing plaintiffs to proceed directly to federal court in cases involving, for example, challenges to municipal land-use regulations based on the

				Finally, 
				<em>
					Williamson County
				</em>
				s state-litigation rule has created some real anomalies, justifying our revisiting the issue.  For example, our holding today ensures that litigants who go to state court to seek compensation will likely be unable later to assert their federal takings claims in federal court.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 22.  And, even if preclusion law would not block a litigants claim, the 
				<em>
					Rooker
				</em>
				-
				<em>
					Feldman
				</em>
				 doctrine might, insofar as 
				<em>
					Williamson County
				</em>
				 can be read to characterize the state courts denial of compensation as a required element of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> takings claim.  See 
				<em>
					Exxon Mobil Corp.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Saudi Basic Industries Corp.
				</em>
				, 544 U. S. ___ (2005).  As the Court recognizes, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 22, 
				<em>
					Williamson
				</em>
            <em>
					County
				</em>
				 all but guarantees that claimants will be unable to utilize the federal courts to enforce the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a>s just compensation guarantee.  The basic principle that state courts are competent to enforce federal rights and to adjudicate federal takings claims is sound, see 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 23, and would apply to any number of federal claims.  Cf. 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2254.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2254</a> (providing for limited federal habeas review of state-court adjudications of alleged violations of the Constitution).  But that principle does not explain why federal takings claims in particular should be singled out to be confined to state court, in the absence of any asserted justification or congressional directive.

				I joined the opinion of the Court in 
				<em>

				</em>
				.  But further reflection and experience lead me to think that the justifications for its state-litigation requirement are suspect, while its impact on takings plaintiffs is dramatic.  Here, no court below has addressed the correctness of 
				<em>
					Williamson County
				</em>
				, neither party has asked us to reconsider it, and resolving the issue could not benefit petitioners.  In an appropriate case, I believe the Court should reconsider whether plaintiffs asserting a

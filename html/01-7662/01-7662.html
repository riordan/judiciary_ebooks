				When Dallas County prosecutors used peremptory strikes to exclude 10 of the 11 African-Americans eligible to serve on the jury at petitioners capital murder trial, he moved to strike the jury on the ground that the exclusions violated equal protection.  Petitioner presented extensive evidence supporting his motion at a pretrial hearing, but the trial judge denied relief, finding no evidence indicating a systematic exclusion of blacks, as was required by the then-controlling precedent, 
				<em>
					Swain
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Alabama,

            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/380/202" class="subref" title="subref">380 U. S. 202</a>.  Subsequently, the jury found petitioner guilty, and he was sentenced to death.  While his appeal was pending, this Court established, in 
				<em>

				 v. 
				<em>
					Kentucky,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/476/79" class="subref" title="subref">476 U. S. 79</a>, a three-part process for evaluating equal protection claims such as petitioners.  Upon remand from the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals for new findings in light of 
				<em>
					Batson,
				</em>
				 the original trial court held a hearing at which it admitted all the 
				<em>
					Swain
				</em>
				 hearing evidence and took further evidence, but concluded that petitioner failed to satisfy step one of 
				<em>
					Batson
				</em>
				 because the evidence did not even raise an inference of racial motivation in the States use of peremptory challenges.  The court also determined that the State would have prevailed on steps two and three because the prosecutors had proffered credible, race-neutral explanations for the African-Americans excluded
				<em>
					i.e.,
				</em>
				 their reluctance to assess, or reservations concerning, imposition of the death penaltysuch that petitioner could not prove purposeful discrimination.  After petitioners direct appeal and state habeas petitions were denied, he filed a federal habeas petition under 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2254.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2254</a>, raising a 
				<em>
					Batson
				</em>
				 claim and other issues.  The Federal District Court denied relief in deference to the state courts acceptance of the prosecutors race-neutral justifications for striking the potential jurors, and subsequently denied petitioners §2253 application for a certificate of appealability (COA).  The Fifth Circuit noted that a COA will issue only if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right, §2253(c)(2); reasoned that a petitioner must make such a substantial showing under the standard set forth in 
				<em>
					Slack
				</em>
				 v.

				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/529/473" class="subref" title="subref">529 U. S. 473</a>; declared that §2254(d)(2) required it to presume state-court findings correct unless it determined that the findings would result in a decision which was unreasonable in light of clear and convincing evidence; and applied this framework to deny petitioner a COA.  
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				
				    
				Petitioners extensive evidence concerning the jury selection procedures falls into two broad categories.  First, he presented, at the pretrial 
				<em>
					Swain
				</em>
				 hearing, testimony and other evidence relating to a pattern and practice of race discrimination in the 
				<em>
					voir dire
				</em>
				 by the Dallas County District Attorneys Office, including a 1976 policy by that office to exclude minorities from jury service that was available at least to one of petitioners prosecutors.  Second, two years later, petitioner presented, to the same state trial court, evidence that directly related to the prosecutors conduct in his case, including a comparative analysis of the venire members demonstrating that African-Americans were excluded from petitioners jury in a ratio significantly higher than Caucasians; evidence that, during 
				<em>
					voir dire
				</em>
				, the prosecution questioned venire members in a racially disparate fashion as to their death penalty views, their willingness to serve on a capital case, and their willingness to impose the minimum sentence for murder, and that responses disclosing reluctance or hesitation to impose capital punishment or a minimum sentence were cited as a justification for striking potential jurors; and the prosecutions use of a Texas criminal procedure practice known as jury shuffling to assure that white venire members were selected in preference to African-Americans.

            <em>
					Held: 
				</em>
				The Fifth Circuit should have issued a COA to review the District Courts denial of habeas relief to petitioner.  Pp. 1124.
			</p>
        <p class="SYLCTF">
				
				    
				(a) Before a prisoner seeking postconviction relief under §2254 may appeal a district courts denial or dismissal of the petition, he must first seek and obtain a COA from a circuit justice or judge, §2253.  This is a jurisdictional prerequisite.  A COA will issue only if §2253s requirements have been satisfied.  When a habeas applicant seeks a COA, the court of appeals should limit its examination to a threshold inquiry into the underlying merit of his claims.  
				<em>
					E.g., Slack, 
				</em>
				529 U. S., at 481.  This inquiry does not require full consideration of the factual or legal bases supporting the claims.  Consistent with this Courts precedent and the statutory text, the prisoner need only demonstrate a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.  §2253(c)(2).  He satisfies this standard by demonstrating that jurists of reason could disagree with the district courts resolution of his case or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.  
				<em>
					E.g., id.
				</em>
				, at 484.  He need not convince a judge, or, for that matter, three judges, that he will prevail, but must demonstrate that reasonable jurists would find the district courts assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong, 
				<em>
					ibid.
				</em>
				  Pp. 1113.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				(b) Since petitioners claim rests on a 
				<em>
					Batson
				</em>
				 violation, resolution of his COA application requires a preliminary, though not definitive, consideration of the three-step 
				<em>
					Batson 
				</em>
				framework.  The State now concedes that petitioner satisfied step one, and petitioner acknowledges that the State proceeded through step two by proffering facially race-neutral explanations for these strikes.  The critical question in determining whether a prisoner has proved purposeful discrimination at step three is the persuasiveness of the prosecutors justification for his peremptory strike.  
				<em>
					E.g., Purkett
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Elem,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/514/765" class="subref" title="subref">514 U. S. 765</a>
            <em>
					(per curiam).  
				</em>
				The issue comes down to whether the trial court finds the prosecutors race-neutral explanations to be credible.  Credibility can be measured by, among other factors, the prosecutors demeanor; by how reasonable, or how improbable, the explanations are; and by whether the proffered rationale has some basis in accepted trial strategy.  A plurality of this Court has concluded in the direct review context that a state courts finding of the absence of discriminatory intent is a pure issue of fact that is accorded significant deference and will not be overturned unless clearly erroneous.  
				<em>
					Hernandez
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					New York,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/500/352" class="subref" title="subref">500 U. S. 352</a>.  Where 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2254.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2254</a> applies, the Courts habeas jurisprudence embodies this deference.  Factual determinations by state courts are presumed correct absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, §2254(e)(1), and a decision adjudicated on the merits in a state court and based on a factual determination will not be overturned on factual grounds unless objectively unreasonable in light of the evidence presented in the state-court proceeding, §2254(d)(2).  Even in the context of federal habeas, deference does not imply abandonment or abdication of judicial review.  In the context of the threshold examination in this 
				<em>
					Batson
				</em>
				 claim, it can suffice to support the issuance of a COA to adduce evidence demonstrating that, despite the neutral explanation of the prosecution, the peremptory strikes in the final analysis were race based.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Reeves
				</em>
				 v.
				<em>
					 Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc.
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/530/133" class="subref" title="subref">530 U. S. 133</a>.  Pp. 1316.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				(c) On review of the record at this stage, this Court concludes that the District Court did not give full consideration to the substantial evidence petitioner put forth in support of the prima facie case.  Instead, it accepted without question the state courts evaluation of the demeanor of the prosecutors and jurors in petitioners trial.  The Fifth Circuit evaluated petitioners COA application in the same way.  In ruling that petitioners claim lacked sufficient merit to justify appellate proceedings, that court recited the requirements for granting a writ under §2254, which it interpreted as requiring petitioner to prove that the state-court decision was objectively unreasonable by clear and convincing evidence.  
				    
				This was too demanding a standard because it incorrectly merged the clear and convincing evidence standard of §2254(e)(1), which pertains only to state-court determinations of factual issues, rather than decisions, and the unreasonableness requirement of §2254(d)(2), which relates to the state-court decision and applies to the granting of habeas relief.  More fundamentally, the court was incorrect in not inquiring whether a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right had been proved, as §2253(c)(2) requires.  The question is the debatability of the underlying constitutional claim, not the resolution of that debate.  In this case, debate as to whether the prosecution acted with a race-based reason when striking prospective jurors was raised by the statistical evidence demonstrating that 91% of the eligible African-Americans were excluded from petitioners venire; by the fact that the state trial court had no occasion to judge the credibility of the prosecutors contemporaneous race-neutral justifications at the time of the pretrial hearing because the Courts equal protection jurisprudence then, dictated by 
				<em>
					Swain
				</em>
				, did not require it; by the fact that three of the States proffered race-neutral rationales for striking African Americansambivalence about the death penalty, hesitancy to vote to execute defendants capable of being rehabilitated, and the jurors own family history of criminalitypertained just as well to some white jurors who were not challenged and who did serve on the jury; by the evidence of the States use of racially disparate questioning; and by the state courts failure to consider the evidence as to the prosecutions use of the jury shuffle and the historical evidence of racial discrimination by the Dallas County District Attorneys Office.

				I join the Courts opinion, but write separately for two reasons: First, to explain why I believe the Courts willingness to consider the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996s (AEDPA) limits on habeas relief in deciding whether to issue a certificate of appealablity (COA) is in accord with the text of 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2253.html#c" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2253(c)</a>.  Second, to discuss some of the evidence on the States side of the casewhich, though inadequate (as the Court holds) to make the absence of a claimed violation of

				 v. 
				<em>

				Many Court of Appeals decisions have denied applications for a COA only after concluding that the applicant was not entitled to habeas relief on the meritswithout even analyzing whether the applicant had made a substantial showing of a denial of a constitutional right.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>

				<em>

                </sup>
            </a>
				  The Court today disapproves this approach, which improperly resolves the merits of the appeal during the COA stage.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 6, 1113.  Less clear from the Courts opinion, however, is why a circuit justice or judge, in deciding whether to issue a COA, must look 
				<em>
					to the District Courts application of AEDPA
				</em>
				 to [a habeas petitioners] constitutional claims and ask whether 
				<em>
					that resolution
				</em>
				 was debatable amongst jurists of reason.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 1112 (emphasis added).  How the district court applied AEDPA has nothing to do with whether a COA applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right, as required by 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2253.html#c_2" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2253(c)(2)</a>, so the AEDPA standard should seemingly have no role in the COA inquiry.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Section 2253(c)(2), however, provides that [a] certificate of appealability 
				<em>
					may
				</em>
            <em>
					issue
				</em>
				 . . . 
				<em>
					only if
				</em>
				 the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.  (Emphasis added).  A substantial showing 
				<em>
					does not entitle
				</em>
				 an applicant to a COA; it is a necessary and not a sufficient condition.  Nothing in the text of §2253(c)(2) prohibits a circuit justice or judge from imposing additional requirements, and one such additional requirement has been approved by this Court.  See 
				<em>
					Slack
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>

 (holding that a habeas petitioner seeking to appeal a district courts denial of habeas relief on procedural grounds must not only make a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right but 
				<em>
					also
				</em>
				 must demonstrate that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court today imposes another additional requirement: a circuit justice or judge must deny a COA, even when the habeas petitioner has made a substantial showing that his constitutional rights were violated, if all reasonable jurists would conclude that a substantive provision of the federal habeas statute bars relief.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 12.  To give an example, suppose a state prisoner presents a constitutional claim that reasonable jurists might find debatable, but is unable to find any clearly established Supreme Court precedent in support of that claim (which was previously rejected on the merits in state-court proceedings).  Under the Courts view, a COA must be denied, 
				<em>
					even if
				</em>
				 the habeas petitioner satisfies the substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right requirement of §2253(c)(2), because all reasonable jurists would agree that habeas relief is impossible to obtain under §2254(d).  This approach is consonant with 
				<em>
					Slack
				</em>
				, in accord with the COAs purpose of preventing meritless habeas appeals, and compatible with the text of §2253(c), which does not make the substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right a sufficient condition for a COA.

				<em>

				Petitioner maintains that the following six African-American jurors were victims of racially motivated peremptory strikes: Edwin Rand, Wayman Kennedy, Roderick Bozeman, Billy Jean Fields, Joe Warren, and Carrol Boggess.  As to each of them, the State proffered race-neutral explanations for its peremptory challenge.  Five were challenged primarily because of their views on imposing the death penalty (Rand, Kennedy, Bozeman, Warren, and Boggess), and one (Fields) was challenged because (among other reasons) his brother had been convicted of drug offenses and served time in prison.  By asserting race-neutral reasons for the challenges, the State satisfied step two of

 (per curiam).  Unless petitioner can make a substantial showing that (
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, a showing that reasonable jurists could debate whether) the State fraudulently recited these explanations as pretext for race discrimination, he has not satisfied the requirement of §2253(c)(2).  Moreover, because the state court entered a finding of fact that the prosecutions purported reasons for exercising its peremptory challenges were not pretextual, App. 878, a COA should not issue unless that finding can reasonably be thought to be contradicted by clear and convincing evidence.  See §2254(e)(1) ([A] determination of a factual issue made by a State court shall be presumed to be correct.  The applicant shall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence).

				The weakness in petitioners 
				<em>
					Batson
				</em>
				 claims stems from his difficulty in identifying any unchallenged white venireman similarly situated to the six aforementioned African-American veniremen.  Although petitioner claims that two white veniremen, Sandra Hearn and Marie Mazza, expressed views about the death penalty as ambivalent as those expressed by Rand, Kennedy, Bozeman, Warren, and Boggess, the 
				<em>
					voir dire
				</em>
				 transcripts do not clearly bear that out.  Although Hearn initially stated that she thought the death penalty was inappropriate for first-time offenders, she also said, I do not see any reason why I couldnt sit on a jury when youre imposing a death penalty.  App. 694.  She further stated that someone who was an extreme child abuser deserved the death penalty, whether or not it was a first-time offense.  Reply Brief for Petitioner 14a.  Hearn also made pro-prosecution statements about her distaste for criminal defendants use of psychiatric testimony to establish incompetency.

At most, petitioner has shown that one of these African-American veniremen (Rand) may have been no more ambivalent about the death penalty than white jurors Hearn and Mazza.  That perhaps would have been enough to permit the state trial court, deciding the issue 
				<em>

				 after observing the demeanor of the prosecutors and the disputed jurors, to find a 
				<em>

But in a federal habeas case, where a state court has previously entered factfindings that the six African-American jurors were not challenged because of their race, petitioner must provide clear and convincing evidence that the state court erred, and, when requesting a COA, must demonstrate that jurists of reason could debate whether this standard was satisfied.

				I join the Courts opinion, but write separately for two reasons: First, to explain why I believe the Courts willingness to consider the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996s (AEDPA) limits on habeas relief in deciding whether to issue a certificate of appealablity (COA) is in accord with the text of 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2253.html#c" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2253(c)</a>.  Second, to discuss some of the evidence on the States side of the casewhich, though inadequate (as the Court holds) to make the absence of a claimed violation of

				Many Court of Appeals decisions have denied applications for a COA only after concluding that the applicant was not entitled to habeas relief on the meritswithout even analyzing whether the applicant had made a substantial showing of a denial of a constitutional right.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 
				<em>

				 v. 
				<em>

            </a>
				  The Court today disapproves this approach, which improperly resolves the merits of the appeal during the COA stage.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 6, 1113.  Less clear from the Courts opinion, however, is why a circuit justice or judge, in deciding whether to issue a COA, must look 
				<em>
					to the District Courts application of AEDPA
				</em>
				 to [a habeas petitioners] constitutional claims and ask whether 
				<em>
					that resolution
				</em>
				 was debatable amongst jurists of reason.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 1112 (emphasis added).  How the district court applied AEDPA has nothing to do with whether a COA applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right, as required by 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2253.html#c_2" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2253(c)(2)</a>, so the AEDPA standard should seemingly have no role in the COA inquiry.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Section 2253(c)(2), however, provides that [a] certificate of appealability 
				<em>
					may
				</em>
            <em>
					issue
				</em>
				 . . . 
				<em>
					only if
				</em>
				 the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.  (Emphasis added).  A substantial showing 
				<em>
					does not entitle
				</em>
				 an applicant to a COA; it is a necessary and not a sufficient condition.  Nothing in the text of §2253(c)(2) prohibits a circuit justice or judge from imposing additional requirements, and one such additional requirement has been approved by this Court.  See 
				<em>
					Slack

				 v. 
				<em>

				 must demonstrate that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court today imposes another additional requirement: a circuit justice or judge must deny a COA, even when the habeas petitioner has made a substantial showing that his constitutional rights were violated, if all reasonable jurists would conclude that a substantive provision of the federal habeas statute bars relief.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 12.  To give an example, suppose a state prisoner presents a constitutional claim that reasonable jurists might find debatable, but is unable to find any clearly established Supreme Court precedent in support of that claim (which was previously rejected on the merits in state-court proceedings).  Under the Courts view, a COA must be denied, 
				<em>
					even if
				</em>
				 the habeas petitioner satisfies the substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right requirement of §2253(c)(2), because all reasonable jurists would agree that habeas relief is impossible to obtain under §2254(d).  This approach is consonant with 
				<em>
					Slack
				</em>
				, in accord with the COAs purpose of preventing meritless habeas appeals, and compatible with the text of §2253(c), which does not make the substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right a sufficient condition for a COA.

				In applying the Courts COA standard to petitioners case, we must ask whether petitioner has made a substantial showing of a 
				<em>
					Batson

				 violation and also whether reasonable jurists could debate petitioners ability to obtain habeas relief in light of AEDPA.  The facts surrounding petitioners 
				<em>
					Batson
				</em>
				 claims, when viewed in light of §2254(e)(1)s requirement that state-court factual determinations can be overcome only by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, reveal this to be a close, rather than a clear, case for the granting of a COA.

				Petitioner maintains that the following six African-American jurors were victims of racially motivated peremptory strikes: Edwin Rand, Wayman Kennedy, Roderick Bozeman, Billy Jean Fields, Joe Warren, and Carrol Boggess.  As to each of them, the State proffered race-neutral explanations for its peremptory challenge.  Five were challenged primarily because of their views on imposing the death penalty (Rand, Kennedy, Bozeman, Warren, and Boggess), and one (Fields) was challenged because (among other reasons) his brother had been convicted of drug offenses and served time in prison.  By asserting race-neutral reasons for the challenges, the State satisfied step two of 
				<em>
					Batson
				</em>
				.  See 
				<em>

				<em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">767</a>768 (1995)
 (per curiam).  Unless petitioner can make a substantial showing that (
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, a showing that reasonable jurists could debate whether) the State fraudulently recited these explanations as pretext for race discrimination, he has not satisfied the requirement of §2253(c)(2).  Moreover, because the state court entered a finding of fact that the prosecutions purported reasons for exercising its peremptory challenges were not pretextual, App. 878, a COA should not issue unless that finding can reasonably be thought to be contradicted by clear and convincing evidence.  See §2254(e)(1) ([A] determination of a factual issue made by a State court shall be presumed to be correct.  The applicant shall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence).

				The weakness in petitioners 
				<em>
					Batson
				</em>
				 claims stems from his difficulty in identifying any unchallenged white venireman similarly situated to the six aforementioned African-American veniremen.  Although petitioner claims that two white veniremen, Sandra Hearn and Marie Mazza, expressed views about the death penalty as ambivalent as those expressed by Rand, Kennedy, Bozeman, Warren, and Boggess, the 
				<em>
					voir dire
				</em>
				 transcripts do not clearly bear that out.  Although Hearn initially stated that she thought the death penalty was inappropriate for first-time offenders, she also said, I do not see any reason why I couldnt sit on a jury when youre imposing a death penalty.  App. 694.  She further stated that someone who was an extreme child abuser deserved the death penalty, whether or not it was a first-time offense.  Reply Brief for Petitioner 14a.  Hearn also made pro-prosecution statements about her distaste for criminal defendants use of psychiatric testimony to establish incompetency.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 17a.  As for Mazza, her stated views on the death penalty were as follows: Its kind of hard determining somebodys life, whether they live or die, but I feel that is something that is accepted in our courts now and it is something thata decision that I think I could make one way or the other.  App. 519.

As to each of them, the State proffered race-neutral explanations for its peremptory challenge.  Five were challenged primarily because of their views on imposing the death penalty (Rand, Kennedy, Bozeman, Warren, and Boggess), and one (Fields) was challenged because (among other reasons) his brother had been convicted of drug offenses and served time in prison.

				The weakness in petitioners 
				<em>
					Batson
				</em>
				 claims stems from his difficulty in identifying any unchallenged white venireman similarly situated to the six aforementioned African-American veniremen.  Although petitioner claims that two white veniremen, Sandra Hearn and Marie Mazza, expressed views about the death penalty as ambivalent as those expressed by Rand, Kennedy, Bozeman, Warren, and Boggess, the 
				<em>
					voir dire
				</em>
				 transcripts do not clearly bear that out.  Although Hearn initially stated that she thought the death penalty was inappropriate for first-time offenders, she also said, I do not see any reason why I couldnt sit on a jury when youre imposing a death penalty.  App. 694.  She further stated that someone who was an extreme child abuser deserved the death penalty, whether or not it was a first-time offense.  Reply Brief for Petitioner 14a.  Hearn also made pro-prosecution statements about her distaste for criminal defendants use of psychiatric testimony to establish incompetency.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 17a.  As for Mazza, her stated views on the death penalty were as follows: Its kind of hard determining somebodys life, whether they live or die, but I feel that is something that is accepted in our courts now and it is something thata decision that I think I could make one way or the other.  App. 519.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Compare those statements with the sentiments expressed by the challenged African-American veniremen.  Kennedy supported the death penalty only in cases of mass murder.  Normally I wouldnt say on just the average murder caseI would say no, not the death sentence.  
				<em>
					Id.

				<em>

				, at 79.  When asked by the prosecutors whether repeated criminal violent conduct would indicate that a person was beyond rehabilitation, Bozeman replied, No, not really.

				].  Sometimes you have mixed feelings about things like that.  
				<em>

				<em>

				<em>

				<em>

				.  Rand is a closer case.  His most ambivalent statement was Can I do this?  You know, right now I say I can, but tomorrow I might not.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 161.  Later on Rand did say that he could impose the death penalty as a juror.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 162164.  But Hearn and Mazza (the white jurors who were seated) also said that they could sit on a jury that imposed the death penalty.  At most, petitioner has shown that one of these African-American veniremen (Rand) may have been no more ambivalent about the death penalty than white jurors Hearn and Mazza.  That perhaps would have been enough to permit the state trial court, deciding the issue 
				<em>
					de novo
				</em>
				 after observing the demeanor of the prosecutors and the disputed jurors, to find a 
				<em>
					Batson
				</em>
				 violation.  But in a federal habeas case, where a state court has previously entered factfindings that the six African-American jurors were not challenged because of their race, petitioner must provide clear and convincing evidence that the state court erred, and, when requesting a COA, must demonstrate that jurists of reason could debate whether this standard was satisfied.

				I join the Courts opinion, but write separately for two reasons: First, to explain why I believe the Courts willingness to consider the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996s (AEDPA) limits on habeas relief in deciding whether to issue a certificate of appealablity (COA) is in accord with the text of 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2253.html#c" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2253(c)</a>.  Second, to discuss some of the evidence on the States side of the casewhich, though inadequate (as the Court holds) to make the absence of a claimed violation of

				I join the Courts opinion, but write separately for two reasons: First, to explain why I believe the Courts willingness to consider the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996s (AEDPA) limits on habeas relief in deciding whether to issue a certificate of appealablity (COA) is in accord with the text of 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2253.html#c" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2253(c)</a>.  Second, to discuss some of the evidence on the States side of the casewhich, though inadequate (as the Court holds) to make the absence of a claimed violation of

				Many Court of Appeals decisions have denied applications for a COA only after concluding that the applicant was not entitled to habeas relief on the meritswithout even analyzing whether the applicant had made a substantial showing of a denial of a constitutional right.  See,

				<em>

				<em>

Under the Courts view, a COA must be denied, 
				<em>

				</em>
				 the habeas petitioner satisfies the substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right requirement of §2253(c)(2), because all reasonable jurists would agree that habeas relief is impossible to obtain under §2254(d).  This approach is consonant with

				In applying the Courts COA standard to petitioners case, we must ask whether petitioner has made a substantial showing of a

				<em>

				Petitioner maintains that the following six African-American jurors were victims of racially motivated peremptory strikes: Edwin Rand, Wayman Kennedy, Roderick Bozeman, Billy Jean Fields, Joe Warren, and Carrol Boggess.  As to each of them, the State proffered race-neutral explanations for its peremptory challenge.  Five were challenged primarily because of their views on imposing the death penalty (Rand, Kennedy, Bozeman, Warren, and Boggess), and one (Fields) was challenged because (among other reasons) his brother had been convicted of drug offenses and served time in prison.  By asserting race-neutral reasons for the challenges, the State satisfied step two of

 (per curiam).  Unless petitioner can make a substantial showing that (
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, a showing that reasonable jurists could debate whether) the State fraudulently recited these explanations as pretext for race discrimination, he has not satisfied the requirement of §2253(c)(2).  Moreover, because the state court entered a finding of fact that the prosecutions purported reasons for exercising its peremptory challenges were not pretextual, App. 878, a COA should not issue unless that finding can reasonably be thought to be contradicted by clear and convincing evidence.  See §2254(e)(1) ([A] determination of a factual issue made by a State court shall be presumed to be correct.  The applicant shall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence).

				The weakness in petitioners 
				<em>
					Batson
				</em>
				 claims stems from his difficulty in identifying any unchallenged white venireman similarly situated to the six aforementioned African-American veniremen.  Although petitioner claims that two white veniremen, Sandra Hearn and Marie Mazza, expressed views about the death penalty as ambivalent as those expressed by Rand, Kennedy, Bozeman, Warren, and Boggess, the 
				<em>
					voir dire
				</em>
				 transcripts do not clearly bear that out.  Although Hearn initially stated that she thought the death penalty was inappropriate for first-time offenders, she also said, I do not see any reason why I couldnt sit on a jury when youre imposing a death penalty.  App. 694.  She further stated that someone who was an extreme child abuser deserved the death penalty, whether or not it was a first-time offense.  Reply Brief for Petitioner 14a.  Hearn also made pro-prosecution statements about her distaste for criminal defendants use of psychiatric testimony to establish incompetency.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 17a.  As for Mazza, her stated views on the death penalty were as follows: Its kind of hard determining somebodys life, whether they live or die, but I feel that is something that is accepted in our courts now and it is something thata decision that I think I could make one way or the other.  App. 519.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Compare those statements with the sentiments expressed by the challenged African-American veniremen.  Kennedy supported the death penalty only in cases of mass murder.  Normally I wouldnt say on just the average murder caseI would say no, not the death sentence.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 216.  Bozeman supported the death penalty only if theres no possible way to rehabilitate a person . . . I would say somebody mentally disturbed or something like that or say a Manson type or something like that.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 79.  When asked by the prosecutors whether repeated criminal violent conduct would indicate that a person was beyond rehabilitation, Bozeman replied, No, not really.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 79.  Warren refused to give any clear answer regarding his views on the death penalty despite numerous questions from the prosecutors.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 139140 (Well, there again, it goes back to the situation, you know, sometimes); 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 140.  When asked whether the death penalty accomplishes anything, Warren answered, Yes and no.  Sometimes I think it does and sometimes I think it dont [
				<em>
					sic
				</em>
				].  Sometimes you have mixed feelings about things like that.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  When asked, What do you think it accomplishes when you feel it does?, Warren replied, I dont know.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  Boggess referred to the death penalty as murder, 
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 197, and said, whether or not I could actually go through with murderwith killing another person or taking another persons life, I just dont know.  Id have trouble with that, 
				<em>
					ibid
				</em>
				.  Rand is a closer case.  His most ambivalent statement was Can I do this?  You know, right now I say I can, but tomorrow I might not.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 161.  Later on Rand did say that he could impose the death penalty as a juror.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 162164.  But Hearn and Mazza (the white jurors who were seated) also said that they could sit on a jury that imposed the death penalty.  At most, petitioner has shown that one of these African-American veniremen (Rand) may have been no more ambivalent about the death penalty than white jurors Hearn and Mazza.  That perhaps would have been enough to permit the state trial court, deciding the issue 
				<em>
					de novo
				</em>
				 after observing the demeanor of the prosecutors and the disputed jurors, to find a 
				<em>
					Batson
				</em>
				 violation.  But in a federal habeas case, where a state court has previously entered factfindings that the six African-American jurors were not challenged because of their race, petitioner must provide clear and convincing evidence that the state court erred, and, when requesting a COA, must demonstrate that jurists of reason could debate whether this standard was satisfied.

However, his brother had several drug convictions and had served time in prison.  App. 124.

Moreover, because the state court entered a finding of fact that the prosecutions purported reasons for exercising its peremptory challenges were not pretextual, App. 878, a COA should not issue unless that finding can reasonably be thought to be contradicted by clear and convincing evidence.  See §2254(e)(1) ([A] determination of a factual issue made by a State court shall be presumed to be correct.

				The weakness in petitioners 
				<em>
					Batson
				</em>
				 claims stems from his difficulty in identifying any unchallenged white venireman similarly situated to the six aforementioned African-American veniremen.  Although petitioner claims that two white veniremen, Sandra Hearn and Marie Mazza, expressed views about the death penalty as ambivalent as those expressed by Rand, Kennedy, Bozeman, Warren, and Boggess, the 
				<em>
					voir dire
				</em>
				 transcripts do not clearly bear that out.  Although Hearn initially stated that she thought the death penalty was inappropriate for first-time offenders, she also said, I do not see any reason why I couldnt sit on a jury when youre imposing a death penalty.  App. 694.  She further stated that someone who was an extreme child abuser deserved the death penalty, whether or not it was a first-time offense.  Reply Brief for Petitioner 14a.  Hearn also made pro-prosecution statements about her distaste for criminal defendants use of psychiatric testimony to establish incompetency.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 17a.  As for Mazza, her stated views on the death penalty were as follows: Its kind of hard determining somebodys life, whether they live or die, but I feel that is something that is accepted in our courts now and it is something thata decision that I think I could make one way or the other.  App. 519.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Compare those statements with the sentiments expressed by the challenged African-American veniremen.  Kennedy supported the death penalty only in cases of mass murder.  Normally I wouldnt say on just the average murder caseI would say no, not the death sentence.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 216.  Bozeman supported the death penalty only if theres no possible way to rehabilitate a person . . . I would say somebody mentally disturbed or something like that or say a Manson type or something like that.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 79.  When asked by the prosecutors whether repeated criminal violent conduct would indicate that a person was beyond rehabilitation, Bozeman replied, No, not really.  
				<em>
					Id.

				, at 79.  Warren refused to give any clear answer regarding his views on the death penalty despite numerous questions from the prosecutors.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 139140 (Well, there again, it goes back to the situation, you know, sometimes); 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 140.  When asked whether the death penalty accomplishes anything, Warren answered, Yes and no.  Sometimes I think it does and sometimes I think it dont [
				<em>

				</em>
				].  Sometimes you have mixed feelings about things like that.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  When asked, What do you think it accomplishes when you feel it does?, Warren replied, I dont know.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  Boggess referred to the death penalty as murder, 
				<em>
					Id.

				, at 197, and said, whether or not I could actually go through with murderwith killing another person or taking another persons life, I just dont know.  Id have trouble with that, 
				<em>

				</em>
				.  Rand is a closer case.  His most ambivalent statement was Can I do this?  You know, right now I say I can, but tomorrow I might not.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 161.  Later on Rand did say that he could impose the death penalty as a juror.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 162164.  But Hearn and Mazza (the white jurors who were seated) also said that they could sit on a jury that imposed the death penalty.  At most, petitioner has shown that one of these African-American veniremen (Rand) may have been no more ambivalent about the death penalty than white jurors Hearn and Mazza.  That perhaps would have been enough to permit the state trial court, deciding the issue 
				<em>
					de novo
				</em>
				 after observing the demeanor of the prosecutors and the disputed jurors, to find a 
				<em>
					Batson
				</em>
				 violation.  But in a federal habeas case, where a state court has previously entered factfindings that the six African-American jurors were not challenged because of their race, petitioner must provide clear and convincing evidence that the state court erred, and, when requesting a COA, must demonstrate that jurists of reason could debate whether this standard was satisfied.

				I join the Courts opinion, but write separately for two reasons: First, to explain why I believe the Courts willingness to consider the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996s (AEDPA) limits on habeas relief in deciding whether to issue a certificate of appealablity (COA) is in accord with the text of 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2253.html#c" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2253(c)</a>.  Second, to discuss some of the evidence on the States side of the casewhich, though inadequate (as the Court holds) to make the absence of a claimed violation of

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/476/79" class="subref" title="subref">476 U. S. 79</a> (1986)

				Many Court of Appeals decisions have denied applications for a COA only after concluding that the applicant was not entitled to habeas relief on the meritswithout even analyzing whether the applicant had made a substantial showing of a denial of a constitutional right.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Kasi
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Angelone
				</em>
				, 300 F. 3d 487 (CA4 2002); 
				<em>
					Wheat

				 v. 
				<em>

				, 238 F. 3d 357 (CA5 2000).*

                <sup>
                    <b>
					*
				</b>
                </sup>
            </a>
				  The Court today disapproves this approach, which improperly resolves the merits of the appeal during the COA stage.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 6, 1113.  Less clear from the Courts opinion, however, is why a circuit justice or judge, in deciding whether to issue a COA, must look 
				<em>
					to the District Courts application of AEDPA
				</em>
				 to [a habeas petitioners] constitutional claims and ask whether 
				<em>
					that resolution
				</em>
				 was debatable amongst jurists of reason.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 1112 (emphasis added).  How the district court applied AEDPA has nothing to do with whether a COA applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right, as required by 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2253.html#c_2" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2253(c)(2)</a>, so the AEDPA standard should seemingly have no role in the COA inquiry.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Section 2253(c)(2), however, provides that [a] certificate of appealability 
				<em>
					may
				</em>
            <em>
					issue
				</em>
				 . . . 
				<em>
					only if
				</em>
				 the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.  (Emphasis added).  A substantial showing 
				<em>
					does not entitle
				</em>
				 an applicant to a COA; it is a necessary and not a sufficient condition.  Nothing in the text of §2253(c)(2) prohibits a circuit justice or judge from imposing additional requirements, and one such additional requirement has been approved by this Court.  See 
				<em>
					Slack
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					McDaniel
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/529/473" class="subref" title="subref">529 U. S. 473</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">484</a> (2000)
 (holding that a habeas petitioner seeking to appeal a district courts denial of habeas relief on procedural grounds must not only make a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right but 
				<em>
					also
				</em>
				 must demonstrate that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court today imposes another additional requirement: a circuit justice or judge must deny a COA, even when the habeas petitioner has made a substantial showing that his constitutional rights were violated, if all reasonable jurists would conclude that a substantive provision of the federal habeas statute bars relief.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 12.  To give an example, suppose a state prisoner presents a constitutional claim that reasonable jurists might find debatable, but is unable to find any clearly established Supreme Court precedent in support of that claim (which was previously rejected on the merits in state-court proceedings).  Under the Courts view, a COA must be denied, 
				<em>
					even if
				</em>
				 the habeas petitioner satisfies the substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right requirement of §2253(c)(2), because all reasonable jurists would agree that habeas relief is impossible to obtain under §2254(d).  This approach is consonant with 
				<em>
					Slack
				</em>
				, in accord with the COAs purpose of preventing meritless habeas appeals, and compatible with the text of §2253(c), which does not make the substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right a sufficient condition for a COA.

				In applying the Courts COA standard to petitioners case, we must ask whether petitioner has made a substantial showing of a 
				<em>
					Batson

				 violation and also whether reasonable jurists could debate petitioners ability to obtain habeas relief in light of AEDPA.  The facts surrounding petitioners 
				<em>
					Batson
				</em>
				 claims, when viewed in light of §2254(e)(1)s requirement that state-court factual determinations can be overcome only by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, reveal this to be a close, rather than a clear, case for the granting of a COA.

				Petitioner maintains that the following six African-American jurors were victims of racially motivated peremptory strikes: Edwin Rand, Wayman Kennedy, Roderick Bozeman, Billy Jean Fields, Joe Warren, and Carrol Boggess.  As to each of them, the State proffered race-neutral explanations for its peremptory challenge.  Five were challenged primarily because of their views on imposing the death penalty (Rand, Kennedy, Bozeman, Warren, and Boggess), and one (Fields) was challenged because (among other reasons) his brother had been convicted of drug offenses and served time in prison.  By asserting race-neutral reasons for the challenges, the State satisfied step two of

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">767</a>768 (1995)
 (per curiam).  Unless petitioner can make a substantial showing that (
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, a showing that reasonable jurists could debate whether) the State fraudulently recited these explanations as pretext for race discrimination, he has not satisfied the requirement of §2253(c)(2).  Moreover, because the state court entered a finding of fact that the prosecutions purported reasons for exercising its peremptory challenges were not pretextual, App. 878, a COA should not issue unless that finding can reasonably be thought to be contradicted by clear and convincing evidence.  See §2254(e)(1) ([A] determination of a factual issue made by a State court shall be presumed to be correct.

				Petitioner maintains that the following six African-American jurors were victims of racially motivated peremptory strikes: Edwin Rand, Wayman Kennedy, Roderick Bozeman, Billy Jean Fields, Joe Warren, and Carrol Boggess.  As to each of them, the State proffered race-neutral explanations for its peremptory challenge.  Five were challenged primarily because of their views on imposing the death penalty (Rand, Kennedy, Bozeman, Warren, and Boggess), and one (Fields) was challenged because (among other reasons) his brother had been convicted of drug offenses and served time in prison.  By asserting race-neutral reasons for the challenges, the State satisfied step two of

				<em>

Moreover, because the state court entered a finding of fact that the prosecutions purported reasons for exercising its peremptory challenges were not pretextual, App. 878, a COA should not issue unless that finding can reasonably be thought to be contradicted by clear and convincing evidence.  See §2254(e)(1) ([A] determination of a factual issue made by a State court shall be presumed to be correct.

				The weakness in petitioners 
				<em>
					Batson
				</em>
				 claims stems from his difficulty in identifying any unchallenged white venireman similarly situated to the six aforementioned African-American veniremen.  Although petitioner claims that two white veniremen, Sandra Hearn and Marie Mazza, expressed views about the death penalty as ambivalent as those expressed by Rand, Kennedy, Bozeman, Warren, and Boggess, the 
				<em>
					voir dire
				</em>
				 transcripts do not clearly bear that out.  Although Hearn initially stated that she thought the death penalty was inappropriate for first-time offenders, she also said, I do not see any reason why I couldnt sit on a jury when youre imposing a death penalty.  App. 694.  She further stated that someone who was an extreme child abuser deserved the death penalty, whether or not it was a first-time offense.  Reply Brief for Petitioner 14a.  Hearn also made pro-prosecution statements about her distaste for criminal defendants use of psychiatric testimony to establish incompetency.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 17a.  As for Mazza, her stated views on the death penalty were as follows: Its kind of hard determining somebodys life, whether they live or die, but I feel that is something that is accepted in our courts now and it is something thata decision that I think I could make one way or the other.  App. 519.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Compare those statements with the sentiments expressed by the challenged African-American veniremen.  Kennedy supported the death penalty only in cases of mass murder.  Normally I wouldnt say on just the average murder caseI would say no, not the death sentence.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 216.  Bozeman supported the death penalty only if theres no possible way to rehabilitate a person . . . I would say somebody mentally disturbed or something like that or say a Manson type or something like that.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 79.  When asked by the prosecutors whether repeated criminal violent conduct would indicate that a person was beyond rehabilitation, Bozeman replied, No, not really.  
				<em>
					Id.

				, at 79.  Warren refused to give any clear answer regarding his views on the death penalty despite numerous questions from the prosecutors.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 139140 (Well, there again, it goes back to the situation, you know, sometimes); 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 140.  When asked whether the death penalty accomplishes anything, Warren answered, Yes and no.  Sometimes I think it does and sometimes I think it dont [
				<em>

				</em>
				].  Sometimes you have mixed feelings about things like that.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  When asked, What do you think it accomplishes when you feel it does?, Warren replied, I dont know.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  Boggess referred to the death penalty as murder, 
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 197, and said, whether or not I could actually go through with murderwith killing another person or taking another persons life, I just dont know.  Id have trouble with that, 
				<em>

				</em>
				.  Rand is a closer case.  His most ambivalent statement was Can I do this?  You know, right now I say I can, but tomorrow I might not.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 161.  Later on Rand did say that he could impose the death penalty as a juror.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 162164.  But Hearn and Mazza (the white jurors who were seated) also said that they could sit on a jury that imposed the death penalty.  At most, petitioner has shown that one of these African-American veniremen (Rand) may have been no more ambivalent about the death penalty than white jurors Hearn and Mazza.  That perhaps would have been enough to permit the state trial court, deciding the issue 
				<em>
					de novo
				</em>
				 after observing the demeanor of the prosecutors and the disputed jurors, to find a 
				<em>
					Batson
				</em>
				 violation.  But in a federal habeas case, where a state court has previously entered factfindings that the six African-American jurors were not challenged because of their race, petitioner must provide clear and convincing evidence that the state court erred, and, when requesting a COA, must demonstrate that jurists of reason could debate whether this standard was satisfied.

				Fields, the sixth African-American venireman who petitioner claims was challenged because of his race, supported capital punishment.  However, his brother had several drug convictions and had served time in prison.  App. 124.

				I join the Courts opinion, but write separately for two reasons: First, to explain why I believe the Courts willingness to consider the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996s (AEDPA) limits on habeas relief in deciding whether to issue a certificate of appealablity (COA) is in accord with the text of 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2253.html#c" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2253(c)</a>.  Second, to discuss some of the evidence on the States side of the casewhich, though inadequate (as the Court holds) to make the absence of a claimed violation of

				I join the Courts opinion, but write separately for two reasons: First, to explain why I believe the Courts willingness to consider the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996s (AEDPA) limits on habeas relief in deciding whether to issue a certificate of appealablity (COA) is in accord with the text of

				Many Court of Appeals decisions have denied applications for a COA only after concluding that the applicant was not entitled to habeas relief on the meritswithout even analyzing whether the applicant had made a substantial showing of a denial of a constitutional right.  See,

				  The Court today disapproves this approach, which improperly resolves the merits of the appeal during the COA stage.  
				<em>

				</em>
				 to [a habeas petitioners] constitutional claims and ask whether 
				<em>

Under the Courts view, a COA must be denied, 
				<em>
					even if
				</em>
				 the habeas petitioner satisfies the substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right requirement of §2253(c)(2), because all reasonable jurists would agree that habeas relief is impossible to obtain under §2254(d).  This approach is consonant with

				In applying the Courts COA standard to petitioners case, we must ask whether petitioner has made a substantial showing of a

				<em>

				Petitioner maintains that the following six African-American jurors were victims of racially motivated peremptory strikes: Edwin Rand, Wayman Kennedy, Roderick Bozeman, Billy Jean Fields, Joe Warren, and Carrol Boggess.  As to each of them, the State proffered race-neutral explanations for its peremptory challenge.  Five were challenged primarily because of their views on imposing the death penalty (Rand, Kennedy, Bozeman, Warren, and Boggess), and one (Fields) was challenged because (among other reasons) his brother had been convicted of drug offenses and served time in prison.  By asserting race-neutral reasons for the challenges, the State satisfied step two of 
				<em>

				.  See

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">767</a>768 (1995)
 (per curiam).  Unless petitioner can make a substantial showing that (
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, a showing that reasonable jurists could debate whether) the State fraudulently recited these explanations as pretext for race discrimination, he has not satisfied the requirement of §2253(c)(2).  Moreover, because the state court entered a finding of fact that the prosecutions purported reasons for exercising its peremptory challenges were not pretextual, App. 878, a COA should not issue unless that finding can reasonably be thought to be contradicted by clear and convincing evidence.  See §2254(e)(1) ([A] determination of a factual issue made by a State court shall be presumed to be correct.  The applicant shall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence).

				The weakness in petitioners 
				<em>
					Batson
				</em>
				 claims stems from his difficulty in identifying any unchallenged white venireman similarly situated to the six aforementioned African-American veniremen.  Although petitioner claims that two white veniremen, Sandra Hearn and Marie Mazza, expressed views about the death penalty as ambivalent as those expressed by Rand, Kennedy, Bozeman, Warren, and Boggess, the 
				<em>
					voir dire
				</em>
				 transcripts do not clearly bear that out.  Although Hearn initially stated that she thought the death penalty was inappropriate for first-time offenders, she also said, I do not see any reason why I couldnt sit on a jury when youre imposing a death penalty.  App. 694.  She further stated that someone who was an extreme child abuser deserved the death penalty, whether or not it was a first-time offense.  Reply Brief for Petitioner 14a.  Hearn also made pro-prosecution statements about her distaste for criminal defendants use of psychiatric testimony to establish incompetency.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 17a.  As for Mazza, her stated views on the death penalty were as follows: Its kind of hard determining somebodys life, whether they live or die, but I feel that is something that is accepted in our courts now and it is something thata decision that I think I could make one way or the other.  App. 519.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Compare those statements with the sentiments expressed by the challenged African-American veniremen.  Kennedy supported the death penalty only in cases of mass murder.  Normally I wouldnt say on just the average murder caseI would say no, not the death sentence.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 216.  Bozeman supported the death penalty only if theres no possible way to rehabilitate a person . . . I would say somebody mentally disturbed or something like that or say a Manson type or something like that.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 79.  When asked by the prosecutors whether repeated criminal violent conduct would indicate that a person was beyond rehabilitation, Bozeman replied, No, not really.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 79.  Warren refused to give any clear answer regarding his views on the death penalty despite numerous questions from the prosecutors.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 139140 (Well, there again, it goes back to the situation, you know, sometimes); 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 140.  When asked whether the death penalty accomplishes anything, Warren answered, Yes and no.  Sometimes I think it does and sometimes I think it dont [
				<em>
					sic
				</em>
				].  Sometimes you have mixed feelings about things like that.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  When asked, What do you think it accomplishes when you feel it does?, Warren replied, I dont know.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  Boggess referred to the death penalty as murder, 
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 197, and said, whether or not I could actually go through with murderwith killing another person or taking another persons life, I just dont know.  Id have trouble with that, 
				<em>
					ibid
				</em>
				.  Rand is a closer case.  His most ambivalent statement was Can I do this?  You know, right now I say I can, but tomorrow I might not.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 161.  Later on Rand did say that he could impose the death penalty as a juror.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 162164.  But Hearn and Mazza (the white jurors who were seated) also said that they could sit on a jury that imposed the death penalty.  At most, petitioner has shown that one of these African-American veniremen (Rand) may have been no more ambivalent about the death penalty than white jurors Hearn and Mazza.  That perhaps would have been enough to permit the state trial court, deciding the issue 
				<em>
					de novo
				</em>
				 after observing the demeanor of the prosecutors and the disputed jurors, to find a 
				<em>
					Batson
				</em>
				 violation.  But in a federal habeas case, where a state court has previously entered factfindings that the six African-American jurors were not challenged because of their race, petitioner must provide clear and convincing evidence that the state court erred, and, when requesting a COA, must demonstrate that jurists of reason could debate whether this standard was satisfied.

				Petitioner maintains that the following six African-American jurors were victims of racially motivated peremptory strikes: Edwin Rand, Wayman Kennedy, Roderick Bozeman, Billy Jean Fields, Joe Warren, and Carrol Boggess.  As to each of them, the State proffered race-neutral explanations for its peremptory challenge.  Five were challenged primarily because of their views on imposing the death penalty (Rand, Kennedy, Bozeman, Warren, and Boggess), and one (Fields) was challenged because (among other reasons) his brother had been convicted of drug offenses and served time in prison.  By asserting race-neutral reasons for the challenges, the State satisfied step two of

Moreover, because the state court entered a finding of fact that the prosecutions purported reasons for exercising its peremptory challenges were not pretextual, App. 878, a COA should not issue unless that finding can reasonably be thought to be contradicted by clear and convincing evidence.  See §2254(e)(1) ([A] determination of a factual issue made by a State court shall be presumed to be correct.  The applicant shall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence).

				The weakness in petitioners 
				<em>
					Batson
				</em>
				 claims stems from his difficulty in identifying any unchallenged white venireman similarly situated to the six aforementioned African-American veniremen.  Although petitioner claims that two white veniremen, Sandra Hearn and Marie Mazza, expressed views about the death penalty as ambivalent as those expressed by Rand, Kennedy, Bozeman, Warren, and Boggess, the 
				<em>
					voir dire
				</em>
				 transcripts do not clearly bear that out.  Although Hearn initially stated that she thought the death penalty was inappropriate for first-time offenders, she also said, I do not see any reason why I couldnt sit on a jury when youre imposing a death penalty.  App. 694.  She further stated that someone who was an extreme child abuser deserved the death penalty, whether or not it was a first-time offense.  Reply Brief for Petitioner 14a.  Hearn also made pro-prosecution statements about her distaste for criminal defendants use of psychiatric testimony to establish incompetency.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 17a.  As for Mazza, her stated views on the death penalty were as follows: Its kind of hard determining somebodys life, whether they live or die, but I feel that is something that is accepted in our courts now and it is something thata decision that I think I could make one way or the other.  App. 519.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Compare those statements with the sentiments expressed by the challenged African-American veniremen.  Kennedy supported the death penalty only in cases of mass murder.  Normally I wouldnt say on just the average murder caseI would say no, not the death sentence.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 216.  Bozeman supported the death penalty only if theres no possible way to rehabilitate a person . . . I would say somebody mentally disturbed or something like that or say a Manson type or something like that.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 79.  When asked by the prosecutors whether repeated criminal violent conduct would indicate that a person was beyond rehabilitation, Bozeman replied, No, not really.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 79.  Warren refused to give any clear answer regarding his views on the death penalty despite numerous questions from the prosecutors.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 139140 (Well, there again, it goes back to the situation, you know, sometimes); 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 140.  When asked whether the death penalty accomplishes anything, Warren answered, Yes and no.  Sometimes I think it does and sometimes I think it dont [
				<em>
					sic
				</em>
				].  Sometimes you have mixed feelings about things like that.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  When asked, What do you think it accomplishes when you feel it does?, Warren replied, I dont know.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  Boggess referred to the death penalty as murder, 
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 197, and said, whether or not I could actually go through with murderwith killing another person or taking another persons life, I just dont know.  Id have trouble with that, 
				<em>
					ibid
				</em>
				.  Rand is a closer case.  His most ambivalent statement was Can I do this?  You know, right now I say I can, but tomorrow I might not.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 161.  Later on Rand did say that he could impose the death penalty as a juror.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 162164.  But Hearn and Mazza (the white jurors who were seated) also said that they could sit on a jury that imposed the death penalty.  At most, petitioner has shown that one of these African-American veniremen (Rand) may have been no more ambivalent about the death penalty than white jurors Hearn and Mazza.  That perhaps would have been enough to permit the state trial court, deciding the issue 
				<em>
					de novo
				</em>
				 after observing the demeanor of the prosecutors and the disputed jurors, to find a 
				<em>
					Batson
				</em>
				 violation.  But in a federal habeas case, where a state court has previously entered factfindings that the six African-American jurors were not challenged because of their race, petitioner must provide clear and convincing evidence that the state court erred, and, when requesting a COA, must demonstrate that jurists of reason could debate whether this standard was satisfied.

				Fields, the sixth African-American venireman who petitioner claims was challenged because of his race, supported capital punishment.  However, his brother had several drug convictions and had served time in prison.  App. 124.

				I join the Courts opinion, but write separately for two reasons: First, to explain why I believe the Courts willingness to consider the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996s (AEDPA) limits on habeas relief in deciding whether to issue a certificate of appealablity (COA) is in accord with the text of 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2253.html#c" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2253(c)</a>.  Second, to discuss some of the evidence on the States side of the casewhich, though inadequate (as the Court holds) to make the absence of a claimed violation of

				 v. 
				<em>

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/476/79" class="subref" title="subref">476 U. S. 79</a> (1986)

				Many Court of Appeals decisions have denied applications for a COA only after concluding that the applicant was not entitled to habeas relief on the meritswithout even analyzing whether the applicant had made a substantial showing of a denial of a constitutional right.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Kasi
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Angelone
				</em>
				, 300 F. 3d 487 (CA4 2002); 
				<em>

				 v. 
				<em>

                </sup>
            </a>
				  The Court today disapproves this approach, which improperly resolves the merits of the appeal during the COA stage.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 6, 1113.  Less clear from the Courts opinion, however, is why a circuit justice or judge, in deciding whether to issue a COA, must look 
				<em>
					to the District Courts application of AEDPA
				</em>
				 to [a habeas petitioners] constitutional claims and ask whether 
				<em>
					that resolution
				</em>
				 was debatable amongst jurists of reason.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 1112 (emphasis added).  How the district court applied AEDPA has nothing to do with whether a COA applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right, as required by 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2253.html#c_2" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2253(c)(2)</a>, so the AEDPA standard should seemingly have no role in the COA inquiry.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Section 2253(c)(2), however, provides that [a] certificate of appealability 
				<em>
					may
				</em>
            <em>
					issue
				</em>
				 . . . 
				<em>
					only if
				</em>
				 the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.  (Emphasis added).  A substantial showing 
				<em>
					does not entitle
				</em>
				 an applicant to a COA; it is a necessary and not a sufficient condition.  Nothing in the text of §2253(c)(2) prohibits a circuit justice or judge from imposing additional requirements, and one such additional requirement has been approved by this Court.  See 
				<em>
					Slack
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					McDaniel

				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/529/473" class="subref" title="subref">529 U. S. 473</a>,

 (holding that a habeas petitioner seeking to appeal a district courts denial of habeas relief on procedural grounds must not only make a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right but 
				<em>
					also
				</em>
				 must demonstrate that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court today imposes another additional requirement: a circuit justice or judge must deny a COA, even when the habeas petitioner has made a substantial showing that his constitutional rights were violated, if all reasonable jurists would conclude that a substantive provision of the federal habeas statute bars relief.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 12.  To give an example, suppose a state prisoner presents a constitutional claim that reasonable jurists might find debatable, but is unable to find any clearly established Supreme Court precedent in support of that claim (which was previously rejected on the merits in state-court proceedings).  Under the Courts view, a COA must be denied, 
				<em>
					even if
				</em>
				 the habeas petitioner satisfies the substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right requirement of §2253(c)(2), because all reasonable jurists would agree that habeas relief is impossible to obtain under §2254(d).  This approach is consonant with 
				<em>
					Slack
				</em>
				, in accord with the COAs purpose of preventing meritless habeas appeals, and compatible with the text of §2253(c), which does not make the substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right a sufficient condition for a COA.

				The Court agrees, 
				<em>

				</em>
				, at 17, that the state courts finding at step three of 
				<em>
					Batson
				</em>
				 is a finding of fact ordinarily subject to §2254(e)(1)s presumption of correctness:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				In a proceeding instituted by an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court, a determination of a factual issue made by a State court shall be presumed to be correct.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
However, the Court implicitly rejects the obvious conclusion that the COA determination under §2253(c) is part of a proceeding instituted by an application for a writ of habeas corpus.  Instead of presuming the state courts factfindings to be correct, as §2254(e)(1) requires, the Court holds that petitioner need only show that reasonable jurists could disagree as to whether he can provide clear and convincing evidence that the finding was erroneous.

				Unlike the majority, I begin with the plain text of the statute that instructs federal courts how to treat state-court findings of fact.  At issue is what constitutes a proceeding for purposes of §2254(e)(1).  The word, proceeding, means [t]he regular and orderly progression of a lawsuit, including 
				<em>
					all acts and events between

The COA, standing alone, … does not assert a grievance against anyone, does not seek remedy or redress for any legal injury, and does not even require a party on the other side.  It is nothing more than a request for permission to seek review.

 (pre-Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) factual deference provision with virtually identical language applies to merits appeal).  The COA determination should be treated no differently, because §2254(e)(1) draws no distinction between the merits appeal and the COA.  The Courts silent conclusion to the contrary is simply illogical.  The COAs status as the jurisdictional prerequisite for the merits appeal requires that

				The Courts rejection of this conclusion also conflicts with pre-AEDPA practice.  Prior to AEDPA, access to a merits appeal in federal habeas corpus proceedings was governed by a mechanism similar to the COA, known as a certificate of probable cause, or CPC.  See 
				<em>
					Slack
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra,
				</em>
				 at 480.  There was also a standard of factual deference similar to, though weaker than, the standard in §2254(e)(1).  See

				  Under these provisions (indistinguishable from AEDPAs for these purposes), courts concluded that §2254(e)(1)s predecessor applied directly to the CPC proceeding, without any filtering through the debatability standard the Court has used in both the CPC and COA contexts.  See,

				, 953 F. 2d 167, 169 (CA5 1992).  These cases support the straightforward notion that §2254(e)(1), like its predecessor did with respect to CPC proceedings, applies directly to the COA proceeding.

				The Courts decision in

            <em>

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Unlike an appellate courts review of district court findings of fact for clear error, §2254(e)(1) establishes a presumption of correctness.  It requires that the federal habeas court assume the state court that entered the findings was the best placed factfinder with the most complete record and 
				<em>
					only then 
				</em>
				ask whether the petitioner can refute that factual finding by clear and convincing evidence.  Procedural imperfections ordinarily will not affect this presumption; thus, it does not matter whether the state judge made his decision two years late or with a less-than-perfect record.  Admittedly these conditions might increase the 
				<em>
					odds
				</em>
				 that a habeas applicant could locate helpful evidence, but to presume facts correct means a court cannot allow a habeas applicant to evade §2254(e)(1) by attacking the process employed by the state 
				<em>
					factfinder
				</em>
				 rather than the actual 
				<em>
					factfindings
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				This reading is confirmed by the changes worked by AEDPA.  Section 2254(e)(1) does not, as its predecessor did, create exceptions to factual deference for procedural infirmities.  For example, prior to AEDPA, a federal habeas court would not defer to state-court determinations of fact if the factfinding procedure employed by the State court was not adequate to afford a full and fair hearing, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2254.html#d_2" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(2)</a> (1994 ed.), the material facts were not adequately developed at the State court hearing, §2254(d)(3), or the applicant did not receive a full, fair, and adequate hearing, §2254(d)(6).  The removal of these exceptions forecloses the use of marginal procedural complaintssuch as a delay between 
				<em>
					voir dire
				</em>
				 and a 
				<em>
					Batson
				</em>
				 hearingto determine whether or how much a federal habeas court will defer to state-court factfinding.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Section 2254(e)(1) simply cannot be read to contain an implied sliding scale of deference.  I do not understand the Court to disagree with this view, however, as its dicta does not actually purport to interpret the text of §2254(e)(1).

				For the three challenged peremptory strikes used on Fields, Warren, and Boggess, petitioner has not even correctly alleged the existence of similarly situated white veniremen.  The majoritys discussion of this subject is misleading, stating that prosecutors explained that their peremptory challenges against six [black] potential jurors were based on ambivalence about the death penalty; hesitancy to vote to execute defendants capable of being rehabilitated; and the [veniremens] own family history of criminality.

Fields, Warren, and Boggess were struck for having family members with criminal histories.  Bozeman and Fields were struck for making pro-defense remarks about rehabilitation.

				The Courts treatment of this issue focuses on the apparent disparity in treatment of 10 black veniremen and 10 white veniremen who were supposedly similar in their opposition to the death penalty.

But the Court neglects to mention that the eight white veniremen who petitioner thinks should have received the graphic formulation, Reply Brief for Petitioner 15, n. 19, were so emphatically opposed to the death penalty that such a description would have served no purpose in clarifying their position on the issue.  No trial lawyer would willingly antagonize a potential juror ardently opposed to the death penalty with an extreme portrait of its implementation.  The strategy pursued by the prosecution makes perfect sense: When it was necessary to draw out a veniremans feelings about the death penalty they would use the graphic script, but when it was overkill they would not.
				    
				The record demonstrates that six of these eight white veniremen were so opposed to the death penalty that they were stricken for cause without the need for the prosecution to spend a peremptory challenge.

				I recognize that these

				 statements only indirectly support respondents explanation because the graphic script was typically given at the outset of 
				<em>

				</em>
				before the above quoted veniremen had the chance to give their stark answers.  Nevertheless, all available evidence supports respondents view that those who were unclear in their views on the death penalty
				<em>

				 received the graphic formulationand that those who were adamantly for 
				<em>
					or against
				</em>
				 the death penalty in their questionnaires did not.

				The jury forms at issue asked two questions directly relevant to the death penalty.  Question 56 asked Do you believe in the death penalty?, offered potential jurors the chance to circle yes or no, and then asked them to [p]lease explain your answer.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, Joint Lodging 44 (Boggess questionnaire).  Question 58 allowed potential jurors to circle yes or no in answering the following question: Do you have any moral, religious, or personal beliefs that would prevent you from returning a verdict which would ultimately result in the execution of another human being?  Ibid.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				First, as already noted, the deeper and clearer opposition to the death penalty on the part of the eight whites who did not receive the graphic script (but petitioner thinks should have) indirectly supports respondents contention that this opposition came out in their questionnaires (presumably by an answer of no to question 56 and an answer of yes to question 58).  But this is not the only evidence supporting respondents view.  Hinson, a white venireman who did not receive the graphic formulation, stated during voir dire
				 that he put on the form there that [he] didnt agree with [the death penalty] for both moral and religious reasons.  VDR 1648.  Similarly, Nelson, a white venireman not receiving the graphic formulation, stated on his questionnaire, I believe that the State does not have the right to take anyones life. 
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 625 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Fernando Guiterrez, a juror who received the graphic formulation, answered yes to question 56, but also yes to question 58, indicating he had moral, religious, or personal beliefs that would obstruct his voting for the death penalty despite the fact that he believed in it.  Joint Lodging 205.

				The prosecution treated the black veniremen no differently.  The blacks who did not receive the graphic formulation (whose questionnaires are contained in the record) 
				<em>
					all
				</em>
				 answered yes to question 56, stating they believed in the death penalty, and no to question 58, indicating that their beliefs wouldnt prevent them from imposing a death sentence.  See

				 believe in the death penalty but would have no personal objection to imposing it.  
				<em>

				.  It happened that, while not completely clear about it in the questionnaire (and hence receiving the graphic formulation), Woods was an enthusiastic supporter of the death penalty, and he was, in fact, seated on petitioners jury.  Further confirming respondents explanation, black veniremen Linda Baker, Janice Mackey, Paul Bailey, and Anna Keaton all gave unclear responses to questions 56 and 58 and all received the graphic formulation.  See Tr. of Pretrial Hearings in No. F8578660NL (5th Crim. Dist. Ct., Dallas County, Tex. (Def. Exh. 7).

				To sum up, the correlation between questionnaire answers and the use of the graphic script is far stronger than any correlation with race.  Sixteen veniremen clearly indicated on the questionnaires their feelings on the death penalty,

				Petitioner fares no better with his allegation that the prosecution employed two different scripts on the basis of race when asking questions about imposition of the minimum sentence.  Indeed, this disparate questioning argument is as flawed as the last one.  Respondent admits that the different questioning on minimum sentences was used as an effort to get veniremen the prosecution felt to be ambivalent about the death penalty dismissed for cause.  In making the decision whether to employ the manipulative minimum punishment script, prosecutors could rely on both the questionnaires and substantial 
				<em>
					voir dire
				</em>
				 testimony, as the minimum punishment questioning occurred much later in 
				<em>
					voir dire
				</em>
				 than the graphic formulation.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Seven black veniremen were given the allegedly manipulative minimum punishment script, all of whom were opposed to the death penalty in varying degrees.  Rand, Kennedy, Bozeman, Warren, and Boggess views on the death penalty have all been exhaustively discussed.  This leaves Baker and Fields.  Bakers views on the death penalty were so clearly ambivalent that she is not even the subject of petitioners 
				<em>
					Batson
				</em>
				 challenge.  And Fields family history of criminality and views on rehabilitation, as earlier discussed,
				<em>
					 supra,
				</em>
				 at 10, and n. 7, convinced the prosecution to use a peremptory strike.

            </a>
				  Finally, petitioners objection to the prosecutions decision not to use the manipulative punishment script on Woods, Reply Brief for Petitioner 17, n. 23, makes no sense.  Woods gave answers indicating he would be an excellent States jurorwhy would the prosecution have tried to eliminate him?  Of course, if petitioner were correct that the prosecution sought to eliminate blacks then one might expect that all methods, including the use of the manipulative script, would have been deployed against Woods, who happened to also be black.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				As with graphic questioning, respondents explanation goes unrebutted by petitioner.  Unless a venireman indicated he would be a poor States juror (using the criteria that respondent has identified here) 
				<em>
					and
				</em>
            <em>
					would not otherwise be struck for cause or by agreement
				</em>
				, there was no reason to use the manipulative script.  Thus, when petitioner points to the States failure to use its manipulative method with the vast majority of white veniremembers who expressed reservations about the death penalty, 
				<em>
					ibid.,
				</em>
				 he ignores the fact that of the 10 whites who expressed opposition to the death penalty, 8 were struck for cause or by agreement, 
				<em>
					meaning no manipulative script was necessary to get them removed

				Quite simply, petitioners arguments rest on circumstantial evidence and speculation that does not hold up to a thorough review of the record.  Far from rebutting §2254(e)(1)s presumption, petitioner has perhaps not even demonstrated that reasonable jurists could debate whether he has provided the requisite evidence of purposeful discriminationbut that is the majoritys inquiry, not mine.  Because petitioner has not demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that even one of the peremptory strikes at issue was the result of racial discrimination, I would affirm the denial of a COA.

						 The pre-AEDPA standard of factual deference provided:

						 I am puzzled by the majoritys willingness to hold against respondent the failure of prosecutors to testify at the post-trial Batson hearing.  Petitioner could easily have requested that the reasons for the allegedly unconstitutional peremptory strikes be given again, and did not.  The attorney representing the State at the post-trial Batson hearing made certain that both trial prosecutors were present to reiterate the reasons they gave in the record for striking the challenged black veniremen.  App. at 865.  Petitioners counsel explicitly refused the opportunity to do so when it was offered. Ibid.  Furthermore, I fail to understand why a move that resulted in a more efficient hearing without redundant testimony should redound to the benefit of petitioner, who bears the burden of proof in this federal habeas corpus proceeding.

						 I do, however, agree with the majority that the Courts decisions in Hernandez v. New York, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/500/352" class="subref" title="subref">500 U. S. 352</a> (1991)
, and Purkett v. Elem, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/514/765" class="subref" title="subref">514 U. S. 765</a> (1995)
 (per curiam), can be helpful in guiding a federal habeas court deciding a claim under Batson v. Kentucky, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/476/79" class="subref" title="subref">476 U. S. 79</a> (1986)
.  For instance, both cases confirm that Batson step three turns on an evaluation of the prosecutors proffered race-neutral justifications for the peremptory challenges at issue.  Purkett, supra, at 768769; Hernandez, 500 U. S., at 364365 (plurality opinion); id., at 372 (OConnor, J., concurring in judgment); see also Batson, supra, at 98, n. 21.  Additionally, because Hernandezs clear error standard is less demanding of a criminal defendant than §2254(e)(1) is of a habeas applicant, a federal habeas court can deny relief on §2254(e)(1) grounds if it determines it would do so when reviewing the same facts for clear error.  Cf. Marshall v. Lonberger, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/459/422" class="subref" title="subref">459 U. S. 422</a>,

						 Petitioner directs the Court to white veniremen Noad Vickery, Cheryl Davis, Chatta Nix, and Joan Weiner as having family members with criminal histories, but points to white veniremen Sandra Hearn and Marie Mazza as equally ambivalent about the death penalty.

						 Again petitioner points to Vickery, Davis, Nix, and Weiner for similar family histories.  Justice Scalia has shown that none of these four were in fact similarly situated to Fields with respect to this justification.  Ante, at 67 (concurring opinion).  Petitioner also alleges that Hearn made pro-defense remarks about rehabilitation similar to those made by Fields.  Again, no white venireman even allegedly fits both reasons given for striking Fields.  Furthermore, even if Fields had only been struck for his views on rehabilitation, those views were in no way equivalent to those expressed by Hearn.  Fields answered yes to the question whether he believed that everyone can be rehabilitated.  App. at 118.  Fields went on to say that [i]t may be far-fetched, but I feel like, if a person has the opportunity to really be talked about God and he commits himself, whereas he has committed this offense, then if he turns his life around, that is rehabilitation.  Ibid.  In contrast, Hearn stated that she believe[d] in the death penalty if a criminal cannot be rehabilitated.  Id., at 694.


Petitioner tries to muddy the waters by pointing out that Fields was, in other respects, a good States juror because he supported the death penalty.  Brief for Petitioner 2425.  However, that does not change the fact that Fields said that everyone could be rehabilitated (and thus might have been swayed by a penitent defendants testimony) and Hearn insisted that some people could not be rehabilitated.  In analyzing Batson claims the focus should not be on the reasonableness of the asserted nonracial motive … [but] rather [on] the genuineness of the motive.  Purkett, 514 U. S., at 769 (emphasis in original).

						 The prosecutions stated reasons for striking Bozeman were that he was ambivalent about the death penalty and that he made pro-defense remarks about rehabilitation.  This is one case where the prosecution gave multiple reasons for a strike and petitioner actually correctly alleged the existence of a similarly situated white venireman, Hearn.  Petitioner believes, albeit erroneously, see ante, at 46 (Scalia, J., concurring), that Hearn expressed similar ambivalence about the death penalty and made pro-defense remarks about rehabilitation.

Baker also did not answer question 58, writing undecided instead.  Mackey answered question 56 no, indicating she did not believe in the death penalty, and wrote Thou Shall Not Kill in the explanation space.  She then proceeded to answer question 58 no as well.

He then circled no in answering question 58.  Keaton circled no, indicating she did not believe in the death penalty, when she answered question 56, writing Its not for me to punished [sic] anyone.  However she then circled no in answering question 58, indicating that she did not have any objection to imposing the death penalty.

						 This analysis considers Hinson and Nelson as being clearly opposed to the death penalty in their questionnaires (answering question 56 no and question 58 yes) and Kennedy as being ambiguous (though in fact he answered question 56 yes and 58 no).  Even without these assumptions, 13 out of 15 veniremen who answered yes to question 56 and no to question 58indicating clear support for the death penaltydid not receive the graphic script.  And seven out of seven of those answering no and no or yes and yesindicating ambiguous or mixed feelings about the death penaltyor not answering clearly at all received the graphic script.  This yields an accuracy rate of 20 out of 22, or 91%.

 (pre-Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) factual deference provision with virtually identical language applies to merits appeal).  The COA determination should be treated no differently, because §2254(e)(1) draws no distinction between the merits appeal and the COA.  The Courts silent conclusion to the contrary is simply illogical.  The COAs status as the jurisdictional prerequisite for the merits appeal requires that

				The Courts rejection of this conclusion also conflicts with pre-AEDPA practice.  Prior to AEDPA, access to a merits appeal in federal habeas corpus proceedings was governed by a mechanism similar to the COA, known as a certificate of probable cause, or CPC.  See

				  Under these provisions (indistinguishable from AEDPAs for these purposes), courts concluded that §2254(e)(1)s predecessor applied directly to the CPC proceeding, without any filtering through the debatability standard the Court has used in both the CPC and COA contexts.  See,

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Unlike an appellate courts review of district court findings of fact for clear error, §2254(e)(1) establishes a presumption of correctness.  It requires that the federal habeas court assume the state court that entered the findings was the best placed factfinder with the most complete record and 
				<em>
					only then 
				</em>
				ask whether the petitioner can refute that factual finding by clear and convincing evidence.  Procedural imperfections ordinarily will not affect this presumption; thus, it does not matter whether the state judge made his decision two years late or with a less-than-perfect record.  Admittedly these conditions might increase the 
				<em>
					odds
				</em>
				 that a habeas applicant could locate helpful evidence, but to presume facts correct means a court cannot allow a habeas applicant to evade §2254(e)(1) by attacking the process employed by the state

				 rather than the actual 
				<em>
					factfindings
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				This reading is confirmed by the changes worked by AEDPA.  Section 2254(e)(1) does not, as its predecessor did, create exceptions to factual deference for procedural infirmities.  For example, prior to AEDPA, a federal habeas court would not defer to state-court determinations of fact if the factfinding procedure employed by the State court was not adequate to afford a full and fair hearing, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2254.html#d_2" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S.

The removal of these exceptions forecloses the use of marginal procedural complaintssuch as a delay between 
				<em>
					voir dire
				</em>
				 and a 
				<em>
					Batson

				 hearingto determine whether or how much a federal habeas court will defer to state-court factfinding.

Fields, Warren, and Boggess were struck for having family members with criminal histories.  Bozeman and Fields were struck for making pro-defense remarks about rehabilitation.

				The Courts treatment of this issue focuses on the apparent disparity in treatment of 10 black veniremen and 10 white veniremen who were supposedly similar in their opposition to the death penalty.

No trial lawyer would willingly antagonize a potential juror ardently opposed to the death penalty with an extreme portrait of its implementation.  The strategy pursued by the prosecution makes perfect sense: When it was necessary to draw out a veniremans feelings about the death penalty they would use the graphic script, but when it was overkill they would not.
				    
				The record demonstrates that six of these eight white veniremen were so opposed to the death penalty that they were stricken for cause without the need for the prosecution to spend a peremptory challenge.  For example, John Nelson wrote on his questionnaire, I believe that the State does not have the right to take anyones life, Tr. of Voir Dire in No. F8578668NL (5th Crim. Dist.

				The jury forms at issue asked two questions directly relevant to the death penalty.  Question 56 asked Do you believe in the death penalty?, offered potential jurors the chance to circle yes or no, and then asked them to [p]lease explain your answer.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, Joint Lodging 44 (Boggess questionnaire).  Question 58 allowed potential jurors to circle yes or no in answering the following question: Do you have any moral, religious, or personal beliefs that would prevent you from returning a verdict which would ultimately result in the execution of another human being?  Ibid.

				First, as already noted, the deeper and clearer opposition to the death penalty on the part of the eight whites who did not receive the graphic script (but petitioner thinks should have) indirectly supports respondents contention that this opposition came out in their questionnaires (presumably by an answer of no to question 56 and an answer of yes to question 58).  But this is not the only evidence supporting respondents view.  Hinson, a white venireman who did not receive the graphic formulation, stated during voir dire
				 that he put on the form there that [he] didnt agree with [the death penalty] for both moral and religious reasons.  VDR 1648.  Similarly, Nelson, a white venireman not receiving the graphic formulation, stated on his questionnaire, I believe that the State does not have the right to take anyones life. 
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 625 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Fernando Guiterrez, a juror who received the graphic formulation, answered yes to question 56, but also yes to question 58, indicating he had moral, religious, or personal beliefs that would obstruct his voting for the death penalty despite the fact that he believed in it.  Joint Lodging 205.

				The prosecution treated the black veniremen no differently.  The blacks who did not receive the graphic formulation (whose questionnaires are contained in the record) 
				<em>
					all
				</em>
				 answered yes to question 56, stating they believed in the death penalty, and no to question 58, indicating that their beliefs wouldnt prevent them from imposing a death sentence.  See

				 at 12 (Bozeman), 20 (Fields), 28 (Warren), 36 (Rand).  The black veniremen who 
				<em>

				.  It happened that, while not completely clear about it in the questionnaire (and hence receiving the graphic formulation), Woods was an enthusiastic supporter of the death penalty, and he was, in fact, seated on petitioners jury.  Further confirming respondents explanation, black veniremen Linda Baker, Janice Mackey, Paul Bailey, and Anna Keaton all gave unclear responses to questions 56 and 58 and all received the graphic formulation.  See Tr. of Pretrial Hearings in No. F8578660NL (5th Crim. Dist. Ct., Dallas County, Tex. (Def. Exh. 7).

				To sum up, the correlation between questionnaire answers and the use of the graphic script is far stronger than any correlation with race.  Sixteen veniremen clearly indicated on the questionnaires their feelings on the death penalty,

				Petitioner fares no better with his allegation that the prosecution employed two different scripts on the basis of race when asking questions about imposition of the minimum sentence.  Indeed, this disparate questioning argument is as flawed as the last one.  Respondent admits that the different questioning on minimum sentences was used as an effort to get veniremen the prosecution felt to be ambivalent about the death penalty dismissed for cause.  In making the decision whether to employ the manipulative minimum punishment script, prosecutors could rely on both the questionnaires and substantial 
				<em>
					voir dire
				</em>
				 testimony, as the minimum punishment questioning occurred much later in 
				<em>
					voir dire
				</em>
				 than the graphic formulation.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Seven black veniremen were given the allegedly manipulative minimum punishment script, all of whom were opposed to the death penalty in varying degrees.  Rand, Kennedy, Bozeman, Warren, and Boggess views on the death penalty have all been exhaustively discussed.  This leaves Baker and Fields.  Bakers views on the death penalty were so clearly ambivalent that she is not even the subject of petitioners 
				<em>
					Batson
				</em>
				 challenge.  And Fields family history of criminality and views on rehabilitation, as earlier discussed,
				<em>
					 supra,
				</em>
				 at 10, and n. 7, convinced the prosecution to use a peremptory strike.

            </a>
				  Finally, petitioners objection to the prosecutions decision not to use the manipulative punishment script on Woods, Reply Brief for Petitioner 17, n. 23, makes no sense.  Woods gave answers indicating he would be an excellent States jurorwhy would the prosecution have tried to eliminate him?  Of course, if petitioner were correct that the prosecution sought to eliminate blacks then one might expect that all methods, including the use of the manipulative script, would have been deployed against Woods, who happened to also be black.

				As with graphic questioning, respondents explanation goes unrebutted by petitioner.  Unless a venireman indicated he would be a poor States juror (using the criteria that respondent has identified here) 
				<em>
					and
				</em>
            <em>
					would not otherwise be struck for cause or by agreement

				<em>
					ibid.,
				</em>
				 he ignores the fact that of the 10 whites who expressed opposition to the death penalty, 8 were struck for cause or by agreement,

				Quite simply, petitioners arguments rest on circumstantial evidence and speculation that does not hold up to a thorough review of the record.  Far from rebutting §2254(e)(1)s presumption, petitioner has perhaps not even demonstrated that reasonable jurists could debate whether he has provided the requisite evidence of purposeful discriminationbut that is the majoritys inquiry, not mine.  Because petitioner has not demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that even one of the peremptory strikes at issue was the result of racial discrimination, I would affirm the denial of a COA.

						 I am puzzled by the majoritys willingness to hold against respondent the failure of prosecutors to testify at the post-trial Batson hearing.  Petitioner could easily have requested that the reasons for the allegedly unconstitutional peremptory strikes be given again, and did not.  The attorney representing the State at the post-trial Batson hearing made certain that both trial prosecutors were present to reiterate the reasons they gave in the record for striking the challenged black veniremen.  App. at 865.  Petitioners counsel explicitly refused the opportunity to do so when it was offered. Ibid.  Furthermore, I fail to understand why a move that resulted in a more efficient hearing without redundant testimony should redound to the benefit of petitioner, who bears the burden of proof in this federal habeas corpus proceeding.

						 I do, however, agree with the majority that the Courts decisions in Hernandez v. New York, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/500/352" class="subref" title="subref">500 U. S. 352</a> (1991)

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/514/765" class="subref" title="subref">514 U. S. 765</a> (1995)
 (per curiam), can be helpful in guiding a federal habeas court deciding a claim under Batson v. Kentucky, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/476/79" class="subref" title="subref">476 U. S. 79</a> (1986)
.  For instance, both cases confirm that Batson step three turns on an evaluation of the prosecutors proffered race-neutral justifications for the peremptory challenges at issue.  Purkett, supra, at 768769; Hernandez, 500 U. S., at 364365 (plurality opinion); id., at 372 (OConnor, J., concurring in judgment); see also Batson, supra, at 98, n. 21.  Additionally, because Hernandezs clear error standard is less demanding of a criminal defendant than §2254(e)(1) is of a habeas applicant, a federal habeas court can deny relief on §2254(e)(1) grounds if it determines it would do so when reviewing the same facts for clear error.  Cf. Marshall v. Lonberger, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/459/422" class="subref" title="subref">459 U. S. 422</a>,

						 Petitioner directs the Court to white veniremen Noad Vickery, Cheryl Davis, Chatta Nix, and Joan Weiner as having family members with criminal histories, but points to white veniremen Sandra Hearn and Marie Mazza as equally ambivalent about the death penalty.

						 Again petitioner points to Vickery, Davis, Nix, and Weiner for similar family histories.  Justice Scalia has shown that none of these four were in fact similarly situated to Fields with respect to this justification.  Ante, at 67 (concurring opinion).  Petitioner also alleges that Hearn made pro-defense remarks about rehabilitation similar to those made by Fields.  Again, no white venireman even allegedly fits both reasons given for striking Fields.  Furthermore, even if Fields had only been struck for his views on rehabilitation, those views were in no way equivalent to those expressed by Hearn.  Fields answered yes to the question whether he believed that everyone can be rehabilitated.  App. at 118.  Fields went on to say that [i]t may be far-fetched, but I feel like, if a person has the opportunity to really be talked about God and he commits himself, whereas he has committed this offense, then if he turns his life around, that is rehabilitation.  Ibid.  In contrast, Hearn stated that she believe[d] in the death penalty if a criminal cannot be rehabilitated.  Id., at 694.


Petitioner tries to muddy the waters by pointing out that Fields was, in other respects, a good States juror because he supported the death penalty.  Brief for Petitioner 2425.  However, that does not change the fact that Fields said that everyone could be rehabilitated (and thus might have been swayed by a penitent defendants testimony) and Hearn insisted that some people could not be rehabilitated.  In analyzing Batson claims the focus should not be on the reasonableness of the asserted nonracial motive … [but] rather [on] the genuineness of the motive.  Purkett, 514 U. S., at 769 (emphasis in original).

						 The prosecutions stated reasons for striking Bozeman were that he was ambivalent about the death penalty and that he made pro-defense remarks about rehabilitation.  This is one case where the prosecution gave multiple reasons for a strike and petitioner actually correctly alleged the existence of a similarly situated white venireman, Hearn.  Petitioner believes, albeit erroneously, see ante, at 46 (Scalia, J., concurring), that Hearn expressed similar ambivalence about the death penalty and made pro-defense remarks about rehabilitation.

Baker also did not answer question 58, writing undecided instead.  Mackey answered question 56 no, indicating she did not believe in the death penalty, and wrote Thou Shall Not Kill in the explanation space.

He then circled no in answering question 58.  Keaton circled no, indicating she did not believe in the death penalty, when she answered question 56, writing Its not for me to punished [sic] anyone.  However she then circled no in answering question 58, indicating that she did not have any objection to imposing the death penalty.

						 This analysis considers Hinson and Nelson as being clearly opposed to the death penalty in their questionnaires (answering question 56 no and question 58 yes) and Kennedy as being ambiguous (though in fact he answered question 56 yes and 58 no).  Even without these assumptions, 13 out of 15 veniremen who answered yes to question 56 and no to question 58indicating clear support for the death penaltydid not receive the graphic script.  And seven out of seven of those answering no and no or yes and yesindicating ambiguous or mixed feelings about the death penaltyor not answering clearly at all received the graphic script.

				Unpersuaded by petitioners claims, the state trial court found that there was no purposeful discrimination by the prosecut[ion] in the use of … peremptory strikes, App. 878.  This finding established that petitioner had failed to carry his burden at step three of the inquiry set out in

I cannot.  Because petitioner has not shown, by clear and convincing evidence, that any peremptory strikes of black veniremen were exercised because of race, he does not merit a certificate of appealability (COA).

				The Court agrees,

However, the Court implicitly rejects the obvious conclusion that the COA determination under §2253(c) is part of a proceeding instituted by an application for a writ of habeas corpus.  Instead of presuming the state courts factfindings to be correct, as §2254(e)(1) requires, the Court holds that petitioner need only show that reasonable jurists could disagree as to whether he can provide clear and convincing evidence that the finding was erroneous.

				Unlike the majority, I begin with the plain text of the statute that instructs federal courts how to treat state-court findings of fact.  At issue is what constitutes a proceeding for purposes of §2254(e)(1).  The word, proceeding, means [t]he regular and orderly progression of a lawsuit, including 
				<em>
					all acts and events between

 (pre-Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) factual deference provision with virtually identical language applies to merits appeal).  The COA determination should be treated no differently, because §2254(e)(1) draws no distinction between the merits appeal and the COA.  The Courts silent conclusion to the contrary is simply illogical.  The COAs status as the jurisdictional prerequisite for the merits appeal requires that 
				<em>

				The Courts rejection of this conclusion also conflicts with pre-AEDPA practice.  Prior to AEDPA, access to a merits appeal in federal habeas corpus proceedings was governed by a mechanism similar to the COA, known as a certificate of probable cause, or CPC.  See 
				<em>
					Slack
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra,
				</em>
				 at 480.  There was also a standard of factual deference similar to, though weaker than, the standard in §2254(e)(1).  See

				  Under these provisions (indistinguishable from AEDPAs for these purposes), courts concluded that §2254(e)(1)s predecessor applied directly to the CPC proceeding, without any filtering through the debatability standard the Court has used in both the CPC and COA contexts.  See,

				 this reasoning is in tension with the plain text of §2254(e)(1) and ignores changes wrought by AEDPA to the role of federal courts on collateral review.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Unlike an appellate courts review of district court findings of fact for clear error, §2254(e)(1) establishes a presumption of correctness.  It requires that the federal habeas court assume the state court that entered the findings was the best placed factfinder with the most complete record and 
				<em>
					only then 
				</em>
				ask whether the petitioner can refute that factual finding by clear and convincing evidence.  Procedural imperfections ordinarily will not affect this presumption; thus, it does not matter whether the state judge made his decision two years late or with a less-than-perfect record.  Admittedly these conditions might increase the 
				<em>
					odds
				</em>
				 that a habeas applicant could locate helpful evidence, but to presume facts correct means a court cannot allow a habeas applicant to evade §2254(e)(1) by attacking the process employed by the state 
				<em>
					factfinder
				</em>
				 rather than the actual 
				<em>
					factfindings
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				This reading is confirmed by the changes worked by AEDPA.  Section 2254(e)(1) does not, as its predecessor did, create exceptions to factual deference for procedural infirmities.  For example, prior to AEDPA, a federal habeas court would not defer to state-court determinations of fact if the factfinding procedure employed by the State court was not adequate to afford a full and fair hearing, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2254.html#d_2" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(2)</a> (1994 ed.), the material facts were not adequately developed at the State court hearing, §2254(d)(3), or the applicant did not receive a full, fair, and adequate hearing, §2254(d)(6).  The removal of these exceptions forecloses the use of marginal procedural complaintssuch as a delay between 
				<em>
					voir dire
				</em>
				 and a 
				<em>
					Batson
				</em>
				 hearingto determine whether or how much a federal habeas court will defer to state-court factfinding.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Section 2254(e)(1) simply cannot be read to contain an implied sliding scale of deference.  I do not understand the Court to disagree with this view, however, as its dicta does not actually purport to interpret the text of §2254(e)(1).

				For the three challenged peremptory strikes used on Fields, Warren, and Boggess, petitioner has not even correctly alleged the existence of similarly situated white veniremen.  The majoritys discussion of this subject is misleading, stating that prosecutors explained that their peremptory challenges against six [black] potential jurors were based on ambivalence about the death penalty; hesitancy to vote to execute defendants capable of being rehabilitated; and the [veniremens] own family history of criminality.

Fields, Warren, and Boggess were struck for having family members with criminal histories.  Bozeman and Fields were struck for making pro-defense remarks about rehabilitation.

				The Courts treatment of this issue focuses on the apparent disparity in treatment of 10 black veniremen and 10 white veniremen who were supposedly similar in their opposition to the death penalty.  The majority notes that only 2 out of these 10 whites got the graphic description while 7 out of 10 blacks did.

But the Court neglects to mention that the eight white veniremen who petitioner thinks should have received the graphic formulation, Reply Brief for Petitioner 15, n. 19, were so emphatically opposed to the death penalty that such a description would have served no purpose in clarifying their position on the issue.  No trial lawyer would willingly antagonize a potential juror ardently opposed to the death penalty with an extreme portrait of its implementation.  The strategy pursued by the prosecution makes perfect sense: When it was necessary to draw out a veniremans feelings about the death penalty they would use the graphic script, but when it was overkill they would not.
				    
				The record demonstrates that six of these eight white veniremen were so opposed to the death penalty that they were stricken for cause without the need for the prosecution to spend a peremptory challenge.  For example, John Nelson wrote on his questionnaire, I believe that the State does not have the right to take anyones life, Tr. of Voir Dire in No. F8578668NL (5th Crim. Dist.

				The jury forms at issue asked two questions directly relevant to the death penalty.  Question 56 asked Do you believe in the death penalty?, offered potential jurors the chance to circle yes or no, and then asked them to [p]lease explain your answer.  See, 
				<em>

				First, as already noted, the deeper and clearer opposition to the death penalty on the part of the eight whites who did not receive the graphic script (but petitioner thinks should have) indirectly supports respondents contention that this opposition came out in their questionnaires (presumably by an answer of no to question 56 and an answer of yes to question 58).  But this is not the only evidence supporting respondents view.  Hinson, a white venireman who did not receive the graphic formulation, stated during voir dire

Fernando Guiterrez, a juror who received the graphic formulation, answered yes to question 56, but also yes to question 58, indicating he had moral, religious, or personal beliefs that would obstruct his voting for the death penalty despite the fact that he believed in it.

It happened that, while not completely clear about it in the questionnaire (and hence receiving the graphic formulation), Woods was an enthusiastic supporter of the death penalty, and he was, in fact, seated on petitioners jury.  Further confirming respondents explanation, black veniremen Linda Baker, Janice Mackey, Paul Bailey, and Anna Keaton all gave unclear responses to questions 56 and 58 and all received the graphic formulation.

				To sum up, the correlation between questionnaire answers and the use of the graphic script is far stronger than any correlation with race.  Sixteen veniremen clearly indicated on the questionnaires their feelings on the death penalty,

				Petitioner fares no better with his allegation that the prosecution employed two different scripts on the basis of race when asking questions about imposition of the minimum sentence.  Indeed, this disparate questioning argument is as flawed as the last one.  Respondent admits that the different questioning on minimum sentences was used as an effort to get veniremen the prosecution felt to be ambivalent about the death penalty dismissed for cause.  In making the decision whether to employ the manipulative minimum punishment script, prosecutors could rely on both the questionnaires and substantial 
				<em>
					voir dire
				</em>
				 testimony, as the minimum punishment questioning occurred much later in 
				<em>
					voir dire
				</em>
				 than the graphic formulation.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Seven black veniremen were given the allegedly manipulative minimum punishment script, all of whom were opposed to the death penalty in varying degrees.  Rand, Kennedy, Bozeman, Warren, and Boggess views on the death penalty have all been exhaustively discussed.  This leaves Baker and Fields.  Bakers views on the death penalty were so clearly ambivalent that she is not even the subject of petitioners 
				<em>
					Batson
				</em>
				 challenge.  And Fields family history of criminality and views on rehabilitation, as earlier discussed,
				<em>
					 supra,
				</em>
				 at 10, and n. 7, convinced the prosecution to use a peremptory strike.

				  Finally, petitioners objection to the prosecutions decision not to use the manipulative punishment script on Woods, Reply Brief for Petitioner 17, n. 23, makes no sense.  Woods gave answers indicating he would be an excellent States jurorwhy would the prosecution have tried to eliminate him?  Of course, if petitioner were correct that the prosecution sought to eliminate blacks then one might expect that all methods, including the use of the manipulative script, would have been deployed against Woods, who happened to also be black.

				As with graphic questioning, respondents explanation goes unrebutted by petitioner.  Unless a venireman indicated he would be a poor States juror (using the criteria that respondent has identified here) 
				<em>
					and
				</em>
            <em>
					would not otherwise be struck for cause or by agreement

				<em>

				</em>
				 he ignores the fact that of the 10 whites who expressed opposition to the death penalty, 8 were struck for cause or by agreement,

				Quite simply, petitioners arguments rest on circumstantial evidence and speculation that does not hold up to a thorough review of the record.  Far from rebutting §2254(e)(1)s presumption, petitioner has perhaps not even demonstrated that reasonable jurists could debate whether he has provided the requisite evidence of purposeful discriminationbut that is the majoritys inquiry, not mine.  Because petitioner has not demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that even one of the peremptory strikes at issue was the result of racial discrimination, I would affirm the denial of a COA.

						 I am puzzled by the majoritys willingness to hold against respondent the failure of prosecutors to testify at the post-trial Batson hearing.  Petitioner could easily have requested that the reasons for the allegedly unconstitutional peremptory strikes be given again, and did not.  The attorney representing the State at the post-trial Batson hearing made certain that both trial prosecutors were present to reiterate the reasons they gave in the record for striking the challenged black veniremen.  App. at 865.  Petitioners counsel explicitly refused the opportunity to do so when it was offered. Ibid.  Furthermore, I fail to understand why a move that resulted in a more efficient hearing without redundant testimony should redound to the benefit of petitioner, who bears the burden of proof in this federal habeas corpus proceeding.

						 I do, however, agree with the majority that the Courts decisions in Hernandez v. New York, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/500/352" class="subref" title="subref">500 U. S. 352</a> (1991)

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/514/765" class="subref" title="subref">514 U. S. 765</a> (1995)
 (per curiam), can be helpful in guiding a federal habeas court deciding a claim under Batson v. Kentucky, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/476/79" class="subref" title="subref">476 U. S. 79</a> (1986)
.  For instance, both cases confirm that Batson step three turns on an evaluation of the prosecutors proffered race-neutral justifications for the peremptory challenges at issue.  Purkett, supra, at 768769; Hernandez, 500 U. S., at 364365 (plurality opinion); id., at 372 (OConnor, J., concurring in judgment); see also Batson, supra, at 98, n. 21.  Additionally, because Hernandezs clear error standard is less demanding of a criminal defendant than §2254(e)(1) is of a habeas applicant, a federal habeas court can deny relief on §2254(e)(1) grounds if it determines it would do so when reviewing the same facts for clear error.  Cf. Marshall v. Lonberger,

						 Petitioner directs the Court to white veniremen Noad Vickery, Cheryl Davis, Chatta Nix, and Joan Weiner as having family members with criminal histories, but points to white veniremen Sandra Hearn and Marie Mazza as equally ambivalent about the death penalty.

						 Again petitioner points to Vickery, Davis, Nix, and Weiner for similar family histories.  Justice Scalia has shown that none of these four were in fact similarly situated to Fields with respect to this justification.  Ante, at 67 (concurring opinion).  Petitioner also alleges that Hearn made pro-defense remarks about rehabilitation similar to those made by Fields.  Again, no white venireman even allegedly fits both reasons given for striking Fields.  Furthermore, even if Fields had only been struck for his views on rehabilitation, those views were in no way equivalent to those expressed by Hearn.  Fields answered yes to the question whether he believed that everyone can be rehabilitated.  App. at 118.  Fields went on to say that [i]t may be far-fetched, but I feel like, if a person has the opportunity to really be talked about God and he commits himself, whereas he has committed this offense, then if he turns his life around, that is rehabilitation.  Ibid.  In contrast, Hearn stated that she believe[d] in the death penalty if a criminal cannot be rehabilitated.  Id., at 694.


Petitioner tries to muddy the waters by pointing out that Fields was, in other respects, a good States juror because he supported the death penalty.  Brief for Petitioner 2425.  However, that does not change the fact that Fields said that everyone could be rehabilitated (and thus might have been swayed by a penitent defendants testimony) and Hearn insisted that some people could not be rehabilitated.  In analyzing Batson claims the focus should not be on the reasonableness of the asserted nonracial motive … [but] rather [on] the genuineness of the motive.  Purkett, 514 U. S., at 769 (emphasis in original).

						 The prosecutions stated reasons for striking Bozeman were that he was ambivalent about the death penalty and that he made pro-defense remarks about rehabilitation.  This is one case where the prosecution gave multiple reasons for a strike and petitioner actually correctly alleged the existence of a similarly situated white venireman, Hearn.  Petitioner believes, albeit erroneously, see ante, at 46 (Scalia, J., concurring), that Hearn expressed similar ambivalence about the death penalty and made pro-defense remarks about rehabilitation.

He then circled no in answering question 58.  Keaton circled no, indicating she did not believe in the death penalty, when she answered question 56, writing Its not for me to punished [sic] anyone.  However she then circled no in answering question 58, indicating that she did not have any objection to imposing the death penalty.

						 This analysis considers Hinson and Nelson as being clearly opposed to the death penalty in their questionnaires (answering question 56 no and question 58 yes) and Kennedy as being ambiguous (though in fact he answered question 56 yes and 58 no).  Even without these assumptions, 13 out of 15 veniremen who answered yes to question 56 and no to question 58indicating clear support for the death penaltydid not receive the graphic script.  And seven out of seven of those answering no and no or yes and yesindicating ambiguous or mixed feelings about the death penaltyor not answering clearly at all received the graphic script.

				Unpersuaded by petitioners claims, the state trial court found that there was no purposeful discrimination by the prosecut[ion] in the use of … peremptory strikes, App. 878.  This finding established that petitioner had failed to carry his burden at step three of the inquiry set out in

I cannot.  Because petitioner has not shown, by clear and convincing evidence, that any peremptory strikes of black veniremen were exercised because of race, he does not merit a certificate of appealability (COA).  I respectfully dissent.

				The Court agrees, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 17, that the state courts finding at step three of 
				<em>
					Batson
				</em>
				 is a finding of fact ordinarily subject to §2254(e)(1)s presumption of correctness:

        <p class="bodytext">

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
However, the Court implicitly rejects the obvious conclusion that the COA determination under §2253(c) is part of a proceeding instituted by an application for a writ of habeas corpus.  Instead of presuming the state courts factfindings to be correct, as §2254(e)(1) requires, the Court holds that petitioner need only show that reasonable jurists could disagree as to whether he can provide clear and convincing evidence that the finding was erroneous.

				 at 484)).  But neither 
				<em>
					Slack
				</em>
				 nor any other decision of this Court addressing the COA procedure has ever considered a constitutional claim that turns entirely on issues of fact.  In these circumstances, it is the text of §2254(e)(1) that governs.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Unlike the majority, I begin with the plain text of the statute that instructs federal courts how to treat state-court findings of fact.  At issue is what constitutes a proceeding for purposes of §2254(e)(1).  The word, proceeding, means [t]he regular and orderly progression of a lawsuit, including 
				<em>
					all acts and events between
				</em>

 (pre-Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) factual deference provision with virtually identical language applies to merits appeal).  The COA determination should be treated no differently, because §2254(e)(1) draws no distinction between the merits appeal and the COA.  The Courts silent conclusion to the contrary is simply illogical.  The COAs status as the jurisdictional prerequisite for the merits appeal requires that

				The Courts rejection of this conclusion also conflicts with pre-AEDPA practice.  Prior to AEDPA, access to a merits appeal in federal habeas corpus proceedings was governed by a mechanism similar to the COA, known as a certificate of probable cause, or CPC.  See

				  Under these provisions (indistinguishable from AEDPAs for these purposes), courts concluded that §2254(e)(1)s predecessor applied directly to the CPC proceeding, without any filtering through the debatability standard the Court has used in both the CPC and COA contexts.  See,

				Unlike an appellate courts review of district court findings of fact for clear error, §2254(e)(1) establishes a presumption of correctness.  It requires that the federal habeas court assume the state court that entered the findings was the best placed factfinder with the most complete record and 
				<em>
					only then 
				</em>
				ask whether the petitioner can refute that factual finding by clear and convincing evidence.  Procedural imperfections ordinarily will not affect this presumption; thus, it does not matter whether the state judge made his decision two years late or with a less-than-perfect record.  Admittedly these conditions might increase the 
				<em>
					odds

				 that a habeas applicant could locate helpful evidence, but to presume facts correct means a court cannot allow a habeas applicant to evade §2254(e)(1) by attacking the process employed by the state

				 rather than the actual 
				<em>
					factfindings
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				This reading is confirmed by the changes worked by AEDPA.  Section 2254(e)(1) does not, as its predecessor did, create exceptions to factual deference for procedural infirmities.  For example, prior to AEDPA, a federal habeas court would not defer to state-court determinations of fact if the factfinding procedure employed by the State court was not adequate to afford a full and fair hearing, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2254.html#d_2" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S.

The removal of these exceptions forecloses the use of marginal procedural complaintssuch as a delay between 
				<em>
					voir dire
				</em>
				 and a 
				<em>
					Batson

				 hearingto determine whether or how much a federal habeas court will defer to state-court factfinding.

				Section 2254(e)(1) simply cannot be read to contain an implied sliding scale of deference.  I do not understand the Court to disagree with this view, however, as its dicta does not actually purport to interpret the text of §2254(e)(1).

				For the three challenged peremptory strikes used on Fields, Warren, and Boggess, petitioner has not even correctly alleged the existence of similarly situated white veniremen.

Fields, Warren, and Boggess were struck for having family members with criminal histories.  Bozeman and Fields were struck for making pro-defense remarks about rehabilitation.

				The Courts treatment of this issue focuses on the apparent disparity in treatment of 10 black veniremen and 10 white veniremen who were supposedly similar in their opposition to the death penalty.

But the Court neglects to mention that the eight white veniremen who petitioner thinks should have received the graphic formulation, Reply Brief for Petitioner 15, n. 19, were so emphatically opposed to the death penalty that such a description would have served no purpose in clarifying their position on the issue.  No trial lawyer would willingly antagonize a potential juror ardently opposed to the death penalty with an extreme portrait of its implementation.  The strategy pursued by the prosecution makes perfect sense: When it was necessary to draw out a veniremans feelings about the death penalty they would use the graphic script, but when it was overkill they would not.
				    
				The record demonstrates that six of these eight white veniremen were so opposed to the death penalty that they were stricken for cause without the need for the prosecution to spend a peremptory challenge.

				First, as already noted, the deeper and clearer opposition to the death penalty on the part of the eight whites who did not receive the graphic script (but petitioner thinks should have) indirectly supports respondents contention that this opposition came out in their questionnaires (presumably by an answer of no to question 56 and an answer of yes to question 58).  But this is not the only evidence supporting respondents view.  Hinson, a white venireman who did not receive the graphic formulation, stated during voir dire

It happened that, while not completely clear about it in the questionnaire (and hence receiving the graphic formulation), Woods was an enthusiastic supporter of the death penalty, and he was, in fact, seated on petitioners jury.  Further confirming respondents explanation, black veniremen Linda Baker, Janice Mackey, Paul Bailey, and Anna Keaton all gave unclear responses to questions 56 and 58 and all received the graphic formulation.

				To sum up, the correlation between questionnaire answers and the use of the graphic script is far stronger than any correlation with race.  Sixteen veniremen clearly indicated on the questionnaires their feelings on the death penalty,

				  In other words, for 23 out of 24, or 96%, of the veniremen for whom questionnaire information is available, the answers given accurately predict whether they got the graphic script.

				Petitioner fares no better with his allegation that the prosecution employed two different scripts on the basis of race when asking questions about imposition of the minimum sentence.  Indeed, this disparate questioning argument is as flawed as the last one.  Respondent admits that the different questioning on minimum sentences was used as an effort to get veniremen the prosecution felt to be ambivalent about the death penalty dismissed for cause.  In making the decision whether to employ the manipulative minimum punishment script, prosecutors could rely on both the questionnaires and substantial 
				<em>
					voir dire
				</em>
				 testimony, as the minimum punishment questioning occurred much later in 
				<em>
					voir dire
				</em>
				 than the graphic formulation.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Seven black veniremen were given the allegedly manipulative minimum punishment script, all of whom were opposed to the death penalty in varying degrees.  Rand, Kennedy, Bozeman, Warren, and Boggess views on the death penalty have all been exhaustively discussed.  This leaves Baker and Fields.  Bakers views on the death penalty were so clearly ambivalent that she is not even the subject of petitioners 
				<em>
					Batson
				</em>
				 challenge.  And Fields family history of criminality and views on rehabilitation, as earlier discussed,
				<em>
					 supra,
				</em>
				 at 10, and n. 7, convinced the prosecution to use a peremptory strike.

				  Finally, petitioners objection to the prosecutions decision not to use the manipulative punishment script on Woods, Reply Brief for Petitioner 17, n. 23, makes no sense.  Woods gave answers indicating he would be an excellent States jurorwhy would the prosecution have tried to eliminate him?  Of course, if petitioner were correct that the prosecution sought to eliminate blacks then one might expect that all methods, including the use of the manipulative script, would have been deployed against Woods, who happened to also be black.

				As with graphic questioning, respondents explanation goes unrebutted by petitioner.  Unless a venireman indicated he would be a poor States juror (using the criteria that respondent has identified here) 
				<em>
					and
				</em>
            <em>
					would not otherwise be struck for cause or by agreement

				<em>

				</em>
				 he ignores the fact that of the 10 whites who expressed opposition to the death penalty, 8 were struck for cause or by agreement,

				Quite simply, petitioners arguments rest on circumstantial evidence and speculation that does not hold up to a thorough review of the record.  Far from rebutting §2254(e)(1)s presumption, petitioner has perhaps not even demonstrated that reasonable jurists could debate whether he has provided the requisite evidence of purposeful discriminationbut that is the majoritys inquiry, not mine.  Because petitioner has not demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that even one of the peremptory strikes at issue was the result of racial discrimination, I would affirm the denial of a COA.

						 I am puzzled by the majoritys willingness to hold against respondent the failure of prosecutors to testify at the post-trial Batson hearing.  Petitioner could easily have requested that the reasons for the allegedly unconstitutional peremptory strikes be given again, and did not.  The attorney representing the State at the post-trial Batson hearing made certain that both trial prosecutors were present to reiterate the reasons they gave in the record for striking the challenged black veniremen.  App. at 865.  Petitioners counsel explicitly refused the opportunity to do so when it was offered. Ibid.  Furthermore, I fail to understand why a move that resulted in a more efficient hearing without redundant testimony should redound to the benefit of petitioner, who bears the burden of proof in this federal habeas corpus proceeding.

						 I do, however, agree with the majority that the Courts decisions in Hernandez v. New York, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/500/352" class="subref" title="subref">500 U. S. 352</a> (1991)
, and Purkett v. Elem, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/514/765" class="subref" title="subref">514 U. S. 765</a> (1995)
 (per curiam), can be helpful in guiding a federal habeas court deciding a claim under Batson v. Kentucky, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/476/79" class="subref" title="subref">476 U. S. 79</a> (1986)
.  For instance, both cases confirm that Batson step three turns on an evaluation of the prosecutors proffered race-neutral justifications for the peremptory challenges at issue.  Purkett, supra, at 768769; Hernandez, 500 U. S., at 364365 (plurality opinion); id., at 372 (OConnor, J., concurring in judgment); see also Batson, supra, at 98, n. 21.  Additionally, because Hernandezs clear error standard is less demanding of a criminal defendant than §2254(e)(1) is of a habeas applicant, a federal habeas court can deny relief on §2254(e)(1) grounds if it determines it would do so when reviewing the same facts for clear error.  Cf. Marshall v. Lonberger,

						 Petitioner directs the Court to white veniremen Noad Vickery, Cheryl Davis, Chatta Nix, and Joan Weiner as having family members with criminal histories, but points to white veniremen Sandra Hearn and Marie Mazza as equally ambivalent about the death penalty.

						 Again petitioner points to Vickery, Davis, Nix, and Weiner for similar family histories.  Justice Scalia has shown that none of these four were in fact similarly situated to Fields with respect to this justification.  Ante, at 67 (concurring opinion).  Petitioner also alleges that Hearn made pro-defense remarks about rehabilitation similar to those made by Fields.  Again, no white venireman even allegedly fits both reasons given for striking Fields.  Furthermore, even if Fields had only been struck for his views on rehabilitation, those views were in no way equivalent to those expressed by Hearn.  Fields answered yes to the question whether he believed that everyone can be rehabilitated.  App. at 118.  Fields went on to say that [i]t may be far-fetched, but I feel like, if a person has the opportunity to really be talked about God and he commits himself, whereas he has committed this offense, then if he turns his life around, that is rehabilitation.  Ibid.  In contrast, Hearn stated that she believe[d] in the death penalty if a criminal cannot be rehabilitated.  Id., at 694.


Petitioner tries to muddy the waters by pointing out that Fields was, in other respects, a good States juror because he supported the death penalty.  Brief for Petitioner 2425.  However, that does not change the fact that Fields said that everyone could be rehabilitated (and thus might have been swayed by a penitent defendants testimony) and Hearn insisted that some people could not be rehabilitated.  In analyzing Batson claims the focus should not be on the reasonableness of the asserted nonracial motive … [but] rather [on] the genuineness of the motive.  Purkett, 514 U. S., at 769 (emphasis in original).

						 The prosecutions stated reasons for striking Bozeman were that he was ambivalent about the death penalty and that he made pro-defense remarks about rehabilitation.  This is one case where the prosecution gave multiple reasons for a strike and petitioner actually correctly alleged the existence of a similarly situated white venireman, Hearn.  Petitioner believes, albeit erroneously, see ante, at 46 (Scalia, J., concurring), that Hearn expressed similar ambivalence about the death penalty and made pro-defense remarks about rehabilitation.

He then circled no in answering question 58.  Keaton circled no, indicating she did not believe in the death penalty, when she answered question 56, writing Its not for me to punished [sic] anyone.  However she then circled no in answering question 58, indicating that she did not have any objection to imposing the death penalty.

						 This analysis considers Hinson and Nelson as being clearly opposed to the death penalty in their questionnaires (answering question 56 no and question 58 yes) and Kennedy as being ambiguous (though in fact he answered question 56 yes and 58 no).  Even without these assumptions, 13 out of 15 veniremen who answered yes to question 56 and no to question 58indicating clear support for the death penaltydid not receive the graphic script.  And seven out of seven of those answering no and no or yes and yesindicating ambiguous or mixed feelings about the death penaltyor not answering clearly at all received the graphic script.  This yields an accuracy rate of 20 out of 22, or 91%.

				Unpersuaded by petitioners claims, the state trial court found that there was no purposeful discrimination by the prosecut[ion] in the use of … peremptory strikes, App. 878.  This finding established that petitioner had failed to carry his burden at step three of the inquiry set out in

I cannot.  Because petitioner has not shown, by clear and convincing evidence, that any peremptory strikes of black veniremen were exercised because of race, he does not merit a certificate of appealability (COA).

				The Court agrees, 
				<em>

				, at 17, that the state courts finding at step three of 
				<em>
					Batson

				 is a finding of fact ordinarily subject to §2254(e)(1)s presumption of correctness:

        <p class="bodytext">

        <p class="bodytext">
				
However, the Court implicitly rejects the obvious conclusion that the COA determination under §2253(c) is part of a proceeding instituted by an application for a writ of habeas corpus.  Instead of presuming the state courts factfindings to be correct, as §2254(e)(1) requires, the Court holds that petitioner need only show that reasonable jurists could disagree as to whether he can provide clear and convincing evidence that the finding was erroneous.

				<em>
					Slack

				Unlike the majority, I begin with the plain text of the statute that instructs federal courts how to treat state-court findings of fact.  At issue is what constitutes a proceeding for purposes of §2254(e)(1).  The word, proceeding, means [t]he regular and orderly progression of a lawsuit, including 
				<em>
					all acts and events between
				</em>
				 the time of commencement and the entry of judgment.  Blacks Law Dictionary 1221 (7th ed. 1999) (emphasis added).  The COA, standing alone, … does not assert a grievance against anyone, does not seek remedy or redress for any legal injury, and does not even require a party on the other side.  It is nothing more than a request for permission to seek review.

 (pre-Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) factual deference provision with virtually identical language applies to merits appeal).  The COA determination should be treated no differently, because §2254(e)(1) draws no distinction between the merits appeal and the COA.  The Courts silent conclusion to the contrary is simply illogical.  The COAs status as the jurisdictional prerequisite for the merits appeal requires that 
				<em>

				The Courts rejection of this conclusion also conflicts with pre-AEDPA practice.  Prior to AEDPA, access to a merits appeal in federal habeas corpus proceedings was governed by a mechanism similar to the COA, known as a certificate of probable cause, or CPC.  See 
				<em>

				,

				  Under these provisions (indistinguishable from AEDPAs for these purposes), courts concluded that §2254(e)(1)s predecessor applied directly to the CPC proceeding, without any filtering through the debatability standard the Court has used in both the CPC and COA contexts.  See,

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Unlike an appellate courts review of district court findings of fact for clear error, §2254(e)(1) establishes a presumption of correctness.  It requires that the federal habeas court assume the state court that entered the findings was the best placed factfinder with the most complete record and 
				<em>
					only then 
				</em>
				ask whether the petitioner can refute that factual finding by clear and convincing evidence.  Procedural imperfections ordinarily will not affect this presumption; thus, it does not matter whether the state judge made his decision two years late or with a less-than-perfect record.  Admittedly these conditions might increase the 
				<em>
					odds
				</em>
				 that a habeas applicant could locate helpful evidence, but to presume facts correct means a court cannot allow a habeas applicant to evade §2254(e)(1) by attacking the process employed by the state 
				<em>
					factfinder
				</em>
				 rather than the actual 
				<em>
					factfindings
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				This reading is confirmed by the changes worked by AEDPA.  Section 2254(e)(1) does not, as its predecessor did, create exceptions to factual deference for procedural infirmities.  For example, prior to AEDPA, a federal habeas court would not defer to state-court determinations of fact if the factfinding procedure employed by the State court was not adequate to afford a full and fair hearing, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2254.html#d_2" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(2)</a> (1994 ed.), the material facts were not adequately developed at the State court hearing, §2254(d)(3), or the applicant did not receive a full, fair, and adequate hearing, §2254(d)(6).  The removal of these exceptions forecloses the use of marginal procedural complaintssuch as a delay between 
				<em>
					voir dire
				</em>
				 and a 
				<em>
					Batson
				</em>
				 hearingto determine whether or how much a federal habeas court will defer to state-court factfinding.

				Section 2254(e)(1) simply cannot be read to contain an implied sliding scale of deference.  I do not understand the Court to disagree with this view, however, as its dicta does not actually purport to interpret the text of §2254(e)(1).

				For the three challenged peremptory strikes used on Fields, Warren, and Boggess, petitioner has not even correctly alleged the existence of similarly situated white veniremen.

Fields, Warren, and Boggess were struck for having family members with criminal histories.  Bozeman and Fields were struck for making pro-defense remarks about rehabilitation.

				The Courts treatment of this issue focuses on the apparent disparity in treatment of 10 black veniremen and 10 white veniremen who were supposedly similar in their opposition to the death penalty.  The majority notes that only 2 out of these 10 whites got the graphic description while 7 out of 10 blacks did.

				, at 20.  But the Court neglects to mention that the eight white veniremen who petitioner thinks should have received the graphic formulation, Reply Brief for Petitioner 15, n. 19, were so emphatically opposed to the death penalty that such a description would have served no purpose in clarifying their position on the issue.  No trial lawyer would willingly antagonize a potential juror ardently opposed to the death penalty with an extreme portrait of its implementation.  The strategy pursued by the prosecution makes perfect sense: When it was necessary to draw out a veniremans feelings about the death penalty they would use the graphic script, but when it was overkill they would not.
				    
				The record demonstrates that six of these eight white veniremen were so opposed to the death penalty that they were stricken for cause without the need for the prosecution to spend a peremptory challenge.  For example, John Nelson wrote on his questionnaire, I believe that the State does not have the right to take anyones life, Tr. of Voir Dire in No. F8578668NL (5th Crim. Dist.

				First, as already noted, the deeper and clearer opposition to the death penalty on the part of the eight whites who did not receive the graphic script (but petitioner thinks should have) indirectly supports respondents contention that this opposition came out in their questionnaires (presumably by an answer of no to question 56 and an answer of yes to question 58).  But this is not the only evidence supporting respondents view.  Hinson, a white venireman who did not receive the graphic formulation, stated during voir dire

				To sum up, the correlation between questionnaire answers and the use of the graphic script is far stronger than any correlation with race.  Sixteen veniremen clearly indicated on the questionnaires their feelings on the death penalty,

				  In other words, for 23 out of 24, or 96%, of the veniremen for whom questionnaire information is available, the answers given accurately predict whether they got the graphic script.

				Petitioner fares no better with his allegation that the prosecution employed two different scripts on the basis of race when asking questions about imposition of the minimum sentence.  Indeed, this disparate questioning argument is as flawed as the last one.  Respondent admits that the different questioning on minimum sentences was used as an effort to get veniremen the prosecution felt to be ambivalent about the death penalty dismissed for cause.  In making the decision whether to employ the manipulative minimum punishment script, prosecutors could rely on both the questionnaires and substantial 
				<em>
					voir dire
				</em>
				 testimony, as the minimum punishment questioning occurred much later in 
				<em>
					voir dire
				</em>
				 than the graphic formulation.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Seven black veniremen were given the allegedly manipulative minimum punishment script, all of whom were opposed to the death penalty in varying degrees.  Rand, Kennedy, Bozeman, Warren, and Boggess views on the death penalty have all been exhaustively discussed.  This leaves Baker and Fields.  Bakers views on the death penalty were so clearly ambivalent that she is not even the subject of petitioners 
				<em>
					Batson
				</em>
				 challenge.  And Fields family history of criminality and views on rehabilitation, as earlier discussed,
				<em>
					 supra,
				</em>
				 at 10, and n. 7, convinced the prosecution to use a peremptory strike.

            </a>
				  Finally, petitioners objection to the prosecutions decision not to use the manipulative punishment script on Woods, Reply Brief for Petitioner 17, n. 23, makes no sense.  Woods gave answers indicating he would be an excellent States jurorwhy would the prosecution have tried to eliminate him?  Of course, if petitioner were correct that the prosecution sought to eliminate blacks then one might expect that all methods, including the use of the manipulative script, would have been deployed against Woods, who happened to also be black.

				As with graphic questioning, respondents explanation goes unrebutted by petitioner.  Unless a venireman indicated he would be a poor States juror (using the criteria that respondent has identified here) 
				<em>
					and
				</em>
            <em>
					would not otherwise be struck for cause or by agreement
				</em>
				, there was no reason to use the manipulative script.  Thus, when petitioner points to the States failure to use its manipulative method with the vast majority of white veniremembers who expressed reservations about the death penalty, 
				<em>
					ibid.,
				</em>
				 he ignores the fact that of the 10 whites who expressed opposition to the death penalty, 8 were struck for cause or by agreement, 
				<em>
					meaning no manipulative script was necessary to get them removed
				</em>
				.  The other two whites were both given the manipulative script

				Quite simply, petitioners arguments rest on circumstantial evidence and speculation that does not hold up to a thorough review of the record.  Far from rebutting §2254(e)(1)s presumption, petitioner has perhaps not even demonstrated that reasonable jurists could debate whether he has provided the requisite evidence of purposeful discriminationbut that is the majoritys inquiry, not mine.  Because petitioner has not demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that even one of the peremptory strikes at issue was the result of racial discrimination, I would affirm the denial of a COA.

						 I am puzzled by the majoritys willingness to hold against respondent the failure of prosecutors to testify at the post-trial Batson hearing.  Petitioner could easily have requested that the reasons for the allegedly unconstitutional peremptory strikes be given again, and did not.  The attorney representing the State at the post-trial Batson hearing made certain that both trial prosecutors were present to reiterate the reasons they gave in the record for striking the challenged black veniremen.  App. at 865.  Petitioners counsel explicitly refused the opportunity to do so when it was offered. Ibid.  Furthermore, I fail to understand why a move that resulted in a more efficient hearing without redundant testimony should redound to the benefit of petitioner, who bears the burden of proof in this federal habeas corpus proceeding.

						 I do, however, agree with the majority that the Courts decisions in Hernandez v. New York, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/500/352" class="subref" title="subref">500 U. S. 352</a> (1991)
, and Purkett v. Elem, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/514/765" class="subref" title="subref">514 U. S. 765</a> (1995)
 (per curiam), can be helpful in guiding a federal habeas court deciding a claim under Batson v. Kentucky, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/476/79" class="subref" title="subref">476 U. S. 79</a> (1986)
.  For instance, both cases confirm that Batson step three turns on an evaluation of the prosecutors proffered race-neutral justifications for the peremptory challenges at issue.  Purkett, supra, at 768769; Hernandez, 500 U. S., at 364365 (plurality opinion); id., at 372 (OConnor, J., concurring in judgment); see also Batson, supra, at 98, n. 21.  Additionally, because Hernandezs clear error standard is less demanding of a criminal defendant than §2254(e)(1) is of a habeas applicant, a federal habeas court can deny relief on §2254(e)(1) grounds if it determines it would do so when reviewing the same facts for clear error.  Cf. Marshall v. Lonberger, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/459/422" class="subref" title="subref">459 U. S. 422</a>,

						 Petitioner directs the Court to white veniremen Noad Vickery, Cheryl Davis, Chatta Nix, and Joan Weiner as having family members with criminal histories, but points to white veniremen Sandra Hearn and Marie Mazza as equally ambivalent about the death penalty.

						 Again petitioner points to Vickery, Davis, Nix, and Weiner for similar family histories.  Justice Scalia has shown that none of these four were in fact similarly situated to Fields with respect to this justification.  Ante, at 67 (concurring opinion).  Petitioner also alleges that Hearn made pro-defense remarks about rehabilitation similar to those made by Fields.  Again, no white venireman even allegedly fits both reasons given for striking Fields.  Furthermore, even if Fields had only been struck for his views on rehabilitation, those views were in no way equivalent to those expressed by Hearn.  Fields answered yes to the question whether he believed that everyone can be rehabilitated.  App. at 118.  Fields went on to say that [i]t may be far-fetched, but I feel like, if a person has the opportunity to really be talked about God and he commits himself, whereas he has committed this offense, then if he turns his life around, that is rehabilitation.  Ibid.  In contrast, Hearn stated that she believe[d] in the death penalty if a criminal cannot be rehabilitated.  Id., at 694.


Petitioner tries to muddy the waters by pointing out that Fields was, in other respects, a good States juror because he supported the death penalty.  Brief for Petitioner 2425.  However, that does not change the fact that Fields said that everyone could be rehabilitated (and thus might have been swayed by a penitent defendants testimony) and Hearn insisted that some people could not be rehabilitated.  In analyzing Batson claims the focus should not be on the reasonableness of the asserted nonracial motive … [but] rather [on] the genuineness of the motive.  Purkett, 514 U. S., at 769 (emphasis in original).

						 The prosecutions stated reasons for striking Bozeman were that he was ambivalent about the death penalty and that he made pro-defense remarks about rehabilitation.  This is one case where the prosecution gave multiple reasons for a strike and petitioner actually correctly alleged the existence of a similarly situated white venireman, Hearn.  Petitioner believes, albeit erroneously, see ante, at 46 (Scalia, J., concurring), that Hearn expressed similar ambivalence about the death penalty and made pro-defense remarks about rehabilitation.

Baker also did not answer question 58, writing undecided instead.  Mackey answered question 56 no, indicating she did not believe in the death penalty, and wrote Thou Shall Not Kill in the explanation space.

He then circled no in answering question 58.  Keaton circled no, indicating she did not believe in the death penalty, when she answered question 56, writing Its not for me to punished [sic] anyone.  However she then circled no in answering question 58, indicating that she did not have any objection to imposing the death penalty.

						 This analysis considers Hinson and Nelson as being clearly opposed to the death penalty in their questionnaires (answering question 56 no and question 58 yes) and Kennedy as being ambiguous (though in fact he answered question 56 yes and 58 no).  Even without these assumptions, 13 out of 15 veniremen who answered yes to question 56 and no to question 58indicating clear support for the death penaltydid not receive the graphic script.  And seven out of seven of those answering no and no or yes and yesindicating ambiguous or mixed feelings about the death penaltyor not answering clearly at all received the graphic script.  This yields an accuracy rate of 20 out of 22, or 91%.

				Unpersuaded by petitioners claims, the state trial court found that there was no purposeful discrimination by the prosecut[ion] in the use of … peremptory strikes, App. 878.  This finding established that petitioner had failed to carry his burden at step three of the inquiry set out in

C. §2254(e)(1)</a> requires that a federal habeas court presum[e] the state courts findings of fact to be correct unless petitioner can rebut the presumption by clear and convincing evidence.  The majority decides, without explanation, to ignore §2254(e)(1)s explicit command.  I cannot.  Because petitioner has not shown, by clear and convincing evidence, that any peremptory strikes of black veniremen were exercised because of race, he does not merit a certificate of appealability (COA).  I respectfully dissent.

				The Court agrees, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 17, that the state courts finding at step three of 
				<em>
					Batson
				</em>
				 is a finding of fact ordinarily subject to §2254(e)(1)s presumption of correctness:

        <p class="bodytext">

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
However, the Court implicitly rejects the obvious conclusion that the COA determination under §2253(c) is part of a proceeding instituted by an application for a writ of habeas corpus.  Instead of presuming the state courts factfindings to be correct, as §2254(e)(1) requires, the Court holds that petitioner need only show that reasonable jurists could disagree as to whether he can provide clear and convincing evidence that the finding was erroneous.

				<em>

				</em>
				 at 484)).  But neither 
				<em>
					Slack
				</em>
				 nor any other decision of this Court addressing the COA procedure has ever considered a constitutional claim that turns entirely on issues of fact.  In these circumstances, it is the text of §2254(e)(1) that governs.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Unlike the majority, I begin with the plain text of the statute that instructs federal courts how to treat state-court findings of fact.  At issue is what constitutes a proceeding for purposes of §2254(e)(1).  The word, proceeding, means [t]he regular and orderly progression of a lawsuit, including 
				<em>
					all acts and events between
				</em>
				 the time of commencement and the entry of judgment.  Blacks Law Dictionary 1221 (7th ed. 1999) (emphasis added).  The COA, standing alone, … does not assert a grievance against anyone, does not seek remedy or redress for any legal injury, and does not even require a party on the other side.  It is nothing more than a request for permission to seek review.

				I agree with the majority that the existence of a COA is a jurisdictional prerequisite to the merits appeal.

 (pre-Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) factual deference provision with virtually identical language applies to merits appeal).  The COA determination should be treated no differently, because §2254(e)(1) draws no distinction between the merits appeal and the COA.  The Courts silent conclusion to the contrary is simply illogical.  The COAs status as the jurisdictional prerequisite for the merits appeal requires that 
				<em>
					both
				</em>
				 the COA determination 
				<em>
					and
				</em>
				 the merits appeal be considered a part of the same proceeding.

				The Courts rejection of this conclusion also conflicts with pre-AEDPA practice.  Prior to AEDPA, access to a merits appeal in federal habeas corpus proceedings was governed by a mechanism similar to the COA, known as a certificate of probable cause, or CPC.  See 
				<em>
					Slack
				</em>
				, 
				<em>

				 at 480.  There was also a standard of factual deference similar to, though weaker than, the standard in §2254(e)(1).  See

				  Under these provisions (indistinguishable from AEDPAs for these purposes), courts concluded that §2254(e)(1)s predecessor applied directly to the CPC proceeding, without any filtering through the debatability standard the Court has used in both the CPC and COA contexts.  See,

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Unlike an appellate courts review of district court findings of fact for clear error, §2254(e)(1) establishes a presumption of correctness.  It requires that the federal habeas court assume the state court that entered the findings was the best placed factfinder with the most complete record and 
				<em>
					only then 
				</em>
				ask whether the petitioner can refute that factual finding by clear and convincing evidence.  Procedural imperfections ordinarily will not affect this presumption; thus, it does not matter whether the state judge made his decision two years late or with a less-than-perfect record.  Admittedly these conditions might increase the 
				<em>
					odds
				</em>
				 that a habeas applicant could locate helpful evidence, but to presume facts correct means a court cannot allow a habeas applicant to evade §2254(e)(1) by attacking the process employed by the state 
				<em>
					factfinder
				</em>
				 rather than the actual 
				<em>
					factfindings
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				This reading is confirmed by the changes worked by AEDPA.  Section 2254(e)(1) does not, as its predecessor did, create exceptions to factual deference for procedural infirmities.  For example, prior to AEDPA, a federal habeas court would not defer to state-court determinations of fact if the factfinding procedure employed by the State court was not adequate to afford a full and fair hearing, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2254.html#d_2" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(2)</a> (1994 ed.), the material facts were not adequately developed at the State court hearing, §2254(d)(3), or the applicant did not receive a full, fair, and adequate hearing, §2254(d)(6).  The removal of these exceptions forecloses the use of marginal procedural complaintssuch as a delay between 
				<em>
					voir dire
				</em>
				 and a 
				<em>
					Batson
				</em>
				 hearingto determine whether or how much a federal habeas court will defer to state-court factfinding.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Section 2254(e)(1) simply cannot be read to contain an implied sliding scale of deference.  I do not understand the Court to disagree with this view, however, as its dicta does not actually purport to interpret the text of §2254(e)(1).

				For the three challenged peremptory strikes used on Fields, Warren, and Boggess, petitioner has not even correctly alleged the existence of similarly situated white veniremen.  The majoritys discussion of this subject is misleading, stating that prosecutors explained that their peremptory challenges against six [black] potential jurors were based on ambivalence about the death penalty; hesitancy to vote to execute defendants capable of being rehabilitated; and the [veniremens] own family history of criminality.

Fields, Warren, and Boggess were struck for having family members with criminal histories.  Bozeman and Fields were struck for making pro-defense remarks about rehabilitation.

				The Courts treatment of this issue focuses on the apparent disparity in treatment of 10 black veniremen and 10 white veniremen who were supposedly similar in their opposition to the death penalty.  The majority notes that only 2 out of these 10 whites got the graphic description while 7 out of 10 blacks did.  
				<em>

				, at 20.  But the Court neglects to mention that the eight white veniremen who petitioner thinks should have received the graphic formulation, Reply Brief for Petitioner 15, n. 19, were so emphatically opposed to the death penalty that such a description would have served no purpose in clarifying their position on the issue.  No trial lawyer would willingly antagonize a potential juror ardently opposed to the death penalty with an extreme portrait of its implementation.  The strategy pursued by the prosecution makes perfect sense: When it was necessary to draw out a veniremans feelings about the death penalty they would use the graphic script, but when it was overkill they would not.
				    
				The record demonstrates that six of these eight white veniremen were so opposed to the death penalty that they were stricken for cause without the need for the prosecution to spend a peremptory challenge.  For example, John Nelson wrote on his questionnaire, I believe that the State does not have the right to take anyones life, Tr. of Voir Dire in No. F8578668NL (5th Crim. Dist.

				First, as already noted, the deeper and clearer opposition to the death penalty on the part of the eight whites who did not receive the graphic script (but petitioner thinks should have) indirectly supports respondents contention that this opposition came out in their questionnaires (presumably by an answer of no to question 56 and an answer of yes to question 58).  But this is not the only evidence supporting respondents view.  Hinson, a white venireman who did not receive the graphic formulation, stated during voir dire

				Petitioner fares no better with his allegation that the prosecution employed two different scripts on the basis of race when asking questions about imposition of the minimum sentence.  Indeed, this disparate questioning argument is as flawed as the last one.  Respondent admits that the different questioning on minimum sentences was used as an effort to get veniremen the prosecution felt to be ambivalent about the death penalty dismissed for cause.  In making the decision whether to employ the manipulative minimum punishment script, prosecutors could rely on both the questionnaires and substantial 
				<em>
					voir dire
				</em>
				 testimony, as the minimum punishment questioning occurred much later in 
				<em>
					voir dire
				</em>
				 than the graphic formulation.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Seven black veniremen were given the allegedly manipulative minimum punishment script, all of whom were opposed to the death penalty in varying degrees.  Rand, Kennedy, Bozeman, Warren, and Boggess views on the death penalty have all been exhaustively discussed.  This leaves Baker and Fields.  Bakers views on the death penalty were so clearly ambivalent that she is not even the subject of petitioners 
				<em>
					Batson
				</em>
				 challenge.  And Fields family history of criminality and views on rehabilitation, as earlier discussed,
				<em>
					 supra,
				</em>
				 at 10, and n. 7, convinced the prosecution to use a peremptory strike.

            </a>
				  Finally, petitioners objection to the prosecutions decision not to use the manipulative punishment script on Woods, Reply Brief for Petitioner 17, n. 23, makes no sense.  Woods gave answers indicating he would be an excellent States jurorwhy would the prosecution have tried to eliminate him?  Of course, if petitioner were correct that the prosecution sought to eliminate blacks then one might expect that all methods, including the use of the manipulative script, would have been deployed against Woods, who happened to also be black.

				As with graphic questioning, respondents explanation goes unrebutted by petitioner.  Unless a venireman indicated he would be a poor States juror (using the criteria that respondent has identified here) 
				<em>
					and
				</em>
            <em>
					would not otherwise be struck for cause or by agreement

				<em>
					ibid.,
				</em>
				 he ignores the fact that of the 10 whites who expressed opposition to the death penalty, 8 were struck for cause or by agreement, 
				<em>

				Quite simply, petitioners arguments rest on circumstantial evidence and speculation that does not hold up to a thorough review of the record.  Far from rebutting §2254(e)(1)s presumption, petitioner has perhaps not even demonstrated that reasonable jurists could debate whether he has provided the requisite evidence of purposeful discriminationbut that is the majoritys inquiry, not mine.  Because petitioner has not demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that even one of the peremptory strikes at issue was the result of racial discrimination, I would affirm the denial of a COA.

						 The pre-AEDPA standard of factual deference provided:


In any proceeding instituted in a Federal court by an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court, a determination after a hearing on the merits of a factual issue, made by a State court of competent jurisdiction … shall be presumed to be correct, unless the applicant shall establish or it shall otherwise appear, or the respondent shall admit [enumerated exceptions omitted]… .

						 I am puzzled by the majoritys willingness to hold against respondent the failure of prosecutors to testify at the post-trial Batson hearing.  Petitioner could easily have requested that the reasons for the allegedly unconstitutional peremptory strikes be given again, and did not.  The attorney representing the State at the post-trial Batson hearing made certain that both trial prosecutors were present to reiterate the reasons they gave in the record for striking the challenged black veniremen.  App. at 865.  Petitioners counsel explicitly refused the opportunity to do so when it was offered. Ibid.  Furthermore, I fail to understand why a move that resulted in a more efficient hearing without redundant testimony should redound to the benefit of petitioner, who bears the burden of proof in this federal habeas corpus proceeding.

						 I do, however, agree with the majority that the Courts decisions in Hernandez v. New York, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/500/352" class="subref" title="subref">500 U. S. 352</a> (1991)
, and Purkett v. Elem, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/514/765" class="subref" title="subref">514 U. S. 765</a> (1995)
 (per curiam), can be helpful in guiding a federal habeas court deciding a claim under Batson v. Kentucky, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/476/79" class="subref" title="subref">476 U. S. 79</a> (1986)
.  For instance, both cases confirm that Batson step three turns on an evaluation of the prosecutors proffered race-neutral justifications for the peremptory challenges at issue.  Purkett, supra, at 768769; Hernandez, 500 U. S., at 364365 (plurality opinion); id., at 372 (OConnor, J., concurring in judgment); see also Batson, supra, at 98, n. 21.  Additionally, because Hernandezs clear error standard is less demanding of a criminal defendant than §2254(e)(1) is of a habeas applicant, a federal habeas court can deny relief on §2254(e)(1) grounds if it determines it would do so when reviewing the same facts for clear error.  Cf. Marshall v. Lonberger,

						 Petitioner directs the Court to white veniremen Noad Vickery, Cheryl Davis, Chatta Nix, and Joan Weiner as having family members with criminal histories, but points to white veniremen Sandra Hearn and Marie Mazza as equally ambivalent about the death penalty.

						 Again petitioner points to Vickery, Davis, Nix, and Weiner for similar family histories.  Justice Scalia has shown that none of these four were in fact similarly situated to Fields with respect to this justification.  Ante, at 67 (concurring opinion).  Petitioner also alleges that Hearn made pro-defense remarks about rehabilitation similar to those made by Fields.  Again, no white venireman even allegedly fits both reasons given for striking Fields.  Furthermore, even if Fields had only been struck for his views on rehabilitation, those views were in no way equivalent to those expressed by Hearn.  Fields answered yes to the question whether he believed that everyone can be rehabilitated.  App. at 118.  Fields went on to say that [i]t may be far-fetched, but I feel like, if a person has the opportunity to really be talked about God and he commits himself, whereas he has committed this offense, then if he turns his life around, that is rehabilitation.  Ibid.  In contrast, Hearn stated that she believe[d] in the death penalty if a criminal cannot be rehabilitated.  Id., at 694.


Petitioner tries to muddy the waters by pointing out that Fields was, in other respects, a good States juror because he supported the death penalty.  Brief for Petitioner 2425.  However, that does not change the fact that Fields said that everyone could be rehabilitated (and thus might have been swayed by a penitent defendants testimony) and Hearn insisted that some people could not be rehabilitated.  In analyzing Batson claims the focus should not be on the reasonableness of the asserted nonracial motive … [but] rather [on] the genuineness of the motive.  Purkett, 514 U. S., at 769 (emphasis in original).

						 The prosecutions stated reasons for striking Bozeman were that he was ambivalent about the death penalty and that he made pro-defense remarks about rehabilitation.  This is one case where the prosecution gave multiple reasons for a strike and petitioner actually correctly alleged the existence of a similarly situated white venireman, Hearn.  Petitioner believes, albeit erroneously, see ante, at 46 (Scalia, J., concurring), that Hearn expressed similar ambivalence about the death penalty and made pro-defense remarks about rehabilitation.

He then circled no in answering question 58.  Keaton circled no, indicating she did not believe in the death penalty, when she answered question 56, writing Its not for me to punished [sic] anyone.  However she then circled no in answering question 58, indicating that she did not have any objection to imposing the death penalty.

						 This analysis considers Hinson and Nelson as being clearly opposed to the death penalty in their questionnaires (answering question 56 no and question 58 yes) and Kennedy as being ambiguous (though in fact he answered question 56 yes and 58 no).  Even without these assumptions, 13 out of 15 veniremen who answered yes to question 56 and no to question 58indicating clear support for the death penaltydid not receive the graphic script.  And seven out of seven of those answering no and no or yes and yesindicating ambiguous or mixed feelings about the death penaltyor not answering clearly at all received the graphic script.  This yields an accuracy rate of 20 out of 22, or 91%.

				Unpersuaded by petitioners claims, the state trial court found that there was no purposeful discrimination by the prosecut[ion] in the use of … peremptory strikes, App. 878.  This finding established that petitioner had failed to carry his burden at step three of the inquiry set out in

I cannot.  Because petitioner has not shown, by clear and convincing evidence, that any peremptory strikes of black veniremen were exercised because of race, he does not merit a certificate of appealability (COA).

				The Court agrees, 
				<em>

				, at 17, that the state courts finding at step three of 
				<em>
					Batson
				</em>
				 is a finding of fact ordinarily subject to §2254(e)(1)s presumption of correctness:

        <p class="bodytext">
				
However, the Court implicitly rejects the obvious conclusion that the COA determination under §2253(c) is part of a proceeding instituted by an application for a writ of habeas corpus.  Instead of presuming the state courts factfindings to be correct, as §2254(e)(1) requires, the Court holds that petitioner need only show that reasonable jurists could disagree as to whether he can provide clear and convincing evidence that the finding was erroneous.

				 at 484)).  But neither 
				<em>
					Slack
				</em>
				 nor any other decision of this Court addressing the COA procedure has ever considered a constitutional claim that turns entirely on issues of fact.  In these circumstances, it is the text of §2254(e)(1) that governs.

				Unlike the majority, I begin with the plain text of the statute that instructs federal courts how to treat state-court findings of fact.  At issue is what constitutes a proceeding for purposes of §2254(e)(1).  The word, proceeding, means [t]he regular and orderly progression of a lawsuit, including 
				<em>
					all acts and events between
				</em>
				 the time of commencement and the entry of judgment.  Blacks Law Dictionary 1221 (7th ed. 1999) (emphasis added).  The COA, standing alone, … does not assert a grievance against anyone, does not seek remedy or redress for any legal injury, and does not even require a party on the other side.  It is nothing more than a request for permission to seek review.

				I agree with the majority that the existence of a COA is a jurisdictional prerequisite to the merits appeal.  
				<em>

				, at 11.  However, the Court takes a wrong turn when it implies that the merits appeal is part of the habeas process (or proceeding) but the COA determination somehow is not.  Overwhelming authority (including the majority opinion) confirms that §2254(e)(1) applies to the merits appeal.  See

 (pre-Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) factual deference provision with virtually identical language applies to merits appeal).  The COA determination should be treated no differently, because §2254(e)(1) draws no distinction between the merits appeal and the COA.  The Courts silent conclusion to the contrary is simply illogical.  The COAs status as the jurisdictional prerequisite for the merits appeal requires that 
				<em>
					both
				</em>
				 the COA determination 
				<em>
					and
				</em>
				 the merits appeal be considered a part of the same proceeding.

				The Courts rejection of this conclusion also conflicts with pre-AEDPA practice.  Prior to AEDPA, access to a merits appeal in federal habeas corpus proceedings was governed by a mechanism similar to the COA, known as a certificate of probable cause, or CPC.  See 
				<em>
					Slack
				</em>
				, 
				<em>

				Unlike an appellate courts review of district court findings of fact for clear error, §2254(e)(1) establishes a presumption of correctness.  It requires that the federal habeas court assume the state court that entered the findings was the best placed factfinder with the most complete record and 
				<em>

				</em>
				ask whether the petitioner can refute that factual finding by clear and convincing evidence.  Procedural imperfections ordinarily will not affect this presumption; thus, it does not matter whether the state judge made his decision two years late or with a less-than-perfect record.  Admittedly these conditions might increase the 
				<em>

				 that a habeas applicant could locate helpful evidence, but to presume facts correct means a court cannot allow a habeas applicant to evade §2254(e)(1) by attacking the process employed by the state

				<em>

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				This reading is confirmed by the changes worked by AEDPA.  Section 2254(e)(1) does not, as its predecessor did, create exceptions to factual deference for procedural infirmities.  For example, prior to AEDPA, a federal habeas court would not defer to state-court determinations of fact if the factfinding procedure employed by the State court was not adequate to afford a full and fair hearing, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2254.html#d_2" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S.

The removal of these exceptions forecloses the use of marginal procedural complaintssuch as a delay between 
				<em>
					voir dire
				</em>
				 and a 
				<em>
					Batson

				 hearingto determine whether or how much a federal habeas court will defer to state-court factfinding.

Fields, Warren, and Boggess were struck for having family members with criminal histories.  Bozeman and Fields were struck for making pro-defense remarks about rehabilitation.

				The Courts treatment of this issue focuses on the apparent disparity in treatment of 10 black veniremen and 10 white veniremen who were supposedly similar in their opposition to the death penalty.  The majority notes that only 2 out of these 10 whites got the graphic description while 7 out of 10 blacks did.

But the Court neglects to mention that the eight white veniremen who petitioner thinks should have received the graphic formulation, Reply Brief for Petitioner 15, n. 19, were so emphatically opposed to the death penalty that such a description would have served no purpose in clarifying their position on the issue.  No trial lawyer would willingly antagonize a potential juror ardently opposed to the death penalty with an extreme portrait of its implementation.  The strategy pursued by the prosecution makes perfect sense: When it was necessary to draw out a veniremans feelings about the death penalty they would use the graphic script, but when it was overkill they would not.
				    
				The record demonstrates that six of these eight white veniremen were so opposed to the death penalty that they were stricken for cause without the need for the prosecution to spend a peremptory challenge.  For example, John Nelson wrote on his questionnaire, I believe that the State does not have the right to take anyones life, Tr. of Voir Dire in No. F8578668NL (5th Crim. Dist.

				First, as already noted, the deeper and clearer opposition to the death penalty on the part of the eight whites who did not receive the graphic script (but petitioner thinks should have) indirectly supports respondents contention that this opposition came out in their questionnaires (presumably by an answer of no to question 56 and an answer of yes to question 58).  But this is not the only evidence supporting respondents view.  Hinson, a white venireman who did not receive the graphic formulation, stated during voir dire

Respondent admits that the different questioning on minimum sentences was used as an effort to get veniremen the prosecution felt to be ambivalent about the death penalty dismissed for cause.  In making the decision whether to employ the manipulative minimum punishment script, prosecutors could rely on both the questionnaires and substantial 
				<em>
					voir dire
				</em>
				 testimony, as the minimum punishment questioning occurred much later in 
				<em>
					voir dire
				</em>
				 than the graphic formulation.

				Seven black veniremen were given the allegedly manipulative minimum punishment script, all of whom were opposed to the death penalty in varying degrees.  Rand, Kennedy, Bozeman, Warren, and Boggess views on the death penalty have all been exhaustively discussed.  This leaves Baker and Fields.  Bakers views on the death penalty were so clearly ambivalent that she is not even the subject of petitioners 
				<em>
					Batson
				</em>
				 challenge.  And Fields family history of criminality and views on rehabilitation, as earlier discussed,
				<em>
					 supra,
				</em>
				 at 10, and n. 7, convinced the prosecution to use a peremptory strike.

				  Finally, petitioners objection to the prosecutions decision not to use the manipulative punishment script on Woods, Reply Brief for Petitioner 17, n. 23, makes no sense.  Woods gave answers indicating he would be an excellent States jurorwhy would the prosecution have tried to eliminate him?  Of course, if petitioner were correct that the prosecution sought to eliminate blacks then one might expect that all methods, including the use of the manipulative script, would have been deployed against Woods, who happened to also be black.

            <em>

				Quite simply, petitioners arguments rest on circumstantial evidence and speculation that does not hold up to a thorough review of the record.  Far from rebutting §2254(e)(1)s presumption, petitioner has perhaps not even demonstrated that reasonable jurists could debate whether he has provided the requisite evidence of purposeful discriminationbut that is the majoritys inquiry, not mine.  Because petitioner has not demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that even one of the peremptory strikes at issue was the result of racial discrimination, I would affirm the denial of a COA.

						 The pre-AEDPA standard of factual deference provided:


In any proceeding instituted in a Federal court by an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court, a determination after a hearing on the merits of a factual issue, made by a State court of competent jurisdiction … shall be presumed to be correct, unless the applicant shall establish or it shall otherwise appear, or the respondent shall admit [enumerated exceptions omitted]… .

						 I am puzzled by the majoritys willingness to hold against respondent the failure of prosecutors to testify at the post-trial Batson hearing.  Petitioner could easily have requested that the reasons for the allegedly unconstitutional peremptory strikes be given again, and did not.  The attorney representing the State at the post-trial Batson hearing made certain that both trial prosecutors were present to reiterate the reasons they gave in the record for striking the challenged black veniremen.  App. at 865.  Petitioners counsel explicitly refused the opportunity to do so when it was offered. Ibid.  Furthermore, I fail to understand why a move that resulted in a more efficient hearing without redundant testimony should redound to the benefit of petitioner, who bears the burden of proof in this federal habeas corpus proceeding.

						 I do, however, agree with the majority that the Courts decisions in Hernandez v. New York, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/500/352" class="subref" title="subref">500 U. S. 352</a> (1991)
, and Purkett v. Elem, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/514/765" class="subref" title="subref">514 U. S. 765</a> (1995)
 (per curiam), can be helpful in guiding a federal habeas court deciding a claim under Batson v. Kentucky, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/476/79" class="subref" title="subref">476 U. S. 79</a> (1986)
.  For instance, both cases confirm that Batson step three turns on an evaluation of the prosecutors proffered race-neutral justifications for the peremptory challenges at issue.  Purkett, supra, at 768769; Hernandez, 500 U. S., at 364365 (plurality opinion); id., at 372 (OConnor, J., concurring in judgment); see also Batson, supra, at 98, n. 21.  Additionally, because Hernandezs clear error standard is less demanding of a criminal defendant than §2254(e)(1) is of a habeas applicant, a federal habeas court can deny relief on §2254(e)(1) grounds if it determines it would do so when reviewing the same facts for clear error.  Cf. Marshall v. Lonberger,

						 Petitioner directs the Court to white veniremen Noad Vickery, Cheryl Davis, Chatta Nix, and Joan Weiner as having family members with criminal histories, but points to white veniremen Sandra Hearn and Marie Mazza as equally ambivalent about the death penalty.

						 Again petitioner points to Vickery, Davis, Nix, and Weiner for similar family histories.  Justice Scalia has shown that none of these four were in fact similarly situated to Fields with respect to this justification.  Ante, at 67 (concurring opinion).  Petitioner also alleges that Hearn made pro-defense remarks about rehabilitation similar to those made by Fields.  Again, no white venireman even allegedly fits both reasons given for striking Fields.  Furthermore, even if Fields had only been struck for his views on rehabilitation, those views were in no way equivalent to those expressed by Hearn.  Fields answered yes to the question whether he believed that everyone can be rehabilitated.  App. at 118.  Fields went on to say that [i]t may be far-fetched, but I feel like, if a person has the opportunity to really be talked about God and he commits himself, whereas he has committed this offense, then if he turns his life around, that is rehabilitation.  Ibid.  In contrast, Hearn stated that she believe[d] in the death penalty if a criminal cannot be rehabilitated.  Id., at 694.


Petitioner tries to muddy the waters by pointing out that Fields was, in other respects, a good States juror because he supported the death penalty.  Brief for Petitioner 2425.  However, that does not change the fact that Fields said that everyone could be rehabilitated (and thus might have been swayed by a penitent defendants testimony) and Hearn insisted that some people could not be rehabilitated.  In analyzing Batson claims the focus should not be on the reasonableness of the asserted nonracial motive … [but] rather [on] the genuineness of the motive.  Purkett, 514 U. S., at 769 (emphasis in original).

						 The prosecutions stated reasons for striking Bozeman were that he was ambivalent about the death penalty and that he made pro-defense remarks about rehabilitation.  This is one case where the prosecution gave multiple reasons for a strike and petitioner actually correctly alleged the existence of a similarly situated white venireman, Hearn.  Petitioner believes, albeit erroneously, see ante, at 46 (Scalia, J., concurring), that Hearn expressed similar ambivalence about the death penalty and made pro-defense remarks about rehabilitation.

						 This analysis considers Hinson and Nelson as being clearly opposed to the death penalty in their questionnaires (answering question 56 no and question 58 yes) and Kennedy as being ambiguous (though in fact he answered question 56 yes and 58 no).  Even without these assumptions, 13 out of 15 veniremen who answered yes to question 56 and no to question 58indicating clear support for the death penaltydid not receive the graphic script.  And seven out of seven of those answering no and no or yes and yesindicating ambiguous or mixed feelings about the death penaltyor not answering clearly at all received the graphic script.  This yields an accuracy rate of 20 out of 22, or 91%.

				Unpersuaded by petitioners claims, the state trial court found that there was no purposeful discrimination by the prosecut[ion] in the use of … peremptory strikes, App. 878.  This finding established that petitioner had failed to carry his burden at step three of the inquiry set out in

C. §2254(e)(1)</a> requires that a federal habeas court presum[e] the state courts findings of fact to be correct unless petitioner can rebut the presumption by clear and convincing evidence.  The majority decides, without explanation, to ignore §2254(e)(1)s explicit command.  I cannot.  Because petitioner has not shown, by clear and convincing evidence, that any peremptory strikes of black veniremen were exercised because of race, he does not merit a certificate of appealability (COA).  I respectfully dissent.

				The Court agrees, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 17, that the state courts finding at step three of 
				<em>
					Batson
				</em>
				 is a finding of fact ordinarily subject to §2254(e)(1)s presumption of correctness:

        <p class="bodytext">

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
However, the Court implicitly rejects the obvious conclusion that the COA determination under §2253(c) is part of a proceeding instituted by an application for a writ of habeas corpus.  Instead of presuming the state courts factfindings to be correct, as §2254(e)(1) requires, the Court holds that petitioner need only show that reasonable jurists could disagree as to whether he can provide clear and convincing evidence that the finding was erroneous.

				</em>
				 at 484)).  But neither 
				<em>
					Slack
				</em>
				 nor any other decision of this Court addressing the COA procedure has ever considered a constitutional claim that turns entirely on issues of fact.  In these circumstances, it is the text of §2254(e)(1) that governs.

				Unlike the majority, I begin with the plain text of the statute that instructs federal courts how to treat state-court findings of fact.  At issue is what constitutes a proceeding for purposes of §2254(e)(1).  The word, proceeding, means [t]he regular and orderly progression of a lawsuit, including 
				<em>
					all acts and events between
				</em>
				 the time of commencement and the entry of judgment.  Blacks Law Dictionary 1221 (7th ed. 1999) (emphasis added).  The COA, standing alone, … does not assert a grievance against anyone, does not seek remedy or redress for any legal injury, and does not even require a party on the other side.  It is nothing more than a request for permission to seek review.

				I agree with the majority that the existence of a COA is a jurisdictional prerequisite to the merits appeal.  
				<em>
					Ante

				, at 11.  However, the Court takes a wrong turn when it implies that the merits appeal is part of the habeas process (or proceeding) but the COA determination somehow is not.  Overwhelming authority (including the majority opinion) confirms that §2254(e)(1) applies to the merits appeal.  See

 (pre-Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) factual deference provision with virtually identical language applies to merits appeal).  The COA determination should be treated no differently, because §2254(e)(1) draws no distinction between the merits appeal and the COA.  The Courts silent conclusion to the contrary is simply illogical.  The COAs status as the jurisdictional prerequisite for the merits appeal requires that 
				<em>

				The Courts rejection of this conclusion also conflicts with pre-AEDPA practice.  Prior to AEDPA, access to a merits appeal in federal habeas corpus proceedings was governed by a mechanism similar to the COA, known as a certificate of probable cause, or CPC.  See 
				<em>
					Slack
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra,

				  Under these provisions (indistinguishable from AEDPAs for these purposes), courts concluded that §2254(e)(1)s predecessor applied directly to the CPC proceeding, without any filtering through the debatability standard the Court has used in both the CPC and COA contexts.  See,

				Unlike an appellate courts review of district court findings of fact for clear error, §2254(e)(1) establishes a presumption of correctness.  It requires that the federal habeas court assume the state court that entered the findings was the best placed factfinder with the most complete record and 
				<em>

				</em>
				ask whether the petitioner can refute that factual finding by clear and convincing evidence.  Procedural imperfections ordinarily will not affect this presumption; thus, it does not matter whether the state judge made his decision two years late or with a less-than-perfect record.  Admittedly these conditions might increase the

				<em>

				This reading is confirmed by the changes worked by AEDPA.  Section 2254(e)(1) does not, as its predecessor did, create exceptions to factual deference for procedural infirmities.  For example, prior to AEDPA, a federal habeas court would not defer to state-court determinations of fact if the factfinding procedure employed by the State court was not adequate to afford a full and fair hearing, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2254.html#d_2" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S.

The removal of these exceptions forecloses the use of marginal procedural complaintssuch as a delay between 
				<em>
					voir dire
				</em>
				 and a 
				<em>
					Batson

				 hearingto determine whether or how much a federal habeas court will defer to state-court factfinding.

				Section 2254(e)(1) simply cannot be read to contain an implied sliding scale of deference.  I do not understand the Court to disagree with this view, however, as its dicta does not actually purport to interpret the text of §2254(e)(1).

				For the three challenged peremptory strikes used on Fields, Warren, and Boggess, petitioner has not even correctly alleged the existence of similarly situated white veniremen.

Fields, Warren, and Boggess were struck for having family members with criminal histories.  Bozeman and Fields were struck for making pro-defense remarks about rehabilitation.

				The Courts treatment of this issue focuses on the apparent disparity in treatment of 10 black veniremen and 10 white veniremen who were supposedly similar in their opposition to the death penalty.  The majority notes that only 2 out of these 10 whites got the graphic description while 7 out of 10 blacks did.

				, at 20.  But the Court neglects to mention that the eight white veniremen who petitioner thinks should have received the graphic formulation, Reply Brief for Petitioner 15, n. 19, were so emphatically opposed to the death penalty that such a description would have served no purpose in clarifying their position on the issue.  No trial lawyer would willingly antagonize a potential juror ardently opposed to the death penalty with an extreme portrait of its implementation.  The strategy pursued by the prosecution makes perfect sense: When it was necessary to draw out a veniremans feelings about the death penalty they would use the graphic script, but when it was overkill they would not.
				    
				The record demonstrates that six of these eight white veniremen were so opposed to the death penalty that they were stricken for cause without the need for the prosecution to spend a peremptory challenge.  For example, John Nelson wrote on his questionnaire, I believe that the State does not have the right to take anyones life, Tr. of Voir Dire in No. F8578668NL (5th Crim. Dist.

				First, as already noted, the deeper and clearer opposition to the death penalty on the part of the eight whites who did not receive the graphic script (but petitioner thinks should have) indirectly supports respondents contention that this opposition came out in their questionnaires (presumably by an answer of no to question 56 and an answer of yes to question 58).  But this is not the only evidence supporting respondents view.  Hinson, a white venireman who did not receive the graphic formulation, stated during voir dire

				Petitioner fares no better with his allegation that the prosecution employed two different scripts on the basis of race when asking questions about imposition of the minimum sentence.  Indeed, this disparate questioning argument is as flawed as the last one.  Respondent admits that the different questioning on minimum sentences was used as an effort to get veniremen the prosecution felt to be ambivalent about the death penalty dismissed for cause.  In making the decision whether to employ the manipulative minimum punishment script, prosecutors could rely on both the questionnaires and substantial

				  Finally, petitioners objection to the prosecutions decision not to use the manipulative punishment script on Woods, Reply Brief for Petitioner 17, n. 23, makes no sense.  Woods gave answers indicating he would be an excellent States jurorwhy would the prosecution have tried to eliminate him?  Of course, if petitioner were correct that the prosecution sought to eliminate blacks then one might expect that all methods, including the use of the manipulative script, would have been deployed against Woods, who happened to also be black.

				Quite simply, petitioners arguments rest on circumstantial evidence and speculation that does not hold up to a thorough review of the record.  Far from rebutting §2254(e)(1)s presumption, petitioner has perhaps not even demonstrated that reasonable jurists could debate whether he has provided the requisite evidence of purposeful discriminationbut that is the majoritys inquiry, not mine.  Because petitioner has not demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that even one of the peremptory strikes at issue was the result of racial discrimination, I would affirm the denial of a COA.

						 The pre-AEDPA standard of factual deference provided:


In any proceeding instituted in a Federal court by an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court, a determination after a hearing on the merits of a factual issue, made by a State court of competent jurisdiction … shall be presumed to be correct, unless the applicant shall establish or it shall otherwise appear, or the respondent shall admit [enumerated exceptions omitted]… .

						 I am puzzled by the majoritys willingness to hold against respondent the failure of prosecutors to testify at the post-trial Batson hearing.  Petitioner could easily have requested that the reasons for the allegedly unconstitutional peremptory strikes be given again, and did not.  The attorney representing the State at the post-trial Batson hearing made certain that both trial prosecutors were present to reiterate the reasons they gave in the record for striking the challenged black veniremen.  App. at 865.  Petitioners counsel explicitly refused the opportunity to do so when it was offered. Ibid.  Furthermore, I fail to understand why a move that resulted in a more efficient hearing without redundant testimony should redound to the benefit of petitioner, who bears the burden of proof in this federal habeas corpus proceeding.

						 I do, however, agree with the majority that the Courts decisions in Hernandez v. New York, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/500/352" class="subref" title="subref">500 U. S. 352</a> (1991)
, and Purkett v. Elem, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/514/765" class="subref" title="subref">514 U. S. 765</a> (1995)
 (per curiam), can be helpful in guiding a federal habeas court deciding a claim under Batson v. Kentucky, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/476/79" class="subref" title="subref">476 U. S. 79</a> (1986)
.  For instance, both cases confirm that Batson step three turns on an evaluation of the prosecutors proffered race-neutral justifications for the peremptory challenges at issue.  Purkett, supra, at 768769; Hernandez, 500 U. S., at 364365 (plurality opinion); id., at 372 (OConnor, J., concurring in judgment); see also Batson, supra, at 98, n. 21.  Additionally, because Hernandezs clear error standard is less demanding of a criminal defendant than §2254(e)(1) is of a habeas applicant, a federal habeas court can deny relief on §2254(e)(1) grounds if it determines it would do so when reviewing the same facts for clear error.  Cf. Marshall v. Lonberger,

						 Again petitioner points to Vickery, Davis, Nix, and Weiner for similar family histories.  Justice Scalia has shown that none of these four were in fact similarly situated to Fields with respect to this justification.  Ante, at 67 (concurring opinion).  Petitioner also alleges that Hearn made pro-defense remarks about rehabilitation similar to those made by Fields.  Again, no white venireman even allegedly fits both reasons given for striking Fields.  Furthermore, even if Fields had only been struck for his views on rehabilitation, those views were in no way equivalent to those expressed by Hearn.  Fields answered yes to the question whether he believed that everyone can be rehabilitated.  App. at 118.  Fields went on to say that [i]t may be far-fetched, but I feel like, if a person has the opportunity to really be talked about God and he commits himself, whereas he has committed this offense, then if he turns his life around, that is rehabilitation.  Ibid.  In contrast, Hearn stated that she believe[d] in the death penalty if a criminal cannot be rehabilitated.  Id., at 694.


Petitioner tries to muddy the waters by pointing out that Fields was, in other respects, a good States juror because he supported the death penalty.  Brief for Petitioner 2425.  However, that does not change the fact that Fields said that everyone could be rehabilitated (and thus might have been swayed by a penitent defendants testimony) and Hearn insisted that some people could not be rehabilitated.  In analyzing Batson claims the focus should not be on the reasonableness of the asserted nonracial motive … [but] rather [on] the genuineness of the motive.  Purkett, 514 U. S., at 769 (emphasis in original).

						 The prosecutions stated reasons for striking Bozeman were that he was ambivalent about the death penalty and that he made pro-defense remarks about rehabilitation.  This is one case where the prosecution gave multiple reasons for a strike and petitioner actually correctly alleged the existence of a similarly situated white venireman, Hearn.  Petitioner believes, albeit erroneously, see ante, at 46 (Scalia, J., concurring), that Hearn expressed similar ambivalence about the death penalty and made pro-defense remarks about rehabilitation.

						 This analysis considers Hinson and Nelson as being clearly opposed to the death penalty in their questionnaires (answering question 56 no and question 58 yes) and Kennedy as being ambiguous (though in fact he answered question 56 yes and 58 no).  Even without these assumptions, 13 out of 15 veniremen who answered yes to question 56 and no to question 58indicating clear support for the death penaltydid not receive the graphic script.  And seven out of seven of those answering no and no or yes and yesindicating ambiguous or mixed feelings about the death penaltyor not answering clearly at all received the graphic script.

				Unpersuaded by petitioners claims, the state trial court found that there was no purposeful discrimination by the prosecut[ion] in the use of … peremptory strikes, App. 878.  This finding established that petitioner had failed to carry his burden at step three of the inquiry set out in

C. §2254(e)(1)</a> requires that a federal habeas court presum[e] the state courts findings of fact to be correct unless petitioner can rebut the presumption by clear and convincing evidence.  The majority decides, without explanation, to ignore §2254(e)(1)s explicit command.  I cannot.  Because petitioner has not shown, by clear and convincing evidence, that any peremptory strikes of black veniremen were exercised because of race, he does not merit a certificate of appealability (COA).  I respectfully dissent.

				The Court agrees, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 17, that the state courts finding at step three of 
				<em>
					Batson
				</em>
				 is a finding of fact ordinarily subject to §2254(e)(1)s presumption of correctness:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				In a proceeding instituted by an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court, a determination of a factual issue made by a State court shall be presumed to be correct.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
However, the Court implicitly rejects the obvious conclusion that the COA determination under §2253(c) is part of a proceeding instituted by an application for a writ of habeas corpus.  Instead of presuming the state courts factfindings to be correct, as §2254(e)(1) requires, the Court holds that petitioner need only show that reasonable jurists could disagree as to whether he can provide clear and convincing evidence that the finding was erroneous.  
				<em>

					Slack

				 v.

				<em>
					Slack

				, 
				<em>
					supra,
				</em>
				 at 484)).  But neither 
				<em>
					Slack
				</em>
				 nor any other decision of this Court addressing the COA procedure has ever considered a constitutional claim that turns entirely on issues of fact.  In these circumstances, it is the text of §2254(e)(1) that governs.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Unlike the majority, I begin with the plain text of the statute that instructs federal courts how to treat state-court findings of fact.  At issue is what constitutes a proceeding for purposes of §2254(e)(1).  The word, proceeding, means [t]he regular and orderly progression of a lawsuit, including 
				<em>
					all acts and events between
				</em>
				 the time of commencement and the entry of judgment.  Blacks Law Dictionary 1221 (7th ed. 1999) (emphasis added).  The COA, standing alone, … does not assert a grievance against anyone, does not seek remedy or redress for any legal injury, and does not even require a party on the other side.  It is nothing more than a request for permission to seek review.

				I agree with the majority that the existence of a COA is a jurisdictional prerequisite to the merits appeal.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 11.  However, the Court takes a wrong turn when it implies that the merits appeal is part of the habeas process (or proceeding) but the COA determination somehow is not.  Overwhelming authority (including the majority opinion) confirms that §2254(e)(1) applies to the merits appeal.  See

 (pre-Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) factual deference provision with virtually identical language applies to merits appeal).  The COA determination should be treated no differently, because §2254(e)(1) draws no distinction between the merits appeal and the COA.  The Courts silent conclusion to the contrary is simply illogical.  The COAs status as the jurisdictional prerequisite for the merits appeal requires that 
				<em>
					both
				</em>
				 the COA determination 
				<em>
					and
				</em>
				 the merits appeal be considered a part of the same proceeding.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Courts rejection of this conclusion also conflicts with pre-AEDPA practice.  Prior to AEDPA, access to a merits appeal in federal habeas corpus proceedings was governed by a mechanism similar to the COA, known as a certificate of probable cause, or CPC.  See 
				<em>
					Slack
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra,
				</em>
				 at 480.  There was also a standard of factual deference similar to, though weaker than, the standard in §2254(e)(1).  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2254.html#d" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2254(d)</a> (1994 ed.).

            </a>
				  Under these provisions (indistinguishable from AEDPAs for these purposes), courts concluded that §2254(e)(1)s predecessor applied directly to the CPC proceeding, without any filtering through the debatability standard the Court has used in both the CPC and COA contexts.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.

				, 
				<em>

				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Collins
				</em>
				, 953 F. 2d 167, 169 (CA5 1992).  These cases support the straightforward notion that §2254(e)(1), like its predecessor did with respect to CPC proceedings, applies directly to the COA proceeding.

				The Courts decision in 
				<em>

            <em>

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1254.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1254</a>, is not to the contrary.  
				<em>
					Hohn
				</em>
				 does not hold, nor does its logic require, that the COA determination be regarded as separate from the rest of the habeas proceeding.  In fact,

				 rejected the proposition that a request to proceed before a court of appeals should be regarded as a threshold inquiry

				Unlike an appellate courts review of district court findings of fact for clear error, §2254(e)(1) establishes a presumption of correctness.  It requires that the federal habeas court assume the state court that entered the findings was the best placed factfinder with the most complete record and 
				<em>
					only then 
				</em>
				ask whether the petitioner can refute that factual finding by clear and convincing evidence.  Procedural imperfections ordinarily will not affect this presumption; thus, it does not matter whether the state judge made his decision two years late or with a less-than-perfect record.  Admittedly these conditions might increase the 
				<em>

				 that a habeas applicant could locate helpful evidence, but to presume facts correct means a court cannot allow a habeas applicant to evade §2254(e)(1) by attacking the process employed by the state

				 rather than the actual 
				<em>
					factfindings

				.

				This reading is confirmed by the changes worked by AEDPA.  Section 2254(e)(1) does not, as its predecessor did, create exceptions to factual deference for procedural infirmities.  For example, prior to AEDPA, a federal habeas court would not defer to state-court determinations of fact if the factfinding procedure employed by the State court was not adequate to afford a full and fair hearing, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2254.html#d_2" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S.

The removal of these exceptions forecloses the use of marginal procedural complaintssuch as a delay between 
				<em>
					voir dire
				</em>
				 and a 
				<em>
					Batson

				 hearingto determine whether or how much a federal habeas court will defer to state-court factfinding.

				Section 2254(e)(1) simply cannot be read to contain an implied sliding scale of deference.  I do not understand the Court to disagree with this view, however, as its dicta does not actually purport to interpret the text of §2254(e)(1).

				The Courts treatment of this issue focuses on the apparent disparity in treatment of 10 black veniremen and 10 white veniremen who were supposedly similar in their opposition to the death penalty.  The majority notes that only 2 out of these 10 whites got the graphic description while 7 out of 10 blacks did.

But the Court neglects to mention that the eight white veniremen who petitioner thinks should have received the graphic formulation, Reply Brief for Petitioner 15, n. 19, were so emphatically opposed to the death penalty that such a description would have served no purpose in clarifying their position on the issue.  No trial lawyer would willingly antagonize a potential juror ardently opposed to the death penalty with an extreme portrait of its implementation.  The strategy pursued by the prosecution makes perfect sense: When it was necessary to draw out a veniremans feelings about the death penalty they would use the graphic script, but when it was overkill they would not.
				    
				The record demonstrates that six of these eight white veniremen were so opposed to the death penalty that they were stricken for cause without the need for the prosecution to spend a peremptory challenge.

				First, as already noted, the deeper and clearer opposition to the death penalty on the part of the eight whites who did not receive the graphic script (but petitioner thinks should have) indirectly supports respondents contention that this opposition came out in their questionnaires (presumably by an answer of no to question 56 and an answer of yes to question 58).  But this is not the only evidence supporting respondents view.  Hinson, a white venireman who did not receive the graphic formulation, stated during voir dire

				Petitioner fares no better with his allegation that the prosecution employed two different scripts on the basis of race when asking questions about imposition of the minimum sentence.  Indeed, this disparate questioning argument is as flawed as the last one.  Respondent admits that the different questioning on minimum sentences was used as an effort to get veniremen the prosecution felt to be ambivalent about the death penalty dismissed for cause.  In making the decision whether to employ the manipulative minimum punishment script, prosecutors could rely on both the questionnaires and substantial 
				<em>

				  Finally, petitioners objection to the prosecutions decision not to use the manipulative punishment script on Woods, Reply Brief for Petitioner 17, n. 23, makes no sense.  Woods gave answers indicating he would be an excellent States jurorwhy would the prosecution have tried to eliminate him?

				Quite simply, petitioners arguments rest on circumstantial evidence and speculation that does not hold up to a thorough review of the record.  Far from rebutting §2254(e)(1)s presumption, petitioner has perhaps not even demonstrated that reasonable jurists could debate whether he has provided the requisite evidence of purposeful discriminationbut that is the majoritys inquiry, not mine.  Because petitioner has not demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that even one of the peremptory strikes at issue was the result of racial discrimination, I would affirm the denial of a COA.

						 The pre-AEDPA standard of factual deference provided:


In any proceeding instituted in a Federal court by an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court, a determination after a hearing on the merits of a factual issue, made by a State court of competent jurisdiction … shall be presumed to be correct, unless the applicant shall establish or it shall otherwise appear, or the respondent shall admit [enumerated exceptions omitted]… .  And in an evidentiary hearing … the burden shall rest upon the applicant to establish by convincing evidence that the factual determination by the State court was erroneous.

						 I am puzzled by the majoritys willingness to hold against respondent the failure of prosecutors to testify at the post-trial Batson hearing.  Petitioner could easily have requested that the reasons for the allegedly unconstitutional peremptory strikes be given again, and did not.  The attorney representing the State at the post-trial Batson hearing made certain that both trial prosecutors were present to reiterate the reasons they gave in the record for striking the challenged black veniremen.  App. at 865.  Petitioners counsel explicitly refused the opportunity to do so when it was offered. Ibid.  Furthermore, I fail to understand why a move that resulted in a more efficient hearing without redundant testimony should redound to the benefit of petitioner, who bears the burden of proof in this federal habeas corpus proceeding.

						 I do, however, agree with the majority that the Courts decisions in Hernandez v. New York, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/500/352" class="subref" title="subref">500 U. S. 352</a> (1991)
, and Purkett v. Elem, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/514/765" class="subref" title="subref">514 U. S. 765</a> (1995)
 (per curiam), can be helpful in guiding a federal habeas court deciding a claim under Batson v. Kentucky, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/476/79" class="subref" title="subref">476 U. S. 79</a> (1986)
.  For instance, both cases confirm that Batson step three turns on an evaluation of the prosecutors proffered race-neutral justifications for the peremptory challenges at issue.  Purkett, supra, at 768769; Hernandez, 500 U. S., at 364365 (plurality opinion); id., at 372 (OConnor, J., concurring in judgment); see also Batson, supra, at 98, n. 21.  Additionally, because Hernandezs clear error standard is less demanding of a criminal defendant than §2254(e)(1) is of a habeas applicant, a federal habeas court can deny relief on §2254(e)(1) grounds if it determines it would do so when reviewing the same facts for clear error.  Cf. Marshall v. Lonberger, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/459/422" class="subref" title="subref">459 U. S. 422</a>,

						 Again petitioner points to Vickery, Davis, Nix, and Weiner for similar family histories.  Justice Scalia has shown that none of these four were in fact similarly situated to Fields with respect to this justification.  Ante, at 67 (concurring opinion).  Petitioner also alleges that Hearn made pro-defense remarks about rehabilitation similar to those made by Fields.  Again, no white venireman even allegedly fits both reasons given for striking Fields.  Furthermore, even if Fields had only been struck for his views on rehabilitation, those views were in no way equivalent to those expressed by Hearn.  Fields answered yes to the question whether he believed that everyone can be rehabilitated.  App. at 118.  Fields went on to say that [i]t may be far-fetched, but I feel like, if a person has the opportunity to really be talked about God and he commits himself, whereas he has committed this offense, then if he turns his life around, that is rehabilitation.  Ibid.  In contrast, Hearn stated that she believe[d] in the death penalty if a criminal cannot be rehabilitated.  Id., at 694.


Petitioner tries to muddy the waters by pointing out that Fields was, in other respects, a good States juror because he supported the death penalty.  Brief for Petitioner 2425.  However, that does not change the fact that Fields said that everyone could be rehabilitated (and thus might have been swayed by a penitent defendants testimony) and Hearn insisted that some people could not be rehabilitated.  In analyzing Batson claims the focus should not be on the reasonableness of the asserted nonracial motive … [but] rather [on] the genuineness of the motive.  Purkett, 514 U. S., at 769 (emphasis in original).

						 The prosecutions stated reasons for striking Bozeman were that he was ambivalent about the death penalty and that he made pro-defense remarks about rehabilitation.  This is one case where the prosecution gave multiple reasons for a strike and petitioner actually correctly alleged the existence of a similarly situated white venireman, Hearn.  Petitioner believes, albeit erroneously, see ante, at 46 (Scalia, J., concurring), that Hearn expressed similar ambivalence about the death penalty and made pro-defense remarks about rehabilitation.

						 This analysis considers Hinson and Nelson as being clearly opposed to the death penalty in their questionnaires (answering question 56 no and question 58 yes) and Kennedy as being ambiguous (though in fact he answered question 56 yes and 58 no).  Even without these assumptions, 13 out of 15 veniremen who answered yes to question 56 and no to question 58indicating clear support for the death penaltydid not receive the graphic script.  And seven out of seven of those answering no and no or yes and yesindicating ambiguous or mixed feelings about the death penaltyor not answering clearly at all received the graphic script.  This yields an accuracy rate of 20 out of 22, or 91%.

				Unpersuaded by petitioners claims, the state trial court found that there was no purposeful discrimination by the prosecut[ion] in the use of … peremptory strikes, App. 878.  This finding established that petitioner had failed to carry his burden at step three of the inquiry set out in 
				<em>

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2254.html#e_1" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2254(e)(1)</a> requires that a federal habeas court presum[e] the state courts findings of fact to be correct unless petitioner can rebut the presumption by clear and convincing evidence.  The majority decides, without explanation, to ignore §2254(e)(1)s explicit command.  I cannot.  Because petitioner has not shown, by clear and convincing evidence, that any peremptory strikes of black veniremen were exercised because of race, he does not merit a certificate of appealability (COA).  I respectfully dissent.

				The Court agrees, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 17, that the state courts finding at step three of 
				<em>
					Batson
				</em>
				 is a finding of fact ordinarily subject to §2254(e)(1)s presumption of correctness:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				In a proceeding instituted by an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court, a determination of a factual issue made by a State court shall be presumed to be correct.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
However, the Court implicitly rejects the obvious conclusion that the COA determination under §2253(c) is part of a proceeding instituted by an application for a writ of habeas corpus.  Instead of presuming the state courts factfindings to be correct, as §2254(e)(1) requires, the Court holds that petitioner need only show that reasonable jurists could disagree as to whether he can provide clear and convincing evidence that the finding was erroneous.  
				<em>

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Courts main justification for this conclusion is supposed fidelity to 
				<em>
					Slack

				 v.

            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/529/473" class="subref" title="subref">529 U. S. 473</a> (2000)

				<em>
					Slack
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra,
				</em>
				 at 484)).  But neither 
				<em>
					Slack
				</em>
				 nor any other decision of this Court addressing the COA procedure has ever considered a constitutional claim that turns entirely on issues of fact.  In these circumstances, it is the text of §2254(e)(1) that governs.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Unlike the majority, I begin with the plain text of the statute that instructs federal courts how to treat state-court findings of fact.  At issue is what constitutes a proceeding for purposes of §2254(e)(1).  The word, proceeding, means [t]he regular and orderly progression of a lawsuit, including 
				<em>
					all acts and events between
				</em>
				 the time of commencement and the entry of judgment.  Blacks Law Dictionary 1221 (7th ed. 1999) (emphasis added).  The COA, standing alone, … does not assert a grievance against anyone, does not seek remedy or redress for any legal injury, and does not even require a party on the other side.  It is nothing more than a request for permission to seek review.

				I agree with the majority that the existence of a COA is a jurisdictional prerequisite to the merits appeal.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 11.  However, the Court takes a wrong turn when it implies that the merits appeal is part of the habeas process (or proceeding) but the COA determination somehow is not.  Overwhelming authority (including the majority opinion) confirms that §2254(e)(1) applies to the merits appeal.  See

 (pre-Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) factual deference provision with virtually identical language applies to merits appeal).  The COA determination should be treated no differently, because §2254(e)(1) draws no distinction between the merits appeal and the COA.  The Courts silent conclusion to the contrary is simply illogical.  The COAs status as the jurisdictional prerequisite for the merits appeal requires that 
				<em>
					both
				</em>
				 the COA determination 
				<em>
					and
				</em>
				 the merits appeal be considered a part of the same proceeding.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Courts rejection of this conclusion also conflicts with pre-AEDPA practice.  Prior to AEDPA, access to a merits appeal in federal habeas corpus proceedings was governed by a mechanism similar to the COA, known as a certificate of probable cause, or CPC.  See 
				<em>
					Slack
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra,
				</em>
				 at 480.  There was also a standard of factual deference similar to, though weaker than, the standard in §2254(e)(1).  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2254.html#d" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2254(d)</a> (1994 ed.).

            </a>
				  Under these provisions (indistinguishable from AEDPAs for these purposes), courts concluded that §2254(e)(1)s predecessor applied directly to the CPC proceeding, without any filtering through the debatability standard the Court has used in both the CPC and COA contexts.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Barnard
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>

				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Collins
				</em>
				, 953 F. 2d 167, 169 (CA5 1992).  These cases support the straightforward notion that §2254(e)(1), like its predecessor did with respect to CPC proceedings, applies directly to the COA proceeding.

				The Courts decision in 
				<em>

				</em>
            <em>

				 which holds that the COA determination constitutes a case in the court of appeals for purposes of this Courts jurisdiction under 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1254.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1254</a>, is not to the contrary.  
				<em>
					Hohn
				</em>
				 does not hold, nor does its logic require, that the COA determination be regarded as separate from the rest of the habeas proceeding.  In fact, 
				<em>

				 rejected the proposition that a request to proceed before a court of appeals should be regarded as a threshold inquiry

				Unlike an appellate courts review of district court findings of fact for clear error, §2254(e)(1) establishes a presumption of correctness.  It requires that the federal habeas court assume the state court that entered the findings was the best placed factfinder with the most complete record and 
				<em>
					only then 
				</em>
				ask whether the petitioner can refute that factual finding by clear and convincing evidence.  Procedural imperfections ordinarily will not affect this presumption; thus, it does not matter whether the state judge made his decision two years late or with a less-than-perfect record.  Admittedly these conditions might increase the 
				<em>
					odds
				</em>
				 that a habeas applicant could locate helpful evidence, but to presume facts correct means a court cannot allow a habeas applicant to evade §2254(e)(1) by attacking the process employed by the state 
				<em>
					factfinder
				</em>
				 rather than the actual 
				<em>
					factfindings
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				This reading is confirmed by the changes worked by AEDPA.  Section 2254(e)(1) does not, as its predecessor did, create exceptions to factual deference for procedural infirmities.  For example, prior to AEDPA, a federal habeas court would not defer to state-court determinations of fact if the factfinding procedure employed by the State court was not adequate to afford a full and fair hearing, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2254.html#d_2" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(2)</a> (1994 ed.), the material facts were not adequately developed at the State court hearing, §2254(d)(3), or the applicant did not receive a full, fair, and adequate hearing, §2254(d)(6).  The removal of these exceptions forecloses the use of marginal procedural complaintssuch as a delay between 
				<em>
					voir dire
				</em>
				 and a 
				<em>
					Batson
				</em>
				 hearingto determine whether or how much a federal habeas court will defer to state-court factfinding.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Section 2254(e)(1) simply cannot be read to contain an implied sliding scale of deference.  I do not understand the Court to disagree with this view, however, as its dicta does not actually purport to interpret the text of §2254(e)(1).

Fields, Warren, and Boggess were struck for having family members with criminal histories.  Bozeman and Fields were struck for making pro-defense remarks about rehabilitation.

				The Courts treatment of this issue focuses on the apparent disparity in treatment of 10 black veniremen and 10 white veniremen who were supposedly similar in their opposition to the death penalty.  The majority notes that only 2 out of these 10 whites got the graphic description while 7 out of 10 blacks did.

But the Court neglects to mention that the eight white veniremen who petitioner thinks should have received the graphic formulation, Reply Brief for Petitioner 15, n. 19, were so emphatically opposed to the death penalty that such a description would have served no purpose in clarifying their position on the issue.  No trial lawyer would willingly antagonize a potential juror ardently opposed to the death penalty with an extreme portrait of its implementation.  The strategy pursued by the prosecution makes perfect sense: When it was necessary to draw out a veniremans feelings about the death penalty they would use the graphic script, but when it was overkill they would not.
				    
				The record demonstrates that six of these eight white veniremen were so opposed to the death penalty that they were stricken for cause without the need for the prosecution to spend a peremptory challenge.  For example, John Nelson wrote on his questionnaire, I believe that the State does not have the right to take anyones life, Tr. of Voir Dire in No. F8578668NL (5th Crim. Dist.

				First, as already noted, the deeper and clearer opposition to the death penalty on the part of the eight whites who did not receive the graphic script (but petitioner thinks should have) indirectly supports respondents contention that this opposition came out in their questionnaires (presumably by an answer of no to question 56 and an answer of yes to question 58).  But this is not the only evidence supporting respondents view.  Hinson, a white venireman who did not receive the graphic formulation, stated during voir dire

				Petitioner fares no better with his allegation that the prosecution employed two different scripts on the basis of race when asking questions about imposition of the minimum sentence.  Indeed, this disparate questioning argument is as flawed as the last one.  Respondent admits that the different questioning on minimum sentences was used as an effort to get veniremen the prosecution felt to be ambivalent about the death penalty dismissed for cause.  In making the decision whether to employ the manipulative minimum punishment script, prosecutors could rely on both the questionnaires and substantial 
				<em>

Bakers views on the death penalty were so clearly ambivalent that she is not even the subject of petitioners 
				<em>

				 challenge.  And Fields family history of criminality and views on rehabilitation, as earlier discussed,
				<em>

				  Finally, petitioners objection to the prosecutions decision not to use the manipulative punishment script on Woods, Reply Brief for Petitioner 17, n. 23, makes no sense.  Woods gave answers indicating he would be an excellent States jurorwhy would the prosecution have tried to eliminate him?  Of course, if petitioner were correct that the prosecution sought to eliminate blacks then one might expect that all methods, including the use of the manipulative script, would have been deployed against Woods, who happened to also be black.

				Quite simply, petitioners arguments rest on circumstantial evidence and speculation that does not hold up to a thorough review of the record.  Far from rebutting §2254(e)(1)s presumption, petitioner has perhaps not even demonstrated that reasonable jurists could debate whether he has provided the requisite evidence of purposeful discriminationbut that is the majoritys inquiry, not mine.  Because petitioner has not demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that even one of the peremptory strikes at issue was the result of racial discrimination, I would affirm the denial of a COA.

						 The pre-AEDPA standard of factual deference provided:


In any proceeding instituted in a Federal court by an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court, a determination after a hearing on the merits of a factual issue, made by a State court of competent jurisdiction … shall be presumed to be correct, unless the applicant shall establish or it shall otherwise appear, or the respondent shall admit [enumerated exceptions omitted]… .  And in an evidentiary hearing … the burden shall rest upon the applicant to establish by convincing evidence that the factual determination by the State court was erroneous.

						 I am puzzled by the majoritys willingness to hold against respondent the failure of prosecutors to testify at the post-trial Batson hearing.  Petitioner could easily have requested that the reasons for the allegedly unconstitutional peremptory strikes be given again, and did not.  The attorney representing the State at the post-trial Batson hearing made certain that both trial prosecutors were present to reiterate the reasons they gave in the record for striking the challenged black veniremen.  App. at 865.  Petitioners counsel explicitly refused the opportunity to do so when it was offered. Ibid.  Furthermore, I fail to understand why a move that resulted in a more efficient hearing without redundant testimony should redound to the benefit of petitioner, who bears the burden of proof in this federal habeas corpus proceeding.

						 I do, however, agree with the majority that the Courts decisions in Hernandez v. New York, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/500/352" class="subref" title="subref">500 U. S. 352</a> (1991)
, and Purkett v. Elem, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/514/765" class="subref" title="subref">514 U. S. 765</a> (1995)
 (per curiam), can be helpful in guiding a federal habeas court deciding a claim under Batson v. Kentucky, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/476/79" class="subref" title="subref">476 U. S. 79</a> (1986)
.  For instance, both cases confirm that Batson step three turns on an evaluation of the prosecutors proffered race-neutral justifications for the peremptory challenges at issue.  Purkett, supra, at 768769; Hernandez, 500 U. S., at 364365 (plurality opinion); id., at 372 (OConnor, J., concurring in judgment); see also Batson, supra, at 98, n. 21.  Additionally, because Hernandezs clear error standard is less demanding of a criminal defendant than §2254(e)(1) is of a habeas applicant, a federal habeas court can deny relief on §2254(e)(1) grounds if it determines it would do so when reviewing the same facts for clear error.  Cf. Marshall v. Lonberger,

						 Again petitioner points to Vickery, Davis, Nix, and Weiner for similar family histories.  Justice Scalia has shown that none of these four were in fact similarly situated to Fields with respect to this justification.  Ante, at 67 (concurring opinion).  Petitioner also alleges that Hearn made pro-defense remarks about rehabilitation similar to those made by Fields.  Again, no white venireman even allegedly fits both reasons given for striking Fields.  Furthermore, even if Fields had only been struck for his views on rehabilitation, those views were in no way equivalent to those expressed by Hearn.  Fields answered yes to the question whether he believed that everyone can be rehabilitated.  App. at 118.  Fields went on to say that [i]t may be far-fetched, but I feel like, if a person has the opportunity to really be talked about God and he commits himself, whereas he has committed this offense, then if he turns his life around, that is rehabilitation.  Ibid.  In contrast, Hearn stated that she believe[d] in the death penalty if a criminal cannot be rehabilitated.  Id., at 694.


Petitioner tries to muddy the waters by pointing out that Fields was, in other respects, a good States juror because he supported the death penalty.  Brief for Petitioner 2425.  However, that does not change the fact that Fields said that everyone could be rehabilitated (and thus might have been swayed by a penitent defendants testimony) and Hearn insisted that some people could not be rehabilitated.  In analyzing Batson claims the focus should not be on the reasonableness of the asserted nonracial motive … [but] rather [on] the genuineness of the motive.  Purkett, 514 U. S., at 769 (emphasis in original).

						 The prosecutions stated reasons for striking Bozeman were that he was ambivalent about the death penalty and that he made pro-defense remarks about rehabilitation.  This is one case where the prosecution gave multiple reasons for a strike and petitioner actually correctly alleged the existence of a similarly situated white venireman, Hearn.  Petitioner believes, albeit erroneously, see ante, at 46 (Scalia, J., concurring), that Hearn expressed similar ambivalence about the death penalty and made pro-defense remarks about rehabilitation.

Even without these assumptions, 13 out of 15 veniremen who answered yes to question 56 and no to question 58indicating clear support for the death penaltydid not receive the graphic script.

				Unpersuaded by petitioners claims, the state trial court found that there was no purposeful discrimination by the prosecut[ion] in the use of … peremptory strikes, App. 878.  This finding established that petitioner had failed to carry his burden at step three of the inquiry set out in

C. §2254(e)(1)</a> requires that a federal habeas court presum[e] the state courts findings of fact to be correct unless petitioner can rebut the presumption by clear and convincing evidence.  The majority decides, without explanation, to ignore §2254(e)(1)s explicit command.  I cannot.  Because petitioner has not shown, by clear and convincing evidence, that any peremptory strikes of black veniremen were exercised because of race, he does not merit a certificate of appealability (COA).  I respectfully dissent.

				The Court agrees, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 17, that the state courts finding at step three of 
				<em>
					Batson
				</em>
				 is a finding of fact ordinarily subject to §2254(e)(1)s presumption of correctness:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				In a proceeding instituted by an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court, a determination of a factual issue made by a State court shall be presumed to be correct.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
However, the Court implicitly rejects the obvious conclusion that the COA determination under §2253(c) is part of a proceeding instituted by an application for a writ of habeas corpus.  Instead of presuming the state courts factfindings to be correct, as §2254(e)(1) requires, the Court holds that petitioner need only show that reasonable jurists could disagree as to whether he can provide clear and convincing evidence that the finding was erroneous.  
				<em>

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Courts main justification for this conclusion is supposed fidelity to 
				<em>
					Slack

				 v.

				<em>
					Slack
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra,
				</em>
				 at 484)).  But neither 
				<em>
					Slack
				</em>
				 nor any other decision of this Court addressing the COA procedure has ever considered a constitutional claim that turns entirely on issues of fact.  In these circumstances, it is the text of §2254(e)(1) that governs.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Unlike the majority, I begin with the plain text of the statute that instructs federal courts how to treat state-court findings of fact.  At issue is what constitutes a proceeding for purposes of §2254(e)(1).  The word, proceeding, means [t]he regular and orderly progression of a lawsuit, including 
				<em>
					all acts and events between
				</em>
				 the time of commencement and the entry of judgment.  Blacks Law Dictionary 1221 (7th ed. 1999) (emphasis added).  The COA, standing alone, … does not assert a grievance against anyone, does not seek remedy or redress for any legal injury, and does not even require a party on the other side.  It is nothing more than a request for permission to seek review.

				I agree with the majority that the existence of a COA is a jurisdictional prerequisite to the merits appeal.  
				<em>
					Ante

				, at 11.  However, the Court takes a wrong turn when it implies that the merits appeal is part of the habeas process (or proceeding) but the COA determination somehow is not.  Overwhelming authority (including the majority opinion) confirms that §2254(e)(1) applies to the merits appeal.  See

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">546</a>547 (1981)
 (pre-Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) factual deference provision with virtually identical language applies to merits appeal).  The COA determination should be treated no differently, because §2254(e)(1) draws no distinction between the merits appeal and the COA.  The Courts silent conclusion to the contrary is simply illogical.  The COAs status as the jurisdictional prerequisite for the merits appeal requires that 
				<em>
					both
				</em>
				 the COA determination 
				<em>
					and
				</em>
				 the merits appeal be considered a part of the same proceeding.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Courts rejection of this conclusion also conflicts with pre-AEDPA practice.  Prior to AEDPA, access to a merits appeal in federal habeas corpus proceedings was governed by a mechanism similar to the COA, known as a certificate of probable cause, or CPC.  See 
				<em>
					Slack
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra,
				</em>
				 at 480.  There was also a standard of factual deference similar to, though weaker than, the standard in §2254(e)(1).  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2254.html#d" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2254(d)</a> (1994 ed.).

            </a>
				  Under these provisions (indistinguishable from AEDPAs for these purposes), courts concluded that §2254(e)(1)s predecessor applied directly to the CPC proceeding, without any filtering through the debatability standard the Court has used in both the CPC and COA contexts.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.

				, 
				<em>

				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Collins
				</em>
				, 953 F. 2d 167, 169 (CA5 1992).  These cases support the straightforward notion that §2254(e)(1), like its predecessor did with respect to CPC proceedings, applies directly to the COA proceeding.

				The Courts decision in 
				<em>
					Hohn
				</em>
            <em>

				 which holds that the COA determination constitutes a case in the court of appeals for purposes of this Courts jurisdiction under 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1254.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1254</a>, is not to the contrary.  
				<em>
					Hohn
				</em>
				 does not hold, nor does its logic require, that the COA determination be regarded as separate from the rest of the habeas proceeding.  In fact, 
				<em>
					Hohn

				 rejected the proposition that a request to proceed before a court of appeals should be regarded as a threshold inquiry 
				<em>
					separate from the merits

				 … .  524 U. S., at 246 (emphasis added).  Indeed, 
				<em>
					Hohn

				 analogized the COA to the filing of a notice of appeal,

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Unlike an appellate courts review of district court findings of fact for clear error, §2254(e)(1) establishes a presumption of correctness.  It requires that the federal habeas court assume the state court that entered the findings was the best placed factfinder with the most complete record and 
				<em>
					only then 
				</em>
				ask whether the petitioner can refute that factual finding by clear and convincing evidence.  Procedural imperfections ordinarily will not affect this presumption; thus, it does not matter whether the state judge made his decision two years late or with a less-than-perfect record.  Admittedly these conditions might increase the 
				<em>
					odds
				</em>
				 that a habeas applicant could locate helpful evidence, but to presume facts correct means a court cannot allow a habeas applicant to evade §2254(e)(1) by attacking the process employed by the state 
				<em>
					factfinder
				</em>
				 rather than the actual 
				<em>
					factfindings
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				This reading is confirmed by the changes worked by AEDPA.  Section 2254(e)(1) does not, as its predecessor did, create exceptions to factual deference for procedural infirmities.  For example, prior to AEDPA, a federal habeas court would not defer to state-court determinations of fact if the factfinding procedure employed by the State court was not adequate to afford a full and fair hearing, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2254.html#d_2" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(2)</a> (1994 ed.), the material facts were not adequately developed at the State court hearing, §2254(d)(3), or the applicant did not receive a full, fair, and adequate hearing, §2254(d)(6).  The removal of these exceptions forecloses the use of marginal procedural complaintssuch as a delay between 
				<em>
					voir dire
				</em>
				 and a 
				<em>
					Batson
				</em>
				 hearingto determine whether or how much a federal habeas court will defer to state-court factfinding.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Section 2254(e)(1) simply cannot be read to contain an implied sliding scale of deference.  I do not understand the Court to disagree with this view, however, as its dicta does not actually purport to interpret the text of §2254(e)(1).

Fields, Warren, and Boggess were struck for having family members with criminal histories.  Bozeman and Fields were struck for making pro-defense remarks about rehabilitation.

				The Courts treatment of this issue focuses on the apparent disparity in treatment of 10 black veniremen and 10 white veniremen who were supposedly similar in their opposition to the death penalty.  The majority notes that only 2 out of these 10 whites got the graphic description while 7 out of 10 blacks did.  
				<em>

				, at 20.  But the Court neglects to mention that the eight white veniremen who petitioner thinks should have received the graphic formulation, Reply Brief for Petitioner 15, n. 19, were so emphatically opposed to the death penalty that such a description would have served no purpose in clarifying their position on the issue.  No trial lawyer would willingly antagonize a potential juror ardently opposed to the death penalty with an extreme portrait of its implementation.  The strategy pursued by the prosecution makes perfect sense: When it was necessary to draw out a veniremans feelings about the death penalty they would use the graphic script, but when it was overkill they would not.
				    
				The record demonstrates that six of these eight white veniremen were so opposed to the death penalty that they were stricken for cause without the need for the prosecution to spend a peremptory challenge.  For example, John Nelson wrote on his questionnaire, I believe that the State does not have the right to take anyones life, Tr. of Voir Dire in No. F8578668NL (5th Crim. Dist.

				First, as already noted, the deeper and clearer opposition to the death penalty on the part of the eight whites who did not receive the graphic script (but petitioner thinks should have) indirectly supports respondents contention that this opposition came out in their questionnaires (presumably by an answer of no to question 56 and an answer of yes to question 58).  But this is not the only evidence supporting respondents view.  Hinson, a white venireman who did not receive the graphic formulation, stated during voir dire

				Petitioner fares no better with his allegation that the prosecution employed two different scripts on the basis of race when asking questions about imposition of the minimum sentence.  Indeed, this disparate questioning argument is as flawed as the last one.  Respondent admits that the different questioning on minimum sentences was used as an effort to get veniremen the prosecution felt to be ambivalent about the death penalty dismissed for cause.  In making the decision whether to employ the manipulative minimum punishment script, prosecutors could rely on both the questionnaires and substantial 
				<em>

Bakers views on the death penalty were so clearly ambivalent that she is not even the subject of petitioners 
				<em>
					Batson

				 challenge.  And Fields family history of criminality and views on rehabilitation, as earlier discussed,
				<em>

				  Finally, petitioners objection to the prosecutions decision not to use the manipulative punishment script on Woods, Reply Brief for Petitioner 17, n. 23, makes no sense.  Woods gave answers indicating he would be an excellent States jurorwhy would the prosecution have tried to eliminate him?  Of course, if petitioner were correct that the prosecution sought to eliminate blacks then one might expect that all methods, including the use of the manipulative script, would have been deployed against Woods, who happened to also be black.

				Quite simply, petitioners arguments rest on circumstantial evidence and speculation that does not hold up to a thorough review of the record.  Far from rebutting §2254(e)(1)s presumption, petitioner has perhaps not even demonstrated that reasonable jurists could debate whether he has provided the requisite evidence of purposeful discriminationbut that is the majoritys inquiry, not mine.  Because petitioner has not demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that even one of the peremptory strikes at issue was the result of racial discrimination, I would affirm the denial of a COA.

The attorney representing the State at the post-trial Batson hearing made certain that both trial prosecutors were present to reiterate the reasons they gave in the record for striking the challenged black veniremen.  App. at 865.  Petitioners counsel explicitly refused the opportunity to do so when it was offered. Ibid.  Furthermore, I fail to understand why a move that resulted in a more efficient hearing without redundant testimony should redound to the benefit of petitioner, who bears the burden of proof in this federal habeas corpus proceeding.

						 I do, however, agree with the majority that the Courts decisions in Hernandez v. New York, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/500/352" class="subref" title="subref">500 U. S. 352</a> (1991)
, and Purkett v. Elem, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/514/765" class="subref" title="subref">514 U. S. 765</a> (1995)
 (per curiam), can be helpful in guiding a federal habeas court deciding a claim under Batson v. Kentucky, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/476/79" class="subref" title="subref">476 U. S. 79</a> (1986)
.  For instance, both cases confirm that Batson step three turns on an evaluation of the prosecutors proffered race-neutral justifications for the peremptory challenges at issue.  Purkett, supra, at 768769; Hernandez, 500 U. S., at 364365 (plurality opinion); id., at 372 (OConnor, J., concurring in judgment); see also Batson, supra, at 98, n. 21.  Additionally, because Hernandezs clear error standard is less demanding of a criminal defendant than §2254(e)(1) is of a habeas applicant, a federal habeas court can deny relief on §2254(e)(1) grounds if it determines it would do so when reviewing the same facts for clear error.  Cf. Marshall v. Lonberger, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/459/422" class="subref" title="subref">459 U. S. 422</a>,

						 Again petitioner points to Vickery, Davis, Nix, and Weiner for similar family histories.  Justice Scalia has shown that none of these four were in fact similarly situated to Fields with respect to this justification.  Ante, at 67 (concurring opinion).  Petitioner also alleges that Hearn made pro-defense remarks about rehabilitation similar to those made by Fields.  Again, no white venireman even allegedly fits both reasons given for striking Fields.  Furthermore, even if Fields had only been struck for his views on rehabilitation, those views were in no way equivalent to those expressed by Hearn.  Fields answered yes to the question whether he believed that everyone can be rehabilitated.  App. at 118.  Fields went on to say that [i]t may be far-fetched, but I feel like, if a person has the opportunity to really be talked about God and he commits himself, whereas he has committed this offense, then if he turns his life around, that is rehabilitation.  Ibid.  In contrast, Hearn stated that she believe[d] in the death penalty if a criminal cannot be rehabilitated.  Id., at 694.


Petitioner tries to muddy the waters by pointing out that Fields was, in other respects, a good States juror because he supported the death penalty.  Brief for Petitioner 2425.  However, that does not change the fact that Fields said that everyone could be rehabilitated (and thus might have been swayed by a penitent defendants testimony) and Hearn insisted that some people could not be rehabilitated.  In analyzing Batson claims the focus should not be on the reasonableness of the asserted nonracial motive … [but] rather [on] the genuineness of the motive.  Purkett, 514 U. S., at 769 (emphasis in original).

						 The prosecutions stated reasons for striking Bozeman were that he was ambivalent about the death penalty and that he made pro-defense remarks about rehabilitation.  This is one case where the prosecution gave multiple reasons for a strike and petitioner actually correctly alleged the existence of a similarly situated white venireman, Hearn.  Petitioner believes, albeit erroneously, see ante, at 46 (Scalia, J., concurring), that Hearn expressed similar ambivalence about the death penalty and made pro-defense remarks about rehabilitation.

				Unpersuaded by petitioners claims, the state trial court found that there was no purposeful discrimination by the prosecut[ion] in the use of … peremptory strikes, App. 878.  This finding established that petitioner had failed to carry his burden at step three of the inquiry set out in

C. §2254(e)(1)</a> requires that a federal habeas court presum[e] the state courts findings of fact to be correct unless petitioner can rebut the presumption by clear and convincing evidence.  The majority decides, without explanation, to ignore §2254(e)(1)s explicit command.  I cannot.  Because petitioner has not shown, by clear and convincing evidence, that any peremptory strikes of black veniremen were exercised because of race, he does not merit a certificate of appealability (COA).  I respectfully dissent.

				The Court agrees, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 17, that the state courts finding at step three of 
				<em>
					Batson
				</em>
				 is a finding of fact ordinarily subject to §2254(e)(1)s presumption of correctness:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				In a proceeding instituted by an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court, a determination of a factual issue made by a State court shall be presumed to be correct.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
However, the Court implicitly rejects the obvious conclusion that the COA determination under §2253(c) is part of a proceeding instituted by an application for a writ of habeas corpus.  Instead of presuming the state courts factfindings to be correct, as §2254(e)(1) requires, the Court holds that petitioner need only show that reasonable jurists could disagree as to whether he can provide clear and convincing evidence that the finding was erroneous.  
				<em>

				 v.

				<em>

				</em>
				 at 484)).  But neither 
				<em>
					Slack
				</em>
				 nor any other decision of this Court addressing the COA procedure has ever considered a constitutional claim that turns entirely on issues of fact.  In these circumstances, it is the text of §2254(e)(1) that governs.

				Unlike the majority, I begin with the plain text of the statute that instructs federal courts how to treat state-court findings of fact.  At issue is what constitutes a proceeding for purposes of §2254(e)(1).  The word, proceeding, means [t]he regular and orderly progression of a lawsuit, including 
				<em>
					all acts and events between
				</em>
				 the time of commencement and the entry of judgment.  Blacks Law Dictionary 1221 (7th ed. 1999) (emphasis added).  The COA, standing alone, … does not assert a grievance against anyone, does not seek remedy or redress for any legal injury, and does not even require a party on the other side.  It is nothing more than a request for permission to seek review.

				I agree with the majority that the existence of a COA is a jurisdictional prerequisite to the merits appeal.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 11.  However, the Court takes a wrong turn when it implies that the merits appeal is part of the habeas process (or proceeding) but the COA determination somehow is not.  Overwhelming authority (including the majority opinion) confirms that §2254(e)(1) applies to the merits appeal.  See

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">546</a>547 (1981)
 (pre-Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) factual deference provision with virtually identical language applies to merits appeal).  The COA determination should be treated no differently, because §2254(e)(1) draws no distinction between the merits appeal and the COA.  The Courts silent conclusion to the contrary is simply illogical.  The COAs status as the jurisdictional prerequisite for the merits appeal requires that 
				<em>
					both
				</em>
				 the COA determination 
				<em>
					and
				</em>
				 the merits appeal be considered a part of the same proceeding.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Courts rejection of this conclusion also conflicts with pre-AEDPA practice.  Prior to AEDPA, access to a merits appeal in federal habeas corpus proceedings was governed by a mechanism similar to the COA, known as a certificate of probable cause, or CPC.  See 
				<em>
					Slack
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra,
				</em>
				 at 480.  There was also a standard of factual deference similar to, though weaker than, the standard in §2254(e)(1).  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2254.html#d" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2254(d)</a> (1994 ed.).

            </a>
				  Under these provisions (indistinguishable from AEDPAs for these purposes), courts concluded that §2254(e)(1)s predecessor applied directly to the CPC proceeding, without any filtering through the debatability standard the Court has used in both the CPC and COA contexts.  See, 
				<em>

				<em>

				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Collins
				</em>
				, 953 F. 2d 167, 169 (CA5 1992).  These cases support the straightforward notion that §2254(e)(1), like its predecessor did with respect to CPC proceedings, applies directly to the COA proceeding.

				The Courts decision in 
				<em>
					Hohn
				</em>
            <em>

				 which holds that the COA determination constitutes a case in the court of appeals for purposes of this Courts jurisdiction under 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1254.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1254</a>, is not to the contrary.  
				<em>
					Hohn
				</em>
				 does not hold, nor does its logic require, that the COA determination be regarded as separate from the rest of the habeas proceeding.  In fact, 
				<em>
					Hohn

				 rejected the proposition that a request to proceed before a court of appeals should be regarded as a threshold inquiry 
				<em>

				 this reasoning is in tension with the plain text of §2254(e)(1) and ignores changes wrought by AEDPA to the role of federal courts on collateral review.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Unlike an appellate courts review of district court findings of fact for clear error, §2254(e)(1) establishes a presumption of correctness.  It requires that the federal habeas court assume the state court that entered the findings was the best placed factfinder with the most complete record and 
				<em>
					only then 
				</em>
				ask whether the petitioner can refute that factual finding by clear and convincing evidence.  Procedural imperfections ordinarily will not affect this presumption; thus, it does not matter whether the state judge made his decision two years late or with a less-than-perfect record.  Admittedly these conditions might increase the 
				<em>
					odds
				</em>
				 that a habeas applicant could locate helpful evidence, but to presume facts correct means a court cannot allow a habeas applicant to evade §2254(e)(1) by attacking the process employed by the state 
				<em>
					factfinder
				</em>
				 rather than the actual 
				<em>
					factfindings
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				This reading is confirmed by the changes worked by AEDPA.  Section 2254(e)(1) does not, as its predecessor did, create exceptions to factual deference for procedural infirmities.  For example, prior to AEDPA, a federal habeas court would not defer to state-court determinations of fact if the factfinding procedure employed by the State court was not adequate to afford a full and fair hearing, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2254.html#d_2" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(2)</a> (1994 ed.), the material facts were not adequately developed at the State court hearing, §2254(d)(3), or the applicant did not receive a full, fair, and adequate hearing, §2254(d)(6).  The removal of these exceptions forecloses the use of marginal procedural complaintssuch as a delay between 
				<em>
					voir dire
				</em>
				 and a 
				<em>
					Batson
				</em>
				 hearingto determine whether or how much a federal habeas court will defer to state-court factfinding.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Section 2254(e)(1) simply cannot be read to contain an implied sliding scale of deference.  I do not understand the Court to disagree with this view, however, as its dicta does not actually purport to interpret the text of §2254(e)(1).

				Because §2254(e)(1) supplies the governing legal standard, petitioner must provide clear and convincing evidence of purposeful discrimination in order to obtain a COA.  Petitioners constitutional claim under

				The evidence amassed by petitioner can be grouped into four categories: (1) evidence of historical discrimination by the Dallas District Attorneys office in the selection of juries; (2) the use of the jury shuffle tactic by the prosecution; (3) the alleged similarity between white veniremen who were not struck by the prosecution and six blacks who were: Edwin Rand, Wayman Kennedy, Roderick Bozeman, Billy Jean Fields, Joe Warren, and Carroll Boggess; and (4) evidence of so-called disparate questioning with respect to veniremens views on the death penalty and their ability to impose the minimum punishment.

				For the three challenged peremptory strikes used on Fields, Warren, and Boggess, petitioner has not even correctly alleged the existence of similarly situated white veniremen.  The majoritys discussion of this subject is misleading, stating that prosecutors explained that their peremptory challenges against six [black] potential jurors were based on ambivalence about the death penalty; hesitancy to vote to execute defendants capable of being rehabilitated; and the [veniremens] own family history of criminality.  
				<em>

				, at 19.  The implication is that for each of the six challenged veniremen, the prosecution gave all three reasons as justifications for the use of a peremptory strike.  To clarify: Rand, Kennedy, Bozeman, Warren, and Boggess were struck for ambivalence about the death penalty.  Fields, Warren, and Boggess were struck for having family members with criminal histories.  Bozeman and Fields were struck for making pro-defense remarks about rehabilitation.

The majority discounts this explanation, stating that [t]his cannot be accepted without further inquiry.

				The Courts treatment of this issue focuses on the apparent disparity in treatment of 10 black veniremen and 10 white veniremen who were supposedly similar in their opposition to the death penalty.  The majority notes that only 2 out of these 10 whites got the graphic description while 7 out of 10 blacks did.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 20.  But the Court neglects to mention that the eight white veniremen who petitioner thinks should have received the graphic formulation, Reply Brief for Petitioner 15, n. 19, were so emphatically opposed to the death penalty that such a description would have served no purpose in clarifying their position on the issue.  No trial lawyer would willingly antagonize a potential juror ardently opposed to the death penalty with an extreme portrait of its implementation.  The strategy pursued by the prosecution makes perfect sense: When it was necessary to draw out a veniremans feelings about the death penalty they would use the graphic script, but when it was overkill they would not.
				    
				The record demonstrates that six of these eight white veniremen were so opposed to the death penalty that they were stricken for cause without the need for the prosecution to spend a peremptory challenge.  For example, John Nelson wrote on his questionnaire, I believe that the State does not have the right to take anyones life, Tr. of Voir Dire in No. F8578668NL (5th Crim. Dist. Ct., Dallas County, Tex.), p. 625 (internal quotation marks omitted) (hereinafter VDR) and testified flatly, I would not be able to vote for the death penalty.

				The jury forms at issue asked two questions directly relevant to the death penalty.  Question 56 asked Do you believe in the death penalty?, offered potential jurors the chance to circle yes or no, and then asked them to [p]lease explain your answer.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.

				, Joint Lodging 44 (Boggess questionnaire).

				First, as already noted, the deeper and clearer opposition to the death penalty on the part of the eight whites who did not receive the graphic script (but petitioner thinks should have) indirectly supports respondents contention that this opposition came out in their questionnaires (presumably by an answer of no to question 56 and an answer of yes to question 58).  But this is not the only evidence supporting respondents view.  Hinson, a white venireman who did not receive the graphic formulation, stated during voir dire
				 that he put on the form there that [he] didnt agree with [the death penalty] for both moral and religious reasons.  VDR 1648.  Similarly, Nelson, a white venireman not receiving the graphic formulation, stated on his questionnaire, I believe that the State does not have the right to take anyones life. 
				<em>

				 at 625 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Fernando Guiterrez, a juror who received the graphic formulation, answered yes to question 56, but also yes to question 58, indicating he had moral, religious, or personal beliefs that would obstruct his voting for the death penalty despite the fact that he believed in it.

				Petitioner fares no better with his allegation that the prosecution employed two different scripts on the basis of race when asking questions about imposition of the minimum sentence.  Indeed, this disparate questioning argument is as flawed as the last one.  Respondent admits that the different questioning on minimum sentences was used as an effort to get veniremen the prosecution felt to be ambivalent about the death penalty dismissed for cause.  In making the decision whether to employ the manipulative minimum punishment script, prosecutors could rely on both the questionnaires and substantial 
				<em>

				 testimony, as the minimum punishment questioning occurred much later in 
				<em>

				 than the graphic formulation.

				Seven black veniremen were given the allegedly manipulative minimum punishment script, all of whom were opposed to the death penalty in varying degrees.  Rand, Kennedy, Bozeman, Warren, and Boggess views on the death penalty have all been exhaustively discussed.  This leaves Baker and Fields.  Bakers views on the death penalty were so clearly ambivalent that she is not even the subject of petitioners 
				<em>
					Batson
				</em>
				 challenge.  And Fields family history of criminality and views on rehabilitation, as earlier discussed,
				<em>

				  Finally, petitioners objection to the prosecutions decision not to use the manipulative punishment script on Woods, Reply Brief for Petitioner 17, n. 23, makes no sense.  Woods gave answers indicating he would be an excellent States jurorwhy would the prosecution have tried to eliminate him?  Of course, if petitioner were correct that the prosecution sought to eliminate blacks then one might expect that all methods, including the use of the manipulative script, would have been deployed against Woods, who happened to also be black.

				Quite simply, petitioners arguments rest on circumstantial evidence and speculation that does not hold up to a thorough review of the record.  Far from rebutting §2254(e)(1)s presumption, petitioner has perhaps not even demonstrated that reasonable jurists could debate whether he has provided the requisite evidence of purposeful discriminationbut that is the majoritys inquiry, not mine.  Because petitioner has not demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that even one of the peremptory strikes at issue was the result of racial discrimination, I would affirm the denial of a COA.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/476/79" class="subref" title="subref">476 U. S. 79</a> (1986)
.  For instance, both cases confirm that Batson step three turns on an evaluation of the prosecutors proffered race-neutral justifications for the peremptory challenges at issue.  Purkett, supra, at 768769; Hernandez, 500 U. S., at 364365 (plurality opinion); id., at 372 (OConnor, J., concurring in judgment); see also Batson, supra, at 98, n. 21.  Additionally, because Hernandezs clear error standard is less demanding of a criminal defendant than §2254(e)(1) is of a habeas applicant, a federal habeas court can deny relief on §2254(e)(1) grounds if it determines it would do so when reviewing the same facts for clear error.  Cf. Marshall v. Lonberger, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/459/422" class="subref" title="subref">459 U. S. 422</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">434</a>435 (1983)
 (We greatly doubt that Congress … intended to authorize broader federal review of state court credibility determinations than are authorized in appeals within the federal system itself ).

						 Petitioner directs the Court to white veniremen Noad Vickery, Cheryl Davis, Chatta Nix, and Joan Weiner as having family members with criminal histories, but points to white veniremen Sandra Hearn and Marie Mazza as equally ambivalent about the death penalty.  Brief for Petitioner 22.  Of course, as Justice Scalia demonstrates, Hearn and Mazza were not ambivalent about the death penalty.  Ante, at 45 (concurring opinion).

						 Again petitioner points to Vickery, Davis, Nix, and Weiner for similar family histories.  Justice Scalia has shown that none of these four were in fact similarly situated to Fields with respect to this justification.  Ante, at 67 (concurring opinion).  Petitioner also alleges that Hearn made pro-defense remarks about rehabilitation similar to those made by Fields.  Again, no white venireman even allegedly fits both reasons given for striking Fields.  Furthermore, even if Fields had only been struck for his views on rehabilitation, those views were in no way equivalent to those expressed by Hearn.  Fields answered yes to the question whether he believed that everyone can be rehabilitated.  App. at 118.  Fields went on to say that [i]t may be far-fetched, but I feel like, if a person has the opportunity to really be talked about God and he commits himself, whereas he has committed this offense, then if he turns his life around, that is rehabilitation.  Ibid.  In contrast, Hearn stated that she believe[d] in the death penalty if a criminal cannot be rehabilitated.  Id., at 694.


Petitioner tries to muddy the waters by pointing out that Fields was, in other respects, a good States juror because he supported the death penalty.  Brief for Petitioner 2425.  However, that does not change the fact that Fields said that everyone could be rehabilitated (and thus might have been swayed by a penitent defendants testimony) and Hearn insisted that some people could not be rehabilitated.  In analyzing Batson claims the focus should not be on the reasonableness of the asserted nonracial motive … [but] rather [on] the genuineness of the motive.  Purkett, 514 U. S., at 769 (emphasis in original).

						 The prosecutions stated reasons for striking Bozeman were that he was ambivalent about the death penalty and that he made pro-defense remarks about rehabilitation.  This is one case where the prosecution gave multiple reasons for a strike and petitioner actually correctly alleged the existence of a similarly situated white venireman, Hearn.  Petitioner believes, albeit erroneously, see ante, at 46 (Scalia, J., concurring), that Hearn expressed similar ambivalence about the death penalty and made pro-defense remarks about rehabilitation.

						 Questions 56 and 58, and the responses thereto, are found on page 6 of each questionnaire. Baker did not circle yes or no in answering question 56, but wrote [m]y strongest feeling is against the death penalty; however, being aware of the overcrowding in jails and the number of murders[,] I would have to know the facts to make a decision … . (emphasis added).  Baker also did not answer question 58, writing undecided instead.  Mackey answered question 56 no, indicating she did not believe in the death penalty, and wrote Thou Shall Not Kill in the explanation space.  She then proceeded to answer question 58 no as well.  Bailey circled yes in answering question 56, but wrote in NO with a circle around it, along with such explanations as yes for a major crime and [n]o one have [sic] the right to take anothe [sic] ones [sic] life (emphasis in original).  He then circled no in answering question 58.  Keaton circled no, indicating she did not believe in the death penalty, when she answered question 56, writing Its not for me to punished [sic] anyone.  However she then circled no in answering question 58, indicating that she did not have any objection to imposing the death penalty.

						 This analysis considers Hinson and Nelson as being clearly opposed to the death penalty in their questionnaires (answering question 56 no and question 58 yes) and Kennedy as being ambiguous (though in fact he answered question 56 yes and 58 no).  Even without these assumptions, 13 out of 15 veniremen who answered yes to question 56 and no to question 58indicating clear support for the death penaltydid not receive the graphic script.  And seven out of seven of those answering no and no or yes and yesindicating ambiguous or mixed feelings about the death penaltyor not answering clearly at all received the graphic script.  This yields an accuracy rate of 20 out of 22, or 91%.

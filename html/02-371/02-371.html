Regardless of the scope of the law that forms the denominator of the fraction here, the numerator of potential invalid applications is too small to result in a finding of substantial overbreadth.  But in other circumstances, the scope of the law chosen for comparison with invalid applications might decide the case.  It might be dispositive whether, say, a citys speech ordinance for a public park is analyzed alone or as one element of the combined policies governing expression in public schoolyards, municipal cemeteries, and the city council chamber.

Regardless of the scope of the law that forms the denominator of the fraction here, the numerator of potential invalid applications is too small to result in a finding of substantial overbreadth.  But in other circumstances, the scope of the law chosen for comparison with invalid applications might decide the case.  It might be dispositive whether, say, a citys speech ordinance for a public park is analyzed alone or as one element of the combined policies governing expression in public schoolyards, municipal cemeteries, and the city council chamber.  Suffice it to say that todays decision does not address how to go about identifying the scope of the relevant law for purposes of overbreadth analysis.

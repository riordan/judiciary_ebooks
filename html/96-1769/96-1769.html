				A prisoner under a death sentence remains a living person and consequently has an interest in his life.  The question this case raises is the issue of what process is constitutionally necessary to protect that interest in the context of Ohios clemency procedures.  It is clear that once society has validly convicted an individual of a crime and therefore established its right to punish, the demands of due process are reduced accordingly.

				In my view, however, a remand to permit the District Court to address respondents specific allegations of due process violations is not required.  The Ohio Death Penalty Clemency Procedure provides that, if a stay has not yet issued, the parole board must schedule a clemency hearing 45 days before an execution for a date approximately 21 days in advance of the execution.  The board must also advise the prisoner that he is entitled to a pre-hearing interview with one or more parole board members.  Although the Parole Authority complied with those instructions here, respondent raises several objections to the process afforded him.  He contends that 3 days notice of his interview and 10 days notice of the hearing were inadequate; that he did not have a meaningful opportunity to prepare his clemency application because postconviction proceedings were pending; that his counsel was improperly excluded from the interview and permitted to participate in the hearing only at the discretion of the parole board chair; and that he was precluded from testifying or submitting documentary evidence at the hearing.  I do not believe that any of these allegations amounts to a due process violation.  The process respondent received, including notice of the hearing and an opportunity to participate in an interview, comports with Ohios regulations and observes whatever limitations the Due Process Clause may impose on clemency proceedings.  Moreover, I agree that the voluntary inmate interview that forms part of Ohios process did not violate respondents Fifth and 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a> privilege against self-incrimination.

				In my view, however, a remand to permit the District Court to address respondents specific allegations of due process violations is not required.  The Ohio Death Penalty Clemency Procedure provides that, if a stay has not yet issued, the parole board must schedule a clemency hearing 45 days before an execution for a date approximately 21 days in advance of the execution.  The board must also advise the prisoner that he is entitled to a pre-hearing interview with one or more parole board members.  Although the Parole Authority complied with those instructions here, respondent raises several objections to the process afforded him.  He contends that 3 days notice of his interview and 10 days notice of the hearing were inadequate; that he did not have a meaningful opportunity to prepare his clemency application because postconviction proceedings were pending; that his counsel was improperly excluded from the interview and permitted to participate in the hearing only at the discretion of the parole board chair; and that he was precluded from testifying or submitting documentary evidence at the hearing.  I do not believe that any of these allegations amounts to a due process violation.  The process respondent received, including notice of the hearing and an opportunity to participate in an interview, comports with Ohios regulations and observes whatever limitations the Due Process Clause may impose on clemency proceedings.  Moreover, I agree that the voluntary inmate interview that forms part of Ohios process did not violate respondents Fifth and

				In my view, however, a remand to permit the District Court to address respondents specific allegations of due process violations is not required.  The Ohio Death Penalty Clemency Procedure provides that, if a stay has not yet issued, the parole board must schedule a clemency hearing 45 days before an execution for a date approximately 21 days in advance of the execution.  The board must also advise the prisoner that he is entitled to a pre-hearing interview with one or more parole board members.  Although the Parole Authority complied with those instructions here, respondent raises several objections to the process afforded him.  He contends that 3 days notice of his interview and 10 days notice of the hearing were inadequate; that he did not have a meaningful opportunity to prepare his clemency application because postconviction proceedings were pending; that his counsel was improperly excluded from the interview and permitted to participate in the hearing only at the discretion of the parole board chair; and that he was precluded from testifying or submitting documentary evidence at the hearing.  I do not believe that any of these allegations amounts to a due process violation.  The process respondent received, including notice of the hearing and an opportunity to participate in an interview, comports with Ohios regulations and observes whatever limitations the Due Process Clause may impose on clemency proceedings.  Moreover, I agree that the voluntary inmate interview that forms part of Ohios process did not violate respondents Fifth and

				When a parole board conducts a hearing to determine whether the State shall actually execute one of its death row inmatesin other words, whether the State shall deprive that person of lifedoes it have an obligation to comply with the Due Process Clause of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>?  In my judgment, the text of the Clause provides the answer to that question.

				Without deciding what minimal, perhaps even barely perceptible procedural safeguards are required in clemency proceedings, the Court of Appeals correctly answered the basic question presented and remanded the case to the District Court to determine whether Ohios procedures meet the minimal requirements of due process.

				The text of the Due Process Clause properly directs our attention to state action that may deprive a person of life, liberty, or property.  When we are evaluating claims that the State has unfairly deprived someone of liberty or property, it is appropriate first to ask whether the state action adversely affected any constitutionally protected interest.  Thus, we may conclude, for example, that a prisoner has no liberty interest in the place where he is confined,

				  That crucial distinction points in the opposite direction in this case because respondent is contesting the States decision to deprive him of life that he still has, rather than any conditional liberty that he desires.  Thus, it is abundantly clear that respondent possesses a life interest protected by the Due Process Clause.

				There are valid reasons for concluding that even if due process is required in clemency proceedings, only the most basic elements of fair procedure are required.  Presumably a State might eliminate this aspect of capital sentencing entirely, and it unquestionably may allow the executive virtually unfettered discretion in determining the merits of appeals for mercy.  Nevertheless, there are equally valid reasons for concluding that these proceedings are not entirely exempt from judicial review.  I think, for example, that no one would contend that a governor could ignore the commands of the Equal Protection Clause and use race, religion, or political affiliation as a standard for granting or denying clemency.  Our cases also support the conclusion that if a State adopts a clemency procedure as an integral part of its system for finally determining whether to deprive a person of life, that procedure must comport with the Due Process Clause.

        <p class="bodytext">

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">396</a> (1985)

The Chief Justice, then, is simply wrong when he states that these cases make clear that there is no continuum requiring varying levels of process at every . . . phase of the criminal system, ante, at 10; instead, these cases simply turned on what process is due.  If there could be any question whether state postconviction proceedings are subject to due process protections, our unanimous opinion in Yates v. Aiken,

				When a parole board conducts a hearing to determine whether the State shall actually execute one of its death row inmatesin other words, whether the State shall deprive that person of lifedoes it have an obligation to comply with the Due Process Clause of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>?  In my judgment, the text of the Clause provides the answer to that question.

				Without deciding what minimal, perhaps even barely perceptible procedural safeguards are required in clemency proceedings, the Court of Appeals correctly answered the basic question presented and remanded the case to the District Court to determine whether Ohios procedures meet the minimal requirements of due process.

				The text of the Due Process Clause properly directs our attention to state action that may deprive a person of life, liberty, or property.  When we are evaluating claims that the State has unfairly deprived someone of liberty or property, it is appropriate first to ask whether the state action adversely affected any constitutionally protected interest.  Thus, we may conclude, for example, that a prisoner has no liberty interest in the place where he is confined,

				  That crucial distinction points in the opposite direction in this case because respondent is contesting the States decision to deprive him of life that he still has, rather than any conditional liberty that he desires.  Thus, it is abundantly clear that respondent possesses a life interest protected by the Due Process Clause.

				There are valid reasons for concluding that even if due process is required in clemency proceedings, only the most basic elements of fair procedure are required.  Presumably a State might eliminate this aspect of capital sentencing entirely, and it unquestionably may allow the executive virtually unfettered discretion in determining the merits of appeals for mercy.  Nevertheless, there are equally valid reasons for concluding that these proceedings are not entirely exempt from judicial review.  I think, for example, that no one would contend that a governor could ignore the commands of the Equal Protection Clause and use race, religion, or political affiliation as a standard for granting or denying clemency.  Our cases also support the conclusion that if a State adopts a clemency procedure as an integral part of its system for finally determining whether to deprive a person of life, that procedure must comport with the Due Process Clause.

        <p class="bodytext">

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">396</a> (1985)
.  Likewise, even if a State has no duty to authorize parole or probation, if it does exercise its discretion to grant conditional liberty to convicted felons, any decision to deprive a parolee or a probationer of such conditional liberty must accord that person due process.

				When a parole board conducts a hearing to determine whether the State shall actually execute one of its death row inmatesin other words, whether the State shall deprive that person of lifedoes it have an obligation to comply with the Due Process Clause of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>?  In my judgment, the text of the Clause provides the answer to that question.

				Without deciding what minimal, perhaps even barely perceptible procedural safeguards are required in clemency proceedings, the Court of Appeals correctly answered the basic question presented and remanded the case to the District Court to determine whether Ohios procedures meet the minimal requirements of due process.

				The text of the Due Process Clause properly directs our attention to state action that may deprive a person of life, liberty, or property.  When we are evaluating claims that the State has unfairly deprived someone of liberty or property, it is appropriate first to ask whether the state action adversely affected any constitutionally protected interest.  Thus, we may conclude, for example, that a prisoner has no liberty interest in the place where he is confined,

				  That crucial distinction points in the opposite direction in this case because respondent is contesting the States decision to deprive him of life that he still has, rather than any conditional liberty that he desires.  Thus, it is abundantly clear that respondent possesses a life interest protected by the Due Process Clause.

				There are valid reasons for concluding that even if due process is required in clemency proceedings, only the most basic elements of fair procedure are required.  Presumably a State might eliminate this aspect of capital sentencing entirely, and it unquestionably may allow the executive virtually unfettered discretion in determining the merits of appeals for mercy.  Nevertheless, there are equally valid reasons for concluding that these proceedings are not entirely exempt from judicial review.  I think, for example, that no one would contend that a governor could ignore the commands of the Equal Protection Clause and use race, religion, or political affiliation as a standard for granting or denying clemency.  Our cases also support the conclusion that if a State adopts a clemency procedure as an integral part of its system for finally determining whether to deprive a person of life, that procedure must comport with the Due Process Clause.

				  For death is a different kind of punishment from any other which may be imposed in this country.  From the point of view of the defendant, it is different in both its severity and its finality… .  From the point of view of society, the action of the sovereign in taking the life of one of its citizens also differs dramatically from any other legitimate state action.

						 Our language in Greenholtz leaves no room for doubt:  There is no constitutional or inherent right of a convicted person to be conditionally released before the expiration of a valid sentence.  The natural desire of an individual to be released is indistinguishable from the initial resistance to being confined.

				The text of the Due Process Clause properly directs our attention to state action that may deprive a person of life, liberty, or property.  When we are evaluating claims that the State has unfairly deprived someone of liberty or property, it is appropriate first to ask whether the state action adversely affected any constitutionally protected interest.  Thus, we may conclude, for example, that a prisoner has no liberty interest in the place where he is confined,

				  That crucial distinction points in the opposite direction in this case because respondent is contesting the States decision to deprive him of life that he still has, rather than any conditional liberty that he desires.  Thus, it is abundantly clear that respondent possesses a life interest protected by the Due Process Clause.

				There are valid reasons for concluding that even if due process is required in clemency proceedings, only the most basic elements of fair procedure are required.  Presumably a State might eliminate this aspect of capital sentencing entirely, and it unquestionably may allow the executive virtually unfettered discretion in determining the merits of appeals for mercy.  Nevertheless, there are equally valid reasons for concluding that these proceedings are not entirely exempt from judicial review.  I think, for example, that no one would contend that a governor could ignore the commands of the Equal Protection Clause and use race, religion, or political affiliation as a standard for granting or denying clemency.  Our cases also support the conclusion that if a State adopts a clemency procedure as an integral part of its system for finally determining whether to deprive a person of life, that procedure must comport with the Due Process Clause.

				  For death is a different kind of punishment from any other which may be imposed in this country.  From the point of view of the defendant, it is different in both its severity and its finality… .  From the point of view of society, the action of the sovereign in taking the life of one of its citizens also differs dramatically from any other legitimate state action.

						 Our language in Greenholtz leaves no room for doubt:  There is no constitutional or inherent right of a convicted person to be conditionally released before the expiration of a valid sentence.  The natural desire of an individual to be released is indistinguishable from the initial resistance to being confined.  But the conviction, with all its procedural safeguards, has extinguished that liberty right:  [G]iven a valid conviction, the criminal defendant has been constitutionally deprived of his liberty.   442 U. S., at 7 (emphasis supplied; citation omitted).  Greenholtz pointedly distinguished parole revocation and probation revocation cases, noting that there is a critical difference between denial of a prisoners request for initial release on parole and revocation of a parolees conditional liberty.

						 While it is true that the constitutional protections in state postconviction proceedings are less stringent than at trial or on direct review, e.g., Pennsylvania v. Finley, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/481/551" class="subref" title="subref">481 U. S. 551</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">555</a>557 (1987)
, we have never held or suggested that the Due Process Clause does not apply to these proceedings.  Indeed, Finley itself asked whether the States post-conviction proceedings comported with the fundamental fairness mandated by the Due Process Clause.  Id., at 556557; see also Murray v. Giarratano, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/492/1" class="subref" title="subref">492 U. S. 1</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">8</a> (1989)
 (opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.) ( [T]he fundamental fairness mandated by the Due Process Clause does not require that the [S]tate supply a lawyer  (quoting Finley, 481 U. S., at 557)).  The Chief Justice, then, is simply wrong when he states that these cases make clear that there is no continuum requiring varying levels of process at every . . . phase of the criminal system, ante, at 10; instead, these cases simply turned on what process is due.  If there could be any question whether state postconviction proceedings are subject to due process protections, our unanimous opinion in Yates v. Aiken, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/484/211" class="subref" title="subref">484 U. S. 211</a>,

				The text of the Due Process Clause properly directs our attention to state action that may deprive a person of life, liberty, or property.  When we are evaluating claims that the State has unfairly deprived someone of liberty or property, it is appropriate first to ask whether the state action adversely affected any constitutionally protected interest.  Thus, we may conclude, for example, that a prisoner has no liberty interest in the place where he is confined,

				There are valid reasons for concluding that even if due process is required in clemency proceedings, only the most basic elements of fair procedure are required.  Presumably a State might eliminate this aspect of capital sentencing entirely, and it unquestionably may allow the executive virtually unfettered discretion in determining the merits of appeals for mercy.  Nevertheless, there are equally valid reasons for concluding that these proceedings are not entirely exempt from judicial review.  I think, for example, that no one would contend that a governor could ignore the commands of the Equal Protection Clause and use race, religion, or political affiliation as a standard for granting or denying clemency.

				  For death is a different kind of punishment from any other which may be imposed in this country.  From the point of view of the defendant, it is different in both its severity and its finality… .  From the point of view of society, the action of the sovereign in taking the life of one of its citizens also differs dramatically from any other legitimate state action.

						 Our language in Greenholtz leaves no room for doubt:  There is no constitutional or inherent right of a convicted person to be conditionally released before the expiration of a valid sentence.  The natural desire of an individual to be released is indistinguishable from the initial resistance to being confined.  But the conviction, with all its procedural safeguards, has extinguished that liberty right:  [G]iven a valid conviction, the criminal defendant has been constitutionally deprived of his liberty.   442 U. S., at 7 (emphasis supplied; citation omitted).  Greenholtz pointedly distinguished parole revocation and probation revocation cases, noting that there is a critical difference between denial of a prisoners request for initial release on parole and revocation of a parolees conditional liberty.

						 While it is true that the constitutional protections in state postconviction proceedings are less stringent than at trial or on direct review, e.g., Pennsylvania v. Finley, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/481/551" class="subref" title="subref">481 U. S. 551</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">555</a>557 (1987)
, we have never held or suggested that the Due Process Clause does not apply to these proceedings.  Indeed, Finley itself asked whether the States post-conviction proceedings comported with the fundamental fairness mandated by the Due Process Clause.  Id., at 556557; see also Murray v. Giarratano, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/492/1" class="subref" title="subref">492 U. S. 1</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">8</a> (1989)
 (opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.) ( [T]he fundamental fairness mandated by the Due Process Clause does not require that the [S]tate supply a lawyer  (quoting Finley, 481 U. S., at 557)).  The Chief Justice, then, is simply wrong when he states that these cases make clear that there is no continuum requiring varying levels of process at every . . . phase of the criminal system, ante, at 10; instead, these cases simply turned on what process is due.  If there could be any question whether state postconviction proceedings are subject to due process protections, our unanimous opinion in Yates v. Aiken, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/484/211" class="subref" title="subref">484 U. S. 211</a>,

						 While it is true that the constitutional protections in state postconviction proceedings are less stringent than at trial or on direct review, e.g., Pennsylvania v. Finley,

, we have never held or suggested that the Due Process Clause does not apply to these proceedings.  Indeed, Finley itself asked whether the States post-conviction proceedings comported with the fundamental fairness mandated by the Due Process Clause.  Id., at 556557; see also Murray v. Giarratano,

 (opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.) ( [T]he fundamental fairness mandated by the Due Process Clause does not require that the [S]tate supply a lawyer  (quoting Finley, 481 U. S., at 557)).  The Chief Justice, then, is simply wrong when he states that these cases make clear that there is no continuum requiring varying levels of process at every . . . phase of the criminal system, ante, at 10; instead, these cases simply turned on what process is due.  If there could be any question whether state postconviction proceedings are subject to due process protections, our unanimous opinion in Yates v. Aiken,

				When a parole board conducts a hearing to determine whether the State shall actually execute one of its death row inmatesin other words, whether the State shall deprive that person of lifedoes it have an obligation to comply with the Due Process Clause of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>?  In my judgment, the text of the Clause provides the answer to that question.

				The text of the Due Process Clause properly directs our attention to state action that may deprive a person of life, liberty, or property.  When we are evaluating claims that the State has unfairly deprived someone of liberty or property, it is appropriate first to ask whether the state action adversely affected any constitutionally protected interest.  Thus, we may conclude, for example, that a prisoner has no liberty interest in the place where he is confined,

				  That crucial distinction points in the opposite direction in this case because respondent is contesting the States decision to deprive him of life that he still has, rather than any conditional liberty that he desires.  Thus, it is abundantly clear that respondent possesses a life interest protected by the Due Process Clause.

				There are valid reasons for concluding that even if due process is required in clemency proceedings, only the most basic elements of fair procedure are required.  Presumably a State might eliminate this aspect of capital sentencing entirely, and it unquestionably may allow the executive virtually unfettered discretion in determining the merits of appeals for mercy.  Nevertheless, there are equally valid reasons for concluding that these proceedings are not entirely exempt from judicial review.  I think, for example, that no one would contend that a governor could ignore the commands of the Equal Protection Clause and use race, religion, or political affiliation as a standard for granting or denying clemency.  Our cases also support the conclusion that if a State adopts a clemency procedure as an integral part of its system for finally determining whether to deprive a person of life, that procedure must comport with the Due Process Clause.

				When a parole board conducts a hearing to determine whether the State shall actually execute one of its death row inmatesin other words, whether the State shall deprive that person of lifedoes it have an obligation to comply with the Due Process Clause of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>?  In my judgment, the text of the Clause provides the answer to that question.

				Without deciding what minimal, perhaps even barely perceptible procedural safeguards are required in clemency proceedings, the Court of Appeals correctly answered the basic question presented and remanded the case to the District Court to determine whether Ohios procedures meet the minimal requirements of due process.

				The text of the Due Process Clause properly directs our attention to state action that may deprive a person of life, liberty, or property.  When we are evaluating claims that the State has unfairly deprived someone of liberty or property, it is appropriate first to ask whether the state action adversely affected any constitutionally protected interest.  Thus, we may conclude, for example, that a prisoner has no liberty interest in the place where he is confined,

				  That crucial distinction points in the opposite direction in this case because respondent is contesting the States decision to deprive him of life that he still has, rather than any conditional liberty that he desires.  Thus, it is abundantly clear that respondent possesses a life interest protected by the Due Process Clause.

				There are valid reasons for concluding that even if due process is required in clemency proceedings, only the most basic elements of fair procedure are required.  Presumably a State might eliminate this aspect of capital sentencing entirely, and it unquestionably may allow the executive virtually unfettered discretion in determining the merits of appeals for mercy.  Nevertheless, there are equally valid reasons for concluding that these proceedings are not entirely exempt from judicial review.  I think, for example, that no one would contend that a governor could ignore the commands of the Equal Protection Clause and use race, religion, or political affiliation as a standard for granting or denying clemency.  Our cases also support the conclusion that if a State adopts a clemency procedure as an integral part of its system for finally determining whether to deprive a person of life, that procedure must comport with the Due Process Clause.

				  For death is a different kind of punishment from any other which may be imposed in this country.  From the point of view of the defendant, it is different in both its severity and its finality… .  From the point of view of society, the action of the sovereign in taking the life of one of its citizens also differs dramatically from any other legitimate state action.

						 Our language in Greenholtz leaves no room for doubt:  There is no constitutional or inherent right of a convicted person to be conditionally released before the expiration of a valid sentence.  The natural desire of an individual to be released is indistinguishable from the initial resistance to being confined.

				The text of the Due Process Clause properly directs our attention to state action that may deprive a person of life, liberty, or property.  When we are evaluating claims that the State has unfairly deprived someone of liberty or property, it is appropriate first to ask whether the state action adversely affected any constitutionally protected interest.  Thus, we may conclude, for example, that a prisoner has no liberty interest in the place where he is confined,

				  That crucial distinction points in the opposite direction in this case because respondent is contesting the States decision to deprive him of life that he still has, rather than any conditional liberty that he desires.  Thus, it is abundantly clear that respondent possesses a life interest protected by the Due Process Clause.

				There are valid reasons for concluding that even if due process is required in clemency proceedings, only the most basic elements of fair procedure are required.  Presumably a State might eliminate this aspect of capital sentencing entirely, and it unquestionably may allow the executive virtually unfettered discretion in determining the merits of appeals for mercy.  Nevertheless, there are equally valid reasons for concluding that these proceedings are not entirely exempt from judicial review.  I think, for example, that no one would contend that a governor could ignore the commands of the Equal Protection Clause and use race, religion, or political affiliation as a standard for granting or denying clemency.  Our cases also support the conclusion that if a State adopts a clemency procedure as an integral part of its system for finally determining whether to deprive a person of life, that procedure must comport with the Due Process Clause.

				  For death is a different kind of punishment from any other which may be imposed in this country.  From the point of view of the defendant, it is different in both its severity and its finality… .  From the point of view of society, the action of the sovereign in taking the life of one of its citizens also differs dramatically from any other legitimate state action.

						 Our language in Greenholtz leaves no room for doubt:  There is no constitutional or inherent right of a convicted person to be conditionally released before the expiration of a valid sentence.  The natural desire of an individual to be released is indistinguishable from the initial resistance to being confined.  But the conviction, with all its procedural safeguards, has extinguished that liberty right:  [G]iven a valid conviction, the criminal defendant has been constitutionally deprived of his liberty.   442 U. S., at 7 (emphasis supplied; citation omitted).  Greenholtz pointedly distinguished parole revocation and probation revocation cases, noting that there is a critical difference between denial of a prisoners request for initial release on parole and revocation of a parolees conditional liberty.

						 While it is true that the constitutional protections in state postconviction proceedings are less stringent than at trial or on direct review, e.g., Pennsylvania v. Finley, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/481/551" class="subref" title="subref">481 U. S. 551</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">555</a>557 (1987)
, we have never held or suggested that the Due Process Clause does not apply to these proceedings.  Indeed, Finley itself asked whether the States post-conviction proceedings comported with the fundamental fairness mandated by the Due Process Clause.  Id., at 556557; see also Murray v. Giarratano, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/492/1" class="subref" title="subref">492 U. S. 1</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">8</a> (1989)
 (opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.) ( [T]he fundamental fairness mandated by the Due Process Clause does not require that the [S]tate supply a lawyer  (quoting Finley, 481 U. S., at 557)).  The Chief Justice, then, is simply wrong when he states that these cases make clear that there is no continuum requiring varying levels of process at every . . . phase of the criminal system, ante, at 10; instead, these cases simply turned on what process is due.  If there could be any question whether state postconviction proceedings are subject to due process protections, our unanimous opinion in Yates v. Aiken, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/484/211" class="subref" title="subref">484 U. S. 211</a>,

				The text of the Due Process Clause properly directs our attention to state action that may deprive a person of life, liberty, or property.  When we are evaluating claims that the State has unfairly deprived someone of liberty or property, it is appropriate first to ask whether the state action adversely affected any constitutionally protected interest.

				There are valid reasons for concluding that even if due process is required in clemency proceedings, only the most basic elements of fair procedure are required.  Presumably a State might eliminate this aspect of capital sentencing entirely, and it unquestionably may allow the executive virtually unfettered discretion in determining the merits of appeals for mercy.  Nevertheless, there are equally valid reasons for concluding that these proceedings are not entirely exempt from judicial review.

From the point of view of society, the action of the sovereign in taking the life of one of its citizens also differs dramatically from any other legitimate state action.

						 Our language in Greenholtz leaves no room for doubt:  There is no constitutional or inherent right of a convicted person to be conditionally released before the expiration of a valid sentence.  The natural desire of an individual to be released is indistinguishable from the initial resistance to being confined.  But the conviction, with all its procedural safeguards, has extinguished that liberty right:  [G]iven a valid conviction, the criminal defendant has been constitutionally deprived of his liberty.   442 U. S., at 7 (emphasis supplied; citation omitted).  Greenholtz pointedly distinguished parole revocation and probation revocation cases, noting that there is a critical difference between denial of a prisoners request for initial release on parole and revocation of a parolees conditional liberty.

						 While it is true that the constitutional protections in state postconviction proceedings are less stringent than at trial or on direct review, e.g., Pennsylvania v. Finley, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/481/551" class="subref" title="subref">481 U. S. 551</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">555</a>557 (1987)
, we have never held or suggested that the Due Process Clause does not apply to these proceedings.  Indeed, Finley itself asked whether the States post-conviction proceedings comported with the fundamental fairness mandated by the Due Process Clause.  Id., at 556557; see also Murray v. Giarratano, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/492/1" class="subref" title="subref">492 U. S. 1</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">8</a> (1989)
 (opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.) ( [T]he fundamental fairness mandated by the Due Process Clause does not require that the [S]tate supply a lawyer  (quoting Finley, 481 U. S., at 557)).  The Chief Justice, then, is simply wrong when he states that these cases make clear that there is no continuum requiring varying levels of process at every . . . phase of the criminal system, ante, at 10; instead, these cases simply turned on what process is due.  If there could be any question whether state postconviction proceedings are subject to due process protections, our unanimous opinion in Yates v. Aiken, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/484/211" class="subref" title="subref">484 U. S. 211</a>,

						 While it is true that the constitutional protections in state postconviction proceedings are less stringent than at trial or on direct review, e.g., Pennsylvania v. Finley,

, we have never held or suggested that the Due Process Clause does not apply to these proceedings.  Indeed, Finley itself asked whether the States post-conviction proceedings comported with the fundamental fairness mandated by the Due Process Clause.  Id., at 556557; see also Murray v. Giarratano,

 (opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.) ( [T]he fundamental fairness mandated by the Due Process Clause does not require that the [S]tate supply a lawyer  (quoting Finley, 481 U. S., at 557)).  The Chief Justice, then, is simply wrong when he states that these cases make clear that there is no continuum requiring varying levels of process at every . . . phase of the criminal system, ante, at 10; instead, these cases simply turned on what process is due.  If there could be any question whether state postconviction proceedings are subject to due process protections, our unanimous opinion in Yates v. Aiken,

				When a parole board conducts a hearing to determine whether the State shall actually execute one of its death row inmatesin other words, whether the State shall deprive that person of lifedoes it have an obligation to comply with the Due Process Clause of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>?  In my judgment, the text of the Clause provides the answer to that question.

				Without deciding what minimal, perhaps even barely perceptible procedural safeguards are required in clemency proceedings, the Court of Appeals correctly answered the basic question presented and remanded the case to the District Court to determine whether Ohios procedures meet the minimal requirements of due process.

				The text of the Due Process Clause properly directs our attention to state action that may deprive a person of life, liberty, or property.  When we are evaluating claims that the State has unfairly deprived someone of liberty or property, it is appropriate first to ask whether the state action adversely affected any constitutionally protected interest.  Thus, we may conclude, for example, that a prisoner has no liberty interest in the place where he is confined,

				  That crucial distinction points in the opposite direction in this case because respondent is contesting the States decision to deprive him of life that he still has, rather than any conditional liberty that he desires.  Thus, it is abundantly clear that respondent possesses a life interest protected by the Due Process Clause.

				There are valid reasons for concluding that even if due process is required in clemency proceedings, only the most basic elements of fair procedure are required.  Presumably a State might eliminate this aspect of capital sentencing entirely, and it unquestionably may allow the executive virtually unfettered discretion in determining the merits of appeals for mercy.  Nevertheless, there are equally valid reasons for concluding that these proceedings are not entirely exempt from judicial review.  I think, for example, that no one would contend that a governor could ignore the commands of the Equal Protection Clause and use race, religion, or political affiliation as a standard for granting or denying clemency.  Our cases also support the conclusion that if a State adopts a clemency procedure as an integral part of its system for finally determining whether to deprive a person of life, that procedure must comport with the Due Process Clause.

Indeed, Finley itself asked whether the States post-conviction proceedings comported with the fundamental fairness mandated by the Due Process Clause.  Id., at 556557; see also Murray v. Giarratano,

 (opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.) ( [T]he fundamental fairness mandated by the Due Process Clause does not require that the [S]tate supply a lawyer  (quoting Finley, 481 U. S., at 557)).  The Chief Justice, then, is simply wrong when he states that these cases make clear that there is no continuum requiring varying levels of process at every . . . phase of the criminal system, ante, at 10; instead, these cases simply turned on what process is due.

, makes it clear that they are.

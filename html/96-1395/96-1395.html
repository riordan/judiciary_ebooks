				The question presented by this case is whether either the Due Process Clause or the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA), 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/5/1101.html" class="subref" title="subref">5 U. S. C. §1101</a>

				, precludes a federal agency from sanctioning an employee for making false statements to the agency regarding alleged employment-related misconduct on the part of the employee.  We hold that they do not.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Respondents Walsh, Erickson, Kye, Barrett, Roberts, and McManus are government employees who were the subject of adverse actions by the various agencies for which they worked.  Each employee made false statements to agency investigators with respect to the misconduct with which they were charged.  In each case, the agency additionally charged the false statement as a ground for adverse action, and the action taken in each was based in part on the added charge.  The employees separately ap-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				pealed the actions taken against them to the Merit Systems Protection Board (Board).  The Board upheld that portion of the penalty based on the underlying charge in each case, but overturned the false statement charge.  The Board further held that an employees false statements could not be used for purposes of impeaching the employees credibility, nor could they be considered in setting the appropriate punishment for the employees underlying misconduct.  Finally, the Board held that an agency may not charge an employee with failure to report an act of fraud when reporting such fraud would tend to implicate the employee in employment-related misconduct.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Director of the Office of Personnel Management appealed each of these decisions by the Board to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.  In a consolidated appeal involving the cases of Walsh, Erickson, Kye, Barrett, and Roberts, that court agreed with the Board that no penalty could be based on a false denial of the underlying claim.

The agency must:

        <p class="bodytext">
				(1) give the employee at least 30 days advance written notice; (2) allow the employee a reasonable time, but not less than 7 days, to answer orally and in writing and to furnish . . . evidence in support of the answer; (3) permit the employee to be represented by an attorney or other representative; and (4) provide the employee with a written decision and the specific reasons therefor.

				The Court of Appeals sought to distinguish these cases on the ground that the defendants in them had been under oath, while here the respondents were not.  The fact that respondents were not under oath, of course, negates a charge of perjury, but that is not the charge brought against them.  They were charged with making false statements during the course of an agency investigation, a charge that does not require that the statements be made under oath.  While the Court of Appeals would apparently permit the imposition of punishment for the former but not the latter, we fail to see how the presence or absence of an oath is material to the due process inquiry.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court of Appeals also relied on its fear that if employees were not allowed to make false statements, they might be coerced into admitting the misconduct, whether they believe that they are guilty or not, in order to avoid the more severe penalty of removal possibly resulting from a falsification charge.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 16a-17a.

.  There a sentencing judge took into consideration his belief that the defendant had testified falsely at his trial.  The defendant argued before us that such a practice would inhibit the exercise of the right to testify truthfully in the proceeding.  We described that contention as entirely frivolous.

				Respondents Walsh, Erickson, Kye, Barrett, Roberts, and McManus are government employees who were the subject of adverse actions by the various agencies for which they worked.  Each employee made false statements to agency investigators with respect to the misconduct with which they were charged.  In each case, the agency additionally charged the false statement as a ground for adverse action, and the action taken in each was based in part on the added charge.  The employees separately ap-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				pealed the actions taken against them to the Merit Systems Protection Board (Board).  The Board upheld that portion of the penalty based on the underlying charge in each case, but overturned the false statement charge.  The Board further held that an employees false statements could not be used for purposes of impeaching the employees credibility, nor could they be considered in setting the appropriate punishment for the employees underlying misconduct.  Finally, the Board held that an agency may not charge an employee with failure to report an act of fraud when reporting such fraud would tend to implicate the employee in employment-related misconduct.

				The Director of the Office of Personnel Management appealed each of these decisions by the Board to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.  In a consolidated appeal involving the cases of Walsh, Erickson, Kye, Barrett, and Roberts, that court agreed with the Board that no penalty could be based on a false denial of the underlying claim.

				The Court of Appeals sought to distinguish these cases on the ground that the defendants in them had been under oath, while here the respondents were not.  The fact that respondents were not under oath, of course, negates a charge of perjury, but that is not the charge brought against them.  They were charged with making false statements during the course of an agency investigation, a charge that does not require that the statements be made under oath.  While the Court of Appeals would apparently permit the imposition of punishment for the former but not the latter, we fail to see how the presence or absence of an oath is material to the due process inquiry.

				The Court of Appeals sought to distinguish these cases on the ground that the defendants in them had been under oath, while here the respondents were not.  The fact that respondents were not under oath, of course, negates a charge of perjury, but that is not the charge brought against them.  They were charged with making false statements during the course of an agency investigation, a charge that does not require that the statements be made under oath.  While the Court of Appeals would apparently permit the imposition of punishment for the former but not the latter, we fail to see how the presence or absence of an oath is material to the due process inquiry.

				The question presented by this case is whether either the Due Process Clause or the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA),

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Respondents Walsh, Erickson, Kye, Barrett, Roberts, and McManus are government employees who were the subject of adverse actions by the various agencies for which they worked.  Each employee made false statements to agency investigators with respect to the misconduct with which they were charged.  In each case, the agency additionally charged the false statement as a ground for adverse action, and the action taken in each was based in part on the added charge.  The employees separately ap-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				pealed the actions taken against them to the Merit Systems Protection Board (Board).  The Board upheld that portion of the penalty based on the underlying charge in each case, but overturned the false statement charge.  The Board further held that an employees false statements could not be used for purposes of impeaching the employees credibility, nor could they be considered in setting the appropriate punishment for the employees underlying misconduct.  Finally, the Board held that an agency may not charge an employee with failure to report an act of fraud when reporting such fraud would tend to implicate the employee in employment-related misconduct.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Director of the Office of Personnel Management appealed each of these decisions by the Board to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.  In a consolidated appeal involving the cases of Walsh, Erickson, Kye, Barrett, and Roberts, that court agreed with the Board that no penalty could be based on a false denial of the underlying claim.

The agency must:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				(1) give the employee at least 30 days advance written notice; (2) allow the employee a reasonable time, but not less than 7 days, to answer orally and in writing and to furnish . . . evidence in support of the answer; (3) permit the employee to be represented by an attorney or other representative; and (4) provide the employee with a written decision and the specific reasons therefor.

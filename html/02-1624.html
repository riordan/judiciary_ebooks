        <p class="bodytext">
				Petitioner school district requires each elementary school class to recite daily the Pledge of Allegiance.  Respondent Newdows daughter participates in this exercise.  Newdow, an atheist, filed suit alleging that, because the Pledge contains the words under God, it constitutes religious indoctrination of his child in violation of the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses.  He also alleged that he had standing to sue on his own behalf and on behalf of his daughter as next friend.  The Magistrate Judge concluded that the Pledge is constitutional, and the District Court agreed and dismissed the complaint.  The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that Newdow has standing as a parent to challenge a practice that interferes with his right to direct his daughters religious education, and that the school districts policy violates the Establishment Clause.  Sandra Banning, the childs mother, then filed a motion to intervene or dismiss, declaring, 
				<em>
					inter alia
				</em>
				, that she had exclusive legal custody under a state-court order and that, as her daughters sole legal custodian, she felt it was not in the childs interest to be a party to Newdows suit.  Concluding that Bannings sole legal custody did not deprive Newdow, as a noncustodial parent, of Article III standing to object to unconstitutional government action affecting his child, the Ninth Circuit held that, under California law, Newdow retains the right to expose his child to his particular religious views even if they contradict her mothers, as well as the right to seek redress for an alleged injury to his own parental interests.
			</p>
        <p class="SYLCTE">
            <em>
					Held:
				</em>
				 Because California law deprives Newdow of the right to sue as next friend, he lacks prudential standing to challenge the school districts policy in federal court.  The standing requirement derives from the constitutional and prudential limits to the powers of an unelected, unrepresentative judiciary.  
				<em>
					E.g., Allen
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Wright,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/468/737" class="subref" title="subref">468 U. S. 737</a>.  The Courts prudential standing jurisprudence encompasses, 
				<em>
					inter alia
				</em>
				, the general prohibition on a litigants raising another persons legal rights, 
				<em>
					e.g., id.,
				</em>
				 at 751, and the Court generally declines to intervene in domestic relations, a traditional subject of state law, 
				<em>
					e.g., In re Burrus,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/136/586" class="subref" title="subref">136 U. S. 586</a>.  The extent of the standing problem raised by the domestic relations issues in this case was not apparent until Banning filed her motion to intervene or dismiss, declaring that the family court order gave her 
				<em>
					sole
				</em>
				 legal custody and authorized her to exercise legal control  over her daughter.  Newdows argument that he nevertheless retains an unrestricted right to inculcate in his daughter his beliefs fails because his rights cannot be viewed in isolation.  This case also concerns Bannings rights under the custody orders and, most important, their daughters interests upon finding herself at the center of a highly public debate.  Newdows standing derives entirely from his relationship with his daughter, but he lacks the right to litigate as her next friend.  Their interests are not parallel and, indeed, are potentially in conflict.  Newdows parental status is defined by state law, and this Court customarily defers to the state-law interpretations of the regional federal court, see 
				<em>
					Bishop
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Wood,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/426/341" class="subref" title="subref">426 U. S. 341</a>.  Here, the Ninth Circuit relied on intermediate state appellate cases recognizing the right of each parent, whether custodial or noncustodial, to impart to the child his or her religious perspective.  Nothing that either Banning or the school board has done, however, impairs Newdows right to instruct his daughter in his religious views.  Instead, he requests the more ambitious relief of forestalling his daughters exposure to religious ideas endorsed by her mother, who wields a form of veto power, and to use his parental status to challenge the influences to which his daughter may be exposed in school when he and Banning disagree.  The California cases simply do not stand for the proposition that Newdow has a right to reach outside the private parent-child sphere to dictate to others what they may and may not say to his child respecting religion.  A next friend surely could exercise such a right, but the family courts order has deprived Newdow of that status.  Pp. 714.

				Each day elementary school teachers in the Elk Grove Unified School District (School District) lead their classes in a group recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance.  Respondent, Michael A. Newdow, is an atheist whose daughter participates in that daily exercise.  Because the Pledge contains the words under God, he views the School Districts policy as a religious indoctrination of his child that violates the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.  A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed with Newdow.  In light of the obvious importance of that decision, we granted certiorari to review the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> issue and, preliminarily, the question whether Newdow has standing to invoke the jurisdiction of the federal courts.  We conclude that Newdow lacks standing and therefore reverse the Court of Appeals decision.

				The Pledge of Allegiance was initially conceived more than a century ago.  As part of the nationwide interest in commemorating the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus discovery of America, a widely circulated national magazine for youth proposed in 1892 that pupils recite the following affirmation: I pledge allegiance to my Flag and the Republic for which it stands: one Nation indivisible, with Liberty and Justice for all.

				  In the 1920s, the National Flag Conferences replaced the phrase my Flag with the flag of the United States of America.

However, civilians will always show full respect to the flag when the pledge is given by merely standing at attention, men removing the headdress.

				Congress revisited the Pledge of Allegiance 12 years later when it amended the text to add the words under God.  Act of June 14, 1954, ch. 297,

				In March 2000, Newdow filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California against the United States Congress, the President of the United States, the State of California, and the Elk Grove Unified School District and its superintendent.

				  App. 24.  At the time of filing, Newdows daughter was enrolled in kindergarten in the Elk Grove Unified School District and participated in the daily recitation of the Pledge.

				The case was referred to a Magistrate Judge, whose brief findings and recommendation concluded, the Pledge does not violate the Establishment Clause.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 79.  The District Court adopted that recommendation and dismissed the complaint on July 21, 2000.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 97.  The Court of Appeals reversed and issued three separate decisions discussing the merits and Newdows standing.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In its first opinion the appeals court unanimously held that Newdow has standing as a parent to challenge a practice that interferes with his right to direct the religious education of his daughter.  
				<em>
					Newdow
				</em>
				 v.

					U. S. Congress
				</em>
				, 292 F. 3d 597, 602 (CA9 2002) 
				<em>
					(Newdow I)

				.  That holding sustained Newdows standing to challenge not only the policy of the School District, where his daughter still is enrolled, but also the 1954 Act of Congress that had amended the Pledge, because his  injury in fact  was  fairly traceable  to its enactment.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 603605.  On the merits, over the dissent of one judge, the court held that both the 1954 Act and the School Districts policy violate the Establishment Clause of the

				<em>
					Id

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				After the Court of Appeals initial opinion was announced, Sandra Banning, the mother of Newdows daughter, filed a motion for leave to intervene, or alternatively to dismiss the complaint.  App. 82.  She declared that although she and Newdow shared physical custody of their daughter, a state-court order granted her exclusive legal custody of the child, including the sole right to represent [the daughters] legal interests and make all decision[s] about her education and welfare.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 82, ¶¶ 23.  Banning further stated that her daughter is a Christian who believes in God and has no objection either to reciting or hearing others recite the Pledge of Allegiance, or to its reference to God.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 83, ¶ 4.  Banning expressed the belief that her daughter would be harmed if the litigation were permitted to proceed, because others might incorrectly perceive the child as sharing her fathers atheist views.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 85, ¶ 10.  Banning accordingly concluded, as her daughters sole legal custodian, that it was not in the childs interest to be a party to Newdows lawsuit.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 86.  On September 25, 2002, the California Superior Court entered an order enjoining Newdow from including his daughter as an unnamed party or suing as her next friend.  That order did not purport to answer the question of Newdows Article III standing.  See 
				<em>
					Newdow
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>

				<em>
					(Newdow II)
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In a second published opinion, the Court of Appeals reconsidered Newdows standing in light of Bannings motion.  The court noted that Newdow no longer claimed to represent his daughter, but unanimously concluded that the grant of sole legal custody to Banning did not deprive Newdow, as a noncustodial parent, of Article III standing to object to unconstitutional government action affecting his child.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 502503.  The court held that under California law Newdow retains the right to expose his child to his particular religious views even if those views contradict the mothers, and that Bannings objections as sole legal custodian do not defeat Newdows right to seek redress for an alleged injury to his own parental interests.

				As explained briefly above, the extent of the standing problem raised by the domestic relations issues in this case was not apparent until August 5, 2002, when Banning filed her motion for leave to intervene or dismiss the complaint following the Court of Appeals initial decision.  At that time, the childs custody was governed by a February 6, 2002, order of the California Superior Court.  That order provided that Banning had  
				<em>
					sole
				</em>
				 legal custody as to the rights and responsibilities to make decisions relating to the health, education and welfare of  her daughter.  
				<em>
					Newdow II
				</em>
				, 313 F. 3d, at 502.  The order stated that the two parents should  consult with one another on substantial decisions relating to  the childs  psychological and educational needs,  but it authorized Banning to  exercise legal control  if the parents could not reach  mutual agreement.   
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				That family court order was the controlling document at the time of the Court of Appeals standing decision.  After the Court of Appeals ruled, however, the Superior Court held another conference regarding the childs custody.  At a hearing on September 11, 2003, the Superior Court announced that the parents have joint legal custody, but that Banning makes the final decisions if the two … disagree.  App. 127128.

				Newdow contends that despite Bannings final authority, he retains an unrestricted right to inculcate in his daughterfree from governmental interferencethe atheistic beliefs he finds persuasive.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 48, ¶ 78.  The difficulty with that argument is that Newdows rights, as in many cases touching upon family relations, cannot be viewed in isolation.  This case concerns not merely Newdows interest in inculcating his child with his views on religion, but also the rights of the childs mother as a parent generally and under the Superior Court orders specifically.  And most important, it implicates the interests of a young child who finds herself at the center of a highly public debate over her custody, the propriety of
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				a widespread national ritual, and the meaning of our Constitution.

				The interests of the affected persons in this case are in many respects antagonistic.  Of course, legal disharmony in family relations is not uncommon, and in many instances that disharmony poses no bar to federal-court adjudication of proper federal questions.  What makes this case different is that Newdows standing derives entirely from his relationship with his daughter, but he lacks the right to litigate as her next friend.

				Newdows parental status is defined by Californias domestic relations law.  Our custom on questions of state law ordinarily is to defer to the interpretation of the Court of Appeals for the Circuit in which the State is located.  See

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">346</a>347 (1976)

				<em>
					Newdow II
				</em>
				, 313 F. 3d, at 504505.  The court based its ruling on two intermediate state appellate cases holding that while the custodial parent undoubtedly has the right to make ultimate decisions concerning the childs religious upbringing, a court will not enjoin the noncustodial parent from discussing religion with the child or involving the child in his or her religious activities in the absence of a showing that the child will be thereby harmed.

				<em>
					Murga
				</em>
				 to invalidate portion of restraining order barring noncustodial father from engaging children in religious activity or discussion without custodial parents consent).  Animated by a conception of family privacy that includes not simply a policy of minimum state intervention but also a presumption of parental autonomy, 142 Cal. App. 3d, at 267268, 190 Cal. Rptr., at 848, the state cases create a zone of private authority within which each parent, whether custodial or noncustodial, remains free to impart to the child his or her religious perspective.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Nothing that either Banning or the School Board has done, however, impairs Newdows right to instruct his daughter in his religious views.  Instead, Newdow requests relief that is more ambitious than that sought in 
				<em>
					Mentry
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Murga
				</em>
				.  He wishes to forestall his daughters exposure to religious ideas that her mother, who wields a form of veto power, endorses, and to use his parental status to challenge the influences to which his daughter may be exposed in school when he and Banning disagree.  The California cases simply do not stand for the proposition that Newdow has a right to dictate to others what they may and may not say to his child respecting religion.  
				<em>
					Mentry
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Murga
				</em>
				 are concerned with protecting  the fragile, complex interpersonal bonds between child and parent,  142 Cal. App. 3d, at 267, 190 Cal. Rptr., at 848, and with permitting divorced parents to expose their children to the  diversity of religious experiences [that] is itself a sound stimulant for a child,  
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 265, 190 Cal. Rptr., at 847 (citation omitted).  The cases speak not at all to the problem of a parent seeking to reach outside the private parent-child sphere to restrain the acts of a third party.  A next friend surely could exercise such a right, but the Superior Courts order has deprived Newdow of that status.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In our view, it is improper for the federal courts to entertain a claim by a plaintiff whose standing to sue is founded on family law rights that are in dispute when prosecution of the lawsuit may have an adverse effect on the person who is the source of the plaintiffs claimed standing.  When hard questions of domestic relations are sure to affect the outcome, the prudent course is for the federal court to stay its hand rather than reach out to resolve a weighty question of federal constitutional law.  There is a vast difference between Newdows right to communicate with his childwhich both California law and the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> recognizeand his claimed right to shield his daughter from influences to which she is exposed in school despite the terms of the custody order.  We conclude that, having been deprived under California law of the right to sue as next friend, Newdow lacks prudential standing to bring this suit in federal court.

						 Our holding does not rest, as The Chief Justice suggests, see post, at 25, on either the domestic relations exception or the abstention doctrine.  Rather, our prudential standing analysis is informed by the variety of contexts in which federal courts decline to intervene because, as Ankenbrandt v. Richards, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/504/689" class="subref" title="subref">504 U. S. 689</a> (1992)
, contemplated, the suit depend[s] on a determination of the status of the parties, id., at 706.  We deemed it appropriate to review the dispute in Palmore because it raise[d] important federal concerns arising from the Constitutions commitment to eradicating discrimination based on race.  466 U. S., at 432.   In this case, by contrast, the disputed family law rights are entwined inextricably with the threshold standing inquiry.  The Chief Justice in this respect, see post, at 3, misses our point: The merits question undoubtedly transcends the domestic relations issue, but the standing question surely does not.

						 The court confirmed that position in a written order issued January 9, 2004:


The parties will have joint legal custody defined as follows: Ms. Banning will continue to make the final decisions as to the minors health, education, and welfare if the two parties cannot mutually agree.  The parties are required to consult with each other on substantial decisions relating to the health, education and welfare of the minor child, including … psychological and educational needs of the minor.  If mutual agreement is not reached in these areas, then Ms. Banning may exercise legal control of the minor that is not specifically prohibited or is inconsistent with the physical custody.  App. to Reply Brief for United States as Respondent Supporting Petitioners 12a.


Despite the use of the term joint legal custodywhich is defined by California statute, see Cal. Fam. Code Ann. §3003 (West 1994)we see no meaningful distinction for present purposes between the custody order issued February 6, 2002, and the one issued January 9, 2004.  Under either order, Newdow has the right to consult on issues relating to the childs education, but Banning possesses what we understand amounts to a tiebreaking vote.

						 Newdows complaint and brief cite several additional bases for standing: that Newdow at times has himself attendedand will in the future attendclass with his daughter, App. 49, ¶ 80; that he has considered teaching elementary school students in [the School District], id., at 65, ¶ 120; that he has attended and will continue to attend school board meetings at which the Pledge is routinely recited, id., at 52, ¶ 85; and that the School District uses his tax dollars to implement its Pledge policy, id., at 6265.  Even if these arguments suffice to establish Article III standing, they do not respond to our prudential concerns.  As for taxpayer standing, Newdow does not reside in or pay taxes to the School District; he alleges that he pays taxes to the District only indirectly through his child support payments to Banning.  Brief for Respondent Newdow 49, n. 70.  That allegation does not amount to the direct dollars-and-cents injury that our strict taxpayer-standing doctrine requires.  Doremus v.

				Each day elementary school teachers in the Elk Grove Unified School District (School District) lead their classes in a group recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance.  Respondent, Michael A. Newdow, is an atheist whose daughter participates in that daily exercise.  Because the Pledge contains the words under God, he views the School Districts policy as a religious indoctrination of his child that violates the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.  A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed with Newdow.  In light of the obvious importance of that decision, we granted certiorari to review the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> issue and, preliminarily, the question whether Newdow has standing to invoke the jurisdiction of the federal courts.  We conclude that Newdow lacks standing and therefore reverse the Court of Appeals decision.

				The Pledge of Allegiance was initially conceived more than a century ago.  As part of the nationwide interest in commemorating the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus discovery of America, a widely circulated national magazine for youth proposed in 1892 that pupils recite the following affirmation: I pledge allegiance to my Flag and the Republic for which it stands: one Nation indivisible, with Liberty and Justice for all.

				<em>

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In its first opinion the appeals court unanimously held that Newdow has standing as a parent to challenge a practice that interferes with his right to direct the religious education of his daughter.  
				<em>

				</em>
				 v.

					(Newdow I)

				.  That holding sustained Newdows standing to challenge not only the policy of the School District, where his daughter still is enrolled, but also the 1954 Act of Congress that had amended the Pledge, because his  injury in fact  was  fairly traceable  to its enactment.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 603605.  On the merits, over the dissent of one judge, the court held that both the 1954 Act and the School Districts policy violate the Establishment Clause of the

				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 612.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				After the Court of Appeals initial opinion was announced, Sandra Banning, the mother of Newdows daughter, filed a motion for leave to intervene, or alternatively to dismiss the complaint.  App. 82.  She declared that although she and Newdow shared physical custody of their daughter, a state-court order granted her exclusive legal custody of the child, including the sole right to represent [the daughters] legal interests and make all decision[s] about her education and welfare.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 82, ¶¶ 23.  Banning further stated that her daughter is a Christian who believes in God and has no objection either to reciting or hearing others recite the Pledge of Allegiance, or to its reference to God.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 83, ¶ 4.  Banning expressed the belief that her daughter would be harmed if the litigation were permitted to proceed, because others might incorrectly perceive the child as sharing her fathers atheist views.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 85, ¶ 10.  Banning accordingly concluded, as her daughters sole legal custodian, that it was not in the childs interest to be a party to Newdows lawsuit.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 86.  On September 25, 2002, the California Superior Court entered an order enjoining Newdow from including his daughter as an unnamed party or suing as her next friend.  That order did not purport to answer the question of Newdows Article III standing.  See 
				<em>
					Newdow
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>

				<em>
					(Newdow II)
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In a second published opinion, the Court of Appeals reconsidered Newdows standing in light of Bannings motion.  The court noted that Newdow no longer claimed to represent his daughter, but unanimously concluded that the grant of sole legal custody to Banning did not deprive Newdow, as a noncustodial parent, of Article III standing to object to unconstitutional government action affecting his child.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 502503.  The court held that under California law Newdow retains the right to expose his child to his particular religious views even if those views contradict the mothers, and that Bannings objections as sole legal custodian do not defeat Newdows right to seek redress for an alleged injury to his own parental interests.

Although we have not exhaustively defined the prudential dimensions of the standing doctrine, we have explained that prudential standing encompasses the general prohibition on a litigants raising another persons legal rights, the rule barring adjudication of generalized grievances more appropriately addressed in the representative branches, and the requirement that a plaintiffs complaint fall within the zone of interests protected by the law invoked.

				As explained briefly above, the extent of the standing problem raised by the domestic relations issues in this case was not apparent until August 5, 2002, when Banning filed her motion for leave to intervene or dismiss the complaint following the Court of Appeals initial decision.  At that time, the childs custody was governed by a February 6, 2002, order of the California Superior Court.  That order provided that Banning had  
				<em>
					sole
				</em>
				 legal custody as to the rights and responsibilities to make decisions relating to the health, education and welfare of  her daughter.  
				<em>
					Newdow II
				</em>
				, 313 F. 3d, at 502.  The order stated that the two parents should  consult with one another on substantial decisions relating to  the childs  psychological and educational needs,  but it authorized Banning to  exercise legal control  if the parents could not reach  mutual agreement. 

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				That family court order was the controlling document at the time of the Court of Appeals standing decision.  After the Court of Appeals ruled, however, the Superior Court held another conference regarding the childs custody.  At a hearing on September 11, 2003, the Superior Court announced that the parents have joint legal custody, but that Banning makes the final decisions if the two … disagree.  App. 127128.

				Newdow contends that despite Bannings final authority, he retains an unrestricted right to inculcate in his daughterfree from governmental interferencethe atheistic beliefs he finds persuasive.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 48, ¶ 78.  The difficulty with that argument is that Newdows rights, as in many cases touching upon family relations, cannot be viewed in isolation.  This case concerns not merely Newdows interest in inculcating his child with his views on religion, but also the rights of the childs mother as a parent generally and under the Superior Court orders specifically.  And most important, it implicates the interests of a young child who finds herself at the center of a highly public debate over her custody, the propriety of

				The interests of the affected persons in this case are in many respects antagonistic.  Of course, legal disharmony in family relations is not uncommon, and in many instances that disharmony poses no bar to federal-court adjudication of proper federal questions.  What makes this case different is that Newdows standing derives entirely from his relationship with his daughter, but he lacks the right to litigate as her next friend.

The court based its ruling on two intermediate state appellate cases holding that while the custodial parent undoubtedly has the right to make ultimate decisions concerning the childs religious upbringing, a court will not enjoin the noncustodial parent from discussing religion with the child or involving the child in his or her religious activities in the absence of a showing that the child will be thereby harmed.

				 to invalidate portion of restraining order barring noncustodial father from engaging children in religious activity or discussion without custodial parents consent).  Animated by a conception of family privacy that includes not simply a policy of minimum state intervention but also a presumption of parental autonomy, 142 Cal. App. 3d, at 267268, 190 Cal. Rptr., at 848, the state cases create a zone of private authority within which each parent, whether custodial or noncustodial, remains free to impart to the child his or her religious perspective.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Nothing that either Banning or the School Board has done, however, impairs Newdows right to instruct his daughter in his religious views.  Instead, Newdow requests relief that is more ambitious than that sought in 
				<em>
					Mentry
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Murga
				</em>
				.  He wishes to forestall his daughters exposure to religious ideas that her mother, who wields a form of veto power, endorses, and to use his parental status to challenge the influences to which his daughter may be exposed in school when he and Banning disagree.  The California cases simply do not stand for the proposition that Newdow has a right to dictate to others what they may and may not say to his child respecting religion.  
				<em>
					Mentry
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Murga

				 are concerned with protecting  the fragile, complex interpersonal bonds between child and parent,  142 Cal. App. 3d, at 267, 190 Cal.

				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 265, 190 Cal. Rptr., at 847 (citation omitted).  The cases speak not at all to the problem of a parent seeking to reach outside the private parent-child sphere to restrain the acts of a third party.  A next friend surely could exercise such a right, but the Superior Courts order has deprived Newdow of that status.

				In our view, it is improper for the federal courts to entertain a claim by a plaintiff whose standing to sue is founded on family law rights that are in dispute when prosecution of the lawsuit may have an adverse effect on the person who is the source of the plaintiffs claimed standing.  When hard questions of domestic relations are sure to affect the outcome, the prudent course is for the federal court to stay its hand rather than reach out to resolve a weighty question of federal constitutional law.  There is a vast difference between Newdows right to communicate with his childwhich both California law and the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> recognizeand his claimed right to shield his daughter from influences to which she is exposed in school despite the terms of the custody order.  We conclude that, having been deprived under California law of the right to sue as next friend, Newdow lacks prudential standing to bring this suit in federal court.

						 Our holding does not rest, as The Chief Justice suggests, see post, at 25, on either the domestic relations exception or the abstention doctrine.  Rather, our prudential standing analysis is informed by the variety of contexts in which federal courts decline to intervene because, as Ankenbrandt v. Richards, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/504/689" class="subref" title="subref">504 U. S. 689</a> (1992)

We deemed it appropriate to review the dispute in Palmore because it raise[d] important federal concerns arising from the Constitutions commitment to eradicating discrimination based on race.  466 U. S., at 432.   In this case, by contrast, the disputed family law rights are entwined inextricably with the threshold standing inquiry.  The Chief Justice in this respect, see post, at 3, misses our point: The merits question undoubtedly transcends the domestic relations issue, but the standing question surely does not.

						 The court confirmed that position in a written order issued January 9, 2004:


The parties will have joint legal custody defined as follows: Ms. Banning will continue to make the final decisions as to the minors health, education, and welfare if the two parties cannot mutually agree.  The parties are required to consult with each other on substantial decisions relating to the health, education and welfare of the minor child, including … psychological and educational needs of the minor.  If mutual agreement is not reached in these areas, then Ms. Banning may exercise legal control of the minor that is not specifically prohibited or is inconsistent with the physical custody.  App. to Reply Brief for United States as Respondent Supporting Petitioners 12a.


Despite the use of the term joint legal custodywhich is defined by California statute, see Cal. Fam. Code Ann. §3003 (West 1994)we see no meaningful distinction for present purposes between the custody order issued February 6, 2002, and the one issued January 9, 2004.  Under either order, Newdow has the right to consult on issues relating to the childs education, but Banning possesses what we understand amounts to a tiebreaking vote.

						 Newdows complaint and brief cite several additional bases for standing: that Newdow at times has himself attendedand will in the future attendclass with his daughter, App. 49, ¶ 80; that he has considered teaching elementary school students in [the School District], id., at 65, ¶ 120; that he has attended and will continue to attend school board meetings at which the Pledge is routinely recited, id., at 52, ¶ 85; and that the School District uses his tax dollars to implement its Pledge policy, id., at 6265.  Even if these arguments suffice to establish Article III standing, they do not respond to our prudential concerns.  As for taxpayer standing, Newdow does not reside in or pay taxes to the School District; he alleges that he pays taxes to the District only indirectly through his child support payments to Banning.

				Each day elementary school teachers in the Elk Grove Unified School District (School District) lead their classes in a group recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance.  Respondent, Michael A. Newdow, is an atheist whose daughter participates in that daily exercise.  Because the Pledge contains the words under God, he views the School Districts policy as a religious indoctrination of his child that violates the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.  A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed with Newdow.  In light of the obvious importance of that decision, we granted certiorari to review the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> issue and, preliminarily, the question whether Newdow has standing to invoke the jurisdiction of the federal courts.  We conclude that Newdow lacks standing and therefore reverse the Court of Appeals decision.

				After the Court of Appeals initial opinion was announced, Sandra Banning, the mother of Newdows daughter, filed a motion for leave to intervene, or alternatively to dismiss the complaint.  App. 82.  She declared that although she and Newdow shared physical custody of their daughter, a state-court order granted her exclusive legal custody of the child, including the sole right to represent [the daughters] legal interests and make all decision[s] about her education and welfare.

				In a second published opinion, the Court of Appeals reconsidered Newdows standing in light of Bannings motion.

				As explained briefly above, the extent of the standing problem raised by the domestic relations issues in this case was not apparent until August 5, 2002, when Banning filed her motion for leave to intervene or dismiss the complaint following the Court of Appeals initial decision.  At that time, the childs custody was governed by a February 6, 2002, order of the California Superior Court.  That order provided that Banning had  
				<em>
					sole
				</em>
				 legal custody as to the rights and responsibilities to make decisions relating to the health, education and welfare of  her daughter.  
				<em>
					Newdow II
				</em>
				, 313 F. 3d, at 502.  The order stated that the two parents should  consult with one another on substantial decisions relating to  the childs  psychological and educational needs,  but it authorized Banning to  exercise legal control  if the parents could not reach  mutual agreement.   
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				That family court order was the controlling document at the time of the Court of Appeals standing decision.  After the Court of Appeals ruled, however, the Superior Court held another conference regarding the childs custody.  At a hearing on September 11, 2003, the Superior Court announced that the parents have joint legal custody, but that Banning makes the final decisions if the two … disagree.  App. 127128.

				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 48, ¶ 78.  The difficulty with that argument is that Newdows rights, as in many cases touching upon family relations, cannot be viewed in isolation.  This case concerns not merely Newdows interest in inculcating his child with his views on religion, but also the rights of the childs mother as a parent generally and under the Superior Court orders specifically.  And most important, it implicates the interests of a young child who finds herself at the center of a highly public debate over her custody, the propriety of

				a widespread national ritual, and the meaning of our Constitution.

				The interests of the affected persons in this case are in many respects antagonistic.  Of course, legal disharmony in family relations is not uncommon, and in many instances that disharmony poses no bar to federal-court adjudication of proper federal questions.  What makes this case different is that Newdows standing derives entirely from his relationship with his daughter, but he lacks the right to litigate as her next friend.

The court based its ruling on two intermediate state appellate cases holding that while the custodial parent undoubtedly has the right to make ultimate decisions concerning the childs religious upbringing, a court will not enjoin the noncustodial parent from discussing religion with the child or involving the child in his or her religious activities in the absence of a showing that the child will be thereby harmed.

				 to invalidate portion of restraining order barring noncustodial father from engaging children in religious activity or discussion without custodial parents consent).  Animated by a conception of family privacy that includes not simply a policy of minimum state intervention but also a presumption of parental autonomy, 142 Cal. App. 3d, at 267268, 190 Cal.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Nothing that either Banning or the School Board has done, however, impairs Newdows right to instruct his daughter in his religious views.  Instead, Newdow requests relief that is more ambitious than that sought in

					Mentry

				 and 
				<em>
					Murga
				</em>
				.  He wishes to forestall his daughters exposure to religious ideas that her mother, who wields a form of veto power, endorses, and to use his parental status to challenge the influences to which his daughter may be exposed in school when he and Banning disagree.  The California cases simply do not stand for the proposition that Newdow has a right to dictate to others what they may and may not say to his child respecting religion.

				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 265, 190 Cal. Rptr., at 847 (citation omitted).  The cases speak not at all to the problem of a parent seeking to reach outside the private parent-child sphere to restrain the acts of a third party.  A next friend surely could exercise such a right, but the Superior Courts order has deprived Newdow of that status.

				In our view, it is improper for the federal courts to entertain a claim by a plaintiff whose standing to sue is founded on family law rights that are in dispute when prosecution of the lawsuit may have an adverse effect on the person who is the source of the plaintiffs claimed standing.  When hard questions of domestic relations are sure to affect the outcome, the prudent course is for the federal court to stay its hand rather than reach out to resolve a weighty question of federal constitutional law.  There is a vast difference between Newdows right to communicate with his childwhich both California law and the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> recognizeand his claimed right to shield his daughter from influences to which she is exposed in school despite the terms of the custody order.  We conclude that, having been deprived under California law of the right to sue as next friend, Newdow lacks prudential standing to bring this suit in federal court.

						 Newdow also named as defendants the Sacramento Unified School District and its superintendent on the chance that his daughter might one day attend school in that district.  App. 48.  The Court of Appeals held that Newdow lacks standing to challenge that districts policy because his daughter is not currently a student there.  Newdow v. U. S.

						 Our holding does not rest, as The Chief Justice suggests, see post, at 25, on either the domestic relations exception or the abstention doctrine.  Rather, our prudential standing analysis is informed by the variety of contexts in which federal courts decline to intervene because, as Ankenbrandt v. Richards,

We deemed it appropriate to review the dispute in Palmore because it raise[d] important federal concerns arising from the Constitutions commitment to eradicating discrimination based on race.  466 U. S., at 432.   In this case, by contrast, the disputed family law rights are entwined inextricably with the threshold standing inquiry.  The Chief Justice in this respect, see post, at 3, misses our point: The merits question undoubtedly transcends the domestic relations issue, but the standing question surely does not.

						 The court confirmed that position in a written order issued January 9, 2004:


The parties will have joint legal custody defined as follows: Ms. Banning will continue to make the final decisions as to the minors health, education, and welfare if the two parties cannot mutually agree.  The parties are required to consult with each other on substantial decisions relating to the health, education and welfare of the minor child, including … psychological and educational needs of the minor.  If mutual agreement is not reached in these areas, then Ms. Banning may exercise legal control of the minor that is not specifically prohibited or is inconsistent with the physical custody.  App. to Reply Brief for United States as Respondent Supporting Petitioners 12a.


Despite the use of the term joint legal custodywhich is defined by California statute, see Cal. Fam. Code Ann. §3003 (West 1994)we see no meaningful distinction for present purposes between the custody order issued February 6, 2002, and the one issued January 9, 2004.  Under either order, Newdow has the right to consult on issues relating to the childs education, but Banning possesses what we understand amounts to a tiebreaking vote.

				Each day elementary school teachers in the Elk Grove Unified School District (School District) lead their classes in a group recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance.  Respondent, Michael A. Newdow, is an atheist whose daughter participates in that daily exercise.  Because the Pledge contains the words under God, he views the School Districts policy as a religious indoctrination of his child that violates the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.  A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed with Newdow.  In light of the obvious importance of that decision, we granted certiorari to review the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> issue and, preliminarily, the question whether Newdow has standing to invoke the jurisdiction of the federal courts.  We conclude that Newdow lacks standing and therefore reverse the Court of Appeals decision.

				The Pledge of Allegiance was initially conceived more than a century ago.  As part of the nationwide interest in commemorating the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus discovery of America, a widely circulated national magazine for youth proposed in 1892 that pupils recite the following affirmation: I pledge allegiance to my Flag and the Republic for which it stands: one Nation indivisible, with Liberty and Justice for all.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In its first opinion the appeals court unanimously held that Newdow has standing as a parent to challenge a practice that interferes with his right to direct the religious education of his daughter.

				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 603605.  On the merits, over the dissent of one judge, the court held that both the 1954 Act and the School Districts policy violate the Establishment Clause of the

				<em>

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				After the Court of Appeals initial opinion was announced, Sandra Banning, the mother of Newdows daughter, filed a motion for leave to intervene, or alternatively to dismiss the complaint.  App. 82.  She declared that although she and Newdow shared physical custody of their daughter, a state-court order granted her exclusive legal custody of the child, including the sole right to represent [the daughters] legal interests and make all decision[s] about her education and welfare.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 82, ¶¶ 23.  Banning further stated that her daughter is a Christian who believes in God and has no objection either to reciting or hearing others recite the Pledge of Allegiance, or to its reference to God.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 83, ¶ 4.  Banning expressed the belief that her daughter would be harmed if the litigation were permitted to proceed, because others might incorrectly perceive the child as sharing her fathers atheist views.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 85, ¶ 10.  Banning accordingly concluded, as her daughters sole legal custodian, that it was not in the childs interest to be a party to Newdows lawsuit.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 86.  On September 25, 2002, the California Superior Court entered an order enjoining Newdow from including his daughter as an unnamed party or suing as her next friend.  That order did not purport to answer the question of Newdows Article III standing.  See 
				<em>

				 v. 
				<em>

				<em>
					(Newdow II)

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In a second published opinion, the Court of Appeals reconsidered Newdows standing in light of Bannings motion.  The court noted that Newdow no longer claimed to represent his daughter, but unanimously concluded that the grant of sole legal custody to Banning did not deprive Newdow, as a noncustodial parent, of Article III standing to object to unconstitutional government action affecting his child.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 502503.  The court held that under California law Newdow retains the right to expose his child to his particular religious views even if those views contradict the mothers, and that Bannings objections as sole legal custodian do not defeat Newdows right to seek redress for an alleged injury to his own parental interests.

				As explained briefly above, the extent of the standing problem raised by the domestic relations issues in this case was not apparent until August 5, 2002, when Banning filed her motion for leave to intervene or dismiss the complaint following the Court of Appeals initial decision.  At that time, the childs custody was governed by a February 6, 2002, order of the California Superior Court.  That order provided that Banning had  
				<em>
					sole
				</em>
				 legal custody as to the rights and responsibilities to make decisions relating to the health, education and welfare of  her daughter.  
				<em>
					Newdow II
				</em>
				, 313 F. 3d, at 502.  The order stated that the two parents should  consult with one another on substantial decisions relating to  the childs  psychological and educational needs,  but it authorized Banning to  exercise legal control  if the parents could not reach  mutual agreement.   
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				That family court order was the controlling document at the time of the Court of Appeals standing decision.  After the Court of Appeals ruled, however, the Superior Court held another conference regarding the childs custody.  At a hearing on September 11, 2003, the Superior Court announced that the parents have joint legal custody, but that Banning makes the final decisions if the two … disagree.  App. 127128.

				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 48, ¶ 78.  The difficulty with that argument is that Newdows rights, as in many cases touching upon family relations, cannot be viewed in isolation.  This case concerns not merely Newdows interest in inculcating his child with his views on religion, but also the rights of the childs mother as a parent generally and under the Superior Court orders specifically.  And most important, it implicates the interests of a young child who finds herself at the center of a highly public debate over her custody, the propriety of

				a widespread national ritual, and the meaning of our Constitution.

				The interests of the affected persons in this case are in many respects antagonistic.  Of course, legal disharmony in family relations is not uncommon, and in many instances that disharmony poses no bar to federal-court adjudication of proper federal questions.  What makes this case different is that Newdows standing derives entirely from his relationship with his daughter, but he lacks the right to litigate as her next friend.

				, 313 F. 3d, at 504505.  The court based its ruling on two intermediate state appellate cases holding that while the custodial parent undoubtedly has the right to make ultimate decisions concerning the childs religious upbringing, a court will not enjoin the noncustodial parent from discussing religion with the child or involving the child in his or her religious activities in the absence of a showing that the child will be thereby harmed.

				<em>
					Murga
				</em>
				 to invalidate portion of restraining order barring noncustodial father from engaging children in religious activity or discussion without custodial parents consent).  Animated by a conception of family privacy that includes not simply a policy of minimum state intervention but also a presumption of parental autonomy, 142 Cal. App. 3d, at 267268, 190 Cal. Rptr., at 848, the state cases create a zone of private authority within which each parent, whether custodial or noncustodial, remains free to impart to the child his or her religious perspective.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Nothing that either Banning or the School Board has done, however, impairs Newdows right to instruct his daughter in his religious views.  Instead, Newdow requests relief that is more ambitious than that sought in 
				<em>
					Mentry
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Murga
				</em>
				.  He wishes to forestall his daughters exposure to religious ideas that her mother, who wields a form of veto power, endorses, and to use his parental status to challenge the influences to which his daughter may be exposed in school when he and Banning disagree.  The California cases simply do not stand for the proposition that Newdow has a right to dictate to others what they may and may not say to his child respecting religion.  
				<em>
					Mentry
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Murga
				</em>
				 are concerned with protecting  the fragile, complex interpersonal bonds between child and parent,  142 Cal. App. 3d, at 267, 190 Cal. Rptr., at 848, and with permitting divorced parents to expose their children to the  diversity of religious experiences [that] is itself a sound stimulant for a child,  
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 265, 190 Cal. Rptr., at 847 (citation omitted).  The cases speak not at all to the problem of a parent seeking to reach outside the private parent-child sphere to restrain the acts of a third party.  A next friend surely could exercise such a right, but the Superior Courts order has deprived Newdow of that status.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In our view, it is improper for the federal courts to entertain a claim by a plaintiff whose standing to sue is founded on family law rights that are in dispute when prosecution of the lawsuit may have an adverse effect on the person who is the source of the plaintiffs claimed standing.  When hard questions of domestic relations are sure to affect the outcome, the prudent course is for the federal court to stay its hand rather than reach out to resolve a weighty question of federal constitutional law.  There is a vast difference between Newdows right to communicate with his childwhich both California law and the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> recognizeand his claimed right to shield his daughter from influences to which she is exposed in school despite the terms of the custody order.  We conclude that, having been deprived under California law of the right to sue as next friend, Newdow lacks prudential standing to bring this suit in federal court.

						 Our holding does not rest, as The Chief Justice suggests, see post, at 25, on either the domestic relations exception or the abstention doctrine.  Rather, our prudential standing analysis is informed by the variety of contexts in which federal courts decline to intervene because, as Ankenbrandt v. Richards, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/504/689" class="subref" title="subref">504 U. S. 689</a> (1992)

We deemed it appropriate to review the dispute in Palmore because it raise[d] important federal concerns arising from the Constitutions commitment to eradicating discrimination based on race.  466 U. S., at 432.   In this case, by contrast, the disputed family law rights are entwined inextricably with the threshold standing inquiry.  The Chief Justice in this respect, see post, at 3, misses our point: The merits question undoubtedly transcends the domestic relations issue, but the standing question surely does not.

						 The court confirmed that position in a written order issued January 9, 2004:


The parties will have joint legal custody defined as follows: Ms. Banning will continue to make the final decisions as to the minors health, education, and welfare if the two parties cannot mutually agree.  The parties are required to consult with each other on substantial decisions relating to the health, education and welfare of the minor child, including … psychological and educational needs of the minor.  If mutual agreement is not reached in these areas, then Ms. Banning may exercise legal control of the minor that is not specifically prohibited or is inconsistent with the physical custody.  App. to Reply Brief for United States as Respondent Supporting Petitioners 12a.


Despite the use of the term joint legal custodywhich is defined by California statute, see Cal. Fam. Code Ann. §3003 (West 1994)we see no meaningful distinction for present purposes between the custody order issued February 6, 2002, and the one issued January 9, 2004.  Under either order, Newdow has the right to consult on issues relating to the childs education, but Banning possesses what we understand amounts to a tiebreaking vote.

						 Newdows complaint and brief cite several additional bases for standing: that Newdow at times has himself attendedand will in the future attendclass with his daughter, App. 49, ¶ 80; that he has considered teaching elementary school students in [the School District], id., at 65, ¶ 120; that he has attended and will continue to attend school board meetings at which the Pledge is routinely recited, id., at 52, ¶ 85; and that the School District uses his tax dollars to implement its Pledge policy, id., at 6265.  Even if these arguments suffice to establish Article III standing, they do not respond to our prudential concerns.

				Each day elementary school teachers in the Elk Grove Unified School District (School District) lead their classes in a group recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance.  Respondent, Michael A. Newdow, is an atheist whose daughter participates in that daily exercise.  Because the Pledge contains the words under God, he views the School Districts policy as a religious indoctrination of his child that violates the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.  A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed with Newdow.  In light of the obvious importance of that decision, we granted certiorari to review the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> issue and, preliminarily, the question whether Newdow has standing to invoke the jurisdiction of the federal courts.

				After the Court of Appeals initial opinion was announced, Sandra Banning, the mother of Newdows daughter, filed a motion for leave to intervene, or alternatively to dismiss the complaint.  App. 82.  She declared that although she and Newdow shared physical custody of their daughter, a state-court order granted her exclusive legal custody of the child, including the sole right to represent [the daughters] legal interests and make all decision[s] about her education and welfare.

				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 83, ¶ 4.  Banning expressed the belief that her daughter would be harmed if the litigation were permitted to proceed, because others might incorrectly perceive the child as sharing her fathers atheist views.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 85, ¶ 10.  Banning accordingly concluded, as her daughters sole legal custodian, that it was not in the childs interest to be a party to Newdows lawsuit.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 86.  On September 25, 2002, the California Superior Court entered an order enjoining Newdow from including his daughter as an unnamed party or suing as her next friend.  That order did not purport to answer the question of Newdows Article III standing.  See

				In a second published opinion, the Court of Appeals reconsidered Newdows standing in light of Bannings motion.  The court noted that Newdow no longer claimed to represent his daughter, but unanimously concluded that the grant of sole legal custody to Banning did not deprive Newdow, as a noncustodial parent, of Article III standing to object to unconstitutional government action affecting his child.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 502503.  The court held that under California law Newdow retains the right to expose his child to his particular religious views even if those views contradict the mothers, and that Bannings objections as sole legal custodian do not defeat Newdows right to seek redress for an alleged injury to his own parental interests.

				As explained briefly above, the extent of the standing problem raised by the domestic relations issues in this case was not apparent until August 5, 2002, when Banning filed her motion for leave to intervene or dismiss the complaint following the Court of Appeals initial decision.  At that time, the childs custody was governed by a February 6, 2002, order of the California Superior Court.  That order provided that Banning had  
				<em>
					sole
				</em>
				 legal custody as to the rights and responsibilities to make decisions relating to the health, education and welfare of  her daughter.  
				<em>
					Newdow II
				</em>
				, 313 F. 3d, at 502.  The order stated that the two parents should  consult with one another on substantial decisions relating to  the childs  psychological and educational needs,  but it authorized Banning to  exercise legal control  if the parents could not reach  mutual agreement.   
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				That family court order was the controlling document at the time of the Court of Appeals standing decision.  After the Court of Appeals ruled, however, the Superior Court held another conference regarding the childs custody.  At a hearing on September 11, 2003, the Superior Court announced that the parents have joint legal custody, but that Banning makes the final decisions if the two … disagree.  App. 127128.

				Newdow contends that despite Bannings final authority, he retains an unrestricted right to inculcate in his daughterfree from governmental interferencethe atheistic beliefs he finds persuasive.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 48, ¶ 78.  The difficulty with that argument is that Newdows rights, as in many cases touching upon family relations, cannot be viewed in isolation.  This case concerns not merely Newdows interest in inculcating his child with his views on religion, but also the rights of the childs mother as a parent generally and under the Superior Court orders specifically.  And most important, it implicates the interests of a young child who finds herself at the center of a highly public debate over her custody, the propriety of

				The interests of the affected persons in this case are in many respects antagonistic.  Of course, legal disharmony in family relations is not uncommon, and in many instances that disharmony poses no bar to federal-court adjudication of proper federal questions.  What makes this case different is that Newdows standing derives entirely from his relationship with his daughter, but he lacks the right to litigate as her next friend.

The court based its ruling on two intermediate state appellate cases holding that while the custodial parent undoubtedly has the right to make ultimate decisions concerning the childs religious upbringing, a court will not enjoin the noncustodial parent from discussing religion with the child or involving the child in his or her religious activities in the absence of a showing that the child will be thereby harmed.

				 to invalidate portion of restraining order barring noncustodial father from engaging children in religious activity or discussion without custodial parents consent).  Animated by a conception of family privacy that includes not simply a policy of minimum state intervention but also a presumption of parental autonomy, 142 Cal. App. 3d, at 267268, 190 Cal. Rptr., at 848, the state cases create a zone of private authority within which each parent, whether custodial or noncustodial, remains free to impart to the child his or her religious perspective.

				Nothing that either Banning or the School Board has done, however, impairs Newdows right to instruct his daughter in his religious views.  Instead, Newdow requests relief that is more ambitious than that sought in 
				<em>
					Mentry
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Murga
				</em>
				.  He wishes to forestall his daughters exposure to religious ideas that her mother, who wields a form of veto power, endorses, and to use his parental status to challenge the influences to which his daughter may be exposed in school when he and Banning disagree.  The California cases simply do not stand for the proposition that Newdow has a right to dictate to others what they may and may not say to his child respecting religion.

				<em>

				., at 265, 190 Cal. Rptr., at 847 (citation omitted).  The cases speak not at all to the problem of a parent seeking to reach outside the private parent-child sphere to restrain the acts of a third party.  A next friend surely could exercise such a right, but the Superior Courts order has deprived Newdow of that status.

				In our view, it is improper for the federal courts to entertain a claim by a plaintiff whose standing to sue is founded on family law rights that are in dispute when prosecution of the lawsuit may have an adverse effect on the person who is the source of the plaintiffs claimed standing.  When hard questions of domestic relations are sure to affect the outcome, the prudent course is for the federal court to stay its hand rather than reach out to resolve a weighty question of federal constitutional law.  There is a vast difference between Newdows right to communicate with his childwhich both California law and the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> recognizeand his claimed right to shield his daughter from influences to which she is exposed in school despite the terms of the custody order.  We conclude that, having been deprived under California law of the right to sue as next friend, Newdow lacks prudential standing to bring this suit in federal court.

						 Our holding does not rest, as The Chief Justice suggests, see post, at 25, on either the domestic relations exception or the abstention doctrine.  Rather, our prudential standing analysis is informed by the variety of contexts in which federal courts decline to intervene because, as Ankenbrandt v. Richards, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/504/689" class="subref" title="subref">504 U. S. 689</a> (1992)
, contemplated, the suit depend[s] on a determination of the status of the parties, id., at 706.  We deemed it appropriate to review the dispute in Palmore because it raise[d] important federal concerns arising from the Constitutions commitment to eradicating discrimination based on race.  466 U. S., at 432.   In this case, by contrast, the disputed family law rights are entwined inextricably with the threshold standing inquiry.  The Chief Justice in this respect, see post, at 3, misses our point: The merits question undoubtedly transcends the domestic relations issue, but the standing question surely does not.

						 The court confirmed that position in a written order issued January 9, 2004:


The parties will have joint legal custody defined as follows: Ms. Banning will continue to make the final decisions as to the minors health, education, and welfare if the two parties cannot mutually agree.  The parties are required to consult with each other on substantial decisions relating to the health, education and welfare of the minor child, including … psychological and educational needs of the minor.  If mutual agreement is not reached in these areas, then Ms. Banning may exercise legal control of the minor that is not specifically prohibited or is inconsistent with the physical custody.  App. to Reply Brief for United States as Respondent Supporting Petitioners 12a.


Despite the use of the term joint legal custodywhich is defined by California statute, see Cal. Fam. Code Ann. §3003 (West 1994)we see no meaningful distinction for present purposes between the custody order issued February 6, 2002, and the one issued January 9, 2004.  Under either order, Newdow has the right to consult on issues relating to the childs education, but Banning possesses what we understand amounts to a tiebreaking vote.

						 Newdows complaint and brief cite several additional bases for standing: that Newdow at times has himself attendedand will in the future attendclass with his daughter, App. 49, ¶ 80; that he has considered teaching elementary school students in [the School District], id., at 65, ¶ 120; that he has attended and will continue to attend school board meetings at which the Pledge is routinely recited, id., at 52, ¶ 85; and that the School District uses his tax dollars to implement its Pledge policy, id., at 6265.  Even if these arguments suffice to establish Article III standing, they do not respond to our prudential concerns.  As for taxpayer standing, Newdow does not reside in or pay taxes to the School District; he alleges that he pays taxes to the District only indirectly through his child support payments to Banning.  Brief for Respondent Newdow 49, n. 70.  That allegation does not amount to the direct dollars-and-cents injury that our strict taxpayer-standing doctrine requires.  Doremus v.

				The Court today erects a novel prudential standing principle in order to avoid reaching the merits of the constitutional claim.  I dissent from that ruling.  On the merits, I conclude that the Elk Grove Unified School District (School District) policy that requires teachers to lead willing students in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance, which includes the words under God, does not violate the Establishment Clause of the

				 at 78.  To be clear, the Court does not dispute that respondent Newdow (hereinafter respondent) satisfies the requisites of Article III standing.  But curiously the Court incorporates criticism of the Court of Appeals Article III standing decision into its justification for its novel prudential standing principle.  The Court concludes that respondent lacks prudential standing, under its new standing principle, to bring his suit in federal court.

 (Standing doctrine embraces several judicially self-imposed limits on the exercise of federal jurisdiction, such as the general prohibition on a litigants raising another persons legal rights …).  In contrast, here is the Courts new prudential standing principle: [I]t is improper for the federal courts to entertain a claim by a plaintiff whose standing to sue is founded on family law rights that are in dispute when prosecution of the lawsuit may have an adverse effect on the person who is the source of the plaintiffs claimed standing.  
				<em>

				13.  The Court loosely bases this novel prudential standing limitation on the domestic relations exception to diversity-of-citizenship jurisdiction pursuant to 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1332.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				First, the Court relies heavily on 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Richards,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/504/689" class="subref" title="subref">504 U. S. 689</a> (1992)
, in which we discussed both the domestic relations exception and the abstention doctrine.  In 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				, the mother of two children sued her former spouse and his female companion on behalf of the children, alleging physical and sexual abuse of the children.  The lower courts declined jurisdiction based on the domestic relations exception to diversity jurisdiction and abstention under 
				<em>
					Younger
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Harris,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/401/37" class="subref" title="subref">401 U. S. 37</a> (1971)
.  We reversed, concluding that the domestic relations exception only applies when a party seeks to have a district court issue a divorce, alimony, and child custody decree, 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				, 504 U. S., at 704.  We further held that abstention was inappropriate because the status of the domestic relationship ha[d] been determined as a matter of state law, and in any event ha[d] no bearing on the underlying torts alleged, 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 706.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court first cites the domestic relations exception to support its new principle.  Then the Court relies on a quote from 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				s discussion of the abstention doctrine: We have also acknowledged that it might be appropriate for the federal courts to decline to hear a case involving elements of the domestic relationship, 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 705, even when divorce, alimony, or child custody is not strictly at issue.  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 910.  The Court perfunctorily states: [T]hus, while rare instances arise in which it is necessary to answer a substantial federal question that transcends or exists apart from the family law issue, see, 
				<em>
					e.g., Palmore
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Sidoti,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/466/429" class="subref" title="subref">466 U. S. 429</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">432</a>434 (1984)
, in general it is appropriate for the federal courts to leave delicate issues of domestic relations to the state courts.  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 9.  That conclusion does not follow from 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				s
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				discussion of the domestic relations exception and abstention; even if it did, it would not be applicable in this case because, on the merits, this case presents a substantial federal question that transcends the family law issue to a greater extent than 
				<em>
					Palmore
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The domestic relations exception is not a prudential limitation on our federal jurisdiction.  It is a limiting construction of the statute defining federal diversity jurisdiction, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1332.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1332</a>, which divests the federal courts of power to issue divorce, alimony, and child custody decrees, 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt,
				</em>
				 504
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				U. S., at 703.  This case does not involve diversity jurisdiction, and respondent does not ask this Court to issue a divorce, alimony, or child custody decree.  Instead it involves a substantial federal question about the constitutionality of the School Districts conducting the pledge ceremony, which is the source of our jurisdiction.  Therefore, the domestic relations exception to diversity jurisdiction forms no basis for denying standing to respondent.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				When we discussed abstention in 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				, we first noted that [a]bstention rarely should be invoked, because the federal courts have a virtually unflagging obligation … to exercise the jurisdiction given them.   
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 705 (quoting 
				<em>
					Colorado River Water Conservation Dist.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					United States,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/424/800" class="subref" title="subref">424 U. S. 800</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">817</a> (1976)
).  
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				s discussion of abstention by no means supports the proposition that only in the rare instances where a substantial federal question … transcends or exists apart from the family law issue, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				9, should federal courts decide the federal issue.  As in 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				, the status of the domestic relationship has been determined as a matter of state law, and in any event has no bearing on the underlying [constitutional violation] alleged.  504 U. S., at 706.  Sandra Banning and respondent now share joint custody of their daughter, respondent retains the right to expose his daughter to his religious views, and the state of their domestic affairs has nothing to do with the underlying constitutional claim.  Abstention forms no basis for denying respondent standing.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court cites
				<em>
					 Palmore
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Sidoti,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/466/429" class="subref" title="subref">466 U. S. 429</a> (1984)
, as an example of the exceptional case where a substantial federal question that transcends or exists apart from the family law issue makes the exercise of our jurisdiction appropriate.  
				<em>
					Ante, 
				</em>
				at 9.  In 
				<em>
					Palmore
				</em>
				, we granted certiorari to review a child custody decision, and reversed the state courts decision because we found that the effects of racial prejudice resulting from the mothers interracial marriage could not justify granting custody to the father.  Contrary to the Courts assertion, the alleged constitutional violation, while clearly involving a substantial federal question, did not transcen[d] or exis[t] apart from the family law issue, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 9; it had everything to do with the domestic relationship[w]e granted certiorari to review a 
				<em>
					judgment of a state court divesting a natural mother of the custody of her infant child
				</em>
				, 466 U. S., at 430 (emphasis added).  Under the Courts discussion today, it appears that we should have stayed out of the domestic dispute in 
				<em>
					Palmore 
				</em>
				no matter how constitutionally offensive the result would have been.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Finally, it seems the Court bases its new prudential standing principle, in part, on criticisms of the Court of Appeals construction of state law, coupled with the prudential principle prohibiting third-party standing.  In the Court of Appeals original opinion, it held unanimously that respondent satisfied the Article III standing requirements, stating respondent has standing as a parent to challenge a practice that interferes with his right to direct the education of his daughter.  
				<em>
					Newdow 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					United States Congress
				</em>
				, 292 F. 3d 597, 602 (CA9 2002).  After Banning moved for leave to intervene, the Court of Appeals reexamined respondents standing to determine whether the parents court-ordered custodial arrangement altered respondents standing.  
				<em>
					Newdow 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					United States Congress
				</em>
				, 313 F. 3d 500 (CA9 2002).  The court examined whether respondent could assert an injury in fact by asking whether, under California law, noncustodial parents maintain the right to expose and educate their children to their individual religious views, even if those religious views contradict those of the custodial parent.

				The Court does not take issue with the fact that, under California law, respondent retains a right to influence his daughters religious upbringing and to expose her to his views.  But it relies on Bannings view of the merits of this case to diminish respondents interest, stating that the respondent wishes to forestall his daughters exposure to religious ideas that her mother, who wields a form of veto power, endorses, and to use his parental status to challenge the influences to which his daughter may be exposed in school when he and Banning disagree.  Ante,

				</em>
				13.  As alleged by respondent and as recognized by the Court of Appeals, respondent wishes to enjoin the School District from endorsing a form of religion inconsistent with his own views because he has a right to expose his daughter to those views without the States placing its 
				<em>
					imprimatur
				</em>
				 on a particular religion.  Under the Court of Appeals construction of California law, Bannings veto power does not override respondents right to challenge the pledge ceremony.

				The Court concludes that the California cases do not stand for the proposition that [respondent] has a right to dictate to others what they may or may not say to his child respecting religion.

				.  Surely, under California case law and the current custody order, respondent may not tell Banning what she may say to their child respecting religion, and respondent does not seek to.  Just as surely, respondent cannot name his daughter as a party to a lawsuit against Bannings wishes.  But his claim is different: Respondent does not seek to tell just anyone what he or she may say to his daughter, and he does not seek to vindicate solely her rights.

				Respondent asserts that the School Districts pledge ceremony infringes his right under California law to expose his daughter to his religious views.  While she is intimately associated with the source of respondents standing (the father-daughter relationship and respondents rights thereunder), the daughter 
				<em>

As part of an overall effort to codify and emphasize existing rules and customs pertaining to the display and use of the flag of the United States of America, see H. R. Rep. No. 2047, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., 1 (1942); S. Rep. No. 1477, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., 1 (1942), Congress enacted the Pledge on June 22, 1942.  Pub. L. 623, ch. 435, §7,

249.  The amendments sponsor, Representative Rabaut, said its purpose was to contrast this countrys belief in God with the Soviet Unions embrace of atheism.  100 Cong. Rec. 1700 (1954).  We do not know what other Members of Congress thought about the purpose of the amendment.  Following the decision of the Court of Appeals in this case, Congress passed legislation that made extensive findings about the historic role of religion in the political development of the Nation and reaffirmed the text of the Pledge.  Act of Nov. 13, 2002, Pub. L. 107293, §§12, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">116</a>Stat.
20572060.  To the millions of people who regularly recite the Pledge, and who have no access to, or concern with, such legislation or legislative history, under God might mean several different things: that God has guided the destiny of the United States, for example, or that the United States exists under Gods authority.  How much consideration anyone gives to the phrase probably varies, since the Pledge itself is a patriotic observance focused primarily on the flag and the Nation, and only secondarily on the description of the Nation.

				The phrase under God in the Pledge seems, as a historical matter, to sum up the attitude of the Nations leaders, and to manifest itself in many of our public observances.  Examples of patriotic invocations of God and official acknowledgments of religions role in our Nations history abound.

				The motto In God We Trust first appeared on the countrys coins during the Civil War.  Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P.

The motto was placed on more and more denominations, and since 1938 all United States coins bear the motto.  Paper currency followed suit at a slower pace; Federal Reserve notes were so inscribed during the decade of the 1960s.

				As pointed out by the Court, California law requires public elementary schools to conduc[t] … appropriate patriotic exercises at the beginning of the schoolday, and notes that the giving of the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America shall satisfy the requirements of this section.  Cal. Educ. Code Ann. §52720 (West 1989).  The School District complies with this requirement by instructing that [e]ach elementary school class recite the [P]ledge of [A]llegiance to the [F]lag once each day.  App. 149150.

.  That case arose out of a graduation ceremony for a public high school in Providence, Rhode Island.  The ceremony was begun with an invocation, and ended with a benediction, given by a local rabbi.  The Court held that even though attendance at the ceremony was voluntary, students who objected to the prayers would nonetheless feel coerced to attend and to stand during each prayer.  But the Court throughout its opinion referred to the prayer as an explicit religious exercise,

				I do not believe that the phrase under God in the Pledge converts its recital into a religious exercise of the sort described in 
				<em>
					Lee
				</em>
				.  Instead, it is a declaration of belief in allegiance and loyalty to the United States flag and the Republic that it represents.  The phrase under God is in no sense a prayer, nor an endorsement of any religion, but a simple recognition of the fact noted in H. R. Rep. No. 1693, at 2: From the time of our earliest history our peoples and our institutions have reflected the traditional concept that our Nation was founded on a fundamental belief in God.  Reciting the Pledge, or listening to others recite it, is a patriotic exercise, not a religious one; participants promise fidelity to our flag and our Nation, not to any particular God, faith, or church.

				There is no doubt that respondent is sincere in his atheism and rejection of a belief in God.  But the mere fact that he disagrees with this part of the Pledge does not give him a veto power over the decision of the public schools that willing participants should pledge allegiance to the flag in the manner prescribed by Congress.  There may be others who disagree, not with the phrase under God, but with the phrase with liberty and justice for all.  But surely that would not give such objectors the right to veto the holding of such a ceremony by those willing to participate.  Only if it can be said that the phrase under God somehow tends to the establishment of a religion in violation of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> can respondents claim succeed, where one based on objections to with liberty and justice for all fails.  Our cases have broadly interpreted this phrase, but none have gone anywhere near as far as the decision of the Court of Appeals in this case.  The recital, in a patriotic ceremony pledging allegiance to the flag and to the Nation, of the descriptive phrase under God cannot possibly lead to the establishment of a religion, or anything like it.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				When courts extend constitutional prohibitions beyond their previously recognized limit, they may restrict democratic choices made by public bodies.  Here, Congress prescribed a Pledge of Allegiance, the State of California required patriotic observances in its schools, and the School District chose to comply by requiring teacher-led recital of the Pledge of Allegiance by willing students.  Thus, we have three levels of popular governmentthe national, the state, and the localcollaborating to produce the Elk Grove ceremony.  The Constitution only requires that schoolchildren be entitled to abstain from the ceremony if they chose to do so.  To give the parent of such a child a sort of hecklers veto over a patriotic ceremony willingly participated in by other students, simply because the Pledge of Allegiance contains the descriptive phrase under God, is an unwarranted extension of the Establishment Clause, an extension which would have the unfortunate effect of prohibiting a commendable patriotic observance.

						 Also as properly described, it is clear that this is not the same as a next-friend suit.

 To the extent that by not naming her you have … an individual right as a parent to say that, not only for all the children of the world but inmine in particular, I believe that this childmy child is being harmed, but the child is … not actually part of the suit, I dont know that theres any way that this court could preclude that.   App. to Brief for Respondent Newdow B4.

Barnette involved a board of education policy that compelled students to recite the Pledge.  319 U. S., at 629.  There was no opportunity to opt out, as there is in the present case.   Failure to conform [was] insubordination dealt with by expulsion.  Readmission [was] denied by statute until compliance.  Meanwhile the expelled child [was] unlawfully absent and [could] be proceeded against as a delinquent.  His parents or guardians [were] liable to prosecution, and if convicted [were] subject to a fine not exceeding $50 and jail term not exceeding thirty days.  Ibid. (footnotes omitted).  I think there is a clear difference between compulsion (Barnette) and coercion (Lee).  Compulsion, after Barnette, is not permissible, and it is not an issue in this case.  And whatever the virtues and vices of Lee, the Court was concerned only with formal religious exercise[s], 505 U. S., at 589, which the Pledge is not.

				The Court today erects a novel prudential standing principle in order to avoid reaching the merits of the constitutional claim.  I dissent from that ruling.  On the merits, I conclude that the Elk Grove Unified School District (School District) policy that requires teachers to lead willing students in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance, which includes the words under God, does not violate the Establishment Clause of the

				 at 78.  To be clear, the Court does not dispute that respondent Newdow (hereinafter respondent) satisfies the requisites of Article III standing.  But curiously the Court incorporates criticism of the Court of Appeals Article III standing decision into its justification for its novel prudential standing principle.  The Court concludes that respondent lacks prudential standing, under its new standing principle, to bring his suit in federal court.

 (Standing doctrine embraces several judicially self-imposed limits on the exercise of federal jurisdiction, such as the general prohibition on a litigants raising another persons legal rights …).  In contrast, here is the Courts new prudential standing principle: [I]t is improper for the federal courts to entertain a claim by a plaintiff whose standing to sue is founded on family law rights that are in dispute when prosecution of the lawsuit may have an adverse effect on the person who is the source of the plaintiffs claimed standing.

				First, the Court relies heavily on 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Richards,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/504/689" class="subref" title="subref">504 U. S. 689</a> (1992)
, in which we discussed both the domestic relations exception and the abstention doctrine.  In 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				, the mother of two children sued her former spouse and his female companion on behalf of the children, alleging physical and sexual abuse of the children.  The lower courts declined jurisdiction based on the domestic relations exception to diversity jurisdiction and abstention under 
				<em>
					Younger
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Harris,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/401/37" class="subref" title="subref">401 U. S. 37</a> (1971)
.  We reversed, concluding that the domestic relations exception only applies when a party seeks to have a district court issue a divorce, alimony, and child custody decree, 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				, 504 U. S., at 704.  We further held that abstention was inappropriate because the status of the domestic relationship ha[d] been determined as a matter of state law, and in any event ha[d] no bearing on the underlying torts alleged, 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 706.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court first cites the domestic relations exception to support its new principle.  Then the Court relies on a quote from 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				s discussion of the abstention doctrine: We have also acknowledged that it might be appropriate for the federal courts to decline to hear a case involving elements of the domestic relationship, 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 705, even when divorce, alimony, or child custody is not strictly at issue.  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 910.  The Court perfunctorily states: [T]hus, while rare instances arise in which it is necessary to answer a substantial federal question that transcends or exists apart from the family law issue, see, 
				<em>
					e.g., Palmore
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Sidoti,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/466/429" class="subref" title="subref">466 U. S. 429</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">432</a>434 (1984)
, in general it is appropriate for the federal courts to leave delicate issues of domestic relations to the state courts.  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 9.  That conclusion does not follow from 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				s
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				discussion of the domestic relations exception and abstention; even if it did, it would not be applicable in this case because, on the merits, this case presents a substantial federal question that transcends the family law issue to a greater extent than 
				<em>
					Palmore
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The domestic relations exception is not a prudential limitation on our federal jurisdiction.  It is a limiting construction of the statute defining federal diversity jurisdiction, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1332.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1332</a>, which divests the federal courts of power to issue divorce, alimony, and child custody decrees, 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt,
				</em>
				 504
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				U. S., at 703.  This case does not involve diversity jurisdiction, and respondent does not ask this Court to issue a divorce, alimony, or child custody decree.  Instead it involves a substantial federal question about the constitutionality of the School Districts conducting the pledge ceremony, which is the source of our jurisdiction.  Therefore, the domestic relations exception to diversity jurisdiction forms no basis for denying standing to respondent.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				When we discussed abstention in 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				, we first noted that [a]bstention rarely should be invoked, because the federal courts have a virtually unflagging obligation … to exercise the jurisdiction given them.   
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 705 (quoting 
				<em>
					Colorado River Water Conservation Dist.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					United States,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">817</a> (1976)
).  
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				s discussion of abstention by no means supports the proposition that only in the rare instances where a substantial federal question … transcends or exists apart from the family law issue, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				9, should federal courts decide the federal issue.  As in 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				, the status of the domestic relationship has been determined as a matter of state law, and in any event has no bearing on the underlying [constitutional violation] alleged.  504 U. S., at 706.  Sandra Banning and respondent now share joint custody of their daughter, respondent retains the right to expose his daughter to his religious views, and the state of their domestic affairs has nothing to do with the underlying constitutional claim.  Abstention forms no basis for denying respondent standing.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court cites
				<em>
					 Palmore
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Sidoti,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/466/429" class="subref" title="subref">466 U. S. 429</a> (1984)
, as an example of the exceptional case where a substantial federal question that transcends or exists apart from the family law issue makes the exercise of our jurisdiction appropriate.  
				<em>
					Ante, 
				</em>
				at 9.  In 
				<em>
					Palmore
				</em>
				, we granted certiorari to review a child custody decision, and reversed the state courts decision because we found that the effects of racial prejudice resulting from the mothers interracial marriage could not justify granting custody to the father.  Contrary to the Courts assertion, the alleged constitutional violation, while clearly involving a substantial federal question, did not transcen[d] or exis[t] apart from the family law issue, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 9; it had everything to do with the domestic relationship[w]e granted certiorari to review a 
				<em>
					judgment of a state court divesting a natural mother of the custody of her infant child
				</em>
				, 466 U. S., at 430 (emphasis added).  Under the Courts discussion today, it appears that we should have stayed out of the domestic dispute in 
				<em>
					Palmore 
				</em>
				no matter how constitutionally offensive the result would have been.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Finally, it seems the Court bases its new prudential standing principle, in part, on criticisms of the Court of Appeals construction of state law, coupled with the prudential principle prohibiting third-party standing.  In the Court of Appeals original opinion, it held unanimously that respondent satisfied the Article III standing requirements, stating respondent has standing as a parent to challenge a practice that interferes with his right to direct the education of his daughter.  
				<em>
					Newdow 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					United States Congress
				</em>
				, 292 F. 3d 597, 602 (CA9 2002).  After Banning moved for leave to intervene, the Court of Appeals reexamined respondents standing to determine whether the parents court-ordered custodial arrangement altered respondents standing.  
				<em>
					Newdow 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					United States Congress
				</em>
				, 313 F. 3d 500 (CA9 2002).  The court examined whether respondent could assert an injury in fact by asking whether, under California law, noncustodial parents maintain the right to expose and educate their children to their individual religious views, even if those religious views contradict those of the custodial parent.

            <em>

				The Court, contrary to the Court of Appeals interpretation of California case law, concludes that respondent requests relief that is more ambitious than that sought in 
				<em>

				and 
				<em>
					Murga
				</em>
				 because he seeks to restrain the act of a third party outside the parent-child sphere.

				<em>
					de novo
				</em>
				 construction of California law.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The correct characterization of respondents interest rests on the interpretation of state law.  As the Court recognizes,

				at 11, we have a settled and firm policy of deferring to regional courts of appeals in matters that involve the construction of state law.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				The Court does not take issue with the fact that, under California law, respondent retains a right to influence his daughters religious upbringing and to expose her to his views.  But it relies on Bannings view of the merits of this case to diminish respondents interest, stating that the respondent wishes to forestall his daughters exposure to religious ideas that her mother, who wields a form of veto power, endorses, and to use his parental status to challenge the influences to which his daughter may be exposed in school when he and Banning disagree.  Ante,
				 at
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				13.  As alleged by respondent and as recognized by the Court of Appeals, respondent wishes to enjoin the School District from endorsing a form of religion inconsistent with his own views because he has a right to expose his daughter to those views without the States placing its 
				<em>
					imprimatur
				</em>
				 on a particular religion.  Under the Court of Appeals construction of California law, Bannings veto power does not override respondents right to challenge the pledge ceremony.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court concludes that the California cases do not stand for the proposition that [respondent] has a right to dictate to others what they may or may not say to his child respecting religion.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  Surely, under California case law and the current custody order, respondent may not tell Banning what she may say to their child respecting religion, and respondent does not seek to.  Just as surely, respondent cannot name his daughter as a party to a lawsuit against Bannings wishes.  But his claim is different: Respondent does not seek to tell just anyone what he or she may say to his daughter, and he does not seek to vindicate solely her rights.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Respondent asserts that the School Districts pledge ceremony infringes his right under California law to expose his daughter to his religious views.  While she is intimately associated with the source of respondents standing (the father-daughter relationship and respondents rights thereunder), the daughter 
				<em>
					is not the source 
				</em>
				of respondents standing; instead it is their relationship that provides respondent his standing, which is clear once respondents interest is properly described.

As part of an overall effort to codify and emphasize existing rules and customs pertaining to the display and use of the flag of the United States of America, see H. R. Rep. No. 2047, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., 1 (1942); S. Rep. No. 1477, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., 1 (1942), Congress enacted the Pledge on June 22, 1942.  Pub. L. 623, ch. 435, §7,

<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">68</a>Stat.
249.  The amendments sponsor, Representative Rabaut, said its purpose was to contrast this countrys belief in God with the Soviet Unions embrace of atheism.  100 Cong. Rec. 1700 (1954).  We do not know what other Members of Congress thought about the purpose of the amendment.  Following the decision of the Court of Appeals in this case, Congress passed legislation that made extensive findings about the historic role of religion in the political development of the Nation and reaffirmed the text of the Pledge.  Act of Nov. 13, 2002, Pub. L. 107293, §§12, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">116</a>Stat.
20572060.  To the millions of people who regularly recite the Pledge, and who have no access to, or concern with, such legislation or legislative history, under God might mean several different things: that God has guided the destiny of the United States, for example, or that the United States exists under Gods authority.  How much consideration anyone gives to the phrase probably varies, since the Pledge itself is a patriotic observance focused primarily on the flag and the Nation, and only secondarily on the description of the Nation.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The phrase under God in the Pledge seems, as a historical matter, to sum up the attitude of the Nations leaders, and to manifest itself in many of our public observances.  Examples of patriotic invocations of God and official acknowledgments of religions role in our Nations history abound.

				The motto In God We Trust first appeared on the countrys coins during the Civil War.  Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase, acting under the authority of an Act of Congress passed in 1864, prescribed that the motto should appear on the two cent coin.  The motto was placed on more and more denominations, and since 1938 all United States coins bear the motto.  Paper currency followed suit at a slower pace; Federal Reserve notes were so inscribed during the decade of the 1960s.  Meanwhile, in 1956, Congress declared that the motto of the United States would be In God We Trust.  Act of July 30, 1956, ch. 795,

				All of these events strongly suggest that our national culture allows public recognition of our Nations religious history and character.

				As pointed out by the Court, California law requires public elementary schools to conduc[t] … appropriate patriotic exercises at the beginning of the schoolday, and notes that the giving of the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America shall satisfy the requirements of this section.  Cal. Educ. Code Ann. §52720 (West 1989).  The School District complies with this requirement by instructing that [e]ach elementary school class recite the [P]ledge of [A]llegiance to the [F]lag once each day.  App. 149150.  Students who object on religious (or other) grounds may abstain from the recitation.

.  That case arose out of a graduation ceremony for a public high school in Providence, Rhode Island.  The ceremony was begun with an invocation, and ended with a benediction, given by a local rabbi.  The Court held that even though attendance at the ceremony was voluntary, students who objected to the prayers would nonetheless feel coerced to attend and to stand during each prayer.  But the Court throughout its opinion referred to the prayer as an explicit religious exercise,

				I do not believe that the phrase under God in the Pledge converts its recital into a religious exercise of the sort described in 
				<em>
					Lee
				</em>
				.  Instead, it is a declaration of belief in allegiance and loyalty to the United States flag and the Republic that it represents.  The phrase under God is in no sense a prayer, nor an endorsement of any religion, but a simple recognition of the fact noted in H. R. Rep. No. 1693, at 2: From the time of our earliest history our peoples and our institutions have reflected the traditional concept that our Nation was founded on a fundamental belief in God.  Reciting the Pledge, or listening to others recite it, is a patriotic exercise, not a religious one; participants promise fidelity to our flag and our Nation, not to any particular God, faith, or church.

				There is no doubt that respondent is sincere in his atheism and rejection of a belief in God.  But the mere fact that he disagrees with this part of the Pledge does not give him a veto power over the decision of the public schools that willing participants should pledge allegiance to the flag in the manner prescribed by Congress.  There may be others who disagree, not with the phrase under God, but with the phrase with liberty and justice for all.  But surely that would not give such objectors the right to veto the holding of such a ceremony by those willing to participate.  Only if it can be said that the phrase under God somehow tends to the establishment of a religion in violation of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> can respondents claim succeed, where one based on objections to with liberty and justice for all fails.  Our cases have broadly interpreted this phrase, but none have gone anywhere near as far as the decision of the Court of Appeals in this case.  The recital, in a patriotic ceremony pledging allegiance to the flag and to the Nation, of the descriptive phrase under God cannot possibly lead to the establishment of a religion, or anything like it.

				When courts extend constitutional prohibitions beyond their previously recognized limit, they may restrict democratic choices made by public bodies.  Here, Congress prescribed a Pledge of Allegiance, the State of California required patriotic observances in its schools, and the School District chose to comply by requiring teacher-led recital of the Pledge of Allegiance by willing students.  Thus, we have three levels of popular governmentthe national, the state, and the localcollaborating to produce the Elk Grove ceremony.  The Constitution only requires that schoolchildren be entitled to abstain from the ceremony if they chose to do so.  To give the parent of such a child a sort of hecklers veto over a patriotic ceremony willingly participated in by other students, simply because the Pledge of Allegiance contains the descriptive phrase under God, is an unwarranted extension of the Establishment Clause, an extension which would have the unfortunate effect of prohibiting a commendable patriotic observance.

						 Also as properly described, it is clear that this is not the same as a next-friend suit.  The Court relies on the fact that respondent [was] deprived under California law of the right to sue as next friend.  Ante, at 14.  The same Superior Court that determined that respondent could not sue as next friend stated:


 To the extent that by not naming her you have … an individual right as a parent to say that, not only for all the children of the world but inmine in particular, I believe that this childmy child is being harmed, but the child is … not actually part of the suit, I dont know that theres any way that this court could preclude that.   App. to Brief for Respondent Newdow B4.

, coercion is present in the School District policy.  Post, at 35 (opinion concurring in judgment).  I cannot agree.  Barnette involved a board of education policy that compelled students to recite the Pledge.  319 U. S., at 629.  There was no opportunity to opt out, as there is in the present case.   Failure to conform [was] insubordination dealt with by expulsion.  Readmission [was] denied by statute until compliance.  Meanwhile the expelled child [was] unlawfully absent and [could] be proceeded against as a delinquent.  His parents or guardians [were] liable to prosecution, and if convicted [were] subject to a fine not exceeding $50 and jail term not exceeding thirty days.  Ibid. (footnotes omitted).  I think there is a clear difference between compulsion (Barnette) and coercion (Lee).  Compulsion, after Barnette, is not permissible, and it is not an issue in this case.  And whatever the virtues and vices of Lee, the Court was concerned only with formal religious exercise[s], 505 U. S., at 589, which the Pledge is not.

				The Court today erects a novel prudential standing principle in order to avoid reaching the merits of the constitutional claim.  I dissent from that ruling.  On the merits, I conclude that the Elk Grove Unified School District (School District) policy that requires teachers to lead willing students in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance, which includes the words under God, does not violate the Establishment Clause of the

				<em>

				 at 78.  To be clear, the Court does not dispute that respondent Newdow (hereinafter respondent) satisfies the requisites of Article III standing.  But curiously the Court incorporates criticism of the Court of Appeals Article III standing decision into its justification for its novel prudential standing principle.  The Court concludes that respondent lacks prudential standing, under its new standing principle, to bring his suit in federal court.

 (Standing doctrine embraces several judicially self-imposed limits on the exercise of federal jurisdiction, such as the general prohibition on a litigants raising another persons legal rights …).  In contrast, here is the Courts new prudential standing principle: [I]t is improper for the federal courts to entertain a claim by a plaintiff whose standing to sue is founded on family law rights that are in dispute when prosecution of the lawsuit may have an adverse effect on the person who is the source of the plaintiffs claimed standing.

				First, the Court relies heavily on 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt

				 v. 
				<em>
					Richards,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/504/689" class="subref" title="subref">504 U. S. 689</a> (1992)
, in which we discussed both the domestic relations exception and the abstention doctrine.  In 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				, the mother of two children sued her former spouse and his female companion on behalf of the children, alleging physical and sexual abuse of the children.  The lower courts declined jurisdiction based on the domestic relations exception to diversity jurisdiction and abstention under 
				<em>
					Younger
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Harris,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/401/37" class="subref" title="subref">401 U. S. 37</a> (1971)
.  We reversed, concluding that the domestic relations exception only applies when a party seeks to have a district court issue a divorce, alimony, and child custody decree, 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				, 504 U. S., at 704.  We further held that abstention was inappropriate because the status of the domestic relationship ha[d] been determined as a matter of state law, and in any event ha[d] no bearing on the underlying torts alleged, 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 706.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court first cites the domestic relations exception to support its new principle.  Then the Court relies on a quote from 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				s discussion of the abstention doctrine: We have also acknowledged that it might be appropriate for the federal courts to decline to hear a case involving elements of the domestic relationship, 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 705, even when divorce, alimony, or child custody is not strictly at issue.  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 910.  The Court perfunctorily states: [T]hus, while rare instances arise in which it is necessary to answer a substantial federal question that transcends or exists apart from the family law issue, see, 
				<em>
					e.g., Palmore
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Sidoti,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/466/429" class="subref" title="subref">466 U. S. 429</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">432</a>434 (1984)
, in general it is appropriate for the federal courts to leave delicate issues of domestic relations to the state courts.  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 9.  That conclusion does not follow from 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				s
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				discussion of the domestic relations exception and abstention; even if it did, it would not be applicable in this case because, on the merits, this case presents a substantial federal question that transcends the family law issue to a greater extent than 
				<em>
					Palmore
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The domestic relations exception is not a prudential limitation on our federal jurisdiction.  It is a limiting construction of the statute defining federal diversity jurisdiction, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1332.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1332</a>, which divests the federal courts of power to issue divorce, alimony, and child custody decrees, 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt,
				</em>
				 504
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				U. S., at 703.  This case does not involve diversity jurisdiction, and respondent does not ask this Court to issue a divorce, alimony, or child custody decree.  Instead it involves a substantial federal question about the constitutionality of the School Districts conducting the pledge ceremony, which is the source of our jurisdiction.  Therefore, the domestic relations exception to diversity jurisdiction forms no basis for denying standing to respondent.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				When we discussed abstention in 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				, we first noted that [a]bstention rarely should be invoked, because the federal courts have a virtually unflagging obligation … to exercise the jurisdiction given them.   
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 705 (quoting

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">817</a> (1976)
).  
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				s discussion of abstention by no means supports the proposition that only in the rare instances where a substantial federal question … transcends or exists apart from the family law issue, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				9, should federal courts decide the federal issue.  As in 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				, the status of the domestic relationship has been determined as a matter of state law, and in any event has no bearing on the underlying [constitutional violation] alleged.  504 U. S., at 706.  Sandra Banning and respondent now share joint custody of their daughter, respondent retains the right to expose his daughter to his religious views, and the state of their domestic affairs has nothing to do with the underlying constitutional claim.  Abstention forms no basis for denying respondent standing.

				<em>

				at 9.  In 
				<em>

				Finally, it seems the Court bases its new prudential standing principle, in part, on criticisms of the Court of Appeals construction of state law, coupled with the prudential principle prohibiting third-party standing.  In the Court of Appeals original opinion, it held unanimously that respondent satisfied the Article III standing requirements, stating respondent has standing as a parent to challenge a practice that interferes with his right to direct the education of his daughter.  
				<em>

				<em>
					Newdow 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					United States Congress

				, 313 F. 3d 500 (CA9 2002).  The court examined whether respondent could assert an injury in fact by asking whether, under California law, noncustodial parents maintain the right to expose and educate their children to their individual religious views, even if those religious views contradict those of the custodial parent.

				The Court does not take issue with the fact that, under California law, respondent retains a right to influence his daughters religious upbringing and to expose her to his views.  But it relies on Bannings view of the merits of this case to diminish respondents interest, stating that the respondent wishes to forestall his daughters exposure to religious ideas that her mother, who wields a form of veto power, endorses, and to use his parental status to challenge the influences to which his daughter may be exposed in school when he and Banning disagree.  Ante,

				13.  As alleged by respondent and as recognized by the Court of Appeals, respondent wishes to enjoin the School District from endorsing a form of religion inconsistent with his own views because he has a right to expose his daughter to those views without the States placing its 
				<em>
					imprimatur
				</em>
				 on a particular religion.  Under the Court of Appeals construction of California law, Bannings veto power does not override respondents right to challenge the pledge ceremony.

				The Court concludes that the California cases do not stand for the proposition that [respondent] has a right to dictate to others what they may or may not say to his child respecting religion.

				.  Surely, under California case law and the current custody order, respondent may not tell Banning what she may say to their child respecting religion, and respondent does not seek to.  Just as surely, respondent cannot name his daughter as a party to a lawsuit against Bannings wishes.  But his claim is different: Respondent does not seek to tell just anyone what he or she may say to his daughter, and he does not seek to vindicate solely her rights.

				Respondent asserts that the School Districts pledge ceremony infringes his right under California law to expose his daughter to his religious views.  While she is intimately associated with the source of respondents standing (the father-daughter relationship and respondents rights thereunder), the daughter 
				<em>

As part of an overall effort to codify and emphasize existing rules and customs pertaining to the display and use of the flag of the United States of America, see H. R. Rep. No. 2047, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., 1 (1942); S. Rep. No. 1477, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., 1 (1942), Congress enacted the Pledge on June 22, 1942.  Pub. L. 623, ch. 435, §7,

We do not know what other Members of Congress thought about the purpose of the amendment.  Following the decision of the Court of Appeals in this case, Congress passed legislation that made extensive findings about the historic role of religion in the political development of the Nation and reaffirmed the text of the Pledge.

20572060.  To the millions of people who regularly recite the Pledge, and who have no access to, or concern with, such legislation or legislative history, under God might mean several different things: that God has guided the destiny of the United States, for example, or that the United States exists under Gods authority.  How much consideration anyone gives to the phrase probably varies, since the Pledge itself is a patriotic observance focused primarily on the flag and the Nation, and only secondarily on the description of the Nation.

The ceremony was begun with an invocation, and ended with a benediction, given by a local rabbi.

				I do not believe that the phrase under God in the Pledge converts its recital into a religious exercise of the sort described in

				.  Instead, it is a declaration of belief in allegiance and loyalty to the United States flag and the Republic that it represents.  The phrase under God is in no sense a prayer, nor an endorsement of any religion, but a simple recognition of the fact noted in H. R. Rep. No. 1693, at 2: From the time of our earliest history our peoples and our institutions have reflected the traditional concept that our Nation was founded on a fundamental belief in God.  Reciting the Pledge, or listening to others recite it, is a patriotic exercise, not a religious one; participants promise fidelity to our flag and our Nation, not to any particular God, faith, or church.

				There is no doubt that respondent is sincere in his atheism and rejection of a belief in God.  But the mere fact that he disagrees with this part of the Pledge does not give him a veto power over the decision of the public schools that willing participants should pledge allegiance to the flag in the manner prescribed by Congress.  There may be others who disagree, not with the phrase under God, but with the phrase with liberty and justice for all.  But surely that would not give such objectors the right to veto the holding of such a ceremony by those willing to participate.  Only if it can be said that the phrase under God somehow tends to the establishment of a religion in violation of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> can respondents claim succeed, where one based on objections to with liberty and justice for all fails.  Our cases have broadly interpreted this phrase, but none have gone anywhere near as far as the decision of the Court of Appeals in this case.  The recital, in a patriotic ceremony pledging allegiance to the flag and to the Nation, of the descriptive phrase under God cannot possibly lead to the establishment of a religion, or anything like it.

				When courts extend constitutional prohibitions beyond their previously recognized limit, they may restrict democratic choices made by public bodies.  Here, Congress prescribed a Pledge of Allegiance, the State of California required patriotic observances in its schools, and the School District chose to comply by requiring teacher-led recital of the Pledge of Allegiance by willing students.  Thus, we have three levels of popular governmentthe national, the state, and the localcollaborating to produce the Elk Grove ceremony.  The Constitution only requires that schoolchildren be entitled to abstain from the ceremony if they chose to do so.  To give the parent of such a child a sort of hecklers veto over a patriotic ceremony willingly participated in by other students, simply because the Pledge of Allegiance contains the descriptive phrase under God, is an unwarranted extension of the Establishment Clause, an extension which would have the unfortunate effect of prohibiting a commendable patriotic observance.

						 Also as properly described, it is clear that this is not the same as a next-friend suit.  The Court relies on the fact that respondent [was] deprived under California law of the right to sue as next friend.  Ante, at 14.  The same Superior Court that determined that respondent could not sue as next friend stated:


 To the extent that by not naming her you have … an individual right as a parent to say that, not only for all the children of the world but inmine in particular, I believe that this childmy child is being harmed, but the child is … not actually part of the suit, I dont know that theres any way that this court could preclude that.   App. to Brief for Respondent Newdow B4.

, coercion is present in the School District policy.  Post, at 35 (opinion concurring in judgment).  I cannot agree.  Barnette involved a board of education policy that compelled students to recite the Pledge.  319 U. S., at 629.  There was no opportunity to opt out, as there is in the present case.   Failure to conform [was] insubordination dealt with by expulsion.  Readmission [was] denied by statute until compliance.  Meanwhile the expelled child [was] unlawfully absent and [could] be proceeded against as a delinquent.  His parents or guardians [were] liable to prosecution, and if convicted [were] subject to a fine not exceeding $50 and jail term not exceeding thirty days.  Ibid. (footnotes omitted).  I think there is a clear difference between compulsion (Barnette) and coercion (Lee).  Compulsion, after Barnette, is not permissible, and it is not an issue in this case.  And whatever the virtues and vices of Lee, the Court was concerned only with formal religious exercise[s], 505 U. S., at 589, which the Pledge is not.

				The Court today erects a novel prudential standing principle in order to avoid reaching the merits of the constitutional claim.  I dissent from that ruling.  On the merits, I conclude that the Elk Grove Unified School District (School District) policy that requires teachers to lead willing students in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance, which includes the words under God, does not violate the Establishment Clause of the

				 at 78.  To be clear, the Court does not dispute that respondent Newdow (hereinafter respondent) satisfies the requisites of Article III standing.  But curiously the Court incorporates criticism of the Court of Appeals Article III standing decision into its justification for its novel prudential standing principle.  The Court concludes that respondent lacks prudential standing, under its new standing principle, to bring his suit in federal court.

 (Standing doctrine embraces several judicially self-imposed limits on the exercise of federal jurisdiction, such as the general prohibition on a litigants raising another persons legal rights …).  In contrast, here is the Courts new prudential standing principle: [I]t is improper for the federal courts to entertain a claim by a plaintiff whose standing to sue is founded on family law rights that are in dispute when prosecution of the lawsuit may have an adverse effect on the person who is the source of the plaintiffs claimed standing.

				First, the Court relies heavily on 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Richards,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/504/689" class="subref" title="subref">504 U. S. 689</a> (1992)
, in which we discussed both the domestic relations exception and the abstention doctrine.  In 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				, the mother of two children sued her former spouse and his female companion on behalf of the children, alleging physical and sexual abuse of the children.  The lower courts declined jurisdiction based on the domestic relations exception to diversity jurisdiction and abstention under 
				<em>
					Younger
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Harris,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/401/37" class="subref" title="subref">401 U. S. 37</a> (1971)
.  We reversed, concluding that the domestic relations exception only applies when a party seeks to have a district court issue a divorce, alimony, and child custody decree, 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				, 504 U. S., at 704.  We further held that abstention was inappropriate because the status of the domestic relationship ha[d] been determined as a matter of state law, and in any event ha[d] no bearing on the underlying torts alleged, 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 706.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court first cites the domestic relations exception to support its new principle.  Then the Court relies on a quote from 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				s discussion of the abstention doctrine: We have also acknowledged that it might be appropriate for the federal courts to decline to hear a case involving elements of the domestic relationship, 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 705, even when divorce, alimony, or child custody is not strictly at issue.  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 910.  The Court perfunctorily states: [T]hus, while rare instances arise in which it is necessary to answer a substantial federal question that transcends or exists apart from the family law issue, see, 
				<em>
					e.g., Palmore
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Sidoti,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/466/429" class="subref" title="subref">466 U. S. 429</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">432</a>434 (1984)
, in general it is appropriate for the federal courts to leave delicate issues of domestic relations to the state courts.  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 9.  That conclusion does not follow from 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				s
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				discussion of the domestic relations exception and abstention; even if it did, it would not be applicable in this case because, on the merits, this case presents a substantial federal question that transcends the family law issue to a greater extent than 
				<em>
					Palmore
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The domestic relations exception is not a prudential limitation on our federal jurisdiction.  It is a limiting construction of the statute defining federal diversity jurisdiction, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1332.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1332</a>, which divests the federal courts of power to issue divorce, alimony, and child custody decrees, 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt,
				</em>
				 504
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				U. S., at 703.  This case does not involve diversity jurisdiction, and respondent does not ask this Court to issue a divorce, alimony, or child custody decree.  Instead it involves a substantial federal question about the constitutionality of the School Districts conducting the pledge ceremony, which is the source of our jurisdiction.  Therefore, the domestic relations exception to diversity jurisdiction forms no basis for denying standing to respondent.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				When we discussed abstention in 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				, we first noted that [a]bstention rarely should be invoked, because the federal courts have a virtually unflagging obligation … to exercise the jurisdiction given them.   
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 705 (quoting 
				<em>
					Colorado River Water Conservation Dist.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					United States,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">817</a> (1976)
).  
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				s discussion of abstention by no means supports the proposition that only in the rare instances where a substantial federal question … transcends or exists apart from the family law issue, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				9, should federal courts decide the federal issue.  As in 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				, the status of the domestic relationship has been determined as a matter of state law, and in any event has no bearing on the underlying [constitutional violation] alleged.  504 U. S., at 706.  Sandra Banning and respondent now share joint custody of their daughter, respondent retains the right to expose his daughter to his religious views, and the state of their domestic affairs has nothing to do with the underlying constitutional claim.  Abstention forms no basis for denying respondent standing.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court cites
				<em>
					 Palmore
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Sidoti,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/466/429" class="subref" title="subref">466 U. S. 429</a> (1984)
, as an example of the exceptional case where a substantial federal question that transcends or exists apart from the family law issue makes the exercise of our jurisdiction appropriate.  
				<em>
					Ante, 
				</em>
				at 9.  In 
				<em>
					Palmore
				</em>
				, we granted certiorari to review a child custody decision, and reversed the state courts decision because we found that the effects of racial prejudice resulting from the mothers interracial marriage could not justify granting custody to the father.  Contrary to the Courts assertion, the alleged constitutional violation, while clearly involving a substantial federal question, did not transcen[d] or exis[t] apart from the family law issue, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 9; it had everything to do with the domestic relationship[w]e granted certiorari to review a 
				<em>
					judgment of a state court divesting a natural mother of the custody of her infant child
				</em>
				, 466 U. S., at 430 (emphasis added).  Under the Courts discussion today, it appears that we should have stayed out of the domestic dispute in 
				<em>
					Palmore 
				</em>
				no matter how constitutionally offensive the result would have been.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Finally, it seems the Court bases its new prudential standing principle, in part, on criticisms of the Court of Appeals construction of state law, coupled with the prudential principle prohibiting third-party standing.  In the Court of Appeals original opinion, it held unanimously that respondent satisfied the Article III standing requirements, stating respondent has standing as a parent to challenge a practice that interferes with his right to direct the education of his daughter.  
				<em>
					Newdow 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					United States Congress
				</em>
				, 292 F. 3d 597, 602 (CA9 2002).  After Banning moved for leave to intervene, the Court of Appeals reexamined respondents standing to determine whether the parents court-ordered custodial arrangement altered respondents standing.  
				<em>
					Newdow 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					United States Congress
				</em>
				, 313 F. 3d 500 (CA9 2002).  The court examined whether respondent could assert an injury in fact by asking whether, under California law, noncustodial parents maintain the right to expose and educate their children to their individual religious views, even if those religious views contradict those of the custodial parent.
				<a name="ZC-1ref" href="#ZC-1" class="">

            </a>
            <em>
					Id.

				, at 504.  The Court of Appeals again unanimously concluded that the respondent satisfied Article III standing, despite the custody order, because he retained sufficient parental rights under California law.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court, contrary to the Court of Appeals interpretation of California case law, concludes that respondent requests relief that is more ambitious than that sought in 
				<em>

				and 
				<em>
					Murga
				</em>
				 because he seeks to restrain the act of a third party outside the parent-child sphere.  
				<em>

				<em>
					de novo
				</em>
				 construction of California law.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The correct characterization of respondents interest rests on the interpretation of state law.  As the Court recognizes,

				at 11, we have a settled and firm policy of deferring to regional courts of appeals in matters that involve the construction of state law.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				The Court does not take issue with the fact that, under California law, respondent retains a right to influence his daughters religious upbringing and to expose her to his views.  But it relies on Bannings view of the merits of this case to diminish respondents interest, stating that the respondent wishes to forestall his daughters exposure to religious ideas that her mother, who wields a form of veto power, endorses, and to use his parental status to challenge the influences to which his daughter may be exposed in school when he and Banning disagree.  Ante,
				 at
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				13.  As alleged by respondent and as recognized by the Court of Appeals, respondent wishes to enjoin the School District from endorsing a form of religion inconsistent with his own views because he has a right to expose his daughter to those views without the States placing its 
				<em>
					imprimatur
				</em>
				 on a particular religion.  Under the Court of Appeals construction of California law, Bannings veto power does not override respondents right to challenge the pledge ceremony.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court concludes that the California cases do not stand for the proposition that [respondent] has a right to dictate to others what they may or may not say to his child respecting religion.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  Surely, under California case law and the current custody order, respondent may not tell Banning what she may say to their child respecting religion, and respondent does not seek to.  Just as surely, respondent cannot name his daughter as a party to a lawsuit against Bannings wishes.  But his claim is different: Respondent does not seek to tell just anyone what he or she may say to his daughter, and he does not seek to vindicate solely her rights.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Respondent asserts that the School Districts pledge ceremony infringes his right under California law to expose his daughter to his religious views.  While she is intimately associated with the source of respondents standing (the father-daughter relationship and respondents rights thereunder), the daughter 
				<em>
					is not the source 
				</em>
				of respondents standing; instead it is their relationship that provides respondent his standing, which is clear once respondents interest is properly described.

As part of an overall effort to codify and emphasize existing rules and customs pertaining to the display and use of the flag of the United States of America, see H. R. Rep. No. 2047, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., 1 (1942); S. Rep. No. 1477, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., 1 (1942), Congress enacted the Pledge on June 22, 1942.  Pub. L. 623, ch. 435, §7,

<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">68</a>Stat.
249.  The amendments sponsor, Representative Rabaut, said its purpose was to contrast this countrys belief in God with the Soviet Unions embrace of atheism.  100 Cong. Rec. 1700 (1954).  We do not know what other Members of Congress thought about the purpose of the amendment.  Following the decision of the Court of Appeals in this case, Congress passed legislation that made extensive findings about the historic role of religion in the political development of the Nation and reaffirmed the text of the Pledge.  Act of Nov. 13, 2002, Pub. L. 107293, §§12, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">116</a>Stat.
20572060.  To the millions of people who regularly recite the Pledge, and who have no access to, or concern with, such legislation or legislative history, under God might mean several different things: that God has guided the destiny of the United States, for example, or that the United States exists under Gods authority.  How much consideration anyone gives to the phrase probably varies, since the Pledge itself is a patriotic observance focused primarily on the flag and the Nation, and only secondarily on the description of the Nation.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The phrase under God in the Pledge seems, as a historical matter, to sum up the attitude of the Nations leaders, and to manifest itself in many of our public observances.  Examples of patriotic invocations of God and official acknowledgments of religions role in our Nations history abound.

				Whereas it is the duty of all Nations to acknowledge the problems of Almighty God, to obey His will, to be grateful for his benefits, and humbly to implore his protection and favorand whereas both Houses of Congress have by their joint Committee requested me to recommend to the People of the United States a day of public thanksgiving and prayer to be observed by acknowledging with grateful hearts the many signal favors of Almighty God especially by affording them an opportunity peaceably to establish a form of government for their safety and happiness.   4 Papers of George Washington 131: Presidential Series (W.

				Later Presidents, at critical times in the Nations history, have likewise invoked the name of God.  Abraham Lincoln, concluding his masterful Gettysburg Address in 1863, used the very phrase under God:

        <p class="bodytext">
				It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before usthat from these honored dead we take increased devotions to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotionthat we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vainthat this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedomand that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.  1 Documents of American History 429 (H. Commager ed. 8th ed. 1968).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
Lincolns equally well known second inaugural address, delivered on March 4, 1865, makes repeated references to God, concluding with these famous words:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nations wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.

				But the right is more precious than peace, and we shall fight for the things which we have always carried nearest our hearts,for democracy, for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own Governments, for the rights and liberties of small nations, for a universal dominion of right for such a concert of free peoples as shall bring peace and safety to all nations and make the world itself at last free.  To such a task we can dedicate our lives and our fortunes, everything that we are and everything that we have, with the pride of those who know that the day has come when America is privileged to spend her blood and her might for the principles that gave her birth and happiness and the peace which she has treasured.

				The motto In God We Trust first appeared on the countrys coins during the Civil War.  Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase, acting under the authority of an Act of Congress passed in 1864, prescribed that the motto should appear on the two cent coin.  The motto was placed on more and more denominations, and since 1938 all United States coins bear the motto.  Paper currency followed suit at a slower pace; Federal Reserve notes were so inscribed during the decade of the 1960s.  Meanwhile, in 1956, Congress declared that the motto of the United States would be In God We Trust.  Act of July 30, 1956, ch. 795,

				All of these events strongly suggest that our national culture allows public recognition of our Nations religious history and character.  In the words of the House Report that accompanied the insertion of the phrase under God in the Pledge: From the time of our earliest history our peoples and our institutions have reflected the traditional concept that our Nation was founded on a fundamental belief in God.  H. R. Rep. No. 1693, 83d Cong., 2d Sess., 2 (1954).  Giving additional support to this idea is our national anthem The Star-Spangled Banner, adopted as such by Congress in 1931.

				As pointed out by the Court, California law requires public elementary schools to conduc[t] … appropriate patriotic exercises at the beginning of the schoolday, and notes that the giving of the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America shall satisfy the requirements of this section.  Cal. Educ. Code Ann. §52720 (West 1989).  The School District complies with this requirement by instructing that [e]ach elementary school class recite the [P]ledge of [A]llegiance to the [F]lag once each day.  App. 149150.  Students who object on religious (or other) grounds may abstain from the recitation.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/505/577" class="subref" title="subref">505 U. S. 577</a> (1992)
.  That case arose out of a graduation ceremony for a public high school in Providence, Rhode Island.  The ceremony was begun with an invocation, and ended with a benediction, given by a local rabbi.  The Court held that even though attendance at the ceremony was voluntary, students who objected to the prayers would nonetheless feel coerced to attend and to stand during each prayer.  But the Court throughout its opinion referred to the prayer as an explicit religious exercise,

				I do not believe that the phrase under God in the Pledge converts its recital into a religious exercise of the sort described in 
				<em>
					Lee
				</em>
				.  Instead, it is a declaration of belief in allegiance and loyalty to the United States flag and the Republic that it represents.  The phrase under God is in no sense a prayer, nor an endorsement of any religion, but a simple recognition of the fact noted in H. R. Rep. No. 1693, at 2: From the time of our earliest history our peoples and our institutions have reflected the traditional concept that our Nation was founded on a fundamental belief in God.  Reciting the Pledge, or listening to others recite it, is a patriotic exercise, not a religious one; participants promise fidelity to our flag and our Nation, not to any particular God, faith, or church.

				There is no doubt that respondent is sincere in his atheism and rejection of a belief in God.  But the mere fact that he disagrees with this part of the Pledge does not give him a veto power over the decision of the public schools that willing participants should pledge allegiance to the flag in the manner prescribed by Congress.  There may be others who disagree, not with the phrase under God, but with the phrase with liberty and justice for all.  But surely that would not give such objectors the right to veto the holding of such a ceremony by those willing to participate.  Only if it can be said that the phrase under God somehow tends to the establishment of a religion in violation of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> can respondents claim succeed, where one based on objections to with liberty and justice for all fails.  Our cases have broadly interpreted this phrase, but none have gone anywhere near as far as the decision of the Court of Appeals in this case.  The recital, in a patriotic ceremony pledging allegiance to the flag and to the Nation, of the descriptive phrase under God cannot possibly lead to the establishment of a religion, or anything like it.

				When courts extend constitutional prohibitions beyond their previously recognized limit, they may restrict democratic choices made by public bodies.  Here, Congress prescribed a Pledge of Allegiance, the State of California required patriotic observances in its schools, and the School District chose to comply by requiring teacher-led recital of the Pledge of Allegiance by willing students.  Thus, we have three levels of popular governmentthe national, the state, and the localcollaborating to produce the Elk Grove ceremony.  The Constitution only requires that schoolchildren be entitled to abstain from the ceremony if they chose to do so.  To give the parent of such a child a sort of hecklers veto over a patriotic ceremony willingly participated in by other students, simply because the Pledge of Allegiance contains the descriptive phrase under God, is an unwarranted extension of the Establishment Clause, an extension which would have the unfortunate effect of prohibiting a commendable patriotic observance.

						 Also as properly described, it is clear that this is not the same as a next-friend suit.  The Court relies on the fact that respondent [was] deprived under California law of the right to sue as next friend.  Ante, at 14.  The same Superior Court that determined that respondent could not sue as next friend stated:


 To the extent that by not naming her you have … an individual right as a parent to say that, not only for all the children of the world but inmine in particular, I believe that this childmy child is being harmed, but the child is … not actually part of the suit, I dont know that theres any way that this court could preclude that.   App. to Brief for Respondent Newdow B4.


The California court did not reject Newdows right as distinct from his daughters, and we should not either.

, coercion is present in the School District policy.  Post, at 35 (opinion concurring in judgment).  I cannot agree.  Barnette involved a board of education policy that compelled students to recite the Pledge.  319 U. S., at 629.  There was no opportunity to opt out, as there is in the present case.   Failure to conform [was] insubordination dealt with by expulsion.  Readmission [was] denied by statute until compliance.  Meanwhile the expelled child [was] unlawfully absent and [could] be proceeded against as a delinquent.  His parents or guardians [were] liable to prosecution, and if convicted [were] subject to a fine not exceeding $50 and jail term not exceeding thirty days.  Ibid. (footnotes omitted).  I think there is a clear difference between compulsion (Barnette) and coercion (Lee).  Compulsion, after Barnette, is not permissible, and it is not an issue in this case.  And whatever the virtues and vices of Lee, the Court was concerned only with formal religious exercise[s], 505 U. S., at 589, which the Pledge is not.

				The Court today erects a novel prudential standing principle in order to avoid reaching the merits of the constitutional claim.  I dissent from that ruling.  On the merits, I conclude that the Elk Grove Unified School District (School District) policy that requires teachers to lead willing students in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance, which includes the words under God, does not violate the Establishment Clause of the

				 at 78.  To be clear, the Court does not dispute that respondent Newdow (hereinafter respondent) satisfies the requisites of Article III standing.  But curiously the Court incorporates criticism of the Court of Appeals Article III standing decision into its justification for its novel prudential standing principle.  The Court concludes that respondent lacks prudential standing, under its new standing principle, to bring his suit in federal court.

 (Standing doctrine embraces several judicially self-imposed limits on the exercise of federal jurisdiction, such as the general prohibition on a litigants raising another persons legal rights …).  In contrast, here is the Courts new prudential standing principle: [I]t is improper for the federal courts to entertain a claim by a plaintiff whose standing to sue is founded on family law rights that are in dispute when prosecution of the lawsuit may have an adverse effect on the person who is the source of the plaintiffs claimed standing.

				First, the Court relies heavily on

, in which we discussed both the domestic relations exception and the abstention doctrine.  In 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				, the mother of two children sued her former spouse and his female companion on behalf of the children, alleging physical and sexual abuse of the children.  The lower courts declined jurisdiction based on the domestic relations exception to diversity jurisdiction and abstention under

				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>

            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/401/37" class="subref" title="subref">401 U. S. 37</a> (1971)
.  We reversed, concluding that the domestic relations exception only applies when a party seeks to have a district court issue a divorce, alimony, and child custody decree, 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				, 504 U. S., at 704.  We further held that abstention was inappropriate because the status of the domestic relationship ha[d] been determined as a matter of state law, and in any event ha[d] no bearing on the underlying torts alleged, 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 706.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court first cites the domestic relations exception to support its new principle.  Then the Court relies on a quote from 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				s discussion of the abstention doctrine: We have also acknowledged that it might be appropriate for the federal courts to decline to hear a case involving elements of the domestic relationship, 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 705, even when divorce, alimony, or child custody is not strictly at issue.  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 910.  The Court perfunctorily states: [T]hus, while rare instances arise in which it is necessary to answer a substantial federal question that transcends or exists apart from the family law issue, see, 
				<em>
					e.g., Palmore
				</em>
				 v.

				<em>

				 at 9.  That conclusion does not follow from 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				s
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				discussion of the domestic relations exception and abstention; even if it did, it would not be applicable in this case because, on the merits, this case presents a substantial federal question that transcends the family law issue to a greater extent than

				U. S., at 703.  This case does not involve diversity jurisdiction, and respondent does not ask this Court to issue a divorce, alimony, or child custody decree.  Instead it involves a substantial federal question about the constitutionality of the School Districts conducting the pledge ceremony, which is the source of our jurisdiction.  Therefore, the domestic relations exception to diversity jurisdiction forms no basis for denying standing to respondent.

				Finally, it seems the Court bases its new prudential standing principle, in part, on criticisms of the Court of Appeals construction of state law, coupled with the prudential principle prohibiting third-party standing.  In the Court of Appeals original opinion, it held unanimously that respondent satisfied the Article III standing requirements, stating respondent has standing as a parent to challenge a practice that interferes with his right to direct the education of his daughter.  
				<em>
					Newdow 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>

				</em>
				, 292 F. 3d 597, 602 (CA9 2002).  After Banning moved for leave to intervene, the Court of Appeals reexamined respondents standing to determine whether the parents court-ordered custodial arrangement altered respondents standing.  
				<em>
					Newdow 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					United States Congress
				</em>
				, 313 F. 3d 500 (CA9 2002).  The court examined whether respondent could assert an injury in fact by asking whether, under California law, noncustodial parents maintain the right to expose and educate their children to their individual religious views, even if those religious views contradict those of the custodial parent.

				The Court does not take issue with the fact that, under California law, respondent retains a right to influence his daughters religious upbringing and to expose her to his views.  But it relies on Bannings view of the merits of this case to diminish respondents interest, stating that the respondent wishes to forestall his daughters exposure to religious ideas that her mother, who wields a form of veto power, endorses, and to use his parental status to challenge the influences to which his daughter may be exposed in school when he and Banning disagree.  Ante,

				13.  As alleged by respondent and as recognized by the Court of Appeals, respondent wishes to enjoin the School District from endorsing a form of religion inconsistent with his own views because he has a right to expose his daughter to those views without the States placing its 
				<em>
					imprimatur
				</em>
				 on a particular religion.  Under the Court of Appeals construction of California law, Bannings veto power does not override respondents right to challenge the pledge ceremony.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court concludes that the California cases do not stand for the proposition that [respondent] has a right to dictate to others what they may or may not say to his child respecting religion.  
				<em>
					Ibid

				.  Surely, under California case law and the current custody order, respondent may not tell Banning what she may say to their child respecting religion, and respondent does not seek to.  Just as surely, respondent cannot name his daughter as a party to a lawsuit against Bannings wishes.  But his claim is different: Respondent does not seek to tell just anyone what he or she may say to his daughter, and he does not seek to vindicate solely her rights.

				Respondent asserts that the School Districts pledge ceremony infringes his right under California law to expose his daughter to his religious views.  While she is intimately associated with the source of respondents standing (the father-daughter relationship and respondents rights thereunder), the daughter 
				<em>

We do not know what other Members of Congress thought about the purpose of the amendment.  Following the decision of the Court of Appeals in this case, Congress passed legislation that made extensive findings about the historic role of religion in the political development of the Nation and reaffirmed the text of the Pledge.

20572060.  To the millions of people who regularly recite the Pledge, and who have no access to, or concern with, such legislation or legislative history, under God might mean several different things: that God has guided the destiny of the United States, for example, or that the United States exists under Gods authority.  How much consideration anyone gives to the phrase probably varies, since the Pledge itself is a patriotic observance focused primarily on the flag and the Nation, and only secondarily on the description of the Nation.

The phrase under God is in no sense a prayer, nor an endorsement of any religion, but a simple recognition of the fact noted in H. R. Rep. No. 1693, at 2: From the time of our earliest history our peoples and our institutions have reflected the traditional concept that our Nation was founded on a fundamental belief in God.  Reciting the Pledge, or listening to others recite it, is a patriotic exercise, not a religious one; participants promise fidelity to our flag and our Nation, not to any particular God, faith, or church.

				There is no doubt that respondent is sincere in his atheism and rejection of a belief in God.  But the mere fact that he disagrees with this part of the Pledge does not give him a veto power over the decision of the public schools that willing participants should pledge allegiance to the flag in the manner prescribed by Congress.  There may be others who disagree, not with the phrase under God, but with the phrase with liberty and justice for all.  But surely that would not give such objectors the right to veto the holding of such a ceremony by those willing to participate.  Only if it can be said that the phrase under God somehow tends to the establishment of a religion in violation of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> can respondents claim succeed, where one based on objections to with liberty and justice for all fails.  Our cases have broadly interpreted this phrase, but none have gone anywhere near as far as the decision of the Court of Appeals in this case.  The recital, in a patriotic ceremony pledging allegiance to the flag and to the Nation, of the descriptive phrase under God cannot possibly lead to the establishment of a religion, or anything like it.

				When courts extend constitutional prohibitions beyond their previously recognized limit, they may restrict democratic choices made by public bodies.  Here, Congress prescribed a Pledge of Allegiance, the State of California required patriotic observances in its schools, and the School District chose to comply by requiring teacher-led recital of the Pledge of Allegiance by willing students.  Thus, we have three levels of popular governmentthe national, the state, and the localcollaborating to produce the Elk Grove ceremony.  The Constitution only requires that schoolchildren be entitled to abstain from the ceremony if they chose to do so.  To give the parent of such a child a sort of hecklers veto over a patriotic ceremony willingly participated in by other students, simply because the Pledge of Allegiance contains the descriptive phrase under God, is an unwarranted extension of the Establishment Clause, an extension which would have the unfortunate effect of prohibiting a commendable patriotic observance.

						 Also as properly described, it is clear that this is not the same as a next-friend suit.  The Court relies on the fact that respondent [was] deprived under California law of the right to sue as next friend.  Ante, at 14.  The same Superior Court that determined that respondent could not sue as next friend stated:


 To the extent that by not naming her you have … an individual right as a parent to say that, not only for all the children of the world but inmine in particular, I believe that this childmy child is being harmed, but the child is … not actually part of the suit, I dont know that theres any way that this court could preclude that.   App. to Brief for Respondent Newdow B4.


The California court did not reject Newdows right as distinct from his daughters, and we should not either.

Barnette involved a board of education policy that compelled students to recite the Pledge.  319 U. S., at 629.  There was no opportunity to opt out, as there is in the present case.   Failure to conform [was] insubordination dealt with by expulsion.  Readmission [was] denied by statute until compliance.  Meanwhile the expelled child [was] unlawfully absent and [could] be proceeded against as a delinquent.  His parents or guardians [were] liable to prosecution, and if convicted [were] subject to a fine not exceeding $50 and jail term not exceeding thirty days.  Ibid. (footnotes omitted).  I think there is a clear difference between compulsion (Barnette) and coercion (Lee).  Compulsion, after Barnette, is not permissible, and it is not an issue in this case.  And whatever the virtues and vices of Lee, the Court was concerned only with formal religious exercise[s], 505 U. S., at 589, which the Pledge is not.

				The Court today erects a novel prudential standing principle in order to avoid reaching the merits of the constitutional claim.  I dissent from that ruling.  On the merits, I conclude that the Elk Grove Unified School District (School District) policy that requires teachers to lead willing students in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance, which includes the words under God, does not violate the Establishment Clause of the

				 at 78.  To be clear, the Court does not dispute that respondent Newdow (hereinafter respondent) satisfies the requisites of Article III standing.  But curiously the Court incorporates criticism of the Court of Appeals Article III standing decision into its justification for its novel prudential standing principle.  The Court concludes that respondent lacks prudential standing, under its new standing principle, to bring his suit in federal court.

 (Standing doctrine embraces several judicially self-imposed limits on the exercise of federal jurisdiction, such as the general prohibition on a litigants raising another persons legal rights …).  In contrast, here is the Courts new prudential standing principle: [I]t is improper for the federal courts to entertain a claim by a plaintiff whose standing to sue is founded on family law rights that are in dispute when prosecution of the lawsuit may have an adverse effect on the person who is the source of the plaintiffs claimed standing.

				13.  The Court loosely bases this novel prudential standing limitation on the domestic relations exception to diversity-of-citizenship jurisdiction pursuant to

				First, the Court relies heavily on 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Richards,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/504/689" class="subref" title="subref">504 U. S. 689</a> (1992)
, in which we discussed both the domestic relations exception and the abstention doctrine.  In 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				, the mother of two children sued her former spouse and his female companion on behalf of the children, alleging physical and sexual abuse of the children.  The lower courts declined jurisdiction based on the domestic relations exception to diversity jurisdiction and abstention under 
				<em>
					Younger
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Harris,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/401/37" class="subref" title="subref">401 U. S. 37</a> (1971)
.  We reversed, concluding that the domestic relations exception only applies when a party seeks to have a district court issue a divorce, alimony, and child custody decree, 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				, 504 U. S., at 704.  We further held that abstention was inappropriate because the status of the domestic relationship ha[d] been determined as a matter of state law, and in any event ha[d] no bearing on the underlying torts alleged, 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 706.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court first cites the domestic relations exception to support its new principle.  Then the Court relies on a quote from 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				s discussion of the abstention doctrine: We have also acknowledged that it might be appropriate for the federal courts to decline to hear a case involving elements of the domestic relationship, 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 705, even when divorce, alimony, or child custody is not strictly at issue.  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 910.  The Court perfunctorily states: [T]hus, while rare instances arise in which it is necessary to answer a substantial federal question that transcends or exists apart from the family law issue, see, 
				<em>
					e.g., Palmore
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Sidoti,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/466/429" class="subref" title="subref">466 U. S. 429</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">432</a>434 (1984)
, in general it is appropriate for the federal courts to leave delicate issues of domestic relations to the state courts.  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 9.  That conclusion does not follow from 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				s
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				discussion of the domestic relations exception and abstention; even if it did, it would not be applicable in this case because, on the merits, this case presents a substantial federal question that transcends the family law issue to a greater extent than 
				<em>
					Palmore
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The domestic relations exception is not a prudential limitation on our federal jurisdiction.  It is a limiting construction of the statute defining federal diversity jurisdiction, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1332.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1332</a>, which divests the federal courts of power to issue divorce, alimony, and child custody decrees, 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt,
				</em>
				 504
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				U. S., at 703.  This case does not involve diversity jurisdiction, and respondent does not ask this Court to issue a divorce, alimony, or child custody decree.  Instead it involves a substantial federal question about the constitutionality of the School Districts conducting the pledge ceremony, which is the source of our jurisdiction.  Therefore, the domestic relations exception to diversity jurisdiction forms no basis for denying standing to respondent.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				When we discussed abstention in 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				, we first noted that [a]bstention rarely should be invoked, because the federal courts have a virtually unflagging obligation … to exercise the jurisdiction given them.   
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 705 (quoting 
				<em>
					Colorado River Water Conservation Dist.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					United States,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/424/800" class="subref" title="subref">424 U. S. 800</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">817</a> (1976)
).  
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				s discussion of abstention by no means supports the proposition that only in the rare instances where a substantial federal question … transcends or exists apart from the family law issue, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				9, should federal courts decide the federal issue.  As in 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				, the status of the domestic relationship has been determined as a matter of state law, and in any event has no bearing on the underlying [constitutional violation] alleged.  504 U. S., at 706.  Sandra Banning and respondent now share joint custody of their daughter, respondent retains the right to expose his daughter to his religious views, and the state of their domestic affairs has nothing to do with the underlying constitutional claim.  Abstention forms no basis for denying respondent standing.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court cites
				<em>
					 Palmore
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Sidoti,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/466/429" class="subref" title="subref">466 U. S. 429</a> (1984)
, as an example of the exceptional case where a substantial federal question that transcends or exists apart from the family law issue makes the exercise of our jurisdiction appropriate.  
				<em>
					Ante, 
				</em>
				at 9.  In 
				<em>
					Palmore
				</em>
				, we granted certiorari to review a child custody decision, and reversed the state courts decision because we found that the effects of racial prejudice resulting from the mothers interracial marriage could not justify granting custody to the father.  Contrary to the Courts assertion, the alleged constitutional violation, while clearly involving a substantial federal question, did not transcen[d] or exis[t] apart from the family law issue, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 9; it had everything to do with the domestic relationship[w]e granted certiorari to review a 
				<em>
					judgment of a state court divesting a natural mother of the custody of her infant child
				</em>
				, 466 U. S., at 430 (emphasis added).  Under the Courts discussion today, it appears that we should have stayed out of the domestic dispute in 
				<em>
					Palmore 
				</em>
				no matter how constitutionally offensive the result would have been.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Finally, it seems the Court bases its new prudential standing principle, in part, on criticisms of the Court of Appeals construction of state law, coupled with the prudential principle prohibiting third-party standing.  In the Court of Appeals original opinion, it held unanimously that respondent satisfied the Article III standing requirements, stating respondent has standing as a parent to challenge a practice that interferes with his right to direct the education of his daughter.  
				<em>
					Newdow 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					United States Congress
				</em>
				, 292 F. 3d 597, 602 (CA9 2002).  After Banning moved for leave to intervene, the Court of Appeals reexamined respondents standing to determine whether the parents court-ordered custodial arrangement altered respondents standing.  
				<em>
					Newdow 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					United States Congress
				</em>
				, 313 F. 3d 500 (CA9 2002).  The court examined whether respondent could assert an injury in fact by asking whether, under California law, noncustodial parents maintain the right to expose and educate their children to their individual religious views, even if those religious views contradict those of the custodial parent.
				<a name="ZC-1ref" href="#ZC-1" class="">

            </a>
            <em>
					Id.

				, at 504.  The Court of Appeals again unanimously concluded that the respondent satisfied Article III standing, despite the custody order, because he retained sufficient parental rights under California law.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court, contrary to the Court of Appeals interpretation of California case law, concludes that respondent requests relief that is more ambitious than that sought in 
				<em>

				</em>
				and 
				<em>
					Murga
				</em>
				 because he seeks to restrain the act of a third party outside the parent-child sphere.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The correct characterization of respondents interest rests on the interpretation of state law.  As the Court recognizes,

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				The Court does not take issue with the fact that, under California law, respondent retains a right to influence his daughters religious upbringing and to expose her to his views.  But it relies on Bannings view of the merits of this case to diminish respondents interest, stating that the respondent wishes to forestall his daughters exposure to religious ideas that her mother, who wields a form of veto power, endorses, and to use his parental status to challenge the influences to which his daughter may be exposed in school when he and Banning disagree.  Ante,
				 at
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				13.  As alleged by respondent and as recognized by the Court of Appeals, respondent wishes to enjoin the School District from endorsing a form of religion inconsistent with his own views because he has a right to expose his daughter to those views without the States placing its 
				<em>
					imprimatur
				</em>
				 on a particular religion.  Under the Court of Appeals construction of California law, Bannings veto power does not override respondents right to challenge the pledge ceremony.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court concludes that the California cases do not stand for the proposition that [respondent] has a right to dictate to others what they may or may not say to his child respecting religion.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  Surely, under California case law and the current custody order, respondent may not tell Banning what she may say to their child respecting religion, and respondent does not seek to.  Just as surely, respondent cannot name his daughter as a party to a lawsuit against Bannings wishes.  But his claim is different: Respondent does not seek to tell just anyone what he or she may say to his daughter, and he does not seek to vindicate solely her rights.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Respondent asserts that the School Districts pledge ceremony infringes his right under California law to expose his daughter to his religious views.  While she is intimately associated with the source of respondents standing (the father-daughter relationship and respondents rights thereunder), the daughter 
				<em>
					is not the source 
				</em>
				of respondents standing; instead it is their relationship that provides respondent his standing, which is clear once respondents interest is properly described.

No. 2047, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., 1 (1942); S. Rep. No. 1477, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., 1 (1942), Congress enacted the Pledge on June 22, 1942.  Pub. L. 623, ch. 435, §7,

We do not know what other Members of Congress thought about the purpose of the amendment.  Following the decision of the Court of Appeals in this case, Congress passed legislation that made extensive findings about the historic role of religion in the political development of the Nation and reaffirmed the text of the Pledge.

20572060.  To the millions of people who regularly recite the Pledge, and who have no access to, or concern with, such legislation or legislative history, under God might mean several different things: that God has guided the destiny of the United States, for example, or that the United States exists under Gods authority.  How much consideration anyone gives to the phrase probably varies, since the Pledge itself is a patriotic observance focused primarily on the flag and the Nation, and only secondarily on the description of the Nation.

				The phrase under God in the Pledge seems, as a historical matter, to sum up the attitude of the Nations leaders, and to manifest itself in many of our public observances.  Examples of patriotic invocations of God and official acknowledgments of religions role in our Nations history abound.

				It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before usthat from these honored dead we take increased devotions to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotionthat we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vainthat this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedomand that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.  1 Documents of American History 429 (H.

Lincolns equally well known second inaugural address, delivered on March 4, 1865, makes repeated references to God, concluding with these famous words:

        <p class="bodytext">
				With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nations wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.

To such a task we can dedicate our lives and our fortunes, everything that we are and everything that we have, with the pride of those who know that the day has come when America is privileged to spend her blood and her might for the principles that gave her birth and happiness and the peace which she has treasured.

				The motto In God We Trust first appeared on the countrys coins during the Civil War.  Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase, acting under the authority of an Act of Congress passed in 1864, prescribed that the motto should appear on the two cent coin.  The motto was placed on more and more denominations, and since 1938 all United States coins bear the motto.  Paper currency followed suit at a slower pace; Federal Reserve notes were so inscribed during the decade of the 1960s.  Meanwhile, in 1956, Congress declared that the motto of the United States would be In God We Trust.  Act of July 30, 1956, ch. 795,

				All of these events strongly suggest that our national culture allows public recognition of our Nations religious history and character.  In the words of the House Report that accompanied the insertion of the phrase under God in the Pledge: From the time of our earliest history our peoples and our institutions have reflected the traditional concept that our Nation was founded on a fundamental belief in God.  H. R. Rep. No. 1693, 83d Cong., 2d Sess., 2 (1954).  Giving additional support to this idea is our national anthem The Star-Spangled Banner, adopted as such by Congress in 1931.

				As pointed out by the Court, California law requires public elementary schools to conduc[t] … appropriate patriotic exercises at the beginning of the schoolday, and notes that the giving of the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America shall satisfy the requirements of this section.  Cal. Educ. Code Ann. §52720 (West 1989).  The School District complies with this requirement by instructing that [e]ach elementary school class recite the [P]ledge of [A]llegiance to the [F]lag once each day.  App. 149150.  Students who object on religious (or other) grounds may abstain from the recitation.

.  That case arose out of a graduation ceremony for a public high school in Providence, Rhode Island.  The ceremony was begun with an invocation, and ended with a benediction, given by a local rabbi.  The Court held that even though attendance at the ceremony was voluntary, students who objected to the prayers would nonetheless feel coerced to attend and to stand during each prayer.  But the Court throughout its opinion referred to the prayer as an explicit religious exercise,

				I do not believe that the phrase under God in the Pledge converts its recital into a religious exercise of the sort described in 
				<em>
					Lee
				</em>
				.  Instead, it is a declaration of belief in allegiance and loyalty to the United States flag and the Republic that it represents.  The phrase under God is in no sense a prayer, nor an endorsement of any religion, but a simple recognition of the fact noted in H. R. Rep. No. 1693, at 2: From the time of our earliest history our peoples and our institutions have reflected the traditional concept that our Nation was founded on a fundamental belief in God.  Reciting the Pledge, or listening to others recite it, is a patriotic exercise, not a religious one; participants promise fidelity to our flag and our Nation, not to any particular God, faith, or church.

				There is no doubt that respondent is sincere in his atheism and rejection of a belief in God.  But the mere fact that he disagrees with this part of the Pledge does not give him a veto power over the decision of the public schools that willing participants should pledge allegiance to the flag in the manner prescribed by Congress.  There may be others who disagree, not with the phrase under God, but with the phrase with liberty and justice for all.  But surely that would not give such objectors the right to veto the holding of such a ceremony by those willing to participate.  Only if it can be said that the phrase under God somehow tends to the establishment of a religion in violation of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> can respondents claim succeed, where one based on objections to with liberty and justice for all fails.  Our cases have broadly interpreted this phrase, but none have gone anywhere near as far as the decision of the Court of Appeals in this case.  The recital, in a patriotic ceremony pledging allegiance to the flag and to the Nation, of the descriptive phrase under God cannot possibly lead to the establishment of a religion, or anything like it.

				When courts extend constitutional prohibitions beyond their previously recognized limit, they may restrict democratic choices made by public bodies.  Here, Congress prescribed a Pledge of Allegiance, the State of California required patriotic observances in its schools, and the School District chose to comply by requiring teacher-led recital of the Pledge of Allegiance by willing students.  Thus, we have three levels of popular governmentthe national, the state, and the localcollaborating to produce the Elk Grove ceremony.  The Constitution only requires that schoolchildren be entitled to abstain from the ceremony if they chose to do so.  To give the parent of such a child a sort of hecklers veto over a patriotic ceremony willingly participated in by other students, simply because the Pledge of Allegiance contains the descriptive phrase under God, is an unwarranted extension of the Establishment Clause, an extension which would have the unfortunate effect of prohibiting a commendable patriotic observance.

						 Also as properly described, it is clear that this is not the same as a next-friend suit.  The Court relies on the fact that respondent [was] deprived under California law of the right to sue as next friend.  Ante, at 14.  The same Superior Court that determined that respondent could not sue as next friend stated:


 To the extent that by not naming her you have … an individual right as a parent to say that, not only for all the children of the world but inmine in particular, I believe that this childmy child is being harmed, but the child is … not actually part of the suit, I dont know that theres any way that this court could preclude that.   App. to Brief for Respondent Newdow B4.

, coercion is present in the School District policy.  Post, at 35 (opinion concurring in judgment).  I cannot agree.  Barnette involved a board of education policy that compelled students to recite the Pledge.  319 U. S., at 629.  There was no opportunity to opt out, as there is in the present case.   Failure to conform [was] insubordination dealt with by expulsion.  Readmission [was] denied by statute until compliance.  Meanwhile the expelled child [was] unlawfully absent and [could] be proceeded against as a delinquent.  His parents or guardians [were] liable to prosecution, and if convicted [were] subject to a fine not exceeding $50 and jail term not exceeding thirty days.  Ibid. (footnotes omitted).  I think there is a clear difference between compulsion (Barnette) and coercion (Lee).  Compulsion, after Barnette, is not permissible, and it is not an issue in this case.  And whatever the virtues and vices of Lee, the Court was concerned only with formal religious exercise[s], 505 U. S., at 589, which the Pledge is not.

				The Court today erects a novel prudential standing principle in order to avoid reaching the merits of the constitutional claim.  I dissent from that ruling.  On the merits, I conclude that the Elk Grove Unified School District (School District) policy that requires teachers to lead willing students in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance, which includes the words under God, does not violate the Establishment Clause of the

In contrast, here is the Courts new prudential standing principle: [I]t is improper for the federal courts to entertain a claim by a plaintiff whose standing to sue is founded on family law rights that are in dispute when prosecution of the lawsuit may have an adverse effect on the person who is the source of the plaintiffs claimed standing.

				The Court first cites the domestic relations exception to support its new principle.  Then the Court relies on a quote from

				<em>

				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				s
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				discussion of the domestic relations exception and abstention; even if it did, it would not be applicable in this case because, on the merits, this case presents a substantial federal question that transcends the family law issue to a greater extent than 
				<em>

				The domestic relations exception is not a prudential limitation on our federal jurisdiction.  It is a limiting construction of the statute defining federal diversity jurisdiction, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1332.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1332</a>, which divests the federal courts of power to issue divorce, alimony, and child custody decrees, 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt,

				 504
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				U. S., at 703.  This case does not involve diversity jurisdiction, and respondent does not ask this Court to issue a divorce, alimony, or child custody decree.  Instead it involves a substantial federal question about the constitutionality of the School Districts conducting the pledge ceremony, which is the source of our jurisdiction.  Therefore, the domestic relations exception to diversity jurisdiction forms no basis for denying standing to respondent.

				When we discussed abstention in 
				<em>

Sandra Banning and respondent now share joint custody of their daughter, respondent retains the right to expose his daughter to his religious views, and the state of their domestic affairs has nothing to do with the underlying constitutional claim.  Abstention forms no basis for denying respondent standing.

, as an example of the exceptional case where a substantial federal question that transcends or exists apart from the family law issue makes the exercise of our jurisdiction appropriate.  
				<em>
					Ante, 
				</em>
				at 9.  In 
				<em>
					Palmore
				</em>
				, we granted certiorari to review a child custody decision, and reversed the state courts decision because we found that the effects of racial prejudice resulting from the mothers interracial marriage could not justify granting custody to the father.  Contrary to the Courts assertion, the alleged constitutional violation, while clearly involving a substantial federal question, did not transcen[d] or exis[t] apart from the family law issue, 
				<em>

				Finally, it seems the Court bases its new prudential standing principle, in part, on criticisms of the Court of Appeals construction of state law, coupled with the prudential principle prohibiting third-party standing.  In the Court of Appeals original opinion, it held unanimously that respondent satisfied the Article III standing requirements, stating respondent has standing as a parent to challenge a practice that interferes with his right to direct the education of his daughter.  
				<em>
					Newdow 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					United States Congress
				</em>
				, 292 F. 3d 597, 602 (CA9 2002).  After Banning moved for leave to intervene, the Court of Appeals reexamined respondents standing to determine whether the parents court-ordered custodial arrangement altered respondents standing.  
				<em>
					Newdow 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					United States Congress
				</em>
				, 313 F. 3d 500 (CA9 2002).  The court examined whether respondent could assert an injury in fact by asking whether, under California law, noncustodial parents maintain the right to expose and educate their children to their individual religious views, even if those religious views contradict those of the custodial parent.

				The correct characterization of respondents interest rests on the interpretation of state law.  As the Court recognizes,

				The Court does not take issue with the fact that, under California law, respondent retains a right to influence his daughters religious upbringing and to expose her to his views.  But it relies on Bannings view of the merits of this case to diminish respondents interest, stating that the respondent wishes to forestall his daughters exposure to religious ideas that her mother, who wields a form of veto power, endorses, and to use his parental status to challenge the influences to which his daughter may be exposed in school when he and Banning disagree.  Ante,
				 at
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				13.  As alleged by respondent and as recognized by the Court of Appeals, respondent wishes to enjoin the School District from endorsing a form of religion inconsistent with his own views because he has a right to expose his daughter to those views without the States placing its 
				<em>
					imprimatur
				</em>
				 on a particular religion.  Under the Court of Appeals construction of California law, Bannings veto power does not override respondents right to challenge the pledge ceremony.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court concludes that the California cases do not stand for the proposition that [respondent] has a right to dictate to others what they may or may not say to his child respecting religion.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  Surely, under California case law and the current custody order, respondent may not tell Banning what she may say to their child respecting religion, and respondent does not seek to.  Just as surely, respondent cannot name his daughter as a party to a lawsuit against Bannings wishes.  But his claim is different: Respondent does not seek to tell just anyone what he or she may say to his daughter, and he does not seek to vindicate solely her rights.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Respondent asserts that the School Districts pledge ceremony infringes his right under California law to expose his daughter to his religious views.  While she is intimately associated with the source of respondents standing (the father-daughter relationship and respondents rights thereunder), the daughter 
				<em>
					is not the source 
				</em>
				of respondents standing; instead it is their relationship that provides respondent his standing, which is clear once respondents interest is properly described.

As part of an overall effort to codify and emphasize existing rules and customs pertaining to the display and use of the flag of the United States of America, see H. R. Rep.

249.  The amendments sponsor, Representative Rabaut, said its purpose was to contrast this countrys belief in God with the Soviet Unions embrace of atheism.  100 Cong. Rec. 1700 (1954).  We do not know what other Members of Congress thought about the purpose of the amendment.  Following the decision of the Court of Appeals in this case, Congress passed legislation that made extensive findings about the historic role of religion in the political development of the Nation and reaffirmed the text of the Pledge.

20572060.  To the millions of people who regularly recite the Pledge, and who have no access to, or concern with, such legislation or legislative history, under God might mean several different things: that God has guided the destiny of the United States, for example, or that the United States exists under Gods authority.  How much consideration anyone gives to the phrase probably varies, since the Pledge itself is a patriotic observance focused primarily on the flag and the Nation, and only secondarily on the description of the Nation.

				The phrase under God in the Pledge seems, as a historical matter, to sum up the attitude of the Nations leaders, and to manifest itself in many of our public observances.  Examples of patriotic invocations of God and official acknowledgments of religions role in our Nations history abound.

				 328 F. 3d 466, 487 (CA9 2003).  To reach this result, the court relied primarily on our decision in

				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/505/577" class="subref" title="subref">505 U. S. 577</a> (1992)
.  That case arose out of a graduation ceremony for a public high school in Providence, Rhode Island.  The ceremony was begun with an invocation, and ended with a benediction, given by a local rabbi.  The Court held that even though attendance at the ceremony was voluntary, students who objected to the prayers would nonetheless feel coerced to attend and to stand during each prayer.  But the Court throughout its opinion referred to the prayer as an explicit religious exercise,

				 at 598, and a formal religious exercise,

				As the Court notes in its opinion, the Pledge of Allegiance evolved as a common public acknowledgement of the ideals that our flag symbolizes.  Its recitation is a patriotic exercise designed to foster national unity and pride in those principles.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I do not believe that the phrase under God in the Pledge converts its recital into a religious exercise of the sort described in 
				<em>
					Lee
				</em>
				.  Instead, it is a declaration of belief in allegiance and loyalty to the United States flag and the Republic that it represents.  The phrase under God is in no sense a prayer, nor an endorsement of any religion, but a simple recognition of the fact noted in H. R. Rep. No. 1693, at 2: From the time of our earliest history our peoples and our institutions have reflected the traditional concept that our Nation was founded on a fundamental belief in God.  Reciting the Pledge, or listening to others recite it, is a patriotic exercise, not a religious one; participants promise fidelity to our flag and our Nation, not to any particular God, faith, or church.

				There is no doubt that respondent is sincere in his atheism and rejection of a belief in God.  But the mere fact that he disagrees with this part of the Pledge does not give him a veto power over the decision of the public schools that willing participants should pledge allegiance to the flag in the manner prescribed by Congress.  There may be others who disagree, not with the phrase under God, but with the phrase with liberty and justice for all.  But surely that would not give such objectors the right to veto the holding of such a ceremony by those willing to participate.  Only if it can be said that the phrase under God somehow tends to the establishment of a religion in violation of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> can respondents claim succeed, where one based on objections to with liberty and justice for all fails.  Our cases have broadly interpreted this phrase, but none have gone anywhere near as far as the decision of the Court of Appeals in this case.  The recital, in a patriotic ceremony pledging allegiance to the flag and to the Nation, of the descriptive phrase under God cannot possibly lead to the establishment of a religion, or anything like it.

				When courts extend constitutional prohibitions beyond their previously recognized limit, they may restrict democratic choices made by public bodies.  Here, Congress prescribed a Pledge of Allegiance, the State of California required patriotic observances in its schools, and the School District chose to comply by requiring teacher-led recital of the Pledge of Allegiance by willing students.  Thus, we have three levels of popular governmentthe national, the state, and the localcollaborating to produce the Elk Grove ceremony.  The Constitution only requires that schoolchildren be entitled to abstain from the ceremony if they chose to do so.  To give the parent of such a child a sort of hecklers veto over a patriotic ceremony willingly participated in by other students, simply because the Pledge of Allegiance contains the descriptive phrase under God, is an unwarranted extension of the Establishment Clause, an extension which would have the unfortunate effect of prohibiting a commendable patriotic observance.

						 Also as properly described, it is clear that this is not the same as a next-friend suit.  The Court relies on the fact that respondent [was] deprived under California law of the right to sue as next friend.  Ante, at 14.  The same Superior Court that determined that respondent could not sue as next friend stated:


 To the extent that by not naming her you have … an individual right as a parent to say that, not only for all the children of the world but inmine in particular, I believe that this childmy child is being harmed, but the child is … not actually part of the suit, I dont know that theres any way that this court could preclude that.   App. to Brief for Respondent Newdow B4.


The California court did not reject Newdows right as distinct from his daughters, and we should not either.

, coercion is present in the School District policy.  Post, at 35 (opinion concurring in judgment).  I cannot agree.  Barnette involved a board of education policy that compelled students to recite the Pledge.  319 U. S., at 629.  There was no opportunity to opt out, as there is in the present case.   Failure to conform [was] insubordination dealt with by expulsion.  Readmission [was] denied by statute until compliance.  Meanwhile the expelled child [was] unlawfully absent and [could] be proceeded against as a delinquent.  His parents or guardians [were] liable to prosecution, and if convicted [were] subject to a fine not exceeding $50 and jail term not exceeding thirty days.  Ibid. (footnotes omitted).  I think there is a clear difference between compulsion (Barnette) and coercion (Lee).  Compulsion, after Barnette, is not permissible, and it is not an issue in this case.  And whatever the virtues and vices of Lee, the Court was concerned only with formal religious exercise[s], 505 U. S., at 589, which the Pledge is not.

				The Court today erects a novel prudential standing principle in order to avoid reaching the merits of the constitutional claim.  I dissent from that ruling.  On the merits, I conclude that the Elk Grove Unified School District (School District) policy that requires teachers to lead willing students in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance, which includes the words under God, does not violate the Establishment Clause of the

				<em>

				 at 78.  To be clear, the Court does not dispute that respondent Newdow (hereinafter respondent) satisfies the requisites of Article III standing.  But curiously the Court incorporates criticism of the Court of Appeals Article III standing decision into its justification for its novel prudential standing principle.  The Court concludes that respondent lacks prudential standing, under its new standing principle, to bring his suit in federal court.

 (Standing doctrine embraces several judicially self-imposed limits on the exercise of federal jurisdiction, such as the general prohibition on a litigants raising another persons legal rights …).  In contrast, here is the Courts new prudential standing principle: [I]t is improper for the federal courts to entertain a claim by a plaintiff whose standing to sue is founded on family law rights that are in dispute when prosecution of the lawsuit may have an adverse effect on the person who is the source of the plaintiffs claimed standing.

				13.  The Court loosely bases this novel prudential standing limitation on the domestic relations exception to diversity-of-citizenship jurisdiction pursuant to 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1332.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S.

				First, the Court relies heavily on 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Richards,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/504/689" class="subref" title="subref">504 U. S. 689</a> (1992)
, in which we discussed both the domestic relations exception and the abstention doctrine.  In 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				, the mother of two children sued her former spouse and his female companion on behalf of the children, alleging physical and sexual abuse of the children.  The lower courts declined jurisdiction based on the domestic relations exception to diversity jurisdiction and abstention under 
				<em>
					Younger
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Harris,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/401/37" class="subref" title="subref">401 U. S. 37</a> (1971)
.  We reversed, concluding that the domestic relations exception only applies when a party seeks to have a district court issue a divorce, alimony, and child custody decree, 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				, 504 U. S., at 704.  We further held that abstention was inappropriate because the status of the domestic relationship ha[d] been determined as a matter of state law, and in any event ha[d] no bearing on the underlying torts alleged, 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 706.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court first cites the domestic relations exception to support its new principle.  Then the Court relies on a quote from 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				s discussion of the abstention doctrine: We have also acknowledged that it might be appropriate for the federal courts to decline to hear a case involving elements of the domestic relationship, 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 705, even when divorce, alimony, or child custody is not strictly at issue.  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 910.  The Court perfunctorily states: [T]hus, while rare instances arise in which it is necessary to answer a substantial federal question that transcends or exists apart from the family law issue, see, 
				<em>
					e.g., Palmore
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Sidoti,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/466/429" class="subref" title="subref">466 U. S. 429</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">432</a>434 (1984)
, in general it is appropriate for the federal courts to leave delicate issues of domestic relations to the state courts.  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 9.  That conclusion does not follow from 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				s
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				discussion of the domestic relations exception and abstention; even if it did, it would not be applicable in this case because, on the merits, this case presents a substantial federal question that transcends the family law issue to a greater extent than 
				<em>
					Palmore
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The domestic relations exception is not a prudential limitation on our federal jurisdiction.  It is a limiting construction of the statute defining federal diversity jurisdiction, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1332.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1332</a>, which divests the federal courts of power to issue divorce, alimony, and child custody decrees, 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt,
				</em>
				 504
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				U. S., at 703.  This case does not involve diversity jurisdiction, and respondent does not ask this Court to issue a divorce, alimony, or child custody decree.  Instead it involves a substantial federal question about the constitutionality of the School Districts conducting the pledge ceremony, which is the source of our jurisdiction.  Therefore, the domestic relations exception to diversity jurisdiction forms no basis for denying standing to respondent.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				When we discussed abstention in 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				, we first noted that [a]bstention rarely should be invoked, because the federal courts have a virtually unflagging obligation … to exercise the jurisdiction given them.   
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 705 (quoting 
				<em>
					Colorado River Water Conservation Dist.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					United States,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/424/800" class="subref" title="subref">424 U. S. 800</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">817</a> (1976)
).  
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				s discussion of abstention by no means supports the proposition that only in the rare instances where a substantial federal question … transcends or exists apart from the family law issue, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				9, should federal courts decide the federal issue.  As in 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				, the status of the domestic relationship has been determined as a matter of state law, and in any event has no bearing on the underlying [constitutional violation] alleged.  504 U. S., at 706.  Sandra Banning and respondent now share joint custody of their daughter, respondent retains the right to expose his daughter to his religious views, and the state of their domestic affairs has nothing to do with the underlying constitutional claim.  Abstention forms no basis for denying respondent standing.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court cites
				<em>
					 Palmore
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Sidoti,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/466/429" class="subref" title="subref">466 U. S. 429</a> (1984)
, as an example of the exceptional case where a substantial federal question that transcends or exists apart from the family law issue makes the exercise of our jurisdiction appropriate.  
				<em>
					Ante, 
				</em>
				at 9.  In 
				<em>
					Palmore
				</em>
				, we granted certiorari to review a child custody decision, and reversed the state courts decision because we found that the effects of racial prejudice resulting from the mothers interracial marriage could not justify granting custody to the father.  Contrary to the Courts assertion, the alleged constitutional violation, while clearly involving a substantial federal question, did not transcen[d] or exis[t] apart from the family law issue, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 9; it had everything to do with the domestic relationship[w]e granted certiorari to review a 
				<em>
					judgment of a state court divesting a natural mother of the custody of her infant child
				</em>
				, 466 U. S., at 430 (emphasis added).  Under the Courts discussion today, it appears that we should have stayed out of the domestic dispute in 
				<em>
					Palmore 
				</em>
				no matter how constitutionally offensive the result would have been.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Finally, it seems the Court bases its new prudential standing principle, in part, on criticisms of the Court of Appeals construction of state law, coupled with the prudential principle prohibiting third-party standing.  In the Court of Appeals original opinion, it held unanimously that respondent satisfied the Article III standing requirements, stating respondent has standing as a parent to challenge a practice that interferes with his right to direct the education of his daughter.  
				<em>
					Newdow 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					United States Congress
				</em>
				, 292 F. 3d 597, 602 (CA9 2002).  After Banning moved for leave to intervene, the Court of Appeals reexamined respondents standing to determine whether the parents court-ordered custodial arrangement altered respondents standing.  
				<em>
					Newdow 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					United States Congress
				</em>
				, 313 F. 3d 500 (CA9 2002).  The court examined whether respondent could assert an injury in fact by asking whether, under California law, noncustodial parents maintain the right to expose and educate their children to their individual religious views, even if those religious views contradict those of the custodial parent.
				<a name="ZC-1ref" href="#ZC-1" class="">

            </a>
            <em>
					Id.

				, at 504.  The Court of Appeals again unanimously concluded that the respondent satisfied Article III standing, despite the custody order, because he retained sufficient parental rights under California law.

				The Court, contrary to the Court of Appeals interpretation of California case law, concludes that respondent requests relief that is more ambitious than that sought in

				 because he seeks to restrain the act of a third party outside the parent-child sphere.

				The correct characterization of respondents interest rests on the interpretation of state law.  As the Court recognizes,

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				The Court does not take issue with the fact that, under California law, respondent retains a right to influence his daughters religious upbringing and to expose her to his views.  But it relies on Bannings view of the merits of this case to diminish respondents interest, stating that the respondent wishes to forestall his daughters exposure to religious ideas that her mother, who wields a form of veto power, endorses, and to use his parental status to challenge the influences to which his daughter may be exposed in school when he and Banning disagree.  Ante,
				 at
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				13.  As alleged by respondent and as recognized by the Court of Appeals, respondent wishes to enjoin the School District from endorsing a form of religion inconsistent with his own views because he has a right to expose his daughter to those views without the States placing its 
				<em>

But his claim is different: Respondent does not seek to tell just anyone what he or she may say to his daughter, and he does not seek to vindicate solely her rights.

As part of an overall effort to codify and emphasize existing rules and customs pertaining to the display and use of the flag of the United States of America, see H. R. Rep. No. 2047, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., 1 (1942); S. Rep. No. 1477, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., 1 (1942), Congress enacted the Pledge on June 22, 1942.  Pub. L. 623, ch. 435, §7,

249.  The amendments sponsor, Representative Rabaut, said its purpose was to contrast this countrys belief in God with the Soviet Unions embrace of atheism.  100 Cong. Rec. 1700 (1954).  We do not know what other Members of Congress thought about the purpose of the amendment.  Following the decision of the Court of Appeals in this case, Congress passed legislation that made extensive findings about the historic role of religion in the political development of the Nation and reaffirmed the text of the Pledge.  Act of Nov. 13, 2002, Pub. L. 107293, §§12, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">116</a>Stat.
20572060.  To the millions of people who regularly recite the Pledge, and who have no access to, or concern with, such legislation or legislative history, under God might mean several different things: that God has guided the destiny of the United States, for example, or that the United States exists under Gods authority.  How much consideration anyone gives to the phrase probably varies, since the Pledge itself is a patriotic observance focused primarily on the flag and the Nation, and only secondarily on the description of the Nation.

				The phrase under God in the Pledge seems, as a historical matter, to sum up the attitude of the Nations leaders, and to manifest itself in many of our public observances.  Examples of patriotic invocations of God and official acknowledgments of religions role in our Nations history abound.

				The motto In God We Trust first appeared on the countrys coins during the Civil War.  Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase, acting under the authority of an Act of Congress passed in 1864, prescribed that the motto should appear on the two cent coin.  The motto was placed on more and more denominations, and since 1938 all United States coins bear the motto.  Paper currency followed suit at a slower pace; Federal Reserve notes were so inscribed during the decade of the 1960s.  Meanwhile, in 1956, Congress declared that the motto of the United States would be In God We Trust.  Act of July 30, 1956, ch. 795,

				As pointed out by the Court, California law requires public elementary schools to conduc[t] … appropriate patriotic exercises at the beginning of the schoolday, and notes that the giving of the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America shall satisfy the requirements of this section.  Cal. Educ. Code Ann. §52720 (West 1989).  The School District complies with this requirement by instructing that [e]ach elementary school class recite the [P]ledge of [A]llegiance to the [F]lag once each day.  App. 149150.

.  That case arose out of a graduation ceremony for a public high school in Providence, Rhode Island.  The ceremony was begun with an invocation, and ended with a benediction, given by a local rabbi.  The Court held that even though attendance at the ceremony was voluntary, students who objected to the prayers would nonetheless feel coerced to attend and to stand during each prayer.  But the Court throughout its opinion referred to the prayer as an explicit religious exercise,

				I do not believe that the phrase under God in the Pledge converts its recital into a religious exercise of the sort described in 
				<em>
					Lee
				</em>
				.  Instead, it is a declaration of belief in allegiance and loyalty to the United States flag and the Republic that it represents.  The phrase under God is in no sense a prayer, nor an endorsement of any religion, but a simple recognition of the fact noted in H. R. Rep. No. 1693, at 2: From the time of our earliest history our peoples and our institutions have reflected the traditional concept that our Nation was founded on a fundamental belief in God.  Reciting the Pledge, or listening to others recite it, is a patriotic exercise, not a religious one; participants promise fidelity to our flag and our Nation, not to any particular God, faith, or church.

				There is no doubt that respondent is sincere in his atheism and rejection of a belief in God.  But the mere fact that he disagrees with this part of the Pledge does not give him a veto power over the decision of the public schools that willing participants should pledge allegiance to the flag in the manner prescribed by Congress.  There may be others who disagree, not with the phrase under God, but with the phrase with liberty and justice for all.  But surely that would not give such objectors the right to veto the holding of such a ceremony by those willing to participate.  Only if it can be said that the phrase under God somehow tends to the establishment of a religion in violation of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> can respondents claim succeed, where one based on objections to with liberty and justice for all fails.  Our cases have broadly interpreted this phrase, but none have gone anywhere near as far as the decision of the Court of Appeals in this case.  The recital, in a patriotic ceremony pledging allegiance to the flag and to the Nation, of the descriptive phrase under God cannot possibly lead to the establishment of a religion, or anything like it.

				When courts extend constitutional prohibitions beyond their previously recognized limit, they may restrict democratic choices made by public bodies.  Here, Congress prescribed a Pledge of Allegiance, the State of California required patriotic observances in its schools, and the School District chose to comply by requiring teacher-led recital of the Pledge of Allegiance by willing students.  Thus, we have three levels of popular governmentthe national, the state, and the localcollaborating to produce the Elk Grove ceremony.  The Constitution only requires that schoolchildren be entitled to abstain from the ceremony if they chose to do so.  To give the parent of such a child a sort of hecklers veto over a patriotic ceremony willingly participated in by other students, simply because the Pledge of Allegiance contains the descriptive phrase under God, is an unwarranted extension of the Establishment Clause, an extension which would have the unfortunate effect of prohibiting a commendable patriotic observance.

						 Also as properly described, it is clear that this is not the same as a next-friend suit.

 To the extent that by not naming her you have … an individual right as a parent to say that, not only for all the children of the world but inmine in particular, I believe that this childmy child is being harmed, but the child is … not actually part of the suit, I dont know that theres any way that this court could preclude that.   App. to Brief for Respondent Newdow B4.

Barnette involved a board of education policy that compelled students to recite the Pledge.  319 U. S., at 629.  There was no opportunity to opt out, as there is in the present case.   Failure to conform [was] insubordination dealt with by expulsion.  Readmission [was] denied by statute until compliance.  Meanwhile the expelled child [was] unlawfully absent and [could] be proceeded against as a delinquent.  His parents or guardians [were] liable to prosecution, and if convicted [were] subject to a fine not exceeding $50 and jail term not exceeding thirty days.  Ibid. (footnotes omitted).  I think there is a clear difference between compulsion (Barnette) and coercion (Lee).  Compulsion, after Barnette, is not permissible, and it is not an issue in this case.  And whatever the virtues and vices of Lee, the Court was concerned only with formal religious exercise[s], 505 U. S., at 589, which the Pledge is not.

On the merits, I conclude that the Elk Grove Unified School District (School District) policy that requires teachers to lead willing students in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance, which includes the words under God, does not violate the Establishment Clause of the

The Court concludes that respondent lacks prudential standing, under its new standing principle, to bring his suit in federal court.

				First, the Court relies heavily on

, in which we discussed both the domestic relations exception and the abstention doctrine.  In 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				, the mother of two children sued her former spouse and his female companion on behalf of the children, alleging physical and sexual abuse of the children.  The lower courts declined jurisdiction based on the domestic relations exception to diversity jurisdiction and abstention under 
				<em>

            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/401/37" class="subref" title="subref">401 U. S. 37</a> (1971)
.  We reversed, concluding that the domestic relations exception only applies when a party seeks to have a district court issue a divorce, alimony, and child custody decree, 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				, 504 U. S., at 704.  We further held that abstention was inappropriate because the status of the domestic relationship ha[d] been determined as a matter of state law, and in any event ha[d] no bearing on the underlying torts alleged, 
				<em>

				</em>
				at 706.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court first cites the domestic relations exception to support its new principle.  Then the Court relies on a quote from 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				s discussion of the abstention doctrine: We have also acknowledged that it might be appropriate for the federal courts to decline to hear a case involving elements of the domestic relationship, 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 705, even when divorce, alimony, or child custody is not strictly at issue.  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 910.  The Court perfunctorily states: [T]hus, while rare instances arise in which it is necessary to answer a substantial federal question that transcends or exists apart from the family law issue, see, 
				<em>
					e.g., Palmore
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>

				</em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">432</a>434 (1984)
, in general it is appropriate for the federal courts to leave delicate issues of domestic relations to the state courts.  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 9.  That conclusion does not follow from 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				s
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				discussion of the domestic relations exception and abstention; even if it did, it would not be applicable in this case because, on the merits, this case presents a substantial federal question that transcends the family law issue to a greater extent than 
				<em>
					Palmore
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The domestic relations exception is not a prudential limitation on our federal jurisdiction.  It is a limiting construction of the statute defining federal diversity jurisdiction, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1332.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1332</a>, which divests the federal courts of power to issue divorce, alimony, and child custody decrees, 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt,
				</em>
				 504
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				U. S., at 703.  This case does not involve diversity jurisdiction, and respondent does not ask this Court to issue a divorce, alimony, or child custody decree.  Instead it involves a substantial federal question about the constitutionality of the School Districts conducting the pledge ceremony, which is the source of our jurisdiction.  Therefore, the domestic relations exception to diversity jurisdiction forms no basis for denying standing to respondent.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				When we discussed abstention in 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				, we first noted that [a]bstention rarely should be invoked, because the federal courts have a virtually unflagging obligation … to exercise the jurisdiction given them.   
				<em>
					Id.

				, at 705 (quoting

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">817</a> (1976)
).  
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				s discussion of abstention by no means supports the proposition that only in the rare instances where a substantial federal question … transcends or exists apart from the family law issue, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				9, should federal courts decide the federal issue.  As in 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				, the status of the domestic relationship has been determined as a matter of state law, and in any event has no bearing on the underlying [constitutional violation] alleged.  504 U. S., at 706.  Sandra Banning and respondent now share joint custody of their daughter, respondent retains the right to expose his daughter to his religious views, and the state of their domestic affairs has nothing to do with the underlying constitutional claim.  Abstention forms no basis for denying respondent standing.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court cites
				<em>

, as an example of the exceptional case where a substantial federal question that transcends or exists apart from the family law issue makes the exercise of our jurisdiction appropriate.  
				<em>
					Ante, 
				</em>
				at 9.  In 
				<em>
					Palmore
				</em>
				, we granted certiorari to review a child custody decision, and reversed the state courts decision because we found that the effects of racial prejudice resulting from the mothers interracial marriage could not justify granting custody to the father.  Contrary to the Courts assertion, the alleged constitutional violation, while clearly involving a substantial federal question, did not transcen[d] or exis[t] apart from the family law issue, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 9; it had everything to do with the domestic relationship[w]e granted certiorari to review a 
				<em>
					judgment of a state court divesting a natural mother of the custody of her infant child
				</em>
				, 466 U. S., at 430 (emphasis added).  Under the Courts discussion today, it appears that we should have stayed out of the domestic dispute in 
				<em>
					Palmore 
				</em>
				no matter how constitutionally offensive the result would have been.

				Finally, it seems the Court bases its new prudential standing principle, in part, on criticisms of the Court of Appeals construction of state law, coupled with the prudential principle prohibiting third-party standing.  In the Court of Appeals original opinion, it held unanimously that respondent satisfied the Article III standing requirements, stating respondent has standing as a parent to challenge a practice that interferes with his right to direct the education of his daughter.  
				<em>
					Newdow 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					United States Congress
				</em>
				, 292 F. 3d 597, 602 (CA9 2002).  After Banning moved for leave to intervene, the Court of Appeals reexamined respondents standing to determine whether the parents court-ordered custodial arrangement altered respondents standing.  
				<em>
					Newdow 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					United States Congress
				</em>
				, 313 F. 3d 500 (CA9 2002).  The court examined whether respondent could assert an injury in fact by asking whether, under California law, noncustodial parents maintain the right to expose and educate their children to their individual religious views, even if those religious views contradict those of the custodial parent.

            <em>

				 because he seeks to restrain the act of a third party outside the parent-child sphere.

				The correct characterization of respondents interest rests on the interpretation of state law.  As the Court recognizes,

				The Court does not take issue with the fact that, under California law, respondent retains a right to influence his daughters religious upbringing and to expose her to his views.  But it relies on Bannings view of the merits of this case to diminish respondents interest, stating that the respondent wishes to forestall his daughters exposure to religious ideas that her mother, who wields a form of veto power, endorses, and to use his parental status to challenge the influences to which his daughter may be exposed in school when he and Banning disagree.  Ante,
				 at
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				13.  As alleged by respondent and as recognized by the Court of Appeals, respondent wishes to enjoin the School District from endorsing a form of religion inconsistent with his own views because he has a right to expose his daughter to those views without the States placing its 
				<em>
					imprimatur
				</em>
				 on a particular religion.  Under the Court of Appeals construction of California law, Bannings veto power does not override respondents right to challenge the pledge ceremony.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court concludes that the California cases do not stand for the proposition that [respondent] has a right to dictate to others what they may or may not say to his child respecting religion.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  Surely, under California case law and the current custody order, respondent may not tell Banning what she may say to their child respecting religion, and respondent does not seek to.  Just as surely, respondent cannot name his daughter as a party to a lawsuit against Bannings wishes.  But his claim is different: Respondent does not seek to tell just anyone what he or she may say to his daughter, and he does not seek to vindicate solely her rights.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Respondent asserts that the School Districts pledge ceremony infringes his right under California law to expose his daughter to his religious views.  While she is intimately associated with the source of respondents standing (the father-daughter relationship and respondents rights thereunder), the daughter 
				<em>
					is not the source 
				</em>
				of respondents standing; instead it is their relationship that provides respondent his standing, which is clear once respondents interest is properly described.

We do not know what other Members of Congress thought about the purpose of the amendment.  Following the decision of the Court of Appeals in this case, Congress passed legislation that made extensive findings about the historic role of religion in the political development of the Nation and reaffirmed the text of the Pledge.

20572060.  To the millions of people who regularly recite the Pledge, and who have no access to, or concern with, such legislation or legislative history, under God might mean several different things: that God has guided the destiny of the United States, for example, or that the United States exists under Gods authority.  How much consideration anyone gives to the phrase probably varies, since the Pledge itself is a patriotic observance focused primarily on the flag and the Nation, and only secondarily on the description of the Nation.

In the words of the House Report that accompanied the insertion of the phrase under God in the Pledge: From the time of our earliest history our peoples and our institutions have reflected the traditional concept that our Nation was founded on a fundamental belief in God.  H. R. Rep. No. 1693, 83d Cong., 2d Sess., 2 (1954).  Giving additional support to this idea is our national anthem The Star-Spangled Banner, adopted as such by Congress in 1931.

				As pointed out by the Court, California law requires public elementary schools to conduc[t] … appropriate patriotic exercises at the beginning of the schoolday, and notes that the giving of the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America shall satisfy the requirements of this section.  Cal. Educ. Code Ann. §52720 (West 1989).  The School District complies with this requirement by instructing that [e]ach elementary school class recite the [P]ledge of [A]llegiance to the [F]lag once each day.  App. 149150.  Students who object on religious (or other) grounds may abstain from the recitation.

.  That case arose out of a graduation ceremony for a public high school in Providence, Rhode Island.  The ceremony was begun with an invocation, and ended with a benediction, given by a local rabbi.  The Court held that even though attendance at the ceremony was voluntary, students who objected to the prayers would nonetheless feel coerced to attend and to stand during each prayer.  But the Court throughout its opinion referred to the prayer as an explicit religious exercise,

				I do not believe that the phrase under God in the Pledge converts its recital into a religious exercise of the sort described in 
				<em>
					Lee
				</em>
				.  Instead, it is a declaration of belief in allegiance and loyalty to the United States flag and the Republic that it represents.  The phrase under God is in no sense a prayer, nor an endorsement of any religion, but a simple recognition of the fact noted in H. R. Rep. No. 1693, at 2: From the time of our earliest history our peoples and our institutions have reflected the traditional concept that our Nation was founded on a fundamental belief in God.  Reciting the Pledge, or listening to others recite it, is a patriotic exercise, not a religious one; participants promise fidelity to our flag and our Nation, not to any particular God, faith, or church.

				There is no doubt that respondent is sincere in his atheism and rejection of a belief in God.  But the mere fact that he disagrees with this part of the Pledge does not give him a veto power over the decision of the public schools that willing participants should pledge allegiance to the flag in the manner prescribed by Congress.  There may be others who disagree, not with the phrase under God, but with the phrase with liberty and justice for all.  But surely that would not give such objectors the right to veto the holding of such a ceremony by those willing to participate.  Only if it can be said that the phrase under God somehow tends to the establishment of a religion in violation of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> can respondents claim succeed, where one based on objections to with liberty and justice for all fails.  Our cases have broadly interpreted this phrase, but none have gone anywhere near as far as the decision of the Court of Appeals in this case.  The recital, in a patriotic ceremony pledging allegiance to the flag and to the Nation, of the descriptive phrase under God cannot possibly lead to the establishment of a religion, or anything like it.

				When courts extend constitutional prohibitions beyond their previously recognized limit, they may restrict democratic choices made by public bodies.  Here, Congress prescribed a Pledge of Allegiance, the State of California required patriotic observances in its schools, and the School District chose to comply by requiring teacher-led recital of the Pledge of Allegiance by willing students.  Thus, we have three levels of popular governmentthe national, the state, and the localcollaborating to produce the Elk Grove ceremony.  The Constitution only requires that schoolchildren be entitled to abstain from the ceremony if they chose to do so.  To give the parent of such a child a sort of hecklers veto over a patriotic ceremony willingly participated in by other students, simply because the Pledge of Allegiance contains the descriptive phrase under God, is an unwarranted extension of the Establishment Clause, an extension which would have the unfortunate effect of prohibiting a commendable patriotic observance.

						 Also as properly described, it is clear that this is not the same as a next-friend suit.  The Court relies on the fact that respondent [was] deprived under California law of the right to sue as next friend.  Ante, at 14.  The same Superior Court that determined that respondent could not sue as next friend stated:


 To the extent that by not naming her you have … an individual right as a parent to say that, not only for all the children of the world but inmine in particular, I believe that this childmy child is being harmed, but the child is … not actually part of the suit, I dont know that theres any way that this court could preclude that.   App. to Brief for Respondent Newdow B4.


The California court did not reject Newdows right as distinct from his daughters, and we should not either.

, coercion is present in the School District policy.  Post, at 35 (opinion concurring in judgment).  I cannot agree.  Barnette involved a board of education policy that compelled students to recite the Pledge.  319 U. S., at 629.  There was no opportunity to opt out, as there is in the present case.   Failure to conform [was] insubordination dealt with by expulsion.  Readmission [was] denied by statute until compliance.  Meanwhile the expelled child [was] unlawfully absent and [could] be proceeded against as a delinquent.  His parents or guardians [were] liable to prosecution, and if convicted [were] subject to a fine not exceeding $50 and jail term not exceeding thirty days.  Ibid. (footnotes omitted).  I think there is a clear difference between compulsion (Barnette) and coercion (Lee).  Compulsion, after Barnette, is not permissible, and it is not an issue in this case.  And whatever the virtues and vices of Lee, the Court was concerned only with formal religious exercise[s], 505 U. S., at 589, which the Pledge is not.

				The Court today erects a novel prudential standing principle in order to avoid reaching the merits of the constitutional claim.  I dissent from that ruling.  On the merits, I conclude that the Elk Grove Unified School District (School District) policy that requires teachers to lead willing students in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance, which includes the words under God, does not violate the Establishment Clause of the

				<em>

				 at 78.  To be clear, the Court does not dispute that respondent Newdow (hereinafter respondent) satisfies the requisites of Article III standing.  But curiously the Court incorporates criticism of the Court of Appeals Article III standing decision into its justification for its novel prudential standing principle.  The Court concludes that respondent lacks prudential standing, under its new standing principle, to bring his suit in federal court.

 (Standing doctrine embraces several judicially self-imposed limits on the exercise of federal jurisdiction, such as the general prohibition on a litigants raising another persons legal rights …).  In contrast, here is the Courts new prudential standing principle: [I]t is improper for the federal courts to entertain a claim by a plaintiff whose standing to sue is founded on family law rights that are in dispute when prosecution of the lawsuit may have an adverse effect on the person who is the source of the plaintiffs claimed standing.

				13.  The Court loosely bases this novel prudential standing limitation on the domestic relations exception to diversity-of-citizenship jurisdiction pursuant to 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1332.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				First, the Court relies heavily on 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Richards,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/504/689" class="subref" title="subref">504 U. S. 689</a> (1992)
, in which we discussed both the domestic relations exception and the abstention doctrine.  In 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				, the mother of two children sued her former spouse and his female companion on behalf of the children, alleging physical and sexual abuse of the children.  The lower courts declined jurisdiction based on the domestic relations exception to diversity jurisdiction and abstention under 
				<em>
					Younger
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Harris,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/401/37" class="subref" title="subref">401 U. S. 37</a> (1971)
.  We reversed, concluding that the domestic relations exception only applies when a party seeks to have a district court issue a divorce, alimony, and child custody decree, 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				, 504 U. S., at 704.  We further held that abstention was inappropriate because the status of the domestic relationship ha[d] been determined as a matter of state law, and in any event ha[d] no bearing on the underlying torts alleged, 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 706.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court first cites the domestic relations exception to support its new principle.  Then the Court relies on a quote from 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				s discussion of the abstention doctrine: We have also acknowledged that it might be appropriate for the federal courts to decline to hear a case involving elements of the domestic relationship, 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 705, even when divorce, alimony, or child custody is not strictly at issue.  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 910.  The Court perfunctorily states: [T]hus, while rare instances arise in which it is necessary to answer a substantial federal question that transcends or exists apart from the family law issue, see, 
				<em>
					e.g., Palmore
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Sidoti,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/466/429" class="subref" title="subref">466 U. S. 429</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">432</a>434 (1984)
, in general it is appropriate for the federal courts to leave delicate issues of domestic relations to the state courts.  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 9.  That conclusion does not follow from 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				s
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				discussion of the domestic relations exception and abstention; even if it did, it would not be applicable in this case because, on the merits, this case presents a substantial federal question that transcends the family law issue to a greater extent than 
				<em>
					Palmore
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The domestic relations exception is not a prudential limitation on our federal jurisdiction.  It is a limiting construction of the statute defining federal diversity jurisdiction, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1332.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1332</a>, which divests the federal courts of power to issue divorce, alimony, and child custody decrees, 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt,
				</em>
				 504
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				U. S., at 703.  This case does not involve diversity jurisdiction, and respondent does not ask this Court to issue a divorce, alimony, or child custody decree.  Instead it involves a substantial federal question about the constitutionality of the School Districts conducting the pledge ceremony, which is the source of our jurisdiction.  Therefore, the domestic relations exception to diversity jurisdiction forms no basis for denying standing to respondent.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				When we discussed abstention in 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				, we first noted that [a]bstention rarely should be invoked, because the federal courts have a virtually unflagging obligation … to exercise the jurisdiction given them.   
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 705 (quoting 
				<em>
					Colorado River Water Conservation Dist.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					United States,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/424/800" class="subref" title="subref">424 U. S. 800</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">817</a> (1976)
).  
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				s discussion of abstention by no means supports the proposition that only in the rare instances where a substantial federal question … transcends or exists apart from the family law issue, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				9, should federal courts decide the federal issue.  As in 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				, the status of the domestic relationship has been determined as a matter of state law, and in any event has no bearing on the underlying [constitutional violation] alleged.  504 U. S., at 706.  Sandra Banning and respondent now share joint custody of their daughter, respondent retains the right to expose his daughter to his religious views, and the state of their domestic affairs has nothing to do with the underlying constitutional claim.  Abstention forms no basis for denying respondent standing.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court cites
				<em>
					 Palmore
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Sidoti,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/466/429" class="subref" title="subref">466 U. S. 429</a> (1984)
, as an example of the exceptional case where a substantial federal question that transcends or exists apart from the family law issue makes the exercise of our jurisdiction appropriate.  
				<em>
					Ante, 
				</em>
				at 9.  In 
				<em>
					Palmore
				</em>
				, we granted certiorari to review a child custody decision, and reversed the state courts decision because we found that the effects of racial prejudice resulting from the mothers interracial marriage could not justify granting custody to the father.  Contrary to the Courts assertion, the alleged constitutional violation, while clearly involving a substantial federal question, did not transcen[d] or exis[t] apart from the family law issue, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 9; it had everything to do with the domestic relationship[w]e granted certiorari to review a 
				<em>
					judgment of a state court divesting a natural mother of the custody of her infant child
				</em>
				, 466 U. S., at 430 (emphasis added).  Under the Courts discussion today, it appears that we should have stayed out of the domestic dispute in 
				<em>
					Palmore 
				</em>
				no matter how constitutionally offensive the result would have been.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Finally, it seems the Court bases its new prudential standing principle, in part, on criticisms of the Court of Appeals construction of state law, coupled with the prudential principle prohibiting third-party standing.  In the Court of Appeals original opinion, it held unanimously that respondent satisfied the Article III standing requirements, stating respondent has standing as a parent to challenge a practice that interferes with his right to direct the education of his daughter.  
				<em>
					Newdow 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					United States Congress
				</em>
				, 292 F. 3d 597, 602 (CA9 2002).  After Banning moved for leave to intervene, the Court of Appeals reexamined respondents standing to determine whether the parents court-ordered custodial arrangement altered respondents standing.  
				<em>
					Newdow 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					United States Congress
				</em>
				, 313 F. 3d 500 (CA9 2002).  The court examined whether respondent could assert an injury in fact by asking whether, under California law, noncustodial parents maintain the right to expose and educate their children to their individual religious views, even if those religious views contradict those of the custodial parent.

				The Court does not take issue with the fact that, under California law, respondent retains a right to influence his daughters religious upbringing and to expose her to his views.  But it relies on Bannings view of the merits of this case to diminish respondents interest, stating that the respondent wishes to forestall his daughters exposure to religious ideas that her mother, who wields a form of veto power, endorses, and to use his parental status to challenge the influences to which his daughter may be exposed in school when he and Banning disagree.  Ante,

				</em>
				 on a particular religion.  Under the Court of Appeals construction of California law, Bannings veto power does not override respondents right to challenge the pledge ceremony.

But his claim is different: Respondent does not seek to tell just anyone what he or she may say to his daughter, and he does not seek to vindicate solely her rights.

As part of an overall effort to codify and emphasize existing rules and customs pertaining to the display and use of the flag of the United States of America, see H. R. Rep. No. 2047, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., 1 (1942); S. Rep. No. 1477, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., 1 (1942), Congress enacted the Pledge on June 22, 1942.  Pub. L. 623, ch. 435, §7,

249.  The amendments sponsor, Representative Rabaut, said its purpose was to contrast this countrys belief in God with the Soviet Unions embrace of atheism.  100 Cong. Rec. 1700 (1954).  We do not know what other Members of Congress thought about the purpose of the amendment.  Following the decision of the Court of Appeals in this case, Congress passed legislation that made extensive findings about the historic role of religion in the political development of the Nation and reaffirmed the text of the Pledge.  Act of Nov. 13, 2002, Pub. L. 107293, §§12, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">116</a>Stat.
20572060.  To the millions of people who regularly recite the Pledge, and who have no access to, or concern with, such legislation or legislative history, under God might mean several different things: that God has guided the destiny of the United States, for example, or that the United States exists under Gods authority.  How much consideration anyone gives to the phrase probably varies, since the Pledge itself is a patriotic observance focused primarily on the flag and the Nation, and only secondarily on the description of the Nation.

				The phrase under God in the Pledge seems, as a historical matter, to sum up the attitude of the Nations leaders, and to manifest itself in many of our public observances.  Examples of patriotic invocations of God and official acknowledgments of religions role in our Nations history abound.

				The motto In God We Trust first appeared on the countrys coins during the Civil War.  Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P.

The motto was placed on more and more denominations, and since 1938 all United States coins bear the motto.  Paper currency followed suit at a slower pace; Federal Reserve notes were so inscribed during the decade of the 1960s.

				As pointed out by the Court, California law requires public elementary schools to conduc[t] … appropriate patriotic exercises at the beginning of the schoolday, and notes that the giving of the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America shall satisfy the requirements of this section.  Cal. Educ. Code Ann. §52720 (West 1989).  The School District complies with this requirement by instructing that [e]ach elementary school class recite the [P]ledge of [A]llegiance to the [F]lag once each day.  App. 149150.

The ceremony was begun with an invocation, and ended with a benediction, given by a local rabbi.  The Court held that even though attendance at the ceremony was voluntary, students who objected to the prayers would nonetheless feel coerced to attend and to stand during each prayer.  But the Court throughout its opinion referred to the prayer as an explicit religious exercise,

				I do not believe that the phrase under God in the Pledge converts its recital into a religious exercise of the sort described in 
				<em>

				.  Instead, it is a declaration of belief in allegiance and loyalty to the United States flag and the Republic that it represents.  The phrase under God is in no sense a prayer, nor an endorsement of any religion, but a simple recognition of the fact noted in H. R. Rep. No. 1693, at 2: From the time of our earliest history our peoples and our institutions have reflected the traditional concept that our Nation was founded on a fundamental belief in God.  Reciting the Pledge, or listening to others recite it, is a patriotic exercise, not a religious one; participants promise fidelity to our flag and our Nation, not to any particular God, faith, or church.

				There is no doubt that respondent is sincere in his atheism and rejection of a belief in God.  But the mere fact that he disagrees with this part of the Pledge does not give him a veto power over the decision of the public schools that willing participants should pledge allegiance to the flag in the manner prescribed by Congress.  There may be others who disagree, not with the phrase under God, but with the phrase with liberty and justice for all.  But surely that would not give such objectors the right to veto the holding of such a ceremony by those willing to participate.  Only if it can be said that the phrase under God somehow tends to the establishment of a religion in violation of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> can respondents claim succeed, where one based on objections to with liberty and justice for all fails.  Our cases have broadly interpreted this phrase, but none have gone anywhere near as far as the decision of the Court of Appeals in this case.  The recital, in a patriotic ceremony pledging allegiance to the flag and to the Nation, of the descriptive phrase under God cannot possibly lead to the establishment of a religion, or anything like it.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				When courts extend constitutional prohibitions beyond their previously recognized limit, they may restrict democratic choices made by public bodies.  Here, Congress prescribed a Pledge of Allegiance, the State of California required patriotic observances in its schools, and the School District chose to comply by requiring teacher-led recital of the Pledge of Allegiance by willing students.  Thus, we have three levels of popular governmentthe national, the state, and the localcollaborating to produce the Elk Grove ceremony.  The Constitution only requires that schoolchildren be entitled to abstain from the ceremony if they chose to do so.  To give the parent of such a child a sort of hecklers veto over a patriotic ceremony willingly participated in by other students, simply because the Pledge of Allegiance contains the descriptive phrase under God, is an unwarranted extension of the Establishment Clause, an extension which would have the unfortunate effect of prohibiting a commendable patriotic observance.

Barnette involved a board of education policy that compelled students to recite the Pledge.  319 U. S., at 629.  There was no opportunity to opt out, as there is in the present case.   Failure to conform [was] insubordination dealt with by expulsion.  Readmission [was] denied by statute until compliance.  Meanwhile the expelled child [was] unlawfully absent and [could] be proceeded against as a delinquent.  His parents or guardians [were] liable to prosecution, and if convicted [were] subject to a fine not exceeding $50 and jail term not exceeding thirty days.  Ibid. (footnotes omitted).  I think there is a clear difference between compulsion (Barnette) and coercion (Lee).  Compulsion, after Barnette, is not permissible, and it is not an issue in this case.  And whatever the virtues and vices of Lee, the Court was concerned only with formal religious exercise[s], 505 U. S., at 589, which the Pledge is not.

				The Court today erects a novel prudential standing principle in order to avoid reaching the merits of the constitutional claim.  I dissent from that ruling.  On the merits, I conclude that the Elk Grove Unified School District (School District) policy that requires teachers to lead willing students in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance, which includes the words under God, does not violate the Establishment Clause of the

				 at 78.  To be clear, the Court does not dispute that respondent Newdow (hereinafter respondent) satisfies the requisites of Article III standing.  But curiously the Court incorporates criticism of the Court of Appeals Article III standing decision into its justification for its novel prudential standing principle.  The Court concludes that respondent lacks prudential standing, under its new standing principle, to bring his suit in federal court.

 (Standing doctrine embraces several judicially self-imposed limits on the exercise of federal jurisdiction, such as the general prohibition on a litigants raising another persons legal rights …).  In contrast, here is the Courts new prudential standing principle: [I]t is improper for the federal courts to entertain a claim by a plaintiff whose standing to sue is founded on family law rights that are in dispute when prosecution of the lawsuit may have an adverse effect on the person who is the source of the plaintiffs claimed standing.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1332.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S.

				First, the Court relies heavily on 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Richards,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/504/689" class="subref" title="subref">504 U. S. 689</a> (1992)
, in which we discussed both the domestic relations exception and the abstention doctrine.  In 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				, the mother of two children sued her former spouse and his female companion on behalf of the children, alleging physical and sexual abuse of the children.  The lower courts declined jurisdiction based on the domestic relations exception to diversity jurisdiction and abstention under 
				<em>
					Younger
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Harris,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/401/37" class="subref" title="subref">401 U. S. 37</a> (1971)
.  We reversed, concluding that the domestic relations exception only applies when a party seeks to have a district court issue a divorce, alimony, and child custody decree, 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				, 504 U. S., at 704.  We further held that abstention was inappropriate because the status of the domestic relationship ha[d] been determined as a matter of state law, and in any event ha[d] no bearing on the underlying torts alleged, 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 706.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court first cites the domestic relations exception to support its new principle.  Then the Court relies on a quote from 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				s discussion of the abstention doctrine: We have also acknowledged that it might be appropriate for the federal courts to decline to hear a case involving elements of the domestic relationship, 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 705, even when divorce, alimony, or child custody is not strictly at issue.  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 910.  The Court perfunctorily states: [T]hus, while rare instances arise in which it is necessary to answer a substantial federal question that transcends or exists apart from the family law issue, see, 
				<em>
					e.g., Palmore
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Sidoti,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/466/429" class="subref" title="subref">466 U. S. 429</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">432</a>434 (1984)
, in general it is appropriate for the federal courts to leave delicate issues of domestic relations to the state courts.  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 9.  That conclusion does not follow from 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				s
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				discussion of the domestic relations exception and abstention; even if it did, it would not be applicable in this case because, on the merits, this case presents a substantial federal question that transcends the family law issue to a greater extent than 
				<em>
					Palmore
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The domestic relations exception is not a prudential limitation on our federal jurisdiction.  It is a limiting construction of the statute defining federal diversity jurisdiction, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1332.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1332</a>, which divests the federal courts of power to issue divorce, alimony, and child custody decrees, 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt,
				</em>
				 504
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				U. S., at 703.  This case does not involve diversity jurisdiction, and respondent does not ask this Court to issue a divorce, alimony, or child custody decree.  Instead it involves a substantial federal question about the constitutionality of the School Districts conducting the pledge ceremony, which is the source of our jurisdiction.  Therefore, the domestic relations exception to diversity jurisdiction forms no basis for denying standing to respondent.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				When we discussed abstention in 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				, we first noted that [a]bstention rarely should be invoked, because the federal courts have a virtually unflagging obligation … to exercise the jurisdiction given them.   
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 705 (quoting 
				<em>
					Colorado River Water Conservation Dist.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					United States,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/424/800" class="subref" title="subref">424 U. S. 800</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">817</a> (1976)
).  
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				s discussion of abstention by no means supports the proposition that only in the rare instances where a substantial federal question … transcends or exists apart from the family law issue, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				9, should federal courts decide the federal issue.  As in 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				, the status of the domestic relationship has been determined as a matter of state law, and in any event has no bearing on the underlying [constitutional violation] alleged.  504 U. S., at 706.  Sandra Banning and respondent now share joint custody of their daughter, respondent retains the right to expose his daughter to his religious views, and the state of their domestic affairs has nothing to do with the underlying constitutional claim.  Abstention forms no basis for denying respondent standing.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court cites
				<em>
					 Palmore
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Sidoti,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/466/429" class="subref" title="subref">466 U. S. 429</a> (1984)
, as an example of the exceptional case where a substantial federal question that transcends or exists apart from the family law issue makes the exercise of our jurisdiction appropriate.  
				<em>
					Ante, 
				</em>
				at 9.  In 
				<em>
					Palmore
				</em>
				, we granted certiorari to review a child custody decision, and reversed the state courts decision because we found that the effects of racial prejudice resulting from the mothers interracial marriage could not justify granting custody to the father.  Contrary to the Courts assertion, the alleged constitutional violation, while clearly involving a substantial federal question, did not transcen[d] or exis[t] apart from the family law issue, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 9; it had everything to do with the domestic relationship[w]e granted certiorari to review a 
				<em>
					judgment of a state court divesting a natural mother of the custody of her infant child
				</em>
				, 466 U. S., at 430 (emphasis added).  Under the Courts discussion today, it appears that we should have stayed out of the domestic dispute in 
				<em>
					Palmore 
				</em>
				no matter how constitutionally offensive the result would have been.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Finally, it seems the Court bases its new prudential standing principle, in part, on criticisms of the Court of Appeals construction of state law, coupled with the prudential principle prohibiting third-party standing.  In the Court of Appeals original opinion, it held unanimously that respondent satisfied the Article III standing requirements, stating respondent has standing as a parent to challenge a practice that interferes with his right to direct the education of his daughter.  
				<em>
					Newdow 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					United States Congress
				</em>
				, 292 F. 3d 597, 602 (CA9 2002).  After Banning moved for leave to intervene, the Court of Appeals reexamined respondents standing to determine whether the parents court-ordered custodial arrangement altered respondents standing.  
				<em>
					Newdow 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					United States Congress
				</em>
				, 313 F. 3d 500 (CA9 2002).  The court examined whether respondent could assert an injury in fact by asking whether, under California law, noncustodial parents maintain the right to expose and educate their children to their individual religious views, even if those religious views contradict those of the custodial parent.

            <em>
					Id.

				, at 504.  The Court of Appeals again unanimously concluded that the respondent satisfied Article III standing, despite the custody order, because he retained sufficient parental rights under California law.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court, contrary to the Court of Appeals interpretation of California case law, concludes that respondent requests relief that is more ambitious than that sought in 
				<em>
					Mentry 
				</em>
				and 
				<em>
					Murga
				</em>
				 because he seeks to restrain the act of a third party outside the parent-child sphere.  
				<em>

				<em>
					de novo
				</em>
				 construction of California law.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The correct characterization of respondents interest rests on the interpretation of state law.  As the Court recognizes,

				at 11, we have a settled and firm policy of deferring to regional courts of appeals in matters that involve the construction of state law.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				The Court does not take issue with the fact that, under California law, respondent retains a right to influence his daughters religious upbringing and to expose her to his views.  But it relies on Bannings view of the merits of this case to diminish respondents interest, stating that the respondent wishes to forestall his daughters exposure to religious ideas that her mother, who wields a form of veto power, endorses, and to use his parental status to challenge the influences to which his daughter may be exposed in school when he and Banning disagree.  Ante,
				 at
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				13.  As alleged by respondent and as recognized by the Court of Appeals, respondent wishes to enjoin the School District from endorsing a form of religion inconsistent with his own views because he has a right to expose his daughter to those views without the States placing its 
				<em>
					imprimatur
				</em>
				 on a particular religion.  Under the Court of Appeals construction of California law, Bannings veto power does not override respondents right to challenge the pledge ceremony.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court concludes that the California cases do not stand for the proposition that [respondent] has a right to dictate to others what they may or may not say to his child respecting religion.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  Surely, under California case law and the current custody order, respondent may not tell Banning what she may say to their child respecting religion, and respondent does not seek to.  Just as surely, respondent cannot name his daughter as a party to a lawsuit against Bannings wishes.  But his claim is different: Respondent does not seek to tell just anyone what he or she may say to his daughter, and he does not seek to vindicate solely her rights.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Respondent asserts that the School Districts pledge ceremony infringes his right under California law to expose his daughter to his religious views.  While she is intimately associated with the source of respondents standing (the father-daughter relationship and respondents rights thereunder), the daughter 
				<em>
					is not the source 
				</em>
				of respondents standing; instead it is their relationship that provides respondent his standing, which is clear once respondents interest is properly described.

As part of an overall effort to codify and emphasize existing rules and customs pertaining to the display and use of the flag of the United States of America, see H. R. Rep. No. 2047, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., 1 (1942); S. Rep. No. 1477, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., 1 (1942), Congress enacted the Pledge on June 22, 1942.  Pub. L. 623, ch. 435, §7,

<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">68</a>Stat.
249.  The amendments sponsor, Representative Rabaut, said its purpose was to contrast this countrys belief in God with the Soviet Unions embrace of atheism.  100 Cong. Rec. 1700 (1954).  We do not know what other Members of Congress thought about the purpose of the amendment.  Following the decision of the Court of Appeals in this case, Congress passed legislation that made extensive findings about the historic role of religion in the political development of the Nation and reaffirmed the text of the Pledge.  Act of Nov. 13, 2002, Pub. L. 107293, §§12, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">116</a>Stat.
20572060.  To the millions of people who regularly recite the Pledge, and who have no access to, or concern with, such legislation or legislative history, under God might mean several different things: that God has guided the destiny of the United States, for example, or that the United States exists under Gods authority.  How much consideration anyone gives to the phrase probably varies, since the Pledge itself is a patriotic observance focused primarily on the flag and the Nation, and only secondarily on the description of the Nation.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The phrase under God in the Pledge seems, as a historical matter, to sum up the attitude of the Nations leaders, and to manifest itself in many of our public observances.  Examples of patriotic invocations of God and official acknowledgments of religions role in our Nations history abound.

To such a task we can dedicate our lives and our fortunes, everything that we are and everything that we have, with the pride of those who know that the day has come when America is privileged to spend her blood and her might for the principles that gave her birth and happiness and the peace which she has treasured.

				The motto In God We Trust first appeared on the countrys coins during the Civil War.  Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase, acting under the authority of an Act of Congress passed in 1864, prescribed that the motto should appear on the two cent coin.  The motto was placed on more and more denominations, and since 1938 all United States coins bear the motto.  Paper currency followed suit at a slower pace; Federal Reserve notes were so inscribed during the decade of the 1960s.  Meanwhile, in 1956, Congress declared that the motto of the United States would be In God We Trust.  Act of July 30, 1956, ch. 795,

				All of these events strongly suggest that our national culture allows public recognition of our Nations religious history and character.  In the words of the House Report that accompanied the insertion of the phrase under God in the Pledge: From the time of our earliest history our peoples and our institutions have reflected the traditional concept that our Nation was founded on a fundamental belief in God.  H. R. Rep. No. 1693, 83d Cong., 2d Sess., 2 (1954).  Giving additional support to this idea is our national anthem The Star-Spangled Banner, adopted as such by Congress in 1931.

				As pointed out by the Court, California law requires public elementary schools to conduc[t] … appropriate patriotic exercises at the beginning of the schoolday, and notes that the giving of the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America shall satisfy the requirements of this section.  Cal. Educ. Code Ann. §52720 (West 1989).  The School District complies with this requirement by instructing that [e]ach elementary school class recite the [P]ledge of [A]llegiance to the [F]lag once each day.  App. 149150.  Students who object on religious (or other) grounds may abstain from the recitation.

The ceremony was begun with an invocation, and ended with a benediction, given by a local rabbi.  The Court held that even though attendance at the ceremony was voluntary, students who objected to the prayers would nonetheless feel coerced to attend and to stand during each prayer.  But the Court throughout its opinion referred to the prayer as an explicit religious exercise,

				I do not believe that the phrase under God in the Pledge converts its recital into a religious exercise of the sort described in 
				<em>
					Lee
				</em>
				.  Instead, it is a declaration of belief in allegiance and loyalty to the United States flag and the Republic that it represents.  The phrase under God is in no sense a prayer, nor an endorsement of any religion, but a simple recognition of the fact noted in H. R. Rep. No. 1693, at 2: From the time of our earliest history our peoples and our institutions have reflected the traditional concept that our Nation was founded on a fundamental belief in God.  Reciting the Pledge, or listening to others recite it, is a patriotic exercise, not a religious one; participants promise fidelity to our flag and our Nation, not to any particular God, faith, or church.

				There is no doubt that respondent is sincere in his atheism and rejection of a belief in God.  But the mere fact that he disagrees with this part of the Pledge does not give him a veto power over the decision of the public schools that willing participants should pledge allegiance to the flag in the manner prescribed by Congress.  There may be others who disagree, not with the phrase under God, but with the phrase with liberty and justice for all.  But surely that would not give such objectors the right to veto the holding of such a ceremony by those willing to participate.  Only if it can be said that the phrase under God somehow tends to the establishment of a religion in violation of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> can respondents claim succeed, where one based on objections to with liberty and justice for all fails.  Our cases have broadly interpreted this phrase, but none have gone anywhere near as far as the decision of the Court of Appeals in this case.  The recital, in a patriotic ceremony pledging allegiance to the flag and to the Nation, of the descriptive phrase under God cannot possibly lead to the establishment of a religion, or anything like it.

				When courts extend constitutional prohibitions beyond their previously recognized limit, they may restrict democratic choices made by public bodies.  Here, Congress prescribed a Pledge of Allegiance, the State of California required patriotic observances in its schools, and the School District chose to comply by requiring teacher-led recital of the Pledge of Allegiance by willing students.  Thus, we have three levels of popular governmentthe national, the state, and the localcollaborating to produce the Elk Grove ceremony.  The Constitution only requires that schoolchildren be entitled to abstain from the ceremony if they chose to do so.  To give the parent of such a child a sort of hecklers veto over a patriotic ceremony willingly participated in by other students, simply because the Pledge of Allegiance contains the descriptive phrase under God, is an unwarranted extension of the Establishment Clause, an extension which would have the unfortunate effect of prohibiting a commendable patriotic observance.

						 Also as properly described, it is clear that this is not the same as a next-friend suit.  The Court relies on the fact that respondent [was] deprived under California law of the right to sue as next friend.  Ante, at 14.  The same Superior Court that determined that respondent could not sue as next friend stated:


 To the extent that by not naming her you have … an individual right as a parent to say that, not only for all the children of the world but inmine in particular, I believe that this childmy child is being harmed, but the child is … not actually part of the suit, I dont know that theres any way that this court could preclude that.   App. to Brief for Respondent Newdow B4.


The California court did not reject Newdows right as distinct from his daughters, and we should not either.

, coercion is present in the School District policy.  Post, at 35 (opinion concurring in judgment).  I cannot agree.  Barnette involved a board of education policy that compelled students to recite the Pledge.  319 U. S., at 629.  There was no opportunity to opt out, as there is in the present case.   Failure to conform [was] insubordination dealt with by expulsion.  Readmission [was] denied by statute until compliance.  Meanwhile the expelled child [was] unlawfully absent and [could] be proceeded against as a delinquent.  His parents or guardians [were] liable to prosecution, and if convicted [were] subject to a fine not exceeding $50 and jail term not exceeding thirty days.  Ibid. (footnotes omitted).  I think there is a clear difference between compulsion (Barnette) and coercion (Lee).  Compulsion, after Barnette, is not permissible, and it is not an issue in this case.  And whatever the virtues and vices of Lee, the Court was concerned only with formal religious exercise[s], 505 U. S., at 589, which the Pledge is not.

				The Court today erects a novel prudential standing principle in order to avoid reaching the merits of the constitutional claim.  I dissent from that ruling.  On the merits, I conclude that the Elk Grove Unified School District (School District) policy that requires teachers to lead willing students in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance, which includes the words under God, does not violate the Establishment Clause of the

				<em>
					Ante,

				 at 78.  To be clear, the Court does not dispute that respondent Newdow (hereinafter respondent) satisfies the requisites of Article III standing.  But curiously the Court incorporates criticism of the Court of Appeals Article III standing decision into its justification for its novel prudential standing principle.  The Court concludes that respondent lacks prudential standing, under its new standing principle, to bring his suit in federal court.

 (Standing doctrine embraces several judicially self-imposed limits on the exercise of federal jurisdiction, such as the general prohibition on a litigants raising another persons legal rights …).  In contrast, here is the Courts new prudential standing principle: [I]t is improper for the federal courts to entertain a claim by a plaintiff whose standing to sue is founded on family law rights that are in dispute when prosecution of the lawsuit may have an adverse effect on the person who is the source of the plaintiffs claimed standing.

				First, the Court relies heavily on 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Richards,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/504/689" class="subref" title="subref">504 U. S. 689</a> (1992)
, in which we discussed both the domestic relations exception and the abstention doctrine.  In 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				, the mother of two children sued her former spouse and his female companion on behalf of the children, alleging physical and sexual abuse of the children.  The lower courts declined jurisdiction based on the domestic relations exception to diversity jurisdiction and abstention under 
				<em>
					Younger
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Harris,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/401/37" class="subref" title="subref">401 U. S. 37</a> (1971)
.  We reversed, concluding that the domestic relations exception only applies when a party seeks to have a district court issue a divorce, alimony, and child custody decree, 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				, 504 U. S., at 704.  We further held that abstention was inappropriate because the status of the domestic relationship ha[d] been determined as a matter of state law, and in any event ha[d] no bearing on the underlying torts alleged, 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 706.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court first cites the domestic relations exception to support its new principle.  Then the Court relies on a quote from 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				s discussion of the abstention doctrine: We have also acknowledged that it might be appropriate for the federal courts to decline to hear a case involving elements of the domestic relationship, 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 705, even when divorce, alimony, or child custody is not strictly at issue.  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 910.  The Court perfunctorily states: [T]hus, while rare instances arise in which it is necessary to answer a substantial federal question that transcends or exists apart from the family law issue, see, 
				<em>
					e.g., Palmore
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Sidoti,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/466/429" class="subref" title="subref">466 U. S. 429</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">432</a>434 (1984)
, in general it is appropriate for the federal courts to leave delicate issues of domestic relations to the state courts.  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 9.  That conclusion does not follow from 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				s
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				discussion of the domestic relations exception and abstention; even if it did, it would not be applicable in this case because, on the merits, this case presents a substantial federal question that transcends the family law issue to a greater extent than 
				<em>
					Palmore
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The domestic relations exception is not a prudential limitation on our federal jurisdiction.  It is a limiting construction of the statute defining federal diversity jurisdiction, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1332.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1332</a>, which divests the federal courts of power to issue divorce, alimony, and child custody decrees, 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt,
				</em>
				 504
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				U. S., at 703.  This case does not involve diversity jurisdiction, and respondent does not ask this Court to issue a divorce, alimony, or child custody decree.  Instead it involves a substantial federal question about the constitutionality of the School Districts conducting the pledge ceremony, which is the source of our jurisdiction.  Therefore, the domestic relations exception to diversity jurisdiction forms no basis for denying standing to respondent.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				When we discussed abstention in 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				, we first noted that [a]bstention rarely should be invoked, because the federal courts have a virtually unflagging obligation … to exercise the jurisdiction given them.   
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 705 (quoting 
				<em>
					Colorado River Water Conservation Dist.

				 v.

					United States,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">817</a> (1976)
).  
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				s discussion of abstention by no means supports the proposition that only in the rare instances where a substantial federal question … transcends or exists apart from the family law issue, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				9, should federal courts decide the federal issue.  As in 
				<em>
					Ankenbrandt
				</em>
				, the status of the domestic relationship has been determined as a matter of state law, and in any event has no bearing on the underlying [constitutional violation] alleged.  504 U. S., at 706.  Sandra Banning and respondent now share joint custody of their daughter, respondent retains the right to expose his daughter to his religious views, and the state of their domestic affairs has nothing to do with the underlying constitutional claim.  Abstention forms no basis for denying respondent standing.

, as an example of the exceptional case where a substantial federal question that transcends or exists apart from the family law issue makes the exercise of our jurisdiction appropriate.  
				<em>
					Ante, 
				</em>
				at 9.  In 
				<em>
					Palmore
				</em>
				, we granted certiorari to review a child custody decision, and reversed the state courts decision because we found that the effects of racial prejudice resulting from the mothers interracial marriage could not justify granting custody to the father.  Contrary to the Courts assertion, the alleged constitutional violation, while clearly involving a substantial federal question, did not transcen[d] or exis[t] apart from the family law issue, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 9; it had everything to do with the domestic relationship[w]e granted certiorari to review a 
				<em>
					judgment of a state court divesting a natural mother of the custody of her infant child
				</em>
				, 466 U. S., at 430 (emphasis added).  Under the Courts discussion today, it appears that we should have stayed out of the domestic dispute in 
				<em>
					Palmore 
				</em>
				no matter how constitutionally offensive the result would have been.

				Finally, it seems the Court bases its new prudential standing principle, in part, on criticisms of the Court of Appeals construction of state law, coupled with the prudential principle prohibiting third-party standing.  In the Court of Appeals original opinion, it held unanimously that respondent satisfied the Article III standing requirements, stating respondent has standing as a parent to challenge a practice that interferes with his right to direct the education of his daughter.  
				<em>

				v. 
				<em>

				, 292 F. 3d 597, 602 (CA9 2002).  After Banning moved for leave to intervene, the Court of Appeals reexamined respondents standing to determine whether the parents court-ordered custodial arrangement altered respondents standing.  
				<em>
					Newdow 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>

				, 313 F. 3d 500 (CA9 2002).  The court examined whether respondent could assert an injury in fact by asking whether, under California law, noncustodial parents maintain the right to expose and educate their children to their individual religious views, even if those religious views contradict those of the custodial parent.

				The Court does not take issue with the fact that, under California law, respondent retains a right to influence his daughters religious upbringing and to expose her to his views.  But it relies on Bannings view of the merits of this case to diminish respondents interest, stating that the respondent wishes to forestall his daughters exposure to religious ideas that her mother, who wields a form of veto power, endorses, and to use his parental status to challenge the influences to which his daughter may be exposed in school when he and Banning disagree.  Ante,
				 at
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				13.  As alleged by respondent and as recognized by the Court of Appeals, respondent wishes to enjoin the School District from endorsing a form of religion inconsistent with his own views because he has a right to expose his daughter to those views without the States placing its 
				<em>
					imprimatur
				</em>
				 on a particular religion.  Under the Court of Appeals construction of California law, Bannings veto power does not override respondents right to challenge the pledge ceremony.

				The Court concludes that the California cases do not stand for the proposition that [respondent] has a right to dictate to others what they may or may not say to his child respecting religion.  
				<em>

				.  Surely, under California case law and the current custody order, respondent may not tell Banning what she may say to their child respecting religion, and respondent does not seek to.  Just as surely, respondent cannot name his daughter as a party to a lawsuit against Bannings wishes.  But his claim is different: Respondent does not seek to tell just anyone what he or she may say to his daughter, and he does not seek to vindicate solely her rights.

				Respondent asserts that the School Districts pledge ceremony infringes his right under California law to expose his daughter to his religious views.  While she is intimately associated with the source of respondents standing (the father-daughter relationship and respondents rights thereunder), the daughter 
				<em>

As part of an overall effort to codify and emphasize existing rules and customs pertaining to the display and use of the flag of the United States of America, see H. R. Rep. No. 2047, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., 1 (1942); S. Rep. No. 1477, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., 1 (1942), Congress enacted the Pledge on June 22, 1942.  Pub. L. 623, ch. 435, §7,

249.  The amendments sponsor, Representative Rabaut, said its purpose was to contrast this countrys belief in God with the Soviet Unions embrace of atheism.  100 Cong. Rec. 1700 (1954).  We do not know what other Members of Congress thought about the purpose of the amendment.  Following the decision of the Court of Appeals in this case, Congress passed legislation that made extensive findings about the historic role of religion in the political development of the Nation and reaffirmed the text of the Pledge.  Act of Nov. 13, 2002, Pub. L. 107293, §§12, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">116</a>Stat.
20572060.  To the millions of people who regularly recite the Pledge, and who have no access to, or concern with, such legislation or legislative history, under God might mean several different things: that God has guided the destiny of the United States, for example, or that the United States exists under Gods authority.  How much consideration anyone gives to the phrase probably varies, since the Pledge itself is a patriotic observance focused primarily on the flag and the Nation, and only secondarily on the description of the Nation.

				The phrase under God in the Pledge seems, as a historical matter, to sum up the attitude of the Nations leaders, and to manifest itself in many of our public observances.  Examples of patriotic invocations of God and official acknowledgments of religions role in our Nations history abound.

				The motto In God We Trust first appeared on the countrys coins during the Civil War.  Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P.

The motto was placed on more and more denominations, and since 1938 all United States coins bear the motto.  Paper currency followed suit at a slower pace; Federal Reserve notes were so inscribed during the decade of the 1960s.

				As pointed out by the Court, California law requires public elementary schools to conduc[t] … appropriate patriotic exercises at the beginning of the schoolday, and notes that the giving of the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America shall satisfy the requirements of this section.  Cal.

The School District complies with this requirement by instructing that [e]ach elementary school class recite the [P]ledge of [A]llegiance to the [F]lag once each day.  App. 149150.

The ceremony was begun with an invocation, and ended with a benediction, given by a local rabbi.

				I do not believe that the phrase under God in the Pledge converts its recital into a religious exercise of the sort described in

				.  Instead, it is a declaration of belief in allegiance and loyalty to the United States flag and the Republic that it represents.  The phrase under God is in no sense a prayer, nor an endorsement of any religion, but a simple recognition of the fact noted in H. R. Rep. No. 1693, at 2: From the time of our earliest history our peoples and our institutions have reflected the traditional concept that our Nation was founded on a fundamental belief in God.  Reciting the Pledge, or listening to others recite it, is a patriotic exercise, not a religious one; participants promise fidelity to our flag and our Nation, not to any particular God, faith, or church.

				There is no doubt that respondent is sincere in his atheism and rejection of a belief in God.  But the mere fact that he disagrees with this part of the Pledge does not give him a veto power over the decision of the public schools that willing participants should pledge allegiance to the flag in the manner prescribed by Congress.  There may be others who disagree, not with the phrase under God, but with the phrase with liberty and justice for all.  But surely that would not give such objectors the right to veto the holding of such a ceremony by those willing to participate.  Only if it can be said that the phrase under God somehow tends to the establishment of a religion in violation of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> can respondents claim succeed, where one based on objections to with liberty and justice for all fails.  Our cases have broadly interpreted this phrase, but none have gone anywhere near as far as the decision of the Court of Appeals in this case.  The recital, in a patriotic ceremony pledging allegiance to the flag and to the Nation, of the descriptive phrase under God cannot possibly lead to the establishment of a religion, or anything like it.

				When courts extend constitutional prohibitions beyond their previously recognized limit, they may restrict democratic choices made by public bodies.  Here, Congress prescribed a Pledge of Allegiance, the State of California required patriotic observances in its schools, and the School District chose to comply by requiring teacher-led recital of the Pledge of Allegiance by willing students.  Thus, we have three levels of popular governmentthe national, the state, and the localcollaborating to produce the Elk Grove ceremony.  The Constitution only requires that schoolchildren be entitled to abstain from the ceremony if they chose to do so.  To give the parent of such a child a sort of hecklers veto over a patriotic ceremony willingly participated in by other students, simply because the Pledge of Allegiance contains the descriptive phrase under God, is an unwarranted extension of the Establishment Clause, an extension which would have the unfortunate effect of prohibiting a commendable patriotic observance.

						 Also as properly described, it is clear that this is not the same as a next-friend suit.

						 Justice Thomas concludes, based partly on West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/319/624" class="subref" title="subref">319 U. S. 624</a> (1943)
, that Lee v. Weisman, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/505/577" class="subref" title="subref">505 U. S. 577</a> (1992)
, coercion is present in the School District policy.  Post, at 35 (opinion concurring in judgment).  I cannot agree.  Barnette involved a board of education policy that compelled students to recite the Pledge.  319 U. S., at 629.  There was no opportunity to opt out, as there is in the present case.   Failure to conform [was] insubordination dealt with by expulsion.  Readmission [was] denied by statute until compliance.  Meanwhile the expelled child [was] unlawfully absent and [could] be proceeded against as a delinquent.  His parents or guardians [were] liable to prosecution, and if convicted [were] subject to a fine not exceeding $50 and jail term not exceeding thirty days.  Ibid. (footnotes omitted).  I think there is a clear difference between compulsion (Barnette) and coercion (Lee).  Compulsion, after Barnette, is not permissible, and it is not an issue in this case.  And whatever the virtues and vices of Lee, the Court was concerned only with formal religious exercise[s], 505 U. S., at 589, which the Pledge is not.

				The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the grant of habeas relief to respondent Gregory Esparza after concluding that, because the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentviii" class="subref" title="subref">Eighth Amendment</a> requires the State to narrow the class of death eligible defendants, the Ohio Court of Appeals had improperly subjected respondents claims to harmless-error review.  310 F. 3d 414 (2002).  This decision ignores the limits imposed on federal habeas review by 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2254.html#d" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2254(d)</a>, and we therefore grant the petition for certiorari and reverse.

				In February 1983, respondent Esparza entered a store in Toledo, Ohio, and approached two employees, Melanie Gerschultz and James Barailloux.  No one else was in the store.  At gunpoint, he ordered Gerschultz to open the cash register.  Barailloux meanwhile fled the store through a rear door, entering the attached home of the storeowner, Evelyn Krieger.  As Barailloux was alerting Krieger to the robbery, he heard a gunshot.  Barailloux and Krieger returned to the store and found Gerschultz lying on the floor, fatally wounded by a single gunshot to her neck.  The cash register was open and approximately $110 was missing.

				Respondent was charged with aggravated murder during the commission of an aggravated robbery, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §2903.01 (Anderson 2002), and aggravated robbery, §2911.01.  He was convicted on both counts, and the trial judge accepted the jurys recommendation that he be sentenced to death for the murder conviction.  The trial judge additionally sentenced respondent to 7 to 25 years imprisonment for aggravated robbery, plus 3 years for the firearm specification.  The Ohio Supreme Court affirmed the convictions and the sentences.

				On state postconviction review, respondent argued, for the first time, that he had not been convicted of an offense for which a death sentence could be imposed under Ohio law.  Although the indictment charged him with aggravated murder in the course of committing aggravated robbery, it did not charge him as a principal offender.

				  The Ohio Court of Appeals rejected his claim, holding that literal compliance with the statute was not required: [W]here only one defendant is named in an indictment alleging felony murder, it would be redundant to state that the defendant is being charged as a principal offender.  Only where more than one defendant is named need the indictment specify the allegation principal offender. 

				Respondent then filed a second petition for state postconviction relief alleging, 
				<em>

				, ineffective assistance of appellate counsel because his attorney did not argue that the States failure to comply with its sentencing procedures violated the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentviii" class="subref" title="subref">Eighth Amendment</a>.  The Ohio Court of Appeals in a conclusory opinion denied his claim, referring back to its previous decision.

The import of the courts decision was clear: Respondent failed to prove he was prejudiced because any error committed by counsel was harmless.  In respondents words, The state court … determined that since [respondent] was the only individual charged, the jury must have determined that [respondent] was the principal offender.  Brief in Opposition 2.

				Having exhausted his avenues for relief under state law, respondent filed a habeas petition in the District Court for the Northern District of Ohio.  The District Court concluded that the Ohio Court of Appeals decision was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law because it was contrary to our opinions in

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentviii" class="subref" title="subref">Eighth Amendment</a> precluded respondents death sentence and that harmless-error review was inappropriate.  The State of Ohio petitioned for a writ of certiorari, which we now grant, along with respondents motion for leave to proceed

				A federal court may grant a state habeas petitioner relief for a claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court only if that adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.

				According to the Sixth Circuit, Ohios failure to charge in the indictment that respondent was a principal was the functional equivalent of dispensing with the reasonable doubt requirement.  310 F. 3d, at 421 (citing

At gunpoint, he ordered Gerschultz to open the cash register.  Barailloux meanwhile fled the store through a rear door, entering the attached home of the storeowner, Evelyn Krieger.  As Barailloux was alerting Krieger to the robbery, he heard a gunshot.  Barailloux and Krieger returned to the store and found Gerschultz lying on the floor, fatally wounded by a single gunshot to her neck.  The cash register was open and approximately $110 was missing.

				Respondent was charged with aggravated murder during the commission of an aggravated robbery, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §2903.01 (Anderson 2002), and aggravated robbery, §2911.01.  He was convicted on both counts, and the trial judge accepted the jurys recommendation that he be sentenced to death for the murder conviction.  The trial judge additionally sentenced respondent to 7 to 25 years imprisonment for aggravated robbery, plus 3 years for the firearm specification.  The Ohio Supreme Court affirmed the convictions and the sentences.

				On state postconviction review, respondent argued, for the first time, that he had not been convicted of an offense for which a death sentence could be imposed under Ohio law.  Although the indictment charged him with aggravated murder in the course of committing aggravated robbery, it did not charge him as a principal offender.

				  The Ohio Court of Appeals rejected his claim, holding that literal compliance with the statute was not required: [W]here only one defendant is named in an indictment alleging felony murder, it would be redundant to state that the defendant is being charged as a principal offender.  Only where more than one defendant is named need the indictment specify the allegation principal offender. 

				The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the grant of habeas relief to respondent Gregory Esparza after concluding that, because the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentviii" class="subref" title="subref">Eighth Amendment</a> requires the State to narrow the class of death eligible defendants, the Ohio Court of Appeals had improperly subjected respondents claims to harmless-error review.  310 F. 3d 414 (2002).

				In February 1983, respondent Esparza entered a store in Toledo, Ohio, and approached two employees, Melanie Gerschultz and James Barailloux.  No one else was in the store.  At gunpoint, he ordered Gerschultz to open the cash register.  Barailloux meanwhile fled the store through a rear door, entering the attached home of the storeowner, Evelyn Krieger.  As Barailloux was alerting Krieger to the robbery, he heard a gunshot.  Barailloux and Krieger returned to the store and found Gerschultz lying on the floor, fatally wounded by a single gunshot to her neck.  The cash register was open and approximately $110 was missing.

				Respondent was charged with aggravated murder during the commission of an aggravated robbery, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §2903.01 (Anderson 2002), and aggravated robbery, §2911.01.  He was convicted on both counts, and the trial judge accepted the jurys recommendation that he be sentenced to death for the murder conviction.  The trial judge additionally sentenced respondent to 7 to 25 years imprisonment for aggravated robbery, plus 3 years for the firearm specification.  The Ohio Supreme Court affirmed the convictions and the sentences.

Presnell, however, relied on the defendants lack of notice and his inability to defend himself, not a faulty indictment or an incomplete jury instruction.

				The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the grant of habeas relief to respondent Gregory Esparza after concluding that, because the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentviii" class="subref" title="subref">Eighth Amendment</a> requires the State to narrow the class of death eligible defendants, the Ohio Court of Appeals had improperly subjected respondents claims to harmless-error review.  310 F. 3d 414 (2002).

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2254.html#d" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2254(d)</a>, and we therefore grant the petition for certiorari and reverse.

				In February 1983, respondent Esparza entered a store in Toledo, Ohio, and approached two employees, Melanie Gerschultz and James Barailloux.  No one else was in the store.  At gunpoint, he ordered Gerschultz to open the cash register.  Barailloux meanwhile fled the store through a rear door, entering the attached home of the storeowner, Evelyn Krieger.  As Barailloux was alerting Krieger to the robbery, he heard a gunshot.  Barailloux and Krieger returned to the store and found Gerschultz lying on the floor, fatally wounded by a single gunshot to her neck.  The cash register was open and approximately $110 was missing.

				Respondent was charged with aggravated murder during the commission of an aggravated robbery, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §2903.01 (Anderson 2002), and aggravated robbery, §2911.01.  He was convicted on both counts, and the trial judge accepted the jurys recommendation that he be sentenced to death for the murder conviction.  The trial judge additionally sentenced respondent to 7 to 25 years imprisonment for aggravated robbery, plus 3 years for the firearm specification.  The Ohio Supreme Court affirmed the convictions and the sentences.

				On state postconviction review, respondent argued, for the first time, that he had not been convicted of an offense for which a death sentence could be imposed under Ohio law.

In Presnell, we held that the Georgia Supreme Court violated due process when it sustained a death sentence because the sentence was supported by the evidence, even though the defendant was unaware of the charge and the issue was never submitted to a jury.  Presnell, however, relied on the defendants lack of notice and his inability to defend himself, not a faulty indictment or an incomplete jury instruction.

				The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the grant of habeas relief to respondent Gregory Esparza after concluding that, because the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentviii" class="subref" title="subref">Eighth Amendment</a> requires the State to narrow the class of death eligible defendants, the Ohio Court of Appeals had improperly subjected respondents claims to harmless-error review.  310 F. 3d 414 (2002).

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2254.html#d" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2254(d)</a>, and we therefore grant the petition for certiorari and reverse.

				In February 1983, respondent Esparza entered a store in Toledo, Ohio, and approached two employees, Melanie Gerschultz and James Barailloux.  No one else was in the store.  At gunpoint, he ordered Gerschultz to open the cash register.  Barailloux meanwhile fled the store through a rear door, entering the attached home of the storeowner, Evelyn Krieger.  As Barailloux was alerting Krieger to the robbery, he heard a gunshot.  Barailloux and Krieger returned to the store and found Gerschultz lying on the floor, fatally wounded by a single gunshot to her neck.  The cash register was open and approximately $110 was missing.

				Respondent was charged with aggravated murder during the commission of an aggravated robbery, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §2903.01 (Anderson 2002), and aggravated robbery, §2911.01.  He was convicted on both counts, and the trial judge accepted the jurys recommendation that he be sentenced to death for the murder conviction.  The trial judge additionally sentenced respondent to 7 to 25 years imprisonment for aggravated robbery, plus 3 years for the firearm specification.  The Ohio Supreme Court affirmed the convictions and the sentences.

				On state postconviction review, respondent argued, for the first time, that he had not been convicted of an offense for which a death sentence could be imposed under Ohio law.  Although the indictment charged him with aggravated murder in the course of committing aggravated robbery, it did not charge him as a principal offender.

				  The Ohio Court of Appeals rejected his claim, holding that literal compliance with the statute was not required: [W]here only one defendant is named in an indictment alleging felony murder, it would be redundant to state that the defendant is being charged as a principal offender.  Only where more than one defendant is named need the indictment specify the allegation principal offender. 

The import of the courts decision was clear: Respondent failed to prove he was prejudiced because any error committed by counsel was harmless.

				A state courts decision is contrary to our clearly established law if it applies a rule that contradicts the  governing law set forth in our cases or if it confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of this Court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from our precedent.

The trial judge further instructed the jury that it must determine  whether the State has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense of Aggravated Murder was committed while the Defendant was committing Aggravated Robbery.   
				<em>

				.  In light of these instructions, the jury verdict would surely have been the same had it been instructed to find as well that the respondent was a principal in the offense.  After all, he was the only defendant charged in the indictment.  There was no evidence presented that anyone other than respondent was involved in the crime or present at the store.

Under these circumstances, we cannot say that the state courts conclusion that respondent was convicted of a capital offense was objectively unreasonable.  That being the case, we may not set aside its decision on habeas review.

						 Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §2929.04(A) (Anderson 2002) provides, in relevant part:


Imposition of the death penalty for aggravated murder is precluded, unless one or more of the following is specified in the indictment or count in the indictment … and proved beyond a reasonable doubt:
.      .      .      .      .


(7) The offense was committed while the offender was committing, attempting to commit, or fleeing immediately after committing or attempting to commit … aggravated robbery, … and either the offender was the principal offender in the commission of the aggravated murder or, if not the principal offender, committed the aggravated murder with prior calculation and design.

 (per curiam), a due process case, noting that rather than remand for a harmless-error analysis, we simply reversed.  In Presnell, we held that the Georgia Supreme Court violated due process when it sustained a death sentence because the sentence was supported by the evidence, even though the defendant was unaware of the charge and the issue was never submitted to a jury.  Presnell, however, relied on the defendants lack of notice and his inability to defend himself, not a faulty indictment or an incomplete jury instruction.

						 The Court of Appeals noted evidence brought to light for the first time in the habeas proceeding in the District Court that suggested there might have been another participant in the crime, Joe Jasso.  The jury, however, was not presented with this evidence at trial, and thus it has no bearing on the correctness of the Ohio Court of Appeals decision that the State need not charge a defendant as a principal offender if the failure to so charge is harmless error.

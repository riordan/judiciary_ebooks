				The Firearms Owners Protection Act (FOPA) added

				<em>
					inter alia,
				</em>
				 §922(a)(1)(A), which forbids dealing in firearms without a federal license.  The evidence at petitioners unlicensed dealing trial was adequate to prove that he was dealing in firearms and that he knew his conduct was unlawful, but there was no evidence that he was aware of the federal licensing requirement.  The trial judge refused to instruct the jury that he could be convicted only if he knew of the federal licensing requirement, instructing, instead, that a person acts willfully if he acts with the bad purpose to disobey or disregard the law, but that he need not be aware of the specific law that his conduct may be violating.  The jury found petitioner guilty.  The Second Circuit affirmed, concluding that the instructions were proper and that the Government had elicited ample proof that petitioner had acted willfully.  
			</p>
        <p class="SYLCTE">
            <em>
					Held:&lt;unicode value="8194"&gt; 
				</em>
				The term willfully in §924(a)(1)(D) requires proof only that the defendant knew his conduct was unlawful, not that he also knew of the federal licensing requirement.  Pp. 611. 
			</p>
        <p class="SYLCTF">
				
				    
				(a) When used in the criminal context, a willful act is generally one undertaken with a bad purpose.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Heikkinen
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					United States,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/355/273" class="subref" title="subref">355 U. S. 273</a>.  In other words, to establish a willful violation of a statute, the Government must prove that the defendant acted with knowledge that his conduct was unlawful.  
				<em>
					Ratzlaf
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/510/135" class="subref" title="subref">510 U. S. 135</a>.  The Court rejects petitioners argument that, for two principal reasons, a more particularized showing is required here.  His first contentionthat the knowingly requirement in §§924(a)(1)(A)(C) for three categories of acts made unlawful by §922 demonstrates that the Government must prove knowledge of the lawis not persuasive because knowingly refers to knowledge of the facts constituting the offense, as distinguished from knowledge of the law, see, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Bailey,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/444/394" class="subref" title="subref">444 U. S. 394</a>.  With respect to the three §924 knowingly categories, the background presumption that every citizen knows the law makes it unnecessary to adduce specific evidence to prove an evil-meaning mind.  As regards the willfully category here at issue, however, the jury must find that the defendant acted with such a mind, 
				<em>
					i.e.,
				</em>
				 with knowledge that his conduct was unlawful.  Also rejected is petitioners second argument: that §924(a)(1)(D) must be read to require knowledge of the law in light of this Courts adoption of a similar interpretation in cases concerned with willful violations of the tax laws, see, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Cheek
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					United States,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/498/192" class="subref" title="subref">498 U. S. 192</a>, and the willful structuring of cash transactions to avoid a bank reporting requirement, see 
				<em>
					Ratzlaf
				</em>
				, 510 U. S., at 138, 149.  Those cases are readily distinguishable because they involved highly technical statutes that threatened to ensnare individuals engaged in apparently innocent conduct.  That danger is not present here because the jury found that this petitioner knew that his conduct was unlawful.  Pp. 611.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				(b) Petitioners additional arguments based on his reading of congressional intent are rejected.  FOPAs legislative history is too ambiguous to offer him much assistance, since his main support lies in statements made by opponents of the bill.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Schwegmann Brothers
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Calvert Distillers Corp.,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/341/384" class="subref" title="subref">341 U. S. 384</a>.  His next argumentthat, at the time FOPA was passed, the willfulness requirements in §§923(d)(1)(C)(D) had uniformly been interpreted to require knowledge of the lawis inaccurate because a number of courts had reached different conclusions.  Moreover, the cases adopting petitioners view support the notion that disregard of a known legal obligation is sufficient to establish a willful violation, but in no way make it necessary.  Petitioners final argumentthat §922(b)(3), which is governed by §924(a)(1)(D), indicates that Congress intended willfully to include knowledge of the lawfails for a similar reason.  Pp. 1215.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				(c) The trial courts misstatement of law in a jury instruction given after the correct instructions were givenspecifically, a sentence asserting that the government [need not] prove that [petitioner] had knowledge that he was breaking the lawdoes not provide a basis for reversal because (1) petitioner did not effectively object to that sentence; (2) in the context of the entire instructions, it seems unlikely that the jury was misled; (3) petitioner failed to raise this argument in the Second Circuit; and (4) this Courts grant of certiorari was limited to the narrow legal question hereinbefore decided.  Pp. 1516.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/922.html" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. §922</a> defined a number of unlawful acts; subsection (a)(1) made it unlawful for any person except a licensed dealer to engage in the business of dealing in firearms.

				  Section 923 established the federal licensing program and repeated the prohibition against dealing in firearms without a license, and §924 specified the penalties for violating any provision of this chapter.  Read literally, §924 authorized the imposition of a fine of up to $5,000 or a prison sentence of not more than five years, or both, on any person who dealt in firearms without a license even if that person believed that he or she was acting lawfully.

            </a>
				  As enacted in 1968, §922(a)(1) and §924 omitted an express scienter requirement and therefore arguably imposed strict criminal liability on every unlicensed dealer in firearms.  The 1968 Act also omitted any definition of the term engaged in the business even though that conduct was an element of the unlawful act prohibited by §922(a)(1).

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In 1986 Congress enacted the Firearms Owners Protection Act (FOPA), in part, to cure these omissions.  The findings in that statute explained that additional legislation was necessary to protect law-abiding citizens with respect to the acquisition, possession, or use of firearms for lawful purposes.

				 and amended §924 to add a scienter requirement as a condition to the imposition of penalties for most of the unlawful acts defined in §922.  For three categories of offenses the intent required is that the defendant acted knowingly; for the fourth category, which includes any other provision of this chapter, the required intent is that the defendant acted willfully.

				The jury having found petitioner guilty, we accept the Governments version of the evidence.  That evidence proved that petitioner did not have a federal license to deal in firearms; that he used so-called straw purchasers in Ohio to acquire pistols that he could not have purchased himself; that the straw purchasers made false statements when purchasing the guns; that petitioner assured the straw purchasers that he would file the serial numbers off the guns; and that he resold the guns on Brooklyn street corners known for drug dealing.

        <p class="bodytext">
				A person acts willfully if he acts intentionally and purposely and with the intent to do something the law forbids, that is, with the bad purpose to disobey or to disregard the law.

				Petitioner was found guilty on both counts.  On appeal he argued that the evidence was insufficient because there was no proof that he had knowledge of the federal licensing requirement, and that the trial judge had erred by failing to instruct the jury that such knowledge was an essential element of the offense.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  It concluded that the instructions were proper and that the Government had elicited ample proof  that petitioner had acted willfully.  App. 22.

				Petitioner argues that a more particularized showing is required in this case for two principal reasons.  First, he argues that the fact that Congress used the adverb knowingly to authorize punishment of three categories of acts made unlawful by §922 and the word willfully when it referred to unlicensed dealing in firearms demonstrates that the Government must shoulder a special burden in cases like this.  This argument is not persuasive because the term knowingly does not necessarily have any reference to a culpable state of mind or to knowledge of the law.  As Justice Jackson correctly observed, the knowledge requisite to knowing violation of a statute is factual knowledge as distinguished from knowledge of the law.

				Petitioner next argues that, at the time FOPA was passed, the willfulness requirements in other subsections of the statute§§923(d)(1)(C)(D)had uniformly been interpreted by lower courts to require knowledge of the law; petitioner argues that Congress intended that willfully should have the same meaning in §924(a)(1)(D).  As an initial matter, the lower courts had come to no such agreement.  While some courts had stated that willfulness in §923(d)(1) is satisfied by a disregard of a known legal obligation,
				<a name="ZO-26ref" href="#ZO-26" class="">

                    <b>

                </sup>
            </a>
				  Moreover, in each of the cases in which disregard of a known legal obligation was held to be sufficient to establish willfulness, it was perfectly clear from the record that the licensee had knowledge of the law

				Finally, petitioner argues that §922(b)(3), which is governed by §924(a)(1)(D)s willfulness standard, indicates that Congress intended willfully to include knowledge of the law.  Subsection 922(b)(3) prohibits licensees from selling firearms to any person who the licensee knows or has reasonable cause to believe does not reside in the licensees State, except where, 
				<em>
					inter alia
				</em>
				, the transaction fully complies with the laws of both the sellers and buyers State.  The subsection further states that the licensee shall be presumed, … in the absence of evidence to the contrary, to have had actual knowledge of the State laws and published ordinances of both States.

                </sup>
            </a>
				  Although petitioner argues that the presumption in §922(b)(3) indicates that Congress intended willfulness to require knowledge of the law for all offenses covered by §924(a)(1)(D), petitioner is mistaken.  As noted above, while disregard of a known legal obligation is certainly sufficient to establish a willful violation, it is not necessaryand nothing in §922(b)(3) contradicts this basic distinction.

				One sentence in the trial courts instructions to the jury, read by itself, contained a misstatement of the law.  In a portion of the instructions that were given after the correct statement that we have already quoted, the judge stated:  In this case, the government is not required to prove that the defendant knew that a license was required, 
				<em>
					nor is the government required to prove that he had knowledge that he was breaking the law.

				  App. 19 (emphasis added).  If the judge had added the words that required a license, the sentence would have been accurate, but as given it was not.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Nevertheless, that error does not provide a basis for reversal for four reasons.  First, petitioner did not object to that sentence, except insofar as he had argued that the jury should have been instructed that the Government had the burden of proving that he had knowledge of the federal licensing requirement.  Second, in the context of the entire instructions, it seems unlikely that the jury was misled.  See, 
				<em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">674</a>675 (1975)
.  Third, petitioner failed to raise this argument in the Court of Appeals.  Finally, our grant of certiorari was limited to the narrow legal question whether knowledge of the licensing requirement is an essential element of the offense.

						 In his opinion dissenting from the Courts decision upholding the constitutionality of a statute authorizing punishment for the knowing violation of an Interstate Commerce regulation, Justice Jackson wrote:


It is further suggested that a defendant is protected against indefiniteness because conviction is authorized only for knowing violations.  The argument seems to be that the jury can find that defendant knowingly violated the regulation only if it finds that it knew the meaning of the regulation he was accused of violating.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/325/91" class="subref" title="subref">325 U.

The proliferation of statutes and regulations has sometimes made it difficult for the average citizen to know and comprehend the extent of the duties and obligations imposed by the tax laws.  Congress has accordingly softened the impact of the common-law presumption by making specific intent to violate the law an element of certain federal criminal tax offenses.  Thus, the Court almost 60 years ago interpreted the statutory term willfully as used in the federal criminal tax statutes as carving out an exception to the traditional rule [that every person is presumed to know the law].  This special treatment of criminal tax offenses is largely due to the complexity of the tax laws.

						  Even before Ratzlaf was decided, then Chief Judge Breyer explained why there was a need for specificity under those statutes that is inapplicable when there is no danger of conviction of a defendant with an innocent state of mind.  He wrote:


I believe that criminal prosecutions for currency law violations, of the sort at issue here, very much resemble criminal prosecutions for tax law violations.  Compare 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/26/6050I.html" class="subref" title="subref">26 U. S. C. §§6050I</a> with 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/31/5322.html" class="subref" title="subref">31 U. S. C. §§5322</a>.  Both sets of laws are technical; and both sets of laws sometimes criminalize conduct that would not strike an ordinary citizen as immoral or likely unlawful.  Thus, both sets of laws may lead to the unfair result of criminally prosecuting individuals who subjectively and honestly believe they have not acted criminally.  Cheek v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/498/192" class="subref" title="subref">498 U. S. 192</a> … (1991), sets forth a legal standard that, by requiring proof that the defendant was subjectively aware of the duty at issue, would avoid such unfair results.  United States v. Aversa, 984 F. 2d 493, 502 (CA1 1993) (concurring opinion).
He therefore concluded that the same standards should apply in both the tax cases and in cases such as Ratzlaf.  984 F. 2d, at 503.

						 For example, Representative Hughes, a staunch opponent of the bill, stated that the willfulness requirement would make it next to impossible to convict dealers, particularly those who engage in business without acquiring a license, because the prosecution would have to show that the dealer was personally aware of every detail of the law, and that he made a conscious decision to violate the law.  132 Cong.

				  Section 923 established the federal licensing program and repeated the prohibition against dealing in firearms without a license, and §924 specified the penalties for violating any provision of this chapter.  Read literally, §924 authorized the imposition of a fine of up to $5,000 or a prison sentence of not more than five years, or both, on any person who dealt in firearms without a license even if that person believed that he or she was acting lawfully.

				  As enacted in 1968, §922(a)(1) and §924 omitted an express scienter requirement and therefore arguably imposed strict criminal liability on every unlicensed dealer in firearms.

				The jury having found petitioner guilty, we accept the Governments version of the evidence.  That evidence proved that petitioner did not have a federal license to deal in firearms; that he used so-called straw purchasers in Ohio to acquire pistols that he could not have purchased himself; that the straw purchasers made false statements when purchasing the guns; that petitioner assured the straw purchasers that he would file the serial numbers off the guns; and that he resold the guns on Brooklyn street corners known for drug dealing.

				Petitioner argues that a more particularized showing is required in this case for two principal reasons.  First, he argues that the fact that Congress used the adverb knowingly to authorize punishment of three categories of acts made unlawful by §922 and the word willfully when it referred to unlicensed dealing in firearms demonstrates that the Government must shoulder a special burden in cases like this.  This argument is not persuasive because the term knowingly does not necessarily have any reference to a culpable state of mind or to knowledge of the law.  As Justice Jackson correctly observed, the knowledge requisite to knowing violation of a statute is factual knowledge as distinguished from knowledge of the law.

				With respect to the three categories of conduct that are made punishable by §924 if performed knowingly, the background presumption that every citizen knows the law makes it unnecessary to adduce specific evidence to prove that an evil-meaning mind directed the evil-doing hand.

				Petitioner next argues that, at the time FOPA was passed, the willfulness requirements in other subsections of the statute§§923(d)(1)(C)(D)had uniformly been interpreted by lower courts to require knowledge of the law; petitioner argues that Congress intended that willfully should have the same meaning in §924(a)(1)(D).  As an initial matter, the lower courts had come to no such agreement.  While some courts had stated that willfulness in §923(d)(1) is satisfied by a disregard of a known legal obligation,

				  Moreover, in each of the cases in which disregard of a known legal obligation was held to be sufficient to establish willfulness, it was perfectly clear from the record that the licensee had knowledge of the law

				Finally, petitioner argues that §922(b)(3), which is governed by §924(a)(1)(D)s willfulness standard, indicates that Congress intended willfully to include knowledge of the law.  Subsection 922(b)(3) prohibits licensees from selling firearms to any person who the licensee knows or has reasonable cause to believe does not reside in the licensees State, except where, 
				<em>
					inter alia
				</em>
				, the transaction fully complies with the laws of both the sellers and buyers State.  The subsection further states that the licensee shall be presumed, … in the absence of evidence to the contrary, to have had actual knowledge of the State laws and published ordinances of both States.

            </a>
				  Although petitioner argues that the presumption in §922(b)(3) indicates that Congress intended willfulness to require knowledge of the law for all offenses covered by §924(a)(1)(D), petitioner is mistaken.  As noted above, while disregard of a known legal obligation is certainly sufficient to establish a willful violation, it is not necessaryand nothing in §922(b)(3) contradicts this basic distinction.

				One sentence in the trial courts instructions to the jury, read by itself, contained a misstatement of the law.  In a portion of the instructions that were given after the correct statement that we have already quoted, the judge stated:  In this case, the government is not required to prove that the defendant knew that a license was required, 
				<em>
					nor is the government required to prove that he had knowledge that he was breaking the law.

				Nevertheless, that error does not provide a basis for reversal for four reasons.  First, petitioner did not object to that sentence, except insofar as he had argued that the jury should have been instructed that the Government had the burden of proving that he had knowledge of the federal licensing requirement.  Second, in the context of the entire instructions, it seems unlikely that the jury was misled.  See,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">674</a>675 (1975)

						 In his opinion dissenting from the Courts decision upholding the constitutionality of a statute authorizing punishment for the knowing violation of an Interstate Commerce regulation, Justice Jackson wrote:


It is further suggested that a defendant is protected against indefiniteness because conviction is authorized only for knowing violations.  The argument seems to be that the jury can find that defendant knowingly violated the regulation only if it finds that it knew the meaning of the regulation he was accused of violating.  With the exception of Screws v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/325/91" class="subref" title="subref">325 U. S. 91</a>, which rests on a very particularized basis, the knowledge requisite to knowing violation of a statute is factual knowledge as distinguished from knowledge of the law.  I do not suppose the Court intends to suggest that if petitioner knew nothing of the existence of such a regulation its ignorance would constitute a defense.  Boyce Motor Lines, Inc. v.

The proliferation of statutes and regulations has sometimes made it difficult for the average citizen to know and comprehend the extent of the duties and obligations imposed by the tax laws.  Congress has accordingly softened the impact of the common-law presumption by making specific intent to violate the law an element of certain federal criminal tax offenses.  Thus, the Court almost 60 years ago interpreted the statutory term willfully as used in the federal criminal tax statutes as carving out an exception to the traditional rule [that every person is presumed to know the law].  This special treatment of criminal tax offenses is largely due to the complexity of the tax laws.

						  Even before Ratzlaf was decided, then Chief Judge Breyer explained why there was a need for specificity under those statutes that is inapplicable when there is no danger of conviction of a defendant with an innocent state of mind.  He wrote:


I believe that criminal prosecutions for currency law violations, of the sort at issue here, very much resemble criminal prosecutions for tax law violations.  Compare 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/26/6050I.html" class="subref" title="subref">26 U. S. C. §§6050I</a> with 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/31/5322.html" class="subref" title="subref">31 U. S. C. §§5322</a>.  Both sets of laws are technical; and both sets of laws sometimes criminalize conduct that would not strike an ordinary citizen as immoral or likely unlawful.  Thus, both sets of laws may lead to the unfair result of criminally prosecuting individuals who subjectively and honestly believe they have not acted criminally.  Cheek v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/498/192" class="subref" title="subref">498 U. S. 192</a> … (1991), sets forth a legal standard that, by requiring proof that the defendant was subjectively aware of the duty at issue, would avoid such unfair results.  United States v. Aversa, 984 F. 2d 493, 502 (CA1 1993) (concurring opinion).
He therefore concluded that the same standards should apply in both the tax cases and in cases such as Ratzlaf.  984 F. 2d, at 503.

						 Moreover, requiring only knowledge that the conduct is unlawful is fully consistent with the purpose of FOPA, as FOPA was enacted to protect law-abiding citizens who might inadvertently violate the law.  See n. 4, supra; see also United States v. Andrade, 135 F. 3d 104, 108109 (CA1 1998).

						 For example, Representative Hughes, a staunch opponent of the bill, stated that the willfulness requirement would make it next to impossible to convict dealers, particularly those who engage in business without acquiring a license, because the prosecution would have to show that the dealer was personally aware of every detail of the law, and that he made a conscious decision to violate the law.  132 Cong.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/922.html" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. §922</a> defined a number of unlawful acts; subsection (a)(1) made it unlawful for any person except a licensed dealer to engage in the business of dealing in firearms.

				  Section 923 established the federal licensing program and repeated the prohibition against dealing in firearms without a license, and §924 specified the penalties for violating any provision of this chapter.  Read literally, §924 authorized the imposition of a fine of up to $5,000 or a prison sentence of not more than five years, or both, on any person who dealt in firearms without a license even if that person believed that he or she was acting lawfully.

				  As enacted in 1968, §922(a)(1) and §924 omitted an express scienter requirement and therefore arguably imposed strict criminal liability on every unlicensed dealer in firearms.  The 1968 Act also omitted any definition of the term engaged in the business even though that conduct was an element of the unlawful act prohibited by §922(a)(1).

				In 1986 Congress enacted the Firearms Owners Protection Act (FOPA), in part, to cure these omissions.  The findings in that statute explained that additional legislation was necessary to protect law-abiding citizens with respect to the acquisition, possession, or use of firearms for lawful purposes.

				 and amended §924 to add a scienter requirement as a condition to the imposition of penalties for most of the unlawful acts defined in §922.  For three categories of offenses the intent required is that the defendant acted knowingly; for the fourth category, which includes any other provision of this chapter, the required intent is that the defendant acted willfully.

				The jury having found petitioner guilty, we accept the Governments version of the evidence.  That evidence proved that petitioner did not have a federal license to deal in firearms; that he used so-called straw purchasers in Ohio to acquire pistols that he could not have purchased himself; that the straw purchasers made false statements when purchasing the guns; that petitioner assured the straw purchasers that he would file the serial numbers off the guns; and that he resold the guns on Brooklyn street corners known for drug dealing.  The evidence was unquestionably adequate to prove that petitioner was dealing in firearms, and that he knew that his conduct was unlawful.

				Petitioner was found guilty on both counts.  On appeal he argued that the evidence was insufficient because there was no proof that he had knowledge of the federal licensing requirement, and that the trial judge had erred by failing to instruct the jury that such knowledge was an essential element of the offense.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  It concluded that the instructions were proper and that the Government had elicited ample proof  that petitioner had acted willfully.  App. 22.

				Petitioner argues that a more particularized showing is required in this case for two principal reasons.  First, he argues that the fact that Congress used the adverb knowingly to authorize punishment of three categories of acts made unlawful by §922 and the word willfully when it referred to unlicensed dealing in firearms demonstrates that the Government must shoulder a special burden in cases like this.  This argument is not persuasive because the term knowingly does not necessarily have any reference to a culpable state of mind or to knowledge of the law.  As Justice Jackson correctly observed, the knowledge requisite to knowing violation of a statute is factual knowledge as distinguished from knowledge of the law.

				With respect to the three categories of conduct that are made punishable by §924 if performed knowingly, the background presumption that every citizen knows the law makes it unnecessary to adduce specific evidence to prove that an evil-meaning mind directed the evil-doing hand.

				Petitioner next argues that, at the time FOPA was passed, the willfulness requirements in other subsections of the statute§§923(d)(1)(C)(D)had uniformly been interpreted by lower courts to require knowledge of the law; petitioner argues that Congress intended that willfully should have the same meaning in §924(a)(1)(D).  As an initial matter, the lower courts had come to no such agreement.  While some courts had stated that willfulness in §923(d)(1) is satisfied by a disregard of a known legal obligation,

				Finally, petitioner argues that §922(b)(3), which is governed by §924(a)(1)(D)s willfulness standard, indicates that Congress intended willfully to include knowledge of the law.  Subsection 922(b)(3) prohibits licensees from selling firearms to any person who the licensee knows or has reasonable cause to believe does not reside in the licensees State, except where, 
				<em>
					inter alia
				</em>
				, the transaction fully complies with the laws of both the sellers and buyers State.  The subsection further states that the licensee shall be presumed, … in the absence of evidence to the contrary, to have had actual knowledge of the State laws and published ordinances of both States.

				  Although petitioner argues that the presumption in §922(b)(3) indicates that Congress intended willfulness to require knowledge of the law for all offenses covered by §924(a)(1)(D), petitioner is mistaken.  As noted above, while disregard of a known legal obligation is certainly sufficient to establish a willful violation, it is not necessaryand nothing in §922(b)(3) contradicts this basic distinction.

				Nevertheless, that error does not provide a basis for reversal for four reasons.  First, petitioner did not object to that sentence, except insofar as he had argued that the jury should have been instructed that the Government had the burden of proving that he had knowledge of the federal licensing requirement.  Second, in the context of the entire instructions, it seems unlikely that the jury was misled.  See,

.  Third, petitioner failed to raise this argument in the Court of Appeals.  Finally, our grant of certiorari was limited to the narrow legal question whether knowledge of the licensing requirement is an essential element of the offense.

						 In his opinion dissenting from the Courts decision upholding the constitutionality of a statute authorizing punishment for the knowing violation of an Interstate Commerce regulation, Justice Jackson wrote:


It is further suggested that a defendant is protected against indefiniteness because conviction is authorized only for knowing violations.  The argument seems to be that the jury can find that defendant knowingly violated the regulation only if it finds that it knew the meaning of the regulation he was accused of violating.  With the exception of Screws v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/325/91" class="subref" title="subref">325 U.

The proliferation of statutes and regulations has sometimes made it difficult for the average citizen to know and comprehend the extent of the duties and obligations imposed by the tax laws.  Congress has accordingly softened the impact of the common-law presumption by making specific intent to violate the law an element of certain federal criminal tax offenses.  Thus, the Court almost 60 years ago interpreted the statutory term willfully as used in the federal criminal tax statutes as carving out an exception to the traditional rule [that every person is presumed to know the law].  This special treatment of criminal tax offenses is largely due to the complexity of the tax laws.

						  Even before Ratzlaf was decided, then Chief Judge Breyer explained why there was a need for specificity under those statutes that is inapplicable when there is no danger of conviction of a defendant with an innocent state of mind.  He wrote:


I believe that criminal prosecutions for currency law violations, of the sort at issue here, very much resemble criminal prosecutions for tax law violations.  Compare 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/26/6050I.html" class="subref" title="subref">26 U. S. C. §§6050I</a> with 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/31/5322.html" class="subref" title="subref">31 U. S. C. §§5322</a>.  Both sets of laws are technical; and both sets of laws sometimes criminalize conduct that would not strike an ordinary citizen as immoral or likely unlawful.  Thus, both sets of laws may lead to the unfair result of criminally prosecuting individuals who subjectively and honestly believe they have not acted criminally.  Cheek v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/498/192" class="subref" title="subref">498 U. S. 192</a> … (1991), sets forth a legal standard that, by requiring proof that the defendant was subjectively aware of the duty at issue, would avoid such unfair results.  United States v. Aversa, 984 F. 2d 493, 502 (CA1 1993) (concurring opinion).
He therefore concluded that the same standards should apply in both the tax cases and in cases such as Ratzlaf.  984 F. 2d, at 503.

						 For example, Representative Hughes, a staunch opponent of the bill, stated that the willfulness requirement would make it next to impossible to convict dealers, particularly those who engage in business without acquiring a license, because the prosecution would have to show that the dealer was personally aware of every detail of the law, and that he made a conscious decision to violate the law.  132 Cong.

The uncontroverted evidence shows clearly that plaintiff was aware of the above holding period requirements.

See also, e.g., Perri, 637 F. 2d, at 1336 (stating that when a dealer understands the requirements of the law, but knowingly fails to follow them or is indifferent to them, willfulness is established, i.e., is satisfied); Steins, 649 F. 2d, at 468 (Evidence of repeated violations with knowledge of the laws requirements has been held sufficient to establish willfulness (emphasis added)); McLemore, 317 F.

We … see no reason why the word regulations [or the phrase any other provision of this chapter] should not be construed as a shorthand designation for specific acts or omissions which violate the Act.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/922.html" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. §922</a> defined a number of unlawful acts; subsection (a)(1) made it unlawful for any person except a licensed dealer to engage in the business of dealing in firearms.

				  Section 923 established the federal licensing program and repeated the prohibition against dealing in firearms without a license, and §924 specified the penalties for violating any provision of this chapter.  Read literally, §924 authorized the imposition of a fine of up to $5,000 or a prison sentence of not more than five years, or both, on any person who dealt in firearms without a license even if that person believed that he or she was acting lawfully.

				  As enacted in 1968, §922(a)(1) and §924 omitted an express scienter requirement and therefore arguably imposed strict criminal liability on every unlicensed dealer in firearms.  The 1968 Act also omitted any definition of the term engaged in the business even though that conduct was an element of the unlawful act prohibited by §922(a)(1).

				The jury having found petitioner guilty, we accept the Governments version of the evidence.  That evidence proved that petitioner did not have a federal license to deal in firearms; that he used so-called straw purchasers in Ohio to acquire pistols that he could not have purchased himself; that the straw purchasers made false statements when purchasing the guns; that petitioner assured the straw purchasers that he would file the serial numbers off the guns; and that he resold the guns on Brooklyn street corners known for drug dealing.

				A person acts willfully if he acts intentionally and purposely and with the intent to do something the law forbids, that is, with the bad purpose to disobey or to disregard the law.

				Petitioner was found guilty on both counts.  On appeal he argued that the evidence was insufficient because there was no proof that he had knowledge of the federal licensing requirement, and that the trial judge had erred by failing to instruct the jury that such knowledge was an essential element of the offense.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  It concluded that the instructions were proper and that the Government had elicited ample proof  that petitioner had acted willfully.  App. 22.

				Petitioner argues that a more particularized showing is required in this case for two principal reasons.  First, he argues that the fact that Congress used the adverb knowingly to authorize punishment of three categories of acts made unlawful by §922 and the word willfully when it referred to unlicensed dealing in firearms demonstrates that the Government must shoulder a special burden in cases like this.  This argument is not persuasive because the term knowingly does not necessarily have any reference to a culpable state of mind or to knowledge of the law.  As Justice Jackson correctly observed, the knowledge requisite to knowing violation of a statute is factual knowledge as distinguished from knowledge of the law.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				With respect to the three categories of conduct that are made punishable by §924 if performed knowingly, the background presumption that every citizen knows the law makes it unnecessary to adduce specific evidence to prove that an evil-meaning mind directed the evil-doing hand.

				Petitioner next argues that, at the time FOPA was passed, the willfulness requirements in other subsections of the statute§§923(d)(1)(C)(D)had uniformly been interpreted by lower courts to require knowledge of the law; petitioner argues that Congress intended that willfully should have the same meaning in §924(a)(1)(D).  As an initial matter, the lower courts had come to no such agreement.  While some courts had stated that willfulness in §923(d)(1) is satisfied by a disregard of a known legal obligation,

				 willful was also interpreted variously to refer to purposeful, intentional conduct,

                </sup>
            </a>
				  Moreover, in each of the cases in which disregard of a known legal obligation was held to be sufficient to establish willfulness, it was perfectly clear from the record that the licensee had knowledge of the law

                </sup>
            </a>
; thus, while these cases support the notion that disregard of a known legal obligation is sufficient to establish a willful violation, they in no way stand for the proposition that it is required.

				Finally, petitioner argues that §922(b)(3), which is governed by §924(a)(1)(D)s willfulness standard, indicates that Congress intended willfully to include knowledge of the law.  Subsection 922(b)(3) prohibits licensees from selling firearms to any person who the licensee knows or has reasonable cause to believe does not reside in the licensees State, except where, 
				<em>
					inter alia
				</em>
				, the transaction fully complies with the laws of both the sellers and buyers State.  The subsection further states that the licensee shall be presumed, … in the absence of evidence to the contrary, to have had actual knowledge of the State laws and published ordinances of both States.

                </sup>
            </a>
				  Although petitioner argues that the presumption in §922(b)(3) indicates that Congress intended willfulness to require knowledge of the law for all offenses covered by §924(a)(1)(D), petitioner is mistaken.  As noted above, while disregard of a known legal obligation is certainly sufficient to establish a willful violation, it is not necessaryand nothing in §922(b)(3) contradicts this basic distinction.

				One sentence in the trial courts instructions to the jury, read by itself, contained a misstatement of the law.  In a portion of the instructions that were given after the correct statement that we have already quoted, the judge stated:  In this case, the government is not required to prove that the defendant knew that a license was required, 
				<em>
					nor is the government required to prove that he had knowledge that he was breaking the law.
				</em>
				  App. 19 (emphasis added).  If the judge had added the words that required a license, the sentence would have been accurate, but as given it was not.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Nevertheless, that error does not provide a basis for reversal for four reasons.  First, petitioner did not object to that sentence, except insofar as he had argued that the jury should have been instructed that the Government had the burden of proving that he had knowledge of the federal licensing requirement.  Second, in the context of the entire instructions, it seems unlikely that the jury was misled.  See,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">674</a>675 (1975)
.  Third, petitioner failed to raise this argument in the Court of Appeals.  Finally, our grant of certiorari was limited to the narrow legal question whether knowledge of the licensing requirement is an essential element of the offense.

						 In his opinion dissenting from the Courts decision upholding the constitutionality of a statute authorizing punishment for the knowing violation of an Interstate Commerce regulation, Justice Jackson wrote:


It is further suggested that a defendant is protected against indefiniteness because conviction is authorized only for knowing violations.  The argument seems to be that the jury can find that defendant knowingly violated the regulation only if it finds that it knew the meaning of the regulation he was accused of violating.  With the exception of Screws v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/325/91" class="subref" title="subref">325 U. S. 91</a>, which rests on a very particularized basis, the knowledge requisite to knowing violation of a statute is factual knowledge as distinguished from knowledge of the law.  I do not suppose the Court intends to suggest that if petitioner knew nothing of the existence of such a regulation its ignorance would constitute a defense.  Boyce Motor Lines, Inc. v.

The proliferation of statutes and regulations has sometimes made it difficult for the average citizen to know and comprehend the extent of the duties and obligations imposed by the tax laws.  Congress has accordingly softened the impact of the common-law presumption by making specific intent to violate the law an element of certain federal criminal tax offenses.  Thus, the Court almost 60 years ago interpreted the statutory term willfully as used in the federal criminal tax statutes as carving out an exception to the traditional rule [that every person is presumed to know the law].  This special treatment of criminal tax offenses is largely due to the complexity of the tax laws.

						  Even before Ratzlaf was decided, then Chief Judge Breyer explained why there was a need for specificity under those statutes that is inapplicable when there is no danger of conviction of a defendant with an innocent state of mind.  He wrote:


I believe that criminal prosecutions for currency law violations, of the sort at issue here, very much resemble criminal prosecutions for tax law violations.  Compare 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/26/6050I.html" class="subref" title="subref">26 U. S. C. §§6050I</a> with 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/31/5322.html" class="subref" title="subref">31 U. S. C. §§5322</a>.  Both sets of laws are technical; and both sets of laws sometimes criminalize conduct that would not strike an ordinary citizen as immoral or likely unlawful.  Thus, both sets of laws may lead to the unfair result of criminally prosecuting individuals who subjectively and honestly believe they have not acted criminally.  Cheek v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/498/192" class="subref" title="subref">498 U. S. 192</a> … (1991), sets forth a legal standard that, by requiring proof that the defendant was subjectively aware of the duty at issue, would avoid such unfair results.  United States v. Aversa, 984 F. 2d 493, 502 (CA1 1993) (concurring opinion).
He therefore concluded that the same standards should apply in both the tax cases and in cases such as Ratzlaf.  984 F. 2d, at 503.

						 Moreover, requiring only knowledge that the conduct is unlawful is fully consistent with the purpose of FOPA, as FOPA was enacted to protect law-abiding citizens who might inadvertently violate the law.  See n. 4, supra; see also United States v. Andrade, 135 F. 3d 104, 108109 (CA1 1998).

						 For example, Representative Hughes, a staunch opponent of the bill, stated that the willfulness requirement would make it next to impossible to convict dealers, particularly those who engage in business without acquiring a license, because the prosecution would have to show that the dealer was personally aware of every detail of the law, and that he made a conscious decision to violate the law.  132 Cong.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/922.html" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. §922</a> defined a number of unlawful acts; subsection (a)(1) made it unlawful for any person except a licensed dealer to engage in the business of dealing in firearms.

				  Section 923 established the federal licensing program and repeated the prohibition against dealing in firearms without a license, and §924 specified the penalties for violating any provision of this chapter.  Read literally, §924 authorized the imposition of a fine of up to $5,000 or a prison sentence of not more than five years, or both, on any person who dealt in firearms without a license even if that person believed that he or she was acting lawfully.

				  As enacted in 1968, §922(a)(1) and §924 omitted an express scienter requirement and therefore arguably imposed strict criminal liability on every unlicensed dealer in firearms.  The 1968 Act also omitted any definition of the term engaged in the business even though that conduct was an element of the unlawful act prohibited by §922(a)(1).

				The jury having found petitioner guilty, we accept the Governments version of the evidence.  That evidence proved that petitioner did not have a federal license to deal in firearms; that he used so-called straw purchasers in Ohio to acquire pistols that he could not have purchased himself; that the straw purchasers made false statements when purchasing the guns; that petitioner assured the straw purchasers that he would file the serial numbers off the guns; and that he resold the guns on Brooklyn street corners known for drug dealing.

				A person acts willfully if he acts intentionally and purposely and with the intent to do something the law forbids, that is, with the bad purpose to disobey or to disregard the law.

				Petitioner was found guilty on both counts.

The Court of Appeals affirmed.  It concluded that the instructions were proper and that the Government had elicited ample proof  that petitioner had acted willfully.  App. 22.

				Petitioner argues that a more particularized showing is required in this case for two principal reasons.  First, he argues that the fact that Congress used the adverb knowingly to authorize punishment of three categories of acts made unlawful by §922 and the word willfully when it referred to unlicensed dealing in firearms demonstrates that the Government must shoulder a special burden in cases like this.  This argument is not persuasive because the term knowingly does not necessarily have any reference to a culpable state of mind or to knowledge of the law.  As Justice Jackson correctly observed, the knowledge requisite to knowing violation of a statute is factual knowledge as distinguished from knowledge of the law.

				With respect to the three categories of conduct that are made punishable by §924 if performed knowingly, the background presumption that every citizen knows the law makes it unnecessary to adduce specific evidence to prove that an evil-meaning mind directed the evil-doing hand.

				Petitioner next argues that, at the time FOPA was passed, the willfulness requirements in other subsections of the statute§§923(d)(1)(C)(D)had uniformly been interpreted by lower courts to require knowledge of the law; petitioner argues that Congress intended that willfully should have the same meaning in §924(a)(1)(D).  As an initial matter, the lower courts had come to no such agreement.  While some courts had stated that willfulness in §923(d)(1) is satisfied by a disregard of a known legal obligation,
				<a name="ZO-26ref" href="#ZO-26" class="">

				  Moreover, in each of the cases in which disregard of a known legal obligation was held to be sufficient to establish willfulness, it was perfectly clear from the record that the licensee had knowledge of the law

				Finally, petitioner argues that §922(b)(3), which is governed by §924(a)(1)(D)s willfulness standard, indicates that Congress intended willfully to include knowledge of the law.  Subsection 922(b)(3) prohibits licensees from selling firearms to any person who the licensee knows or has reasonable cause to believe does not reside in the licensees State, except where, 
				<em>
					inter alia
				</em>
				, the transaction fully complies with the laws of both the sellers and buyers State.  The subsection further states that the licensee shall be presumed, … in the absence of evidence to the contrary, to have had actual knowledge of the State laws and published ordinances of both States.

                </sup>
            </a>
				  Although petitioner argues that the presumption in §922(b)(3) indicates that Congress intended willfulness to require knowledge of the law for all offenses covered by §924(a)(1)(D), petitioner is mistaken.  As noted above, while disregard of a known legal obligation is certainly sufficient to establish a willful violation, it is not necessaryand nothing in §922(b)(3) contradicts this basic distinction.

				One sentence in the trial courts instructions to the jury, read by itself, contained a misstatement of the law.  In a portion of the instructions that were given after the correct statement that we have already quoted, the judge stated:  In this case, the government is not required to prove that the defendant knew that a license was required, 
				<em>
					nor is the government required to prove that he had knowledge that he was breaking the law.

				  App. 19 (emphasis added).  If the judge had added the words that required a license, the sentence would have been accurate, but as given it was not.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Nevertheless, that error does not provide a basis for reversal for four reasons.  First, petitioner did not object to that sentence, except insofar as he had argued that the jury should have been instructed that the Government had the burden of proving that he had knowledge of the federal licensing requirement.  Second, in the context of the entire instructions, it seems unlikely that the jury was misled.  See, 
				<em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">674</a>675 (1975)
.  Third, petitioner failed to raise this argument in the Court of Appeals.  Finally, our grant of certiorari was limited to the narrow legal question whether knowledge of the licensing requirement is an essential element of the offense.

						 In his opinion dissenting from the Courts decision upholding the constitutionality of a statute authorizing punishment for the knowing violation of an Interstate Commerce regulation, Justice Jackson wrote:


It is further suggested that a defendant is protected against indefiniteness because conviction is authorized only for knowing violations.  The argument seems to be that the jury can find that defendant knowingly violated the regulation only if it finds that it knew the meaning of the regulation he was accused of violating.  With the exception of Screws v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/325/91" class="subref" title="subref">325 U. S. 91</a>, which rests on a very particularized basis, the knowledge requisite to knowing violation of a statute is factual knowledge as distinguished from knowledge of the law.  I do not suppose the Court intends to suggest that if petitioner knew nothing of the existence of such a regulation its ignorance would constitute a defense.  Boyce Motor Lines, Inc. v. United States,

The proliferation of statutes and regulations has sometimes made it difficult for the average citizen to know and comprehend the extent of the duties and obligations imposed by the tax laws.  Congress has accordingly softened the impact of the common-law presumption by making specific intent to violate the law an element of certain federal criminal tax offenses.  Thus, the Court almost 60 years ago interpreted the statutory term willfully as used in the federal criminal tax statutes as carving out an exception to the traditional rule [that every person is presumed to know the law].  This special treatment of criminal tax offenses is largely due to the complexity of the tax laws.

						  Even before Ratzlaf was decided, then Chief Judge Breyer explained why there was a need for specificity under those statutes that is inapplicable when there is no danger of conviction of a defendant with an innocent state of mind.  He wrote:


I believe that criminal prosecutions for currency law violations, of the sort at issue here, very much resemble criminal prosecutions for tax law violations.  Compare 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/26/6050I.html" class="subref" title="subref">26 U. S. C. §§6050I</a> with 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/31/5322.html" class="subref" title="subref">31 U. S. C. §§5322</a>.  Both sets of laws are technical; and both sets of laws sometimes criminalize conduct that would not strike an ordinary citizen as immoral or likely unlawful.  Thus, both sets of laws may lead to the unfair result of criminally prosecuting individuals who subjectively and honestly believe they have not acted criminally.  Cheek v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/498/192" class="subref" title="subref">498 U. S. 192</a> … (1991), sets forth a legal standard that, by requiring proof that the defendant was subjectively aware of the duty at issue, would avoid such unfair results.  United States v. Aversa, 984 F. 2d 493, 502 (CA1 1993) (concurring opinion).
He therefore concluded that the same standards should apply in both the tax cases and in cases such as Ratzlaf.  984 F. 2d, at 503.

						 Moreover, requiring only knowledge that the conduct is unlawful is fully consistent with the purpose of FOPA, as FOPA was enacted to protect law-abiding citizens who might inadvertently violate the law.  See n. 4, supra; see also United States v. Andrade, 135 F. 3d 104, 108109 (CA1 1998).

						 For example, Representative Hughes, a staunch opponent of the bill, stated that the willfulness requirement would make it next to impossible to convict dealers, particularly those who engage in business without acquiring a license, because the prosecution would have to show that the dealer was personally aware of every detail of the law, and that he made a conscious decision to violate the law.  132 Cong.

						 In Mayesh, for example, the court stated:


The uncontroverted evidence shows clearly that plaintiff was aware of the above holding period requirements.  Mr. Mayesh had been previously advised on the requirements under Illinois law, and he clearly acknowledged that he was aware of them… . Since the material facts are undisputed, as a matter of law the plaintiff clearly and knowingly violated the Illinois holding provisions …, and hence,

See also, e.g., Perri, 637 F. 2d, at 1336 (stating that when a dealer understands the requirements of the law, but knowingly fails to follow them or is indifferent to them, willfulness is established, i.e., is satisfied); Steins, 649 F. 2d, at 468 (Evidence of repeated violations with knowledge of the laws requirements has been held sufficient to establish willfulness (emphasis added)); McLemore, 317 F.

						  Petitioner also argues that the statutory languagewillfully violates any other provision of this chapterindicates a congressional intent to attach liability only when a defendant possesses specific knowledge of the provision[s] of [the] chapter.  We rejected a similar argument in United States v. International Minerals &amp; Chemical Corp., 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/402/558" class="subref" title="subref">402 U. S. 558</a> (1971)
.  Although that case involved the word knowingly (in the phrase knowingly violates any such regulation), the response is the same:


We … see no reason why the word regulations [or the phrase any other provision of this chapter] should not be construed as a shorthand designation for specific acts or omissions which violate the Act.  The Act, so viewed, does not signal an exception to the rule that ignorance of the law is no excuse … .  Id., at 562.

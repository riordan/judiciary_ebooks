				A motion by a federal prisoner for postconviction relief under 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2255.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2255</a> is subject to a one-year time limitation that generally runs from the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final.  §2255, ¶6(1).  This case concerns the starting date for the one-year limitation.  It presents a narrow but recurring question on which courts of appeals have divided: When a defendant in a federal prosecution takes an unsuccessful direct appeal from a judgment of conviction, but does not next petition for a writ of certiorari from this Court, does the judgment become final for postconviction relief purposes (1) when the appellate court issues its mandate affirming the conviction, or, instead, (2) on the date, ordinarily 69 days later, when the time for filing a petition for certiorari expires?
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In accord with this Courts consistent understanding of finality in the context of collateral review, and the weight of lower court authority, we reject the issuance of the appellate court mandate as the triggering date.  For the purpose of starting the clock on §2255s one-year limitation period, we hold, a judgment of conviction becomes final when the time expires for filing a petition for certiorari contesting the appellate courts affirmation of the conviction.

				In 1997, petitioner Erick Cornell Clay was convicted of arson and distribution of cocaine base in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana.  On November 23, 1998, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed his convictions.  That courts mandate issued on December 15, 1998.  See Fed. Rules App. Proc. 40(a)(1) and 41(b) (when no petition for rehearing is filed, a court of appeals mandate issues 21 days after entry of judgment).  Clay did not file a petition for a writ of certiorari.  The time in which he could have petitioned for certiorari expired on February 22, 1999, 90 days after entry of the Court of Appeals judgment, see this Courts Rule 13(1), and 69 days after the issuance of the appellate courts mandate.

				On February 22, 2000one year and 69 days after the Court of Appeals issued its mandate and exactly one year after the time for seeking certiorari expiredClay filed a motion in the District Court, pursuant to 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2255.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2255</a>, to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence.  Congress has prescribed [a] 1-year period of limitation for such motions run[ning] from the latest of four specified dates.  §2255, ¶6.  Of the four dates, the only one relevant in this case, as in the generality of cases, is the first: the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final.  §2255, ¶6(1).

Because Clay filed his §2255 motion more than one year after that date, the court denied the motion as time barred.

Six Courts of Appeals have parted ways with the Seventh and Fourth Circuits.  These courts hold that, for federal prisoners like Clay who do not file petitions for certiorari following affirmance of their convictions, §2255s one-year limitation period begins to run when the defendants time for seeking review by this Court expires.

				Finality is variously defined; like many legal terms, its precise meaning depends on context.  Typically, a federal judgment becomes final for appellate review and claim preclusion purposes when the district court disassociates itself from the case, leaving nothing to be done at the court of first instance save execution of the judgment.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Quackenbush
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Allstate Ins. Co.,
				</em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">712</a> (1996)
; Restatement (Second) of Judgments §13, Comment 
				<em>
					b
				</em>
				 (1980).  For other purposes, finality attaches at a different stage.  For example, for certain determinations under the Speedy Trial Act of 1974, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/3161.html" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. §3161</a>
            <em>
					et seq.
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				and under a now-repealed version of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33, several lower courts have held that finality attends issuance of the appellate courts mandate.  See Brief for 
				<em>
					Amicus Curiae
				</em>
				 by Invitation of the Court 2228 (hereinafter DeBruin Brief) (citing cases).  For the purpose of seeking review by this Court, in contrast, [t]he time to file a petition for a writ of certiorari runs from the date of entry of the judgment or order sought to be reviewed, and not from the issuance date of the mandate (or its equivalent under local practice).  This Courts Rule 13(3).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Here, the relevant context is postconviction relief, a context in which finality has a long-recognized, clear meaning: Finality attaches when this Court affirms a conviction on the merits on direct review or denies a petition for a writ of certiorari, or when the time for filing a certiorari petition expires.

See DeBruin Brief 820.  Sections 2255 and 2244(d)(1), as now formulated, were reshaped by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996.  See §§101, 105,

Three of the four time triggers under §2244(d)(1) closely track corresponding portions of §2255.  Compare §§2244(d)(1)(B)(D), with §2255, ¶¶6(2)(4).  But where §2255, ¶6(1), refers simply to the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final, §2244(d)(1)(A) speaks of the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.

				<em>
					 by the conclusion of direct review
				</em>
				.  Had §2255 explicitly provided for the first of the two finality triggers set forth in §2244(d)(1)(A), one might indeed question the soundness of interpreting §2255 implicitly to incorporate §2244(d)(1)(A)s second trigger as well.  As written, however, §2255 does not qualify becomes final at all.  Using neither of the disjunctive phrases that follow the words became final in §2244(d)(1)(A), §2255 simply leaves becomes final undefined.

				<em>
					Russello
				</em>
				 urged a narrow construction of the unqualified words any interest … acquired.  Rejecting that argument, we observed that a succeeding subsection, §1963(a)(2), reached any interest in … any enterprise the defendant conducted in violation of RICOs proscriptions.  At that point, we referred to the maxim invoked by 
				<em>
					amicus
				</em>
				.  See 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 6.  The qualifying words in … any enterprise narrowed §1963(a)(2), but in no way affected §1963(a)(1).  The comparison of the two subsections, we said, fortified the broad construction we approved for the unmodified words any interest … acquired.

				Far from supporting the Seventh Circuits constricted reading of §2255, ¶6(1), 
				<em>

				<em>
					Russello

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Moreover, as Clay and the Government urge, see Brief for Petitioner 22; Reply Brief for United States 78, one can readily comprehend why Congress might have found it appropriate to spell out the meaning of final in §2244(d)(1)(A) but not in §2255.  Section 2244(d)(1) governs petitions by state prisoners.  In that context, a bare reference to became final might have suggested that finality assessments should be made by reference to state law rules that may differ from the general federal rule and vary from State to State.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Artuz

The words by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review make it clear that finality for the purpose of §2244(d)(1)(A) is to be determined by reference to a uniform federal rule.  Section 2255, however, governs only petitions by federal prisoners; within the federal system there is no comparable risk of varying rules to guard against.

				<em>
					Torres
				</em>
				, 211 F. 3d, at 840.  Chapter 154 of Title 28 governs certain habeas petitions filed by death-sentenced state prisoners.  Section 2263(a) prescribes a 180-day limitation period for such petitions running from final State court affirmance of the conviction and sentence on direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.  That period is tolled, however, from the date that a petition for certiorari is filed in the Supreme Court until the date of final disposition of the petition if a State prisoner files the petition to secure review by the Supreme Court of the affirmance of a capital sentence on direct review by the court of last resort of the State or other final State court decision on direct review.  §2263(b)(1).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We do not find in §2263 cause to alter our reading of §2255.  First, 
				<em>
					amicus
				</em>
				 reliance on §2263 encounters essentially the same problem as does his reliance on §2244(d)(1)(A): Section 2255, ¶6(1), refers to 
				<em>
					neither
				</em>
				 of the two events that §2263(a) identifies as possible starting points for the limitation periodaffirmance of the conviction and sentence on direct review and the expiration of the time for seeking such review.  Thus, reasoning by negative implication from §2263 does not justify the conclusion that §2255, ¶6(1)s limitation period begins to run at one of those times rather than the other.  Cf. 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 68.  Second, §2263(a) ties the applicable limitation period to affirmance of the conviction and sentence, while §2255, ¶6(1), ties the limitation period to the date when the judgment of conviction becomes final.  See 
				<em>
					Torres

				, 211 F. 3d, at 845 (Hamilton, J., dissenting).  The

				We hold that, for federal criminal defendants who do not file a petition for certiorari with this Court on direct review, §2255s one-year limitation period starts to run when the time for seeking such review expires.

						 Agreeing with the position advanced by the majority of the courts of appeals that have ruled on the question, the United States joins petitioner Clay in urging that Clays §2255 motion was timely filed.  We therefore invited David W. DeBruin to brief and argue this case, as amicus curiae, in support of the Seventh Circuits judgment.  Mr. DeBruins able advocacy permits us to decide the case satisfied that the relevant issues have been fully aired.

						 Although recognizing that the question is not presented in this case, Tr. of Oral Arg. 27, amicus suggests that §2255s limitation period starts to run upon issuance of the court of appeals mandate even in cases in which the defendant does petition for certiorari.  Id., at 2728, 3638, 4142.  As amicus also recognizes, however, id., at 41, courts of appeals have uniformly concluded that, if a prisoner petitions for certiorari, the contested conviction becomes final when the Supreme Court either denies the writ or issues a decision on the merits, United States v.

				A motion by a federal prisoner for postconviction relief under 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2255.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2255</a> is subject to a one-year time limitation that generally runs from the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final.  §2255, ¶6(1).  This case concerns the starting date for the one-year limitation.  It presents a narrow but recurring question on which courts of appeals have divided: When a defendant in a federal prosecution takes an unsuccessful direct appeal from a judgment of conviction, but does not next petition for a writ of certiorari from this Court, does the judgment become final for postconviction relief purposes (1) when the appellate court issues its mandate affirming the conviction, or, instead, (2) on the date, ordinarily 69 days later, when the time for filing a petition for certiorari expires?
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In accord with this Courts consistent understanding of finality in the context of collateral review, and the weight of lower court authority, we reject the issuance of the appellate court mandate as the triggering date.  For the purpose of starting the clock on §2255s one-year limitation period, we hold, a judgment of conviction becomes final when the time expires for filing a petition for certiorari contesting the appellate courts affirmation of the conviction.

				In 1997, petitioner Erick Cornell Clay was convicted of arson and distribution of cocaine base in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana.  On November 23, 1998, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed his convictions.  That courts mandate issued on December 15, 1998.  See Fed. Rules App. Proc. 40(a)(1) and 41(b) (when no petition for rehearing is filed, a court of appeals mandate issues 21 days after entry of judgment).  Clay did not file a petition for a writ of certiorari.  The time in which he could have petitioned for certiorari expired on February 22, 1999, 90 days after entry of the Court of Appeals judgment, see this Courts Rule 13(1), and 69 days after the issuance of the appellate courts mandate.

				On February 22, 2000one year and 69 days after the Court of Appeals issued its mandate and exactly one year after the time for seeking certiorari expiredClay filed a motion in the District Court, pursuant to

Congress has prescribed [a] 1-year period of limitation for such motions run[ning] from the latest of four specified dates.  §2255, ¶6.  Of the four dates, the only one relevant in this case, as in the generality of cases, is the first: the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final.  §2255, ¶6(1).

Six Courts of Appeals have parted ways with the Seventh and Fourth Circuits.  These courts hold that, for federal prisoners like Clay who do not file petitions for certiorari following affirmance of their convictions, §2255s one-year limitation period begins to run when the defendants time for seeking review by this Court expires.

				Finality is variously defined; like many legal terms, its precise meaning depends on context.  Typically, a federal judgment becomes final for appellate review and claim preclusion purposes when the district court disassociates itself from the case, leaving nothing to be done at the court of first instance save execution of the judgment.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Quackenbush
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Allstate Ins. Co.,
				</em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">712</a> (1996)
; Restatement (Second) of Judgments §13, Comment 
				<em>
					b
				</em>
				 (1980).  For other purposes, finality attaches at a different stage.  For example, for certain determinations under the Speedy Trial Act of 1974, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/3161.html" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. §3161</a>
            <em>
					et seq.
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				and under a now-repealed version of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33, several lower courts have held that finality attends issuance of the appellate courts mandate.  See Brief for 
				<em>
					Amicus Curiae
				</em>
				 by Invitation of the Court 2228 (hereinafter DeBruin Brief) (citing cases).  For the purpose of seeking review by this Court, in contrast, [t]he time to file a petition for a writ of certiorari runs from the date of entry of the judgment or order sought to be reviewed, and not from the issuance date of the mandate (or its equivalent under local practice).  This Courts Rule 13(3).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Here, the relevant context is postconviction relief, a context in which finality has a long-recognized, clear meaning: Finality attaches when this Court affirms a conviction on the merits on direct review or denies a petition for a writ of certiorari, or when the time for filing a certiorari petition expires.

Three of the four time triggers under §2244(d)(1) closely track corresponding portions of §2255.  Compare §§2244(d)(1)(B)(D), with §2255, ¶¶6(2)(4).  But where §2255, ¶6(1), refers simply to the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final, §2244(d)(1)(A) speaks of the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.

As written, however, §2255 does not qualify becomes final at all.

				 urged a narrow construction of the unqualified words any interest … acquired.  Rejecting that argument, we observed that a succeeding subsection, §1963(a)(2), reached any interest in … any enterprise the defendant conducted in violation of RICOs proscriptions.  At that point, we referred to the maxim invoked by 
				<em>

				Far from supporting the Seventh Circuits constricted reading of §2255, ¶6(1),

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Moreover, as Clay and the Government urge, see Brief for Petitioner 22; Reply Brief for United States 78, one can readily comprehend why Congress might have found it appropriate to spell out the meaning of final in §2244(d)(1)(A) but not in §2255.  Section 2244(d)(1) governs petitions by state prisoners.  In that context, a bare reference to became final might have suggested that finality assessments should be made by reference to state law rules that may differ from the general federal rule and vary from State to State.

Section 2263(a) prescribes a 180-day limitation period for such petitions running from final State court affirmance of the conviction and sentence on direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.  That period is tolled, however, from the date that a petition for certiorari is filed in the Supreme Court until the date of final disposition of the petition if a State prisoner files the petition to secure review by the Supreme Court of the affirmance of a capital sentence on direct review by the court of last resort of the State or other final State court decision on direct review.  §2263(b)(1).

				We hold that, for federal criminal defendants who do not file a petition for certiorari with this Court on direct review, §2255s one-year limitation period starts to run when the time for seeking such review expires.  Under this rule, Clays §2255 petition was timely filed.  The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

						 Agreeing with the position advanced by the majority of the courts of appeals that have ruled on the question, the United States joins petitioner Clay in urging that Clays §2255 motion was timely filed.  We therefore invited David W. DeBruin to brief and argue this case, as amicus curiae, in support of the Seventh Circuits judgment.  Mr. DeBruins able advocacy permits us to decide the case satisfied that the relevant issues have been fully aired.

				A motion by a federal prisoner for postconviction relief under 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2255.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2255</a> is subject to a one-year time limitation that generally runs from the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final.  §2255, ¶6(1).  This case concerns the starting date for the one-year limitation.  It presents a narrow but recurring question on which courts of appeals have divided: When a defendant in a federal prosecution takes an unsuccessful direct appeal from a judgment of conviction, but does not next petition for a writ of certiorari from this Court, does the judgment become final for postconviction relief purposes (1) when the appellate court issues its mandate affirming the conviction, or, instead, (2) on the date, ordinarily 69 days later, when the time for filing a petition for certiorari expires?
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In accord with this Courts consistent understanding of finality in the context of collateral review, and the weight of lower court authority, we reject the issuance of the appellate court mandate as the triggering date.  For the purpose of starting the clock on §2255s one-year limitation period, we hold, a judgment of conviction becomes final when the time expires for filing a petition for certiorari contesting the appellate courts affirmation of the conviction.

				In 1997, petitioner Erick Cornell Clay was convicted of arson and distribution of cocaine base in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana.  On November 23, 1998, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed his convictions.  That courts mandate issued on December 15, 1998.  See Fed. Rules App. Proc. 40(a)(1) and 41(b) (when no petition for rehearing is filed, a court of appeals mandate issues 21 days after entry of judgment).  Clay did not file a petition for a writ of certiorari.  The time in which he could have petitioned for certiorari expired on February 22, 1999, 90 days after entry of the Court of Appeals judgment, see this Courts Rule 13(1), and 69 days after the issuance of the appellate courts mandate.

				On February 22, 2000one year and 69 days after the Court of Appeals issued its mandate and exactly one year after the time for seeking certiorari expiredClay filed a motion in the District Court, pursuant to

Congress has prescribed [a] 1-year period of limitation for such motions run[ning] from the latest of four specified dates.  §2255, ¶6.  Of the four dates, the only one relevant in this case, as in the generality of cases, is the first: the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final.  §2255, ¶6(1).

Six Courts of Appeals have parted ways with the Seventh and Fourth Circuits.  These courts hold that, for federal prisoners like Clay who do not file petitions for certiorari following affirmance of their convictions, §2255s one-year limitation period begins to run when the defendants time for seeking review by this Court expires.

				Finality is variously defined; like many legal terms, its precise meaning depends on context.  Typically, a federal judgment becomes final for appellate review and claim preclusion purposes when the district court disassociates itself from the case, leaving nothing to be done at the court of first instance save execution of the judgment.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Quackenbush
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Allstate Ins. Co.,
				</em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">712</a> (1996)
; Restatement (Second) of Judgments §13, Comment 
				<em>
					b
				</em>
				 (1980).  For other purposes, finality attaches at a different stage.  For example, for certain determinations under the Speedy Trial Act of 1974, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/3161.html" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. §3161</a>
            <em>
					et seq.
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				and under a now-repealed version of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33, several lower courts have held that finality attends issuance of the appellate courts mandate.  See Brief for 
				<em>
					Amicus Curiae
				</em>
				 by Invitation of the Court 2228 (hereinafter DeBruin Brief) (citing cases).  For the purpose of seeking review by this Court, in contrast, [t]he time to file a petition for a writ of certiorari runs from the date of entry of the judgment or order sought to be reviewed, and not from the issuance date of the mandate (or its equivalent under local practice).  This Courts Rule 13(3).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Here, the relevant context is postconviction relief, a context in which finality has a long-recognized, clear meaning: Finality attaches when this Court affirms a conviction on the merits on direct review or denies a petition for a writ of certiorari, or when the time for filing a certiorari petition expires.

Three of the four time triggers under §2244(d)(1) closely track corresponding portions of §2255.  Compare §§2244(d)(1)(B)(D), with §2255, ¶¶6(2)(4).  But where §2255, ¶6(1), refers simply to the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final, §2244(d)(1)(A) speaks of the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.

				Far from supporting the Seventh Circuits constricted reading of §2255, ¶6(1),

				Moreover, as Clay and the Government urge, see Brief for Petitioner 22; Reply Brief for United States 78, one can readily comprehend why Congress might have found it appropriate to spell out the meaning of final in §2244(d)(1)(A) but not in §2255.  Section 2244(d)(1) governs petitions by state prisoners.  In that context, a bare reference to became final might have suggested that finality assessments should be made by reference to state law rules that may differ from the general federal rule and vary from State to State.

Section 2263(a) prescribes a 180-day limitation period for such petitions running from final State court affirmance of the conviction and sentence on direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.  That period is tolled, however, from the date that a petition for certiorari is filed in the Supreme Court until the date of final disposition of the petition if a State prisoner files the petition to secure review by the Supreme Court of the affirmance of a capital sentence on direct review by the court of last resort of the State or other final State court decision on direct review.  §2263(b)(1).

				We hold that, for federal criminal defendants who do not file a petition for certiorari with this Court on direct review, §2255s one-year limitation period starts to run when the time for seeking such review expires.  Under this rule, Clays §2255 petition was timely filed.  The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

						 Agreeing with the position advanced by the majority of the courts of appeals that have ruled on the question, the United States joins petitioner Clay in urging that Clays §2255 motion was timely filed.  We therefore invited David W. DeBruin to brief and argue this case, as amicus curiae, in support of the Seventh Circuits judgment.

				A motion by a federal prisoner for postconviction relief under 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2255.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2255</a> is subject to a one-year time limitation that generally runs from the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final.  §2255, ¶6(1).  This case concerns the starting date for the one-year limitation.  It presents a narrow but recurring question on which courts of appeals have divided: When a defendant in a federal prosecution takes an unsuccessful direct appeal from a judgment of conviction, but does not next petition for a writ of certiorari from this Court, does the judgment become final for postconviction relief purposes (1) when the appellate court issues its mandate affirming the conviction, or, instead, (2) on the date, ordinarily 69 days later, when the time for filing a petition for certiorari expires?
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In accord with this Courts consistent understanding of finality in the context of collateral review, and the weight of lower court authority, we reject the issuance of the appellate court mandate as the triggering date.  For the purpose of starting the clock on §2255s one-year limitation period, we hold, a judgment of conviction becomes final when the time expires for filing a petition for certiorari contesting the appellate courts affirmation of the conviction.

				In 1997, petitioner Erick Cornell Clay was convicted of arson and distribution of cocaine base in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana.  On November 23, 1998, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed his convictions.  That courts mandate issued on December 15, 1998.  See Fed. Rules App. Proc. 40(a)(1) and 41(b) (when no petition for rehearing is filed, a court of appeals mandate issues 21 days after entry of judgment).  Clay did not file a petition for a writ of certiorari.  The time in which he could have petitioned for certiorari expired on February 22, 1999, 90 days after entry of the Court of Appeals judgment, see this Courts Rule 13(1), and 69 days after the issuance of the appellate courts mandate.

				On February 22, 2000one year and 69 days after the Court of Appeals issued its mandate and exactly one year after the time for seeking certiorari expiredClay filed a motion in the District Court, pursuant to

Congress has prescribed [a] 1-year period of limitation for such motions run[ning] from the latest of four specified dates.  §2255, ¶6.  Of the four dates, the only one relevant in this case, as in the generality of cases, is the first: the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final.  §2255, ¶6(1).

Six Courts of Appeals have parted ways with the Seventh and Fourth Circuits.  These courts hold that, for federal prisoners like Clay who do not file petitions for certiorari following affirmance of their convictions, §2255s one-year limitation period begins to run when the defendants time for seeking review by this Court expires.

				Finality is variously defined; like many legal terms, its precise meaning depends on context.  Typically, a federal judgment becomes final for appellate review and claim preclusion purposes when the district court disassociates itself from the case, leaving nothing to be done at the court of first instance save execution of the judgment.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Quackenbush
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Allstate Ins. Co.,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">712</a> (1996)
; Restatement (Second) of Judgments §13, Comment 
				<em>
					b
				</em>
				 (1980).  For other purposes, finality attaches at a different stage.  For example, for certain determinations under the Speedy Trial Act of 1974, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/3161.html" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. §3161</a>
            <em>
					et seq.
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				and under a now-repealed version of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33, several lower courts have held that finality attends issuance of the appellate courts mandate.  See Brief for 
				<em>
					Amicus Curiae
				</em>
				 by Invitation of the Court 2228 (hereinafter DeBruin Brief) (citing cases).  For the purpose of seeking review by this Court, in contrast, [t]he time to file a petition for a writ of certiorari runs from the date of entry of the judgment or order sought to be reviewed, and not from the issuance date of the mandate (or its equivalent under local practice).  This Courts Rule 13(3).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Here, the relevant context is postconviction relief, a context in which finality has a long-recognized, clear meaning: Finality attaches when this Court affirms a conviction on the merits on direct review or denies a petition for a writ of certiorari, or when the time for filing a certiorari petition expires.

				.  Had §2255 explicitly provided for the first of the two finality triggers set forth in §2244(d)(1)(A), one might indeed question the soundness of interpreting §2255 implicitly to incorporate §2244(d)(1)(A)s second trigger as well.  As written, however, §2255 does not qualify becomes final at all.  Using neither of the disjunctive phrases that follow the words became final in §2244(d)(1)(A), §2255 simply leaves becomes final undefined.

				Moreover, as Clay and the Government urge, see Brief for Petitioner 22; Reply Brief for United States 78, one can readily comprehend why Congress might have found it appropriate to spell out the meaning of final in §2244(d)(1)(A) but not in §2255.  Section 2244(d)(1) governs petitions by state prisoners.  In that context, a bare reference to became final might have suggested that finality assessments should be made by reference to state law rules that may differ from the general federal rule and vary from State to State.

Section 2263(a) prescribes a 180-day limitation period for such petitions running from final State court affirmance of the conviction and sentence on direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.  That period is tolled, however, from the date that a petition for certiorari is filed in the Supreme Court until the date of final disposition of the petition if a State prisoner files the petition to secure review by the Supreme Court of the affirmance of a capital sentence on direct review by the court of last resort of the State or other final State court decision on direct review.  §2263(b)(1).

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We do not find in §2263 cause to alter our reading of §2255.  First, 
				<em>
					amicus

				 reliance on §2263 encounters essentially the same problem as does his reliance on §2244(d)(1)(A): Section 2255, ¶6(1), refers to

				</em>
				 of the two events that §2263(a) identifies as possible starting points for the limitation periodaffirmance of the conviction and sentence on direct review and the expiration of the time for seeking such review.  Thus, reasoning by negative implication from §2263 does not justify the conclusion that §2255, ¶6(1)s limitation period begins to run at one of those times rather than the other.  Cf. 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 68.  Second, §2263(a) ties the applicable limitation period to affirmance of the conviction and sentence, while §2255, ¶6(1), ties the limitation period to the date when the judgment of conviction becomes final.  See

				We hold that, for federal criminal defendants who do not file a petition for certiorari with this Court on direct review, §2255s one-year limitation period starts to run when the time for seeking such review expires.  Under this rule, Clays §2255 petition was timely filed.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2255.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2255</a> is subject to a one-year time limitation that generally runs from the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final.  §2255, ¶6(1).  This case concerns the starting date for the one-year limitation.  It presents a narrow but recurring question on which courts of appeals have divided: When a defendant in a federal prosecution takes an unsuccessful direct appeal from a judgment of conviction, but does not next petition for a writ of certiorari from this Court, does the judgment become final for postconviction relief purposes (1) when the appellate court issues its mandate affirming the conviction, or, instead, (2) on the date, ordinarily 69 days later, when the time for filing a petition for certiorari expires?

				In accord with this Courts consistent understanding of finality in the context of collateral review, and the weight of lower court authority, we reject the issuance of the appellate court mandate as the triggering date.  For the purpose of starting the clock on §2255s one-year limitation period, we hold, a judgment of conviction becomes final when the time expires for filing a petition for certiorari contesting the appellate courts affirmation of the conviction.

				In 1997, petitioner Erick Cornell Clay was convicted of arson and distribution of cocaine base in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana.  On November 23, 1998, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed his convictions.  That courts mandate issued on December 15, 1998.  See Fed. Rules App. Proc. 40(a)(1) and 41(b) (when no petition for rehearing is filed, a court of appeals mandate issues 21 days after entry of judgment).  Clay did not file a petition for a writ of certiorari.  The time in which he could have petitioned for certiorari expired on February 22, 1999, 90 days after entry of the Court of Appeals judgment, see this Courts Rule 13(1), and 69 days after the issuance of the appellate courts mandate.

				Finality is variously defined; like many legal terms, its precise meaning depends on context.  Typically, a federal judgment becomes final for appellate review and claim preclusion purposes when the district court disassociates itself from the case, leaving nothing to be done at the court of first instance save execution of the judgment.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Quackenbush
				</em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">712</a> (1996)
; Restatement (Second) of Judgments §13, Comment 
				<em>
					b
				</em>
				 (1980).  For other purposes, finality attaches at a different stage.  For example, for certain determinations under the Speedy Trial Act of 1974, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/3161.html" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. §3161</a>

					et seq.
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				and under a now-repealed version of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33, several lower courts have held that finality attends issuance of the appellate courts mandate.  See Brief for 
				<em>
					Amicus Curiae
				</em>
				 by Invitation of the Court 2228 (hereinafter DeBruin Brief) (citing cases).  For the purpose of seeking review by this Court, in contrast, [t]he time to file a petition for a writ of certiorari runs from the date of entry of the judgment or order sought to be reviewed, and not from the issuance date of the mandate (or its equivalent under local practice).  This Courts Rule 13(3).

Three of the four time triggers under §2244(d)(1) closely track corresponding portions of §2255.  Compare §§2244(d)(1)(B)(D), with §2255, ¶¶6(2)(4).  But where §2255, ¶6(1), refers simply to the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final, §2244(d)(1)(A) speaks of the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.

				.  Had §2255 explicitly provided for the first of the two finality triggers set forth in §2244(d)(1)(A), one might indeed question the soundness of interpreting §2255 implicitly to incorporate §2244(d)(1)(A)s second trigger as well.  As written, however, §2255 does not qualify becomes final at all.  Using neither of the disjunctive phrases that follow the words became final in §2244(d)(1)(A), §2255 simply leaves becomes final undefined.

				Far from supporting the Seventh Circuits constricted reading of §2255, ¶6(1),

				<em>

				Moreover, as Clay and the Government urge, see Brief for Petitioner 22; Reply Brief for United States 78, one can readily comprehend why Congress might have found it appropriate to spell out the meaning of final in §2244(d)(1)(A) but not in §2255.  Section 2244(d)(1) governs petitions by state prisoners.  In that context, a bare reference to became final might have suggested that finality assessments should be made by reference to state law rules that may differ from the general federal rule and vary from State to State.

The words by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review make it clear that finality for the purpose of §2244(d)(1)(A) is to be determined by reference to a uniform federal rule.  Section 2255, however, governs only petitions by federal prisoners; within the federal system there is no comparable risk of varying rules to guard against.

				<em>
					Torres
				</em>
				, 211 F. 3d, at 840.  Chapter 154 of Title 28 governs certain habeas petitions filed by death-sentenced state prisoners.  Section 2263(a) prescribes a 180-day limitation period for such petitions running from final State court affirmance of the conviction and sentence on direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.  That period is tolled, however, from the date that a petition for certiorari is filed in the Supreme Court until the date of final disposition of the petition if a State prisoner files the petition to secure review by the Supreme Court of the affirmance of a capital sentence on direct review by the court of last resort of the State or other final State court decision on direct review.  §2263(b)(1).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We do not find in §2263 cause to alter our reading of §2255.  First, 
				<em>
					amicus
				</em>
				 reliance on §2263 encounters essentially the same problem as does his reliance on §2244(d)(1)(A): Section 2255, ¶6(1), refers to 
				<em>
					neither
				</em>
				 of the two events that §2263(a) identifies as possible starting points for the limitation periodaffirmance of the conviction and sentence on direct review and the expiration of the time for seeking such review.  Thus, reasoning by negative implication from §2263 does not justify the conclusion that §2255, ¶6(1)s limitation period begins to run at one of those times rather than the other.  Cf. 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 68.  Second, §2263(a) ties the applicable limitation period to affirmance of the conviction and sentence, while §2255, ¶6(1), ties the limitation period to the date when the judgment of conviction becomes final.  See 
				<em>

				, 211 F. 3d, at 845 (Hamilton, J., dissenting).  The

				We hold that, for federal criminal defendants who do not file a petition for certiorari with this Court on direct review, §2255s one-year limitation period starts to run when the time for seeking such review expires.  Under this rule, Clays §2255 petition was timely filed.  The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

						 Agreeing with the position advanced by the majority of the courts of appeals that have ruled on the question, the United States joins petitioner Clay in urging that Clays §2255 motion was timely filed.  We therefore invited David W. DeBruin to brief and argue this case, as amicus curiae, in support of the Seventh Circuits judgment.  Mr. DeBruins able advocacy permits us to decide the case satisfied that the relevant issues have been fully aired.

						 Although recognizing that the question is not presented in this case, Tr. of Oral Arg. 27, amicus suggests that §2255s limitation period starts to run upon issuance of the court of appeals mandate even in cases in which the defendant does petition for certiorari.  Id., at 2728, 3638, 4142.  As amicus also recognizes, however, id., at 41, courts of appeals have uniformly concluded that, if a prisoner petitions for certiorari, the contested conviction becomes final when the Supreme Court either denies the writ or issues a decision on the merits, United States v. Hicks, 283 F. 3d 380, 387 (CADC 2002).

				Respondent Yeskey was sentenced to 18 to 36 months in a Pennsylvania correctional facility, but was recommended for placement in a Motivational Boot Camp for first-time offenders, the successful completion of which would have led to his parole in just six months.  When he was refused admission because of his medical history of hypertension, he sued petitioners, Pennsylvanias Department of Corrections and several officials, alleging that the exclusion violated the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), Title II of which prohibits a public entity from discriminating against a qualified individual with a disability on account of that disability, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/12132.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §12132</a>.  The District Court dismissed for failure to state a claim, holding the ADA inapplicable to state prison inmates, but the Third Circuit reversed.

				 if applicable to federal intrusion upon the administration of state prisons, has been met.  Petitioners attempts to derive an intent not to cover prisons from the statutory references to the benefits of programs, and to qualified individual are rejected; some prison programs, such as this one, have benefits and are restricted to qualified inmates.  The statutes lack of ambiguity also requires rejection of petitioners appeal to the doctrine of constitutional doubt.  The Court does not address the issue whether applying the ADA to state prisons is a constitutional exercise of Congresss power under either the Commerce Clause or the

				While conducting a routine vehicle stop, police arrested petitioner Willie Davis, a passenger, for giving a false name.  After handcuffing Davis and securing the scene, the police searched the vehicle and found Daviss revolver.  Davis was then indicted on charges of being a felon in possession of a firearm.  In a suppression motion, Davis acknowledged that the search of the vehicle complied with existing Eleventh Circuit precedent interpreting 
				<em>
					New York
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Belton
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/453/454" class="subref" title="subref">453 U. S. 454</a>, but Davis raised a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> challenge to preserve the issue on appeal.  The District Court denied the motion, and Davis was convicted.  While his appeal was pending, this Court announced, in 
				<em>
					Arizona 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					Gant
				</em>
				, 556 U. S. ___, ___, a new rule governing automobile searches incident to arrests of recent occupants.  The Eleventh Circuit held, under 
				<em>
					Gant
				</em>
				, that the vehicle search at issue violated Daviss 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> rights, but the court declined to suppress the revolver and affirmed Daviss conviction.  
			</p>
        <p class="SYLCTE">
            <em>
					Held:
				</em>
				 Searches conducted in objectively reasonable reliance on binding appellate precedent are not subject to the exclusionary rule.  Pp. 620.
			</p>
        <p class="SYLCTF">
				
				    
				(a) The exclusionary rules sole purpose is to deter future 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> violations, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Herring
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/555/135" class="subref" title="subref">555 U. S. 135</a>, and its operation is limited to situations in which this purpose is thought most efficaciously served, 
				<em>

				 v. 
				<em>
					Calandra
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/414/338" class="subref" title="subref">414 U. S. 338</a>.  For exclusion to be appropriate, the deterrence benefits of suppression must outweigh the rules heavy costs.  Under a line of cases beginning with 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Leon, 
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/468/897" class="subref" title="subref">468 U. S. 897</a>, the result of this cost-benefit analysis turns on the flagrancy of the police misconduct at issue. 
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 909, 911.  When the police exhibit deliberate, reckless, or grossly negligent disregard for 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> rights, the benefits of exclusion tend to outweigh the costs.  
				<em>
					Herring, supra
				</em>
				, at 144.  But when the police act with an objectively reasonable good-faith belief that their conduct is lawful, or when their conduct involves only simple, isolated negligence, the deterrent value of suppression is diminished, and exclusion cannot pay its way.  See 
				<em>
					Leon
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra,
				</em>
				 at 909, 919, 908, n. 6; 
				<em>
					Herring
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 137.  Pp. 69. 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				(b) Although the search in this case turned out to be unconstitutional under 
				<em>
					Gant
				</em>
				, Davis concedes that the officers conduct was in strict compliance with then-binding Circuit law and was not culpable in any way.  Under this Courts exclusionary-rule precedents, the acknowledged absence of police culpability dooms Daviss claim.  Pp. 911. 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				(c) The Court is not persuaded by arguments that other considerations should prevent the good-faith exception from applying in this case.  Pp. 1119.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				
				    
				(1) The argument that the availability of the exclusionary rule to enforce new 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> precedent is a retroactivity issue, not a good-faith issue, is unpersuasive.  This argument erroneously conflates retroactivity with remedy.  Because Daviss conviction had not become final when 
				<em>
					Gant 
				</em>
				was announced, 
				<em>
					Gant
				</em>
				 applies retroactively in this case, and Davis may invoke its newly announced rule as a basis for seeking relief.  See 
				<em>
					Griffith 
				</em>
				v.
				<em>
					 Kentucky
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/479/314" class="subref" title="subref">479 U. S. 314</a>.  But retroactive application of a new rule does not determine the question of what remedy the defendant should obtain.  See 
				<em>
					Powell
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Nevada
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/511/79" class="subref" title="subref">511 U. S. 79</a>. The remedy of exclusion does not automatically follow from a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> violation, see 
				<em>
					Arizona
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Evans
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/514/1" class="subref" title="subref">514 U. S. 1</a>, and applies only where its purpose is effectively advanced,
				<em>
					 Illinois
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Krull
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/480/340" class="subref" title="subref">480 U. S. 340</a>.  The application of the good-faith exception here neither contravenes 
				<em>
					Griffith
				</em>
				 nor denies retroactive effect to 
				<em>
					Gant
				</em>
				.  Pp. 1216.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				
				    
				(2) Nor is the Court persuaded by the argument that applying the good-faith exception to searches conducted in reliance on binding precedent will stunt the development of 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> law by discouraging criminal defendants from attacking precedent.  Facilitating the overruling of precedent has never been a relevant consideration in this Courts exclusionary-rule cases.  In any event, applying the good-faith exception in this context will not prevent this Courts review of 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> precedents.  If precedent from a federal court of appeals or state court of last resort upholds a particular type of search or seizure, defendants in jurisdictions where the question remains open will still have an undiminished incentive to litigate the issue, and this Court can grant certiorari in one of those cases.  Daviss claim that 
				<em>
					this 
				</em>
				Courts 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> precedents will be effectively insulated from challenge is overstated.  In many cases, defendants will test this Courts 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> precedents by arguing that they are distinguishable.  And at most, this argument might suggest that, in a future case, the Court could allow a petitioner who secures a decision overruling one of this Courts precedents to obtain suppression of evidence in that one case.  Pp. 1619.

				The 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> protects the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures, but it is silent about how this right is to be enforced.  To supplement
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				the bare text, this Court created the exclusionary rule, a deterrent sanction that bars the prosecution from introducing evidence obtained by way of a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> violation.  The question here is whether to apply this sanction when the police conduct a search in compliance with binding precedent that is later overruled.  Because suppression would do nothing to deter police misconduct in these circumstances, and because it would come at a high cost to both the truth and the public safety, we hold that searches conducted in objectively reasonable reliance on binding appellate precedent are not subject to the exclusionary rule.

In an opinion that repeatedly stressed the need for a straightforward, workable rule to guide police conduct, the Court announced that when a policeman has made a lawful custodial arrest of the occupant of an automobile, he may, as a contemporaneous incident of that arrest, search the passenger compartment of that automobile.

				For years,

				.  On an April evening in 2007, police officers in Greenville, Alabama, conducted a routine traffic stop that eventually resulted in the arrests of driver Stella Owens (for driving while intoxicated) and passenger Willie Davis (for giving a false name to police).  The police handcuffed both Owens and Davis, and they placed the arrestees in the back of separate patrol cars.  The police then searched the passenger compartment of Owenss vehicle and found a revolver inside Daviss jacket pocket.

				he raised a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> challenge to preserve the issue for review on appeal.  App. 15.  The District Court denied the motion, and Davis was convicted on the firearms charge.

				The question in this case is whether to apply the exclusionary rule when the police conduct a search in objectively reasonable reliance on binding judicial precedent.  At the time of the search at issue here, we had not yet decided 
				<em>
					Arizona
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Gant

				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/453/454" class="subref" title="subref">453 U. S. 454</a>, to establish a bright-line rule authorizing the search of a vehicles passenger compartment incident to a recent occupants arrest.  
				<em>
					Gonzalez
				</em>
				, 71 F. 3d, at 825.  The search incident to Daviss arrest in this case followed the Eleventh Circuits 
				<em>
					Gonzalez
				</em>
				 precedent to the letter.  Although the search turned out to be unconstitutional under 
				<em>
					Gant
				</em>
				, all agree that the officers conduct was in strict compliance with then-binding Circuit law and was not culpable in any way.  See Brief for Petitioner 49 (suppression in this case would impl[y] no assignment of blame).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Under our exclusionary-rule precedents, this acknowledged absence of police culpability dooms Daviss claim.  Police practices trigger the harsh sanction of exclusion only when they are deliberate enough to yield meaningfu[l] deterrence, and culpable enough to be worth the price paid by the justice system.  
				<em>
					Herring
				</em>
				, 555 U. S., at 144.  The conduct of the officers here was neither of these things.  The officers who conducted the search did not violate Daviss 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> rights deliberately, recklessly, or with gross negligence.  
				<em>
					See ibid.
				</em>
				  Nor does this case involve any recurring or systemic negligence on the part of law enforcement.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  The police acted in strict compliance with binding precedent, and their behavior was not wrongful.  Unless the exclusionary rule is to become a strict-liability regime, it can have no application in this case.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Indeed, in 27 years of practice under 
				<em>
					Leon
				</em>
				s good-faith exception, we have never applied the exclusionary rule to suppress evidence obtained as a result of nonculpable, innocent police conduct.  
				<em>
					Herring

				, or on an erroneous warrant record in a government database, 
				<em>
					Herring

				<em>

				About all that exclusion would deter in this case is conscientious police work.  Responsible law-enforcement officers will take care to learn what is required of them under

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Our retroactivity jurisprudence is concerned with whether, as a categorical matter, a new rule is available on direct review as a 
				<em>
					potential
				</em>
				 ground for relief.  Retroactive application under 
				<em>
					Griffith
				</em>
				 lifts what would otherwise be a categorical bar to obtaining redress for the governments violation of a newly announced constitutional rule.  See 
				<em>
					Danforth
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra,
				</em>
				 at 271, n. 5 (noting that it may make more sense to speak in terms of the redressability of violations of new rules, rather than the retroactivity of such new rules).  Retroactive application does not, however, determine what appropriate remedy (if any) the defendant should obtain.  See

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">189</a> (1990)
 (plurality opinion) ([T]he Court has never equated its retroactivity principles with remedial principles).  As a result, the retroactive application of a new rule of substantive 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> law 
				<em>
					raises
				</em>
				 the question whether a suppression remedy applies; it does not answer that question.  See 
				<em>
					Leon
				</em>
				, 468 U. S., at 906 (Whether the exclusionary sanction is appropriately imposed in a particular case … is an issue separate from the question whether the

				When this Court announced its decision in

				 therefore applies retroactively to this case.  Davis may invoke its newly announced rule of substantive 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> law as a basis for seeking relief.  See 
				<em>
					Griffith
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 326, 328.  The question, then, becomes one of remedy, and on that issue Davis seeks application of the exclusionary rule.  But exclusion of evidence does not automatically follow from the fact that a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> violation occurred.  See 
				<em>

				The dissent and Davis recognize that at least some of the established exceptions to the exclusionary rule limit its availability in cases involving new 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> rules.  Suppression would thus be inappropriate, the dissent and Davis acknowledge, if the inevitable-discovery exception were applicable in this case.  See 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, at 3; Reply Brief for Petitioner 22 (Doctrines such as inevitable discovery, independent source, attenuated basis, [and] standing … sharply limit the impact of newly-announced rules).  The good-faith exception, however, is no less an established limit on the

				It is true that, under the old retroactivity regime of 
				<em>
					Linkletter
				</em>
				, the Courts decisions on the retroactivity prob-lem in the context of the exclusionary rule did take

It does not follow, however, that reliance on binding precedent is irrelevant in applying the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule.  When this Court adopted the good-faith exception in 
				<em>

				</em>
				, the Courts opinion explicitly relied on 
				<em>
					Peltier 
				</em>
				and imported its reasoning into the good-faith inquiry.  See 468 U. S., at 918919.  That reasonable reliance by police was once a factor in our retroactivity cases does not make it any less relevant under our

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> law.  With no possibility of suppression, criminal defendants will have no incentive, Davis maintains, to request that courts overrule precedent.

				This argument is difficult to reconcile with our modern understanding of the role of the exclusionary rule.  We have never held that facilitating the overruling of precedent is a relevant consideration in an exclusionary-rule case.  Rather, we have said time and again that the 
				<em>
					sole
				</em>
				 purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter misconduct by law enforcement.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 
				<em>

				<em>

				</em>
				 at 14 (historically designed as a means of deterring police misconduct).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				We have also repeatedly rejected efforts to expand the focus of the exclusionary rule beyond deterrence of culpable police conduct.  In 
				<em>
					Leon,
				</em>
				 for example, we made clear that the exclusionary rule is designed to deter police misconduct rather than to punish the errors of judges.  468 U. S., at 916; see 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 918 (If exclusion of evidence obtained pursuant to a subsequently invalidated warrant is to have any deterrent effect … it must alter the behavior of individual law enforcement officers or the policies of their departments).  
				<em>
					Krull
				</em>
				 too noted that legislators, like judicial officers, are not the focus of the exclusionary rule. 480 U. S., at 350.  And in
				<em>
					 Evans
				</em>
				, we said that the exclusionary rule was aimed at deterring police misconduct, not mistakes by court employees.  514 U. S., at 14.  These cases do not suggest that the exclusionary rule should be modified to serve a purpose other than deterrence of culpable law-enforcement conduct.

				And in any event, applying the good-faith exception in this context will not prevent judicial reconsideration of prior 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> precedents.  In most instances, as in this case, the precedent sought to be challenged will be a decision of a Federal Court of Appeals or State Supreme Court.  But a good-faith exception for objectively reasonable reliance on binding precedent will not prevent review and correction of such decisions.  This Court reviews criminal convictions from 12 Federal Courts of Appeals, 50 state courts of last resort, and the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.  If one or even many of these courts uphold a particular type of search or seizure, defendants in jurisdictions in which the question remains open will still have an undiminished incentive to litigate the issue.  This Court can then grant certiorari, and the de-velopment of 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> law will in no way be stunted.

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> grounds, the good-faith exception may prevent the exclusionary rule from applying in every case pending when [the statute] is overturned.  Post, at 3.  This result does not make the Courts newly announced rule of 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> law any less retroactive.  It simply limits the applicability of a suppression remedy.  See Krull, supra, at 354355, n. 11.

						 Davis also asserts that a good-faith rule would permit new

For reasons discussed in connection with Daviss argument that application of the good-faith exception here would revive the Linkletter regime, this argument conflates the question of retroactivity with the question of remedy.

						 The dissent does not dispute this point, but it claims that the good-faith exception will prevent us from rely[ing] upon lower courts to work out

						 Davis contends that a criminal defendant will lack Article III standing to challenge an existing 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> precedent if the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule precludes the defendant from obtaining relief based on police conduct that conformed to that precedent.  This argument confuses weakness on the merits with absence of Article III standing.  See ASARCO Inc. v. Kadish, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/490/605" class="subref" title="subref">490 U. S. 605</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">624</a> (1989)
 (standing does not  depen[d] on the merits of [a claim] ).  And as a practical matter, the argument is also overstated.  In many instances, as in Gant, see 556 U. S., at __ (slip op., at 8), defendants will not simply concede that the police conduct conformed to the precedent; they will argue instead that the police conduct did not fall within the scope of the precedent.


In any event, even if some criminal defendants will be unable to challenge some precedents for the reason that Davis suggests, that provides no good reason for refusing to apply the good-faith exception.  As noted, the exclusionary rule is not a personal right, see Stone, 428 U. S., at 486, 490, and therefore the rights of these defendants will not be impaired.  And because (at least in almost all instances) the precedent can be challenged by others, 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> case law will not be insulated from reconsideration.

				The

				the bare text, this Court created the exclusionary rule, a deterrent sanction that bars the prosecution from introducing evidence obtained by way of a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> violation.  The question here is whether to apply this sanction when the police conduct a search in compliance with binding precedent that is later overruled.  Because suppression would do nothing to deter police misconduct in these circumstances, and because it would come at a high cost to both the truth and the public safety, we hold that searches conducted in objectively reasonable reliance on binding appellate precedent are not subject to the exclusionary rule.

				The search at issue in this case took place a full two years before this Court announced its new rule in

				.  On an April evening in 2007, police officers in Greenville, Alabama, conducted a routine traffic stop that eventually resulted in the arrests of driver Stella Owens (for driving while intoxicated) and passenger Willie Davis (for giving a false name to police).  The police handcuffed both Owens and Davis, and they placed the arrestees in the back of separate patrol cars.  The police then searched the passenger compartment of Owenss vehicle and found a revolver inside Daviss jacket pocket.

				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				the revolver, Davis acknowledged that the officers search fully complied with existing Eleventh Circuit precedent.  App. 1315.  Like most courts, the Eleventh Circuit had long read

				he raised a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> challenge to preserve the issue for review on appeal.  App. 15.  The District Court denied the motion, and Davis was convicted on the firearms charge.

				The question in this case is whether to apply the exclusionary rule when the police conduct a search in objectively reasonable reliance on binding judicial precedent.  At the time of the search at issue here, we had not yet decided 
				<em>
					Arizona
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Gant
				</em>
				, 556 U. S. ___, and the Eleventh Circuit had interpreted our decision in 
				<em>
					New York
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Belton
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/453/454" class="subref" title="subref">453 U. S. 454</a>, to establish a bright-line rule authorizing the search of a vehicles passenger compartment incident to a recent occupants arrest.  
				<em>
					Gonzalez
				</em>
				, 71 F. 3d, at 825.  The search incident to Daviss arrest in this case followed the Eleventh Circuits 
				<em>
					Gonzalez
				</em>
				 precedent to the letter.  Although the search turned out to be unconstitutional under 
				<em>
					Gant
				</em>
				, all agree that the officers conduct was in strict compliance with then-binding Circuit law and was not culpable in any way.  See Brief for Petitioner 49 (suppression in this case would impl[y] no assignment of blame).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Under our exclusionary-rule precedents, this acknowledged absence of police culpability dooms Daviss claim.  Police practices trigger the harsh sanction of exclusion only when they are deliberate enough to yield meaningfu[l] deterrence, and culpable enough to be worth the price paid by the justice system.  
				<em>
					Herring
				</em>
				, 555 U. S., at 144.  The conduct of the officers here was neither of these things.  The officers who conducted the search did not violate Daviss 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> rights deliberately, recklessly, or with gross negligence.  
				<em>
					See ibid.
				</em>
				  Nor does this case involve any recurring or systemic negligence on the part of law enforcement.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  The police acted in strict compliance with binding precedent, and their behavior was not wrongful.  Unless the exclusionary rule is to become a strict-liability regime, it can have no application in this case.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Indeed, in 27 years of practice under 
				<em>
					Leon
				</em>
				s good-faith exception, we have never applied the exclusionary rule to suppress evidence obtained as a result of nonculpable, innocent police conduct.  
				<em>
					Herring
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 144.  If the police in this case had reasonably relied on a warrant in conducting their search, see 
				<em>

				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, or on an erroneous warrant record in a government database, 
				<em>
					Herring
				</em>
				, 
				<em>

            </a>
				 we would swiftly conclude that  [p]enalizing the officer for the legislatures error … cannot logically contribute to the deterrence of 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> violations.   See 
				<em>
					Krull
				</em>
				, 480 U. S., at 350.  The same should be true of Daviss attempt here to  [p]enaliz[e] the officer for the [appellate judges] error.   See 
				<em>
					ibid
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				About all that exclusion would deter in this case is conscientious police work.  Responsible law-enforcement officers will take care to learn what is required of them under 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> precedent and will conform their conduct to these rules.  
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				, 547 U. S., at 599.  But by the same token, when binding appellate precedent specifically 
				<em>
					authorizes
				</em>
				 a particular police practice, well-trained officers will and should use that tool to fulfill their crime-detection and public-safety responsibilities.  An of-ficer who conducts a search in reliance on binding appellate precedent does no more than  ac[t] as a reasonable officer would and should act  under the circumstances.

				The dissent and Davis recognize that at least some of the established exceptions to the exclusionary rule limit its availability in cases involving new 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> rules.  Suppression would thus be inappropriate, the dissent and Davis acknowledge, if the inevitable-discovery exception were applicable in this case.  See

				</em>
				, at 3; Reply Brief for Petitioner 22 (Doctrines such as inevitable discovery, independent source, attenuated basis, [and] standing … sharply limit the impact of newly-announced rules).  The good-faith exception, however, is no less an established limit on the

				It is true that, under the old retroactivity regime of 
				<em>

				</em>
				, the Courts decisions on the retroactivity prob-lem in the context of the exclusionary rule did take

It does not follow, however, that reliance on binding precedent is irrelevant in applying the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule.  When this Court adopted the good-faith exception in 
				<em>
					Leon
				</em>
				, the Courts opinion explicitly relied on 
				<em>
					Peltier 
				</em>
				and imported its reasoning into the good-faith inquiry.  See 468 U. S., at 918919.  That reasonable reliance by police was once a factor in our retroactivity cases does not make it any less relevant under our

				This argument is difficult to reconcile with our modern understanding of the role of the exclusionary rule.  We have never held that facilitating the overruling of precedent is a relevant consideration in an exclusionary-rule case.  Rather, we have said time and again that the 
				<em>
					sole
				</em>
				 purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter misconduct by law enforcement.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				,

				</em>
				 at 14 (historically designed as a means of deterring police misconduct).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				We have also repeatedly rejected efforts to expand the focus of the exclusionary rule beyond deterrence of culpable police conduct.  In 
				<em>
					Leon,
				</em>
				 for example, we made clear that the exclusionary rule is designed to deter police misconduct rather than to punish the errors of judges.  468 U. S., at 916; see 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 918 (If exclusion of evidence obtained pursuant to a subsequently invalidated warrant is to have any deterrent effect … it must alter the behavior of individual law enforcement officers or the policies of their departments).  
				<em>
					Krull
				</em>
				 too noted that legislators, like judicial officers, are not the focus of the exclusionary rule. 480 U. S., at 350.  And in
				<em>
					 Evans
				</em>
				, we said that the exclusionary rule was aimed at deterring police misconduct, not mistakes by court employees.  514 U. S., at 14.  These cases do not suggest that the exclusionary rule should be modified to serve a purpose other than deterrence of culpable law-enforcement conduct.

				And in any event, applying the good-faith exception in this context will not prevent judicial reconsideration of prior 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> precedents.  In most instances, as in this case, the precedent sought to be challenged will be a decision of a Federal Court of Appeals or State Supreme Court.  But a good-faith exception for objectively reasonable reliance on binding precedent will not prevent review and correction of such decisions.  This Court reviews criminal convictions from 12 Federal Courts of Appeals, 50 state courts of last resort, and the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.  If one or even many of these courts uphold a particular type of search or seizure, defendants in jurisdictions in which the question remains open will still have an undiminished incentive to litigate the issue.  This Court can then grant certiorari, and the de-velopment of

We fail to see how this distinction makes any difference.  The same could be saidindeed, the same was saidof searches conducted in reasonable reliance on statutes.  See Krull, 480 U.

This result does not make the Courts newly announced rule of 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> law any less retroactive.  It simply limits the applicability of a suppression remedy.  See Krull, supra, at 354355, n. 11.

						 Davis contends that a criminal defendant will lack Article III standing to challenge an existing 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> precedent if the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule precludes the defendant from obtaining relief based on police conduct that conformed to that precedent.  This argument confuses weakness on the merits with absence of Article III standing.  See ASARCO Inc. v. Kadish, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/490/605" class="subref" title="subref">490 U. S. 605</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">624</a> (1989)
 (standing does not  depen[d] on the merits of [a claim] ).  And as a practical matter, the argument is also overstated.  In many instances, as in Gant, see 556 U. S., at __ (slip op., at 8), defendants will not simply concede that the police conduct conformed to the precedent; they will argue instead that the police conduct did not fall within the scope of the precedent.


In any event, even if some criminal defendants will be unable to challenge some precedents for the reason that Davis suggests, that provides no good reason for refusing to apply the good-faith exception.  As noted, the exclusionary rule is not a personal right, see Stone, 428 U. S., at 486, 490, and therefore the rights of these defendants will not be impaired.  And because (at least in almost all instances) the precedent can be challenged by others, 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> case law will not be insulated from reconsideration.

The question here is whether to apply this sanction when the police conduct a search in compliance with binding precedent that is later overruled.

				For years, 
				<em>
					Belton
				</em>
				 was widely understood to have set down a simple, bright-line rule.  Numerous courts read
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				the decision to authorize automobile searches incident to arrests of recent occupants, regardless of whether the arrestee in any particular case was within reaching distance of the vehicle at the time of the search.  See

				 as a case in which four unsecured arrestees presented an immediate risk of loss of evidence and an obvious threat to [a] lone officers safety.  216 Ariz., at 4, 162 P. 3d, at 643.  The court held that where no such exigencies exis[t]where the arrestee has been subdued and the scene securedthe rule of

				The search at issue in this case took place a full two years before this Court announced its new rule in 
				<em>
					Gant
				</em>
				.  On an April evening in 2007, police officers in Greenville, Alabama, conducted a routine traffic stop that eventually resulted in the arrests of driver Stella Owens (for driving while intoxicated) and passenger Willie Davis (for giving a false name to police).  The police handcuffed both Owens and Davis, and they placed the arrestees in the back of separate patrol cars.  The police then searched the passenger compartment of Owenss vehicle and found a revolver inside Daviss jacket pocket.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Davis was indicted in the Middle District of Alabama on one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/922.html#g_1" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. §922(g)(1)</a>.  In his motion to suppress
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				the revolver, Davis acknowledged that the officers search fully complied with existing Eleventh Circuit precedent.  App. 1315.  Like most courts, the Eleventh Circuit had long read 
				<em>
					Belton 
				</em>
				to establish a bright-line rule authorizing substantially contemporaneous vehicle searches incident to arrests of recent occupants.  See 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Gonzalez
				</em>
				, 71 F. 3d 819, 822, 824827 (CA11 1996) (upholding automobile search conducted after the defendant had been pulled from the vehicle, handcuffed, laid on the ground, and placed under arrest).  Davis recognized that the Dis-trict Court was obligated to follow this precedent, but
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				he raised a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> challenge to preserve the issue for review on appeal.  App. 15.  The District Court denied the motion, and Davis was convicted on the firearms charge.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				While Daviss appeal was pending, this Court decided 
				<em>
					Gant
				</em>
				.  The Eleventh Circuit, in the opinion below, applied 
				<em>
					Gant
				</em>
				s new rule and held that the vehicle search incident to Daviss arrest violated [his] 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> rights.  598 F. 3d 1259, 1263 (CA11 2010).  As for whether this constitutional violation warranted suppression, the Eleventh Circuit viewed that as a separate issue that turned on the potential of exclusion to deter wrongful police conduct.

				The question in this case is whether to apply the exclusionary rule when the police conduct a search in objectively reasonable reliance on binding judicial precedent.  At the time of the search at issue here, we had not yet decided

					Gonzalez
				</em>
				, 71 F. 3d, at 825.  The search incident to Daviss arrest in this case followed the Eleventh Circuits 
				<em>

				</em>
				 precedent to the letter.  Although the search turned out to be unconstitutional under 
				<em>
					Gant
				</em>
				, all agree that the officers conduct was in strict compliance with then-binding Circuit law and was not culpable in any way.  See Brief for Petitioner 49 (suppression in this case would impl[y] no assignment of blame).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Under our exclusionary-rule precedents, this acknowledged absence of police culpability dooms Daviss claim.  Police practices trigger the harsh sanction of exclusion only when they are deliberate enough to yield meaningfu[l] deterrence, and culpable enough to be worth the price paid by the justice system.  
				<em>
					Herring
				</em>
				, 555 U. S., at 144.  The conduct of the officers here was neither of these things.  The officers who conducted the search did not violate Daviss 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> rights deliberately, recklessly, or with gross negligence.  
				<em>
					See ibid.
				</em>
				  Nor does this case involve any recurring or systemic negligence on the part of law enforcement.  
				<em>

				</em>
				.  The police acted in strict compliance with binding precedent, and their behavior was not wrongful.  Unless the exclusionary rule is to become a strict-liability regime, it can have no application in this case.

				Indeed, in 27 years of practice under

				Our retroactivity jurisprudence is concerned with whether, as a categorical matter, a new rule is available on direct review as a

				 ground for relief.  Retroactive application under 
				<em>
					Griffith

				 at 271, n. 5 (noting that it may make more sense to speak in terms of the redressability of violations of new rules, rather than the retroactivity of such new rules).  Retroactive application does not, however, determine what appropriate remedy (if any) the defendant should obtain.  See

 (plurality opinion) ([T]he Court has never equated its retroactivity principles with remedial principles).  As a result, the retroactive application of a new rule of substantive 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> law 
				<em>
					raises
				</em>
				 the question whether a suppression remedy applies; it does not answer that question.  See 
				<em>
					Leon
				</em>
				, 468 U. S., at 906 (Whether the exclusionary sanction is appropriately imposed in a particular case … is an issue separate from the question whether the

				<em>
					Griffith
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra

				, at 326, 328.  The question, then, becomes one of remedy, and on that issue Davis seeks application of the exclusionary rule.  But exclusion of evidence does not automatically follow from the fact that a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> violation occurred.  See 
				<em>

				The dissent and Davis recognize that at least some of the established exceptions to the exclusionary rule limit its availability in cases involving new

				 at 14 (historically designed as a means of deterring police misconduct).

				We have also repeatedly rejected efforts to expand the focus of the exclusionary rule beyond deterrence of culpable police conduct.  In 
				<em>

				</em>
				 for example, we made clear that the exclusionary rule is designed to deter police misconduct rather than to punish the errors of judges.  468 U. S., at 916; see

				<em>
					Krull
				</em>
				 too noted that legislators, like judicial officers, are not the focus of the exclusionary rule. 480 U. S., at 350.  And in
				<em>
					 Evans
				</em>
				, we said that the exclusionary rule was aimed at deterring police misconduct, not mistakes by court employees.  514 U. S., at 14.  These cases do not suggest that the exclusionary rule should be modified to serve a purpose other than deterrence of culpable law-enforcement conduct.

				And in any event, applying the good-faith exception in this context will not prevent judicial reconsideration of prior

In most instances, as in this case, the precedent sought to be challenged will be a decision of a Federal Court of Appeals or State Supreme Court.  But a good-faith exception for objectively reasonable reliance on binding precedent will not prevent review and correction of such decisions.  This Court reviews criminal convictions from 12 Federal Courts of Appeals, 50 state courts of last resort, and the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.  If one or even many of these courts uphold a particular type of search or seizure, defendants in jurisdictions in which the question remains open will still have an undiminished incentive to litigate the issue.

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> precedents are rare.  Indeed, it has been more than 40 years since the Court last handed down a decision of the type to which Davis refers.

				At most, Daviss argument might suggest thatto prevent

We fail to see how this distinction makes any difference.  The same could be saidindeed, the same was saidof searches conducted in reasonable reliance on statutes.  See Krull, 480 U.

This result does not make the Courts newly announced rule of 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> law any less retroactive.  It simply limits the applicability of a suppression remedy.  See Krull, supra, at 354355, n. 11.

						 Davis also asserts that a good-faith rule would permit new

For reasons discussed in connection with Daviss argument that application of the good-faith exception here would revive the Linkletter regime, this argument conflates the question of retroactivity with the question of remedy.

						 The dissent does not dispute this point, but it claims that the good-faith exception will prevent us from rely[ing] upon lower courts to work out 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> differences among themselves.  Post, at 5.  If that is correct, then todays holding may well lead to more circuit splits in

						 Davis contends that a criminal defendant will lack Article III standing to challenge an existing 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> precedent if the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule precludes the defendant from obtaining relief based on police conduct that conformed to that precedent.  This argument confuses weakness on the merits with absence of Article III standing.  See ASARCO Inc. v. Kadish, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/490/605" class="subref" title="subref">490 U. S. 605</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">624</a> (1989)
 (standing does not  depen[d] on the merits of [a claim] ).  And as a practical matter, the argument is also overstated.  In many instances, as in Gant, see 556 U. S., at __ (slip op., at 8), defendants will not simply concede that the police conduct conformed to the precedent; they will argue instead that the police conduct did not fall within the scope of the precedent.


In any event, even if some criminal defendants will be unable to challenge some precedents for the reason that Davis suggests, that provides no good reason for refusing to apply the good-faith exception.  As noted, the exclusionary rule is not a personal right, see Stone, 428 U. S., at 486, 490, and therefore the rights of these defendants will not be impaired.  And because (at least in almost all instances) the precedent can be challenged by others, 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> case law will not be insulated from reconsideration.

				The

				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				the bare text, this Court created the exclusionary rule, a deterrent sanction that bars the prosecution from introducing evidence obtained by way of a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> violation.  The question here is whether to apply this sanction when the police conduct a search in compliance with binding precedent that is later overruled.  Because suppression would do nothing to deter police misconduct in these circumstances, and because it would come at a high cost to both the truth and the public safety, we hold that searches conducted in objectively reasonable reliance on binding appellate precedent are not subject to the exclusionary rule.

				The search at issue in this case took place a full two years before this Court announced its new rule in

				.  On an April evening in 2007, police officers in Greenville, Alabama, conducted a routine traffic stop that eventually resulted in the arrests of driver Stella Owens (for driving while intoxicated) and passenger Willie Davis (for giving a false name to police).  The police handcuffed both Owens and Davis, and they placed the arrestees in the back of separate patrol cars.  The police then searched the passenger compartment of Owenss vehicle and found a revolver inside Daviss jacket pocket.

				<span class="softbreak"></span>

				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				he raised a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> challenge to preserve the issue for review on appeal.  App. 15.  The District Court denied the motion, and Davis was convicted on the firearms charge.

				The question in this case is whether to apply the exclusionary rule when the police conduct a search in objectively reasonable reliance on binding judicial precedent.  At the time of the search at issue here, we had not yet decided 
				<em>
					Arizona

				 v. 
				<em>

				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/453/454" class="subref" title="subref">453 U. S. 454</a>, to establish a bright-line rule authorizing the search of a vehicles passenger compartment incident to a recent occupants arrest.  
				<em>
					Gonzalez
				</em>
				, 71 F. 3d, at 825.  The search incident to Daviss arrest in this case followed the Eleventh Circuits 
				<em>
					Gonzalez
				</em>
				 precedent to the letter.  Although the search turned out to be unconstitutional under 
				<em>
					Gant
				</em>
				, all agree that the officers conduct was in strict compliance with then-binding Circuit law and was not culpable in any way.  See Brief for Petitioner 49 (suppression in this case would impl[y] no assignment of blame).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Under our exclusionary-rule precedents, this acknowledged absence of police culpability dooms Daviss claim.  Police practices trigger the harsh sanction of exclusion only when they are deliberate enough to yield meaningfu[l] deterrence, and culpable enough to be worth the price paid by the justice system.  
				<em>
					Herring
				</em>
				, 555 U. S., at 144.  The conduct of the officers here was neither of these things.  The officers who conducted the search did not violate Daviss 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> rights deliberately, recklessly, or with gross negligence.  
				<em>
					See ibid.
				</em>
				  Nor does this case involve any recurring or systemic negligence on the part of law enforcement.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  The police acted in strict compliance with binding precedent, and their behavior was not wrongful.  Unless the exclusionary rule is to become a strict-liability regime, it can have no application in this case.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Indeed, in 27 years of practice under 
				<em>
					Leon
				</em>
				s good-faith exception, we have never applied the exclusionary rule to suppress evidence obtained as a result of nonculpable, innocent police conduct.  
				<em>
					Herring
				</em>

				<em>

				, at 144.  If the police in this case had reasonably relied on a warrant in conducting their search, see

				, or on an erroneous warrant record in a government database, 
				<em>

				 we would swiftly conclude that  [p]enalizing the officer for the legislatures error … cannot logically contribute to the deterrence of 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> violations.   See 
				<em>
					Krull

				About all that exclusion would deter in this case is conscientious police work.  Responsible law-enforcement officers will take care to learn what is required of them under

				The principal argument of both the dissent and Davis is that the exclusionary rules availability to enforce new

				In

				The dissent and Davis argue that applying the good-faith exception in this case is incompatible with our retroactivity precedent under 
				<em>

				, at 2; Reply Brief for Petitioner 37.  We think this argument conflates what are two distinct doctrines.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Our retroactivity jurisprudence is concerned with whether, as a categorical matter, a new rule is available on direct review as a 
				<em>
					potential
				</em>
				 ground for relief.  Retroactive application under 
				<em>
					Griffith
				</em>
				 lifts what would otherwise be a categorical bar to obtaining redress for the governments violation of a newly announced constitutional rule.  See 
				<em>
					Danforth
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra,
				</em>
				 at 271, n. 5 (noting that it may make more sense to speak in terms of the redressability of violations of new rules, rather than the retroactivity of such new rules).  Retroactive application does not, however, determine what appropriate remedy (if any) the defendant should obtain.  See 
				<em>
					Powell

				 v. 
				<em>
					Nevada
				</em>
				,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">84</a> (1994)
 (noting that it does not necessarily follow from retroactive application of a new rule that the defendant will gain … relief).  Remedy is a separate, analytically distinct issue.  Cf. 
				<em>
					American Trucking Assns., Inc.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">189</a> (1990)
 (plurality opinion) ([T]he Court has never equated its retroactivity principles with remedial principles).  As a result, the retroactive application of a new rule of substantive 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> law 
				<em>
					raises
				</em>
				 the question whether a suppression remedy applies; it does not answer that question.  See 
				<em>
					Leon
				</em>
				, 468 U. S., at 906 (Whether the exclusionary sanction is appropriately imposed in a particular case … is an issue separate from the question whether the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> rights of the party seeking to invoke the rule were violated by police conduct ).

				When this Court announced its decision in 
				<em>
					Gant
				</em>
				, Daviss conviction had not yet become final on direct review.  
				<em>
					Gant
				</em>
				 therefore applies retroactively to this case.  Davis may invoke its newly announced rule of substantive 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> law as a basis for seeking relief.  See 
				<em>
					Griffith
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 326, 328.  The question, then, becomes one of remedy, and on that issue Davis seeks application of the exclusionary rule.  But exclusion of evidence does not automatically follow from the fact that a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> violation occurred.  See 
				<em>
					Evans

				The dissent and Davis recognize that at least some of the established exceptions to the exclusionary rule limit its availability in cases involving new 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> rules.  Suppression would thus be inappropriate, the dissent and Davis acknowledge, if the inevitable-discovery exception were applicable in this case.  See 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, at 3; Reply Brief for Petitioner 22 (Doctrines such as inevitable discovery, independent source, attenuated basis, [and] standing … sharply limit the impact of newly-announced rules).  The good-faith exception, however, is no less an established limit on the

				It is true that, under the old retroactivity regime of 
				<em>
					Linkletter
				</em>
				, the Courts decisions on the retroactivity prob-lem in the context of the exclusionary rule did take
				<span class="softbreak"></span>

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/479/314" class="subref" title="subref">479 U. S. 314</a>.  It does not follow, however, that reliance on binding precedent is irrelevant in applying the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule.  When this Court adopted the good-faith exception in 
				<em>
					Leon
				</em>
				, the Courts opinion explicitly relied on 
				<em>
					Peltier 
				</em>
				and imported its reasoning into the good-faith inquiry.  See 468 U. S., at 918919.  That reasonable reliance by police was once a factor in our retroactivity cases does not make it any less relevant under our

				Davis also contends that applying the good-faith ex-ception to searches conducted in reliance on binding pre-cedent will stunt the development of 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> law.  With no possibility of suppression, criminal defendants will have no incentive, Davis maintains, to request that courts overrule precedent.

				This argument is difficult to reconcile with our modern understanding of the role of the exclusionary rule.  We have never held that facilitating the overruling of precedent is a relevant consideration in an exclusionary-rule case.  Rather, we have said time and again that the 
				<em>
					sole
				</em>
				 purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter misconduct by law enforcement.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 
				<em>

				, 468 U. S., at 990 ( adopted to deter unlawful searches by police );

				, 
				<em>
					supra,
				</em>
				 at 14 (historically designed as a means of deterring police misconduct).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				We have also repeatedly rejected efforts to expand the focus of the exclusionary rule beyond deterrence of culpable police conduct.  In 
				<em>
					Leon,
				</em>
				 for example, we made clear that the exclusionary rule is designed to deter police misconduct rather than to punish the errors of judges.  468 U. S., at 916; see 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 918 (If exclusion of evidence obtained pursuant to a subsequently invalidated warrant is to have any deterrent effect … it must alter the behavior of individual law enforcement officers or the policies of their departments).  
				<em>
					Krull
				</em>
				 too noted that legislators, like judicial officers, are not the focus of the exclusionary rule. 480 U. S., at 350.  And in
				<em>
					 Evans
				</em>
				, we said that the exclusionary rule was aimed at deterring police misconduct, not mistakes by court employees.  514 U. S., at 14.  These cases do not suggest that the exclusionary rule should be modified to serve a purpose other than deterrence of culpable law-enforcement conduct.

				And in any event, applying the good-faith exception in this context will not prevent judicial reconsideration of prior 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> precedents.  In most instances, as in this case, the precedent sought to be challenged will be a decision of a Federal Court of Appeals or State Supreme Court.  But a good-faith exception for objectively reasonable reliance on binding precedent will not prevent review and correction of such decisions.  This Court reviews criminal convictions from 12 Federal Courts of Appeals, 50 state courts of last resort, and the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.  If one or even many of these courts uphold a particular type of search or seizure, defendants in jurisdictions in which the question remains open will still have an undiminished incentive to litigate the issue.  This Court can then grant certiorari, and the de-velopment of

Ann. §222501(c) (2007) (When a lawful arrest is effected a law enforcement officer may reasonably search the person arrested and the area within such persons immediate presence for the purpose of … [d]iscovering the fruits, instrumentalities, or evidence of a crime).  The Kansas Supreme Court recently struck this provision down in light of Arizona v. Gant, 556 U. S. ___ (2009).  State v. Henning, 289 Kan. 136, 137, 209 P. 3d 711, 714 (2009).

						 The dissent argues that the good-faith exception is unlike … inevitable discovery because the former applies in all cases where the police reasonably rely on binding precedent, while the latter applies only upon occasion.  Post, at 3.  We fail to see how this distinction makes any difference.  The same could be saidindeed, the same was saidof searches conducted in reasonable reliance on statutes.  See Krull, 480 U. S., at 368369 (OConnor, J., dissenting) (arguing that result in Krull was inconsistent with Griffith).  When this Court strikes down a statute on 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> grounds, the good-faith exception may prevent the exclusionary rule from applying in every case pending when [the statute] is overturned.  Post, at 3.  This result does not make the Courts newly announced rule of 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> law any less retroactive.  It simply limits the applicability of a suppression remedy.  See Krull, supra, at 354355, n. 11.

, foreclose application of the good-faith exception in cases involving changing law.  Johnson distinguished Peltier and held that all

						 Davis also asserts that a good-faith rule would permit new 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> decisions to be applied only prospectively, thus amounting to a regime of rule-creation by advisory opinion.  Brief for Petitioner 23, 25.  For reasons discussed in connection with Daviss argument that application of the good-faith exception here would revive the Linkletter regime, this argument conflates the question of retroactivity with the question of remedy.

						 The dissent does not dispute this point, but it claims that the good-faith exception will prevent us from rely[ing] upon lower courts to work out 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> differences among themselves.  Post, at 5.  If that is correct, then todays holding may well lead to more circuit splits in

						 Davis contends that a criminal defendant will lack Article III standing to challenge an existing 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> precedent if the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule precludes the defendant from obtaining relief based on police conduct that conformed to that precedent.  This argument confuses weakness on the merits with absence of Article III standing.  See ASARCO Inc. v. Kadish, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/490/605" class="subref" title="subref">490 U. S. 605</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">624</a> (1989)
 (standing does not  depen[d] on the merits of [a claim] ).  And as a practical matter, the argument is also overstated.  In many instances, as in Gant, see 556 U. S., at __ (slip op., at 8), defendants will not simply concede that the police conduct conformed to the precedent; they will argue instead that the police conduct did not fall within the scope of the precedent.


In any event, even if some criminal defendants will be unable to challenge some precedents for the reason that Davis suggests, that provides no good reason for refusing to apply the good-faith exception.  As noted, the exclusionary rule is not a personal right, see Stone, 428 U. S., at 486, 490, and therefore the rights of these defendants will not be impaired.  And because (at least in almost all instances) the precedent can be challenged by others, 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> case law will not be insulated from reconsideration.

				The 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> protects the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures, but it is silent about how this right is to be enforced.  To supplement
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				the bare text, this Court created the exclusionary rule, a deterrent sanction that bars the prosecution from introducing evidence obtained by way of a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> violation.  The question here is whether to apply this sanction when the police conduct a search in compliance with binding precedent that is later overruled.  Because suppression would do nothing to deter police misconduct in these circumstances, and because it would come at a high cost to both the truth and the public safety, we hold that searches conducted in objectively reasonable reliance on binding appellate precedent are not subject to the exclusionary rule.

				The search at issue in this case took place a full two years before this Court announced its new rule in

On an April evening in 2007, police officers in Greenville, Alabama, conducted a routine traffic stop that eventually resulted in the arrests of driver Stella Owens (for driving while intoxicated) and passenger Willie Davis (for giving a false name to police).  The police handcuffed both Owens and Davis, and they placed the arrestees in the back of separate patrol cars.  The police then searched the passenger compartment of Owenss vehicle and found a revolver inside Daviss jacket pocket.

				<span class="softbreak"></span>

				he raised a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> challenge to preserve the issue for review on appeal.  App. 15.  The District Court denied the motion, and Davis was convicted on the firearms charge.

				The question in this case is whether to apply the exclusionary rule when the police conduct a search in objectively reasonable reliance on binding judicial precedent.  At the time of the search at issue here, we had not yet decided 
				<em>
					Arizona
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Gant
				</em>
				, 556 U. S. ___, and the Eleventh Circuit had interpreted our decision in 
				<em>
					New York
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Belton
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/453/454" class="subref" title="subref">453 U. S. 454</a>, to establish a bright-line rule authorizing the search of a vehicles passenger compartment incident to a recent occupants arrest.  
				<em>
					Gonzalez
				</em>
				, 71 F. 3d, at 825.  The search incident to Daviss arrest in this case followed the Eleventh Circuits 
				<em>
					Gonzalez
				</em>
				 precedent to the letter.  Although the search turned out to be unconstitutional under 
				<em>
					Gant
				</em>
				, all agree that the officers conduct was in strict compliance with then-binding Circuit law and was not culpable in any way.  See Brief for Petitioner 49 (suppression in this case would impl[y] no assignment of blame).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Under our exclusionary-rule precedents, this acknowledged absence of police culpability dooms Daviss claim.  Police practices trigger the harsh sanction of exclusion only when they are deliberate enough to yield meaningfu[l] deterrence, and culpable enough to be worth the price paid by the justice system.  
				<em>
					Herring
				</em>
				, 555 U. S., at 144.  The conduct of the officers here was neither of these things.  The officers who conducted the search did not violate Daviss 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> rights deliberately, recklessly, or with gross negligence.  
				<em>
					See ibid.
				</em>
				  Nor does this case involve any recurring or systemic negligence on the part of law enforcement.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  The police acted in strict compliance with binding precedent, and their behavior was not wrongful.  Unless the exclusionary rule is to become a strict-liability regime, it can have no application in this case.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Indeed, in 27 years of practice under 
				<em>
					Leon
				</em>
				s good-faith exception, we have never applied the exclusionary rule to suppress evidence obtained as a result of nonculpable, innocent police conduct.  
				<em>
					Herring
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 144.  If the police in this case had reasonably relied on a warrant in conducting their search, see 
				<em>

				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, or on an erroneous warrant record in a government database, 
				<em>
					Herring
				</em>
				, 
				<em>

            </a>
				 we would swiftly conclude that  [p]enalizing the officer for the legislatures error … cannot logically contribute to the deterrence of 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> violations.   See 
				<em>
					Krull
				</em>
				, 480 U. S., at 350.  The same should be true of Daviss attempt here to  [p]enaliz[e] the officer for the [appellate judges] error.   See 
				<em>
					ibid
				</em>
				.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				About all that exclusion would deter in this case is conscientious police work.  Responsible law-enforcement officers will take care to learn what is required of them under 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> precedent and will conform their conduct to these rules.  
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				, 547 U. S., at 599.  But by the same token, when binding appellate precedent specifically 
				<em>
					authorizes
				</em>
				 a particular police practice, well-trained officers will and should use that tool to fulfill their crime-detection and public-safety responsibilities.  An of-ficer who conducts a search in reliance on binding appellate precedent does no more than  ac[t] as a reasonable officer would and should act  under the circumstances.

				The dissent and Davis recognize that at least some of the established exceptions to the exclusionary rule limit its availability in cases involving new 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> rules.  Suppression would thus be inappropriate, the dissent and Davis acknowledge, if the inevitable-discovery exception were applicable in this case.  See

					post
				</em>
				, at 3; Reply Brief for Petitioner 22 (Doctrines such as inevitable discovery, independent source, attenuated basis, [and] standing … sharply limit the impact of newly-announced rules).  The good-faith exception, however, is no less an established limit on the

				It is true that, under the old retroactivity regime of 
				<em>
					Linkletter
				</em>
				, the Courts decisions on the retroactivity prob-lem in the context of the exclusionary rule did take

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/479/314" class="subref" title="subref">479 U. S. 314</a>.  It does not follow, however, that reliance on binding precedent is irrelevant in applying the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule.  When this Court adopted the good-faith exception in 
				<em>
					Leon
				</em>
				, the Courts opinion explicitly relied on 
				<em>
					Peltier 
				</em>
				and imported its reasoning into the good-faith inquiry.  See 468 U. S., at 918919.  That reasonable reliance by police was once a factor in our retroactivity cases does not make it any less relevant under our

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> law.  With no possibility of suppression, criminal defendants will have no incentive, Davis maintains, to request that courts overrule precedent.

				This argument is difficult to reconcile with our modern understanding of the role of the exclusionary rule.  We have never held that facilitating the overruling of precedent is a relevant consideration in an exclusionary-rule case.  Rather, we have said time and again that the 
				<em>
					sole
				</em>
				 purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter misconduct by law enforcement.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				,

				</em>
				 at 14 (historically designed as a means of deterring police misconduct).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				We have also repeatedly rejected efforts to expand the focus of the exclusionary rule beyond deterrence of culpable police conduct.  In 
				<em>
					Leon,
				</em>
				 for example, we made clear that the exclusionary rule is designed to deter police misconduct rather than to punish the errors of judges.  468 U. S., at 916; see 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 918 (If exclusion of evidence obtained pursuant to a subsequently invalidated warrant is to have any deterrent effect … it must alter the behavior of individual law enforcement officers or the policies of their departments).  
				<em>
					Krull
				</em>
				 too noted that legislators, like judicial officers, are not the focus of the exclusionary rule. 480 U. S., at 350.  And in
				<em>
					 Evans
				</em>
				, we said that the exclusionary rule was aimed at deterring police misconduct, not mistakes by court employees.  514 U. S., at 14.  These cases do not suggest that the exclusionary rule should be modified to serve a purpose other than deterrence of culpable law-enforcement conduct.

				And in any event, applying the good-faith exception in this context will not prevent judicial reconsideration of prior 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> precedents.  In most instances, as in this case, the precedent sought to be challenged will be a decision of a Federal Court of Appeals or State Supreme Court.  But a good-faith exception for objectively reasonable reliance on binding precedent will not prevent review and correction of such decisions.  This Court reviews criminal convictions from 12 Federal Courts of Appeals, 50 state courts of last resort, and the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.  If one or even many of these courts uphold a particular type of search or seizure, defendants in jurisdictions in which the question remains open will still have an undiminished incentive to litigate the issue.  This Court can then grant certiorari, and the de-velopment of

We fail to see how this distinction makes any difference.  The same could be saidindeed, the same was saidof searches conducted in reasonable reliance on statutes.  See Krull, 480 U.

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> grounds, the good-faith exception may prevent the exclusionary rule from applying in every case pending when [the statute] is overturned.  Post, at 3.  This result does not make the Courts newly announced rule of 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> law any less retroactive.  It simply limits the applicability of a suppression remedy.  See Krull, supra, at 354355, n. 11.

						 Davis contends that a criminal defendant will lack Article III standing to challenge an existing 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> precedent if the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule precludes the defendant from obtaining relief based on police conduct that conformed to that precedent.  This argument confuses weakness on the merits with absence of Article III standing.  See ASARCO Inc. v. Kadish, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/490/605" class="subref" title="subref">490 U. S. 605</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">624</a> (1989)
 (standing does not  depen[d] on the merits of [a claim] ).  And as a practical matter, the argument is also overstated.  In many instances, as in Gant, see 556 U. S., at __ (slip op., at 8), defendants will not simply concede that the police conduct conformed to the precedent; they will argue instead that the police conduct did not fall within the scope of the precedent.


In any event, even if some criminal defendants will be unable to challenge some precedents for the reason that Davis suggests, that provides no good reason for refusing to apply the good-faith exception.  As noted, the exclusionary rule is not a personal right, see Stone, 428 U. S., at 486, 490, and therefore the rights of these defendants will not be impaired.  And because (at least in almost all instances) the precedent can be challenged by others, 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> case law will not be insulated from reconsideration.

				This case does not present the markedly different question whether the exclusionary rule applies when the law governing the constitutionality of a particular search is unsettled.  As we previously recognized in deciding whether to apply a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> holding retroactively, when police decide to conduct a search or seizure in the absence of case law (or other authority) specifically sanctioning such action, exclusion of the evidence obtained may deter

The Court of Appeals recognized as much in limiting its application of the good-faith exception it articulated in this case to situations where its precedent on a given point [is] unequivocal.  598 F. 3d 1259, 1266 (CA11 2010); see

				<em>

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> violations where appellate precedent does not specifically authorize a certain practice and, if so, whether the benefits of exclusion would outweigh its costs are questions unanswered by our previous decisions.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The dissent suggests that todays decision essentially answers those questions, noting that an officer who conducts a search in the face of unsettled precedent is no more culpable than an officer who follows erroneous binding precedent.   
				<em>
					Post
				</em>
				, at 7 (opinion of 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Breyer
				</span>
				, J.).  The Court does not address this issue.  In my view, whether an officers conduct can be characterized as culpable is not itself dispositive.  We have never refused to apply the exclusionary rule where its application would appreciably deter 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> violations on the mere ground that the officers conduct could be characterized as nonculpable.  Rather, an officers culpability is relevant because it may inform the overarching inquiry whether exclusion would result in appreciable deterrence.  See 
				<em>

				, at 8 (The basic insight of the

				As stated, whether exclusion would result in appreciable deterrence in the circumstances of this case is a different question from whether exclusion would appreciably deter

				In 2009, in 
				<em>
					Arizona
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Gant
				</em>
				, 556 U. S. ___, this Court held that a police search of an automobile without a warrant violates the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> if the police have pre-viously removed the automobiles occupants and placed them securely in a squad car.  The present case involves these same circumstances, and it was pending on appeal when this Court decided 
				<em>
					Gant
				</em>
				.  Because 
				<em>
					Gant 
				</em>
				represents a shift in the Courts 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> jurisprudence,

				I agree with the Court about 
				<em>
					whether Gant

				<em>
					Linkletter
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				the Court determined a new rules retroactivity by looking to several different factors, including whether the new rule represented a clear break with the past and the degree of reliance by law enforcement authorities on the old standards.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				After 22 years of struggling with its 
				<em>
					Linkletter 
				</em>
				approach, however, the Court decided in 
				<em>
					Griffith 
				</em>
				that 
				<em>
					Linkletter  
				</em>
				had proved unfair and unworkable.  It then substituted a clearer approach, stating that a new rule for the conduct of criminal prosecutions is to be applied retroactively to all cases, state or federal, pending on direct review or not yet final, with no exception for cases in which the new rule constitutes a clear break with the past.  479 U.

				The Court goes on, however, to decide

				<em>

				new rule will apply.  And here it adds a fatal twist.  While conceding that, like the search in 
				<em>
					Gant, 
				</em>
				this search violated the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>, it holds that, unlike Gant
				<em>
					, 
				</em>
				this defendant is not entitled to a remedy.  That is be-cause the Court finds a new good faith exception which prevents application of the normal remedy for a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> violation, namely, suppression of the illegally seized evidence.

				At this point I can no longer agree with the Court.  A new good faith exception and this Courts retroactivity decisions are incompatible.  For one thing, the Courts distinction between (1) retroactive application of a new rule and (2) availability of a remedy is highly artificial and runs counter to precedent.  To determine that a new rule is retroactive 
				<em>
					is 
				</em>
				to determine that, at least in the normal case, there is a remedy.  As we have previously said, the source of a new rule is the Constitution itself, not any judicial power to create new rules of law; hence, [w]hat we are actually determining when we assess the retroactivity of a new rule is not the temporal scope of a newly announced right, but whether a violation of the right that occurred prior to the announcement of the new rule will entitle a criminal defendant to the relief sought.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">271</a> (2008)
.  The Courts good faith exception (unlike, say, inevitable discovery, a remedial doctrine that applies only upon occasion) creates a categorical bar to obtaining redress in 
				<em>
					every 
				</em>
				case pending when a precedent is overturned.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 1314.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				For another thing, the Courts holding re-creates the very problems that led the Court to abandon 
				<em>
					Linkletter
				</em>
				s approach to retroactivity in favor of 
				<em>
					Griffith
				</em>
				s
				<em>
					.
				</em>
				  One such problem concerns workability.  The Court says that its exception applies where there is objectively reasonable police reliance on binding appellate precedent.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 1, 19.  But to apply the term binding appellate precedent often requires resolution of complex questions of degree.  Davis conceded that he faced binding anti-
				<em>
					Gant 
				</em>
				precedent in the Eleventh Circuit.  But future litigants will be less forthcoming.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 18.  Indeed, those litigants will now have to create distinctions to show that previous Circuit precedent was not binding lest they find relief foreclosed even if they win their constitutional claim.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				At the same time, 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> precedents frequently require courts to slosh their way through the factbound morass of reasonableness. 

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">383</a> (2007)
.  Suppose an officers conduct is consistent with the language of a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> rule that a court of appeals announced in a case with clearly distinguishable facts?  Suppose the case creating the rele-vant precedent did not directly announce any general 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				rule but involved highly analogous facts?  What about a rule that all other jurisdictions, but not the defendants jurisdiction, had previously accepted?  What rules can be developed for determining when, where, and how these different kinds of precedents do, or do not, count as relevant binding precedent?  The 
				<em>
					Linkletter-
				</em>
				like result is likely complex legal argument and police force confusion.  See 
				<em>
					Williams
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>

				<em>

				</em>
				decisions as almost as difficult as trying to follow the tracks made by a beast of prey in search of its intended victim).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Another such problem concerns fairness.  Todays holding, like that in 
				<em>
					Linkletter
				</em>
				, violates basic norms of con-stitutional adjudication.  
				<em>
					Griffith
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra, 
				</em>
				at 322.  It treats the defendant in a case announcing a new rule one way while treating similarly situated defendants whose cases are pending on appeal in a different way.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1819.  Justice Harlan explained why this approach is wrong when he said:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				We cannot release criminals from jail merely because we think one case is a particularly appropriate one [to announce a constitutional doctrine] … .  Simply fishing one case from the stream of appellate review, using it as a vehicle for pronouncing new constitutional standards, and then permitting a stream of similar cases subsequently to flow by unaffected by that new rule constitute an indefensible departure from [our ordinary] model of judicial review.

				<em>

				, the Court embraced to a significant extent the comprehensive analysis presented by Justice Harlan.  479 U. S., at 322.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Of course, the Court may, as it suggests, avoid this un-fairness by refusing to apply the exclusionary rule even 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				to the defendant in the very case in which it announces a new rule.  But that approach would make matters worse.  What would then happen in the lower courts?  How would courts of appeals, for example, come to reconsider their prior decisions when other circuits cases lead them to believe those decisions may be wrong?  Why would a defendant seek to overturn any such decision?  After all, if the (incorrect) circuit precedent is clear, then even if 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				the defendant wins (on the constitutional question), he loses (on relief).  See 
				<em>

				</em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">301</a> (1967)
.  To what extent then could this Court rely upon lower courts to work out 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> differences among themselvesthrough circuit reconsideration of a precedent that other circuits have criticized?  See

				Perhaps more important, the Courts rationale for creating its new good faith exception threatens to undermine well-settled 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> law.  The Court correctly says that pre-
				<em>
					Gant
				</em>
				 Eleventh Circuit precedent had held that a 
				<em>
					Gant-
				</em>
				type search was constitutional; hence the police conduct in this case, consistent with that precedent, was innocent.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 10.  But the Court then finds this fact sufficient to create a new good faith exception to the exclusionary rule.  It reasons that the sole purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter future 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> violations, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 6.  The deterrence benefits of exclusion vary with the culpability of the law enforcement conduct at issue, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 8 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).  Those benefits are sufficient to jus-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				tify exclusion where police exhibit deliberate, reckless, 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				or grossly negligent disregard for 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> rights, 
				<em>
					ibid. 
				</em>
				(internal quotation marks omitted).  But those benefits do not justify exclusion where, as here, the police act with simple, isolated negligence or an objectively reasonable good-faith belief that their conduct is lawful,

				The fact that such exceptions are few and far between is understandable.  Defendants frequently move to suppress evidence on 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> grounds.  In many, perhaps most, of these instances the police, uncertain of how the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> applied to the particular factual circumstances they faced, will have acted in objective good faith.  Yet, in a significant percentage of these instances, courts will find that the police were wrong.  And, unless the police conduct falls into one of the exceptions previously noted, courts have required the suppression of the evidence seized.  1 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure §1.3, pp. 103104 (4th ed. 2004) (good faith exception has not yet been applied to warrantless searches and seizures beyond the rather special situations of

				But an officer who conducts a search that he believes complies with the Constitution but which, it ultimately turns out, falls just outside the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>s bounds is no more culpable than an officer who follows erroneous binding precedent.  Nor is an officer more culpable where circuit precedent is simply suggestive rather than binding, where it only describes how to treat roughly analogous instances, or where it just does not exist.  Thus, if the Court means what it now says, if it would place determinative weight upon the culpability of an individual officers conduct, and if it would apply the exclusionary rule only where a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> violation was deliberate, reckless, or grossly negligent, then the good faith exception will swallow the exclusionary rule.  Indeed, our broad dicta in

				In 2009, in 
				<em>
					Arizona
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Gant
				</em>
				, 556 U. S. ___, this Court held that a police search of an automobile without a warrant violates the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> if the police have pre-viously removed the automobiles occupants and placed them securely in a squad car.  The present case involves these same circumstances, and it was pending on appeal when this Court decided 
				<em>
					Gant
				</em>
				.  Because 
				<em>
					Gant 
				</em>
				represents a shift in the Courts

				<em>

				</em>
				,
				<em>

				After 22 years of struggling with its 
				<em>

				approach, however, the Court decided in 
				<em>

				</em>
				that 
				<em>
					Linkletter

				had proved unfair and unworkable.  It then substituted a clearer approach, stating that a new rule for the conduct of criminal prosecutions is to be applied retroactively to all cases, state or federal, pending on direct review or not yet final, with no exception for cases in which the new rule constitutes a clear break with the past.  479 U.

				The Court goes on, however, to decide

				<em>

				</em>
				this search violated the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>, it holds that, unlike Gant
				<em>
					, 
				</em>
				this defendant is not entitled to a remedy.  That is be-cause the Court finds a new good faith exception which prevents application of the normal remedy for a

				At this point I can no longer agree with the Court.  A new good faith exception and this Courts retroactivity decisions are incompatible.  For one thing, the Courts distinction between (1) retroactive application of a new rule and (2) availability of a remedy is highly artificial and runs counter to precedent.  To determine that a new rule is retroactive 
				<em>
					is 
				</em>
				to determine that, at least in the normal case, there is a remedy.  As we have previously said, the source of a new rule is the Constitution itself, not any judicial power to create new rules of law; hence, [w]hat we are actually determining when we assess the retroactivity of a new rule is not the temporal scope of a newly announced right, but whether a violation of the right that occurred prior to the announcement of the new rule will entitle a criminal defendant to the relief sought.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">271</a> (2008)
.  The Courts good faith exception (unlike, say, inevitable discovery, a remedial doctrine that applies only upon occasion) creates a categorical bar to obtaining redress in 
				<em>
					every 
				</em>
				case pending when a precedent is overturned.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 1314.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				For another thing, the Courts holding re-creates the very problems that led the Court to abandon 
				<em>
					Linkletter
				</em>
				s approach to retroactivity in favor of 
				<em>
					Griffith
				</em>
				s
				<em>
					.
				</em>
				  One such problem concerns workability.  The Court says that its exception applies where there is objectively reasonable police reliance on binding appellate precedent.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 1, 19.  But to apply the term binding appellate precedent often requires resolution of complex questions of degree.  Davis conceded that he faced binding anti-
				<em>
					Gant 
				</em>
				precedent in the Eleventh Circuit.  But future litigants will be less forthcoming.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 18.  Indeed, those litigants will now have to create distinctions to show that previous Circuit precedent was not binding lest they find relief foreclosed even if they win their constitutional claim.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				At the same time, 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> precedents frequently require courts to slosh their way through the factbound morass of reasonableness. 

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">383</a> (2007)
.  Suppose an officers conduct is consistent with the language of a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> rule that a court of appeals announced in a case with clearly distinguishable facts?  Suppose the case creating the rele-vant precedent did not directly announce any general 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				rule but involved highly analogous facts?  What about a rule that all other jurisdictions, but not the defendants jurisdiction, had previously accepted?  What rules can be developed for determining when, where, and how these different kinds of precedents do, or do not, count as relevant binding precedent?  The 
				<em>
					Linkletter-
				</em>
				like result is likely complex legal argument and police force confusion.  See 
				<em>
					Williams

				</em>
				decisions as almost as difficult as trying to follow the tracks made by a beast of prey in search of its intended victim).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Another such problem concerns fairness.  Todays holding, like that in 
				<em>
					Linkletter
				</em>
				, violates basic norms of con-stitutional adjudication.  
				<em>
					Griffith
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra, 
				</em>
				at 322.  It treats the defendant in a case announcing a new rule one way while treating similarly situated defendants whose cases are pending on appeal in a different way.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1819.  Justice Harlan explained why this approach is wrong when he said:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				We cannot release criminals from jail merely because we think one case is a particularly appropriate one [to announce a constitutional doctrine] … .  Simply fishing one case from the stream of appellate review, using it as a vehicle for pronouncing new constitutional standards, and then permitting a stream of similar cases subsequently to flow by unaffected by that new rule constitute an indefensible departure from [our ordinary] model of judicial review.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Of course, the Court may, as it suggests, avoid this un-fairness by refusing to apply the exclusionary rule even 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				to the defendant in the very case in which it announces a new rule.  But that approach would make matters worse.  What would then happen in the lower courts?  How would courts of appeals, for example, come to reconsider their prior decisions when other circuits cases lead them to believe those decisions may be wrong?  Why would a defendant seek to overturn any such decision?  After all, if the (incorrect) circuit precedent is clear, then even if 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				the defendant wins (on the constitutional question), he loses (on relief).  See

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">301</a> (1967)
.  To what extent then could this Court rely upon lower courts to work out 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> differences among themselvesthrough circuit reconsideration of a precedent that other circuits have criticized?  See

				Perhaps more important, the Courts rationale for creating its new good faith exception threatens to undermine well-settled 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> law.  The Court correctly says that pre-
				<em>
					Gant
				</em>
				 Eleventh Circuit precedent had held that a 
				<em>
					Gant-
				</em>
				type search was constitutional; hence the police conduct in this case, consistent with that precedent, was innocent.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 10.  But the Court then finds this fact sufficient to create a new good faith exception to the exclusionary rule.  It reasons that the sole purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter future 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> violations, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 6.  The deterrence benefits of exclusion vary with the culpability of the law enforcement conduct at issue, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 8 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).  Those benefits are sufficient to jus-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				tify exclusion where police exhibit deliberate, reckless, 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				or grossly negligent disregard for 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> rights, 
				<em>
					ibid. 
				</em>
				(internal quotation marks omitted).  But those benefits do not justify exclusion where, as here, the police act with simple, isolated negligence or an objectively reasonable good-faith belief that their conduct is lawful,

				The fact that such exceptions are few and far between is understandable.  Defendants frequently move to suppress evidence on 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> grounds.  In many, perhaps most, of these instances the police, uncertain of how the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> applied to the particular factual circumstances they faced, will have acted in objective good faith.  Yet, in a significant percentage of these instances, courts will find that the police were wrong.  And, unless the police conduct falls into one of the exceptions previously noted, courts have required the suppression of the evidence seized.  1 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure §1.3, pp. 103104 (4th ed. 2004) (good faith exception has not yet been applied to warrantless searches and seizures beyond the rather special situations of

				But an officer who conducts a search that he believes complies with the Constitution but which, it ultimately turns out, falls just outside the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>s bounds is no more culpable than an officer who follows erroneous binding precedent.  Nor is an officer more culpable where circuit precedent is simply suggestive rather than binding, where it only describes how to treat roughly analogous instances, or where it just does not exist.  Thus, if the Court means what it now says, if it would place determinative weight upon the culpability of an individual officers conduct, and if it would apply the exclusionary rule only where a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> violation was deliberate, reckless, or grossly negligent, then the good faith exception will swallow the exclusionary rule.  Indeed, our broad dicta in

				In 2009, in 
				<em>
					Arizona
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Gant
				</em>
				, 556 U. S. ___, this Court held that a police search of an automobile without a warrant violates the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> if the police have pre-viously removed the automobiles occupants and placed them securely in a squad car.  The present case involves these same circumstances, and it was pending on appeal when this Court decided 
				<em>
					Gant
				</em>
				.  Because 
				<em>
					Gant 
				</em>
				represents a shift in the Courts

				<em>
					Linkletter
				</em>
				,
				<em>

				After 22 years of struggling with its

				approach, however, the Court decided in 
				<em>

				</em>
				that 
				<em>
					Linkletter

				had proved unfair and unworkable.  It then substituted a clearer approach, stating that a new rule for the conduct of criminal prosecutions is to be applied retroactively to all cases, state or federal, pending on direct review or not yet final, with no exception for cases in which the new rule constitutes a clear break with the past.  479 U.

				The Court goes on, however, to decide

				<em>

				</em>
				this search violated the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>, it holds that, unlike Gant
				<em>
					, 
				</em>
				this defendant is not entitled to a remedy.  That is be-cause the Court finds a new good faith exception which prevents application of the normal remedy for a

				At this point I can no longer agree with the Court.  A new good faith exception and this Courts retroactivity decisions are incompatible.  For one thing, the Courts distinction between (1) retroactive application of a new rule and (2) availability of a remedy is highly artificial and runs counter to precedent.  To determine that a new rule is retroactive 
				<em>
					is 
				</em>
				to determine that, at least in the normal case, there is a remedy.  As we have previously said, the source of a new rule is the Constitution itself, not any judicial power to create new rules of law; hence, [w]hat we are actually determining when we assess the retroactivity of a new rule is not the temporal scope of a newly announced right, but whether a violation of the right that occurred prior to the announcement of the new rule will entitle a criminal defendant to the relief sought.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">271</a> (2008)
.  The Courts good faith exception (unlike, say, inevitable discovery, a remedial doctrine that applies only upon occasion) creates a categorical bar to obtaining redress in 
				<em>
					every 
				</em>
				case pending when a precedent is overturned.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 1314.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				For another thing, the Courts holding re-creates the very problems that led the Court to abandon 
				<em>
					Linkletter
				</em>
				s approach to retroactivity in favor of 
				<em>
					Griffith
				</em>
				s
				<em>
					.
				</em>
				  One such problem concerns workability.  The Court says that its exception applies where there is objectively reasonable police reliance on binding appellate precedent.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 1, 19.  But to apply the term binding appellate precedent often requires resolution of complex questions of degree.  Davis conceded that he faced binding anti-
				<em>
					Gant 
				</em>
				precedent in the Eleventh Circuit.  But future litigants will be less forthcoming.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 18.  Indeed, those litigants will now have to create distinctions to show that previous Circuit precedent was not binding lest they find relief foreclosed even if they win their constitutional claim.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				At the same time, 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> precedents frequently require courts to slosh their way through the factbound morass of reasonableness. 

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">383</a> (2007)
.  Suppose an officers conduct is consistent with the language of a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> rule that a court of appeals announced in a case with clearly distinguishable facts?  Suppose the case creating the rele-vant precedent did not directly announce any general 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				rule but involved highly analogous facts?  What about a rule that all other jurisdictions, but not the defendants jurisdiction, had previously accepted?  What rules can be developed for determining when, where, and how these different kinds of precedents do, or do not, count as relevant binding precedent?  The 
				<em>
					Linkletter-
				</em>
				like result is likely complex legal argument and police force confusion.  See 
				<em>
					Williams
				</em>

				</em>
				decisions as almost as difficult as trying to follow the tracks made by a beast of prey in search of its intended victim).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Another such problem concerns fairness.  Todays holding, like that in 
				<em>
					Linkletter
				</em>
				, violates basic norms of con-stitutional adjudication.  
				<em>
					Griffith
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra, 
				</em>
				at 322.  It treats the defendant in a case announcing a new rule one way while treating similarly situated defendants whose cases are pending on appeal in a different way.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1819.  Justice Harlan explained why this approach is wrong when he said:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				We cannot release criminals from jail merely because we think one case is a particularly appropriate one [to announce a constitutional doctrine] … .  Simply fishing one case from the stream of appellate review, using it as a vehicle for pronouncing new constitutional standards, and then permitting a stream of similar cases subsequently to flow by unaffected by that new rule constitute an indefensible departure from [our ordinary] model of judicial review.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Of course, the Court may, as it suggests, avoid this un-fairness by refusing to apply the exclusionary rule even 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				to the defendant in the very case in which it announces a new rule.  But that approach would make matters worse.  What would then happen in the lower courts?  How would courts of appeals, for example, come to reconsider their prior decisions when other circuits cases lead them to believe those decisions may be wrong?  Why would a defendant seek to overturn any such decision?  After all, if the (incorrect) circuit precedent is clear, then even if 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				the defendant wins (on the constitutional question), he loses (on relief).  See 
				<em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">301</a> (1967)
.  To what extent then could this Court rely upon lower courts to work out 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> differences among themselvesthrough circuit reconsideration of a precedent that other circuits have criticized?  See

				Perhaps more important, the Courts rationale for creating its new good faith exception threatens to undermine well-settled 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> law.  The Court correctly says that pre-
				<em>
					Gant
				</em>
				 Eleventh Circuit precedent had held that a 
				<em>
					Gant-
				</em>
				type search was constitutional; hence the police conduct in this case, consistent with that precedent, was innocent.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 10.  But the Court then finds this fact sufficient to create a new good faith exception to the exclusionary rule.  It reasons that the sole purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter future 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> violations, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 6.  The deterrence benefits of exclusion vary with the culpability of the law enforcement conduct at issue, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 8 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).  Those benefits are sufficient to jus-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				tify exclusion where police exhibit deliberate, reckless, 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				or grossly negligent disregard for

				The fact that such exceptions are few and far between is understandable.  Defendants frequently move to suppress evidence on 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> grounds.  In many, perhaps most, of these instances the police, uncertain of how the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> applied to the particular factual circumstances they faced, will have acted in objective good faith.  Yet, in a significant percentage of these instances, courts will find that the police were wrong.  And, unless the police conduct falls into one of the exceptions previously noted, courts have required the suppression of the evidence seized.  1 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure §1.3, pp. 103104 (4th ed. 2004) (good faith exception has not yet been applied to warrantless searches and seizures beyond the rather special situations of

				But an officer who conducts a search that he believes complies with the Constitution but which, it ultimately turns out, falls just outside the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>s bounds is no more culpable than an officer who follows erroneous binding precedent.  Nor is an officer more culpable where circuit precedent is simply suggestive rather than binding, where it only describes how to treat roughly analogous instances, or where it just does not exist.  Thus, if the Court means what it now says, if it would place determinative weight upon the culpability of an individual officers conduct, and if it would apply the exclusionary rule only where a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> violation was deliberate, reckless, or grossly negligent, then the good faith exception will swallow the exclusionary rule.  Indeed, our broad dicta in

				In 2009, in 
				<em>
					Arizona
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Gant
				</em>
				, 556 U. S. ___, this Court held that a police search of an automobile without a warrant violates the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> if the police have pre-viously removed the automobiles occupants and placed them securely in a squad car.  The present case involves these same circumstances, and it was pending on appeal when this Court decided 
				<em>
					Gant
				</em>
				.  Because 
				<em>
					Gant 
				</em>
				represents a shift in the Courts

				<em>
					Linkletter
				</em>
				,
				<em>

				After 22 years of struggling with its 
				<em>

				approach, however, the Court decided in 
				<em>
					Griffith 
				</em>
				that 
				<em>
					Linkletter

				had proved unfair and unworkable.  It then substituted a clearer approach, stating that a new rule for the conduct of criminal prosecutions is to be applied retroactively to all cases, state or federal, pending on direct review or not yet final, with no exception for cases in which the new rule constitutes a clear break with the past.  479 U.

				The Court goes on, however, to decide

				<em>

				new rule will apply.  And here it adds a fatal twist.  While conceding that, like the search in 
				<em>
					Gant, 
				</em>
				this search violated the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>, it holds that, unlike Gant
				<em>
					, 
				</em>
				this defendant is not entitled to a remedy.  That is be-cause the Court finds a new good faith exception which prevents application of the normal remedy for a

				At this point I can no longer agree with the Court.  A new good faith exception and this Courts retroactivity decisions are incompatible.  For one thing, the Courts distinction between (1) retroactive application of a new rule and (2) availability of a remedy is highly artificial and runs counter to precedent.  To determine that a new rule is retroactive 
				<em>
					is 
				</em>
				to determine that, at least in the normal case, there is a remedy.  As we have previously said, the source of a new rule is the Constitution itself, not any judicial power to create new rules of law; hence, [w]hat we are actually determining when we assess the retroactivity of a new rule is not the temporal scope of a newly announced right, but whether a violation of the right that occurred prior to the announcement of the new rule will entitle a criminal defendant to the relief sought.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">271</a> (2008)
.  The Courts good faith exception (unlike, say, inevitable discovery, a remedial doctrine that applies only upon occasion) creates a categorical bar to obtaining redress in 
				<em>
					every 
				</em>
				case pending when a precedent is overturned.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 1314.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				For another thing, the Courts holding re-creates the very problems that led the Court to abandon 
				<em>
					Linkletter
				</em>
				s approach to retroactivity in favor of 
				<em>
					Griffith
				</em>
				s
				<em>
					.
				</em>
				  One such problem concerns workability.  The Court says that its exception applies where there is objectively reasonable police reliance on binding appellate precedent.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 1, 19.  But to apply the term binding appellate precedent often requires resolution of complex questions of degree.  Davis conceded that he faced binding anti-
				<em>
					Gant 
				</em>
				precedent in the Eleventh Circuit.  But future litigants will be less forthcoming.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 18.  Indeed, those litigants will now have to create distinctions to show that previous Circuit precedent was not binding lest they find relief foreclosed even if they win their constitutional claim.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				At the same time, 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> precedents frequently require courts to slosh their way through the factbound morass of reasonableness. 

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">383</a> (2007)
.  Suppose an officers conduct is consistent with the language of a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> rule that a court of appeals announced in a case with clearly distinguishable facts?  Suppose the case creating the rele-vant precedent did not directly announce any general 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				rule but involved highly analogous facts?  What about a rule that all other jurisdictions, but not the defendants jurisdiction, had previously accepted?  What rules can be developed for determining when, where, and how these different kinds of precedents do, or do not, count as relevant binding precedent?  The 
				<em>
					Linkletter-
				</em>
				like result is likely complex legal argument and police force confusion.  See 
				<em>
					Williams
				</em>

				</em>
				decisions as almost as difficult as trying to follow the tracks made by a beast of prey in search of its intended victim).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Another such problem concerns fairness.  Todays holding, like that in 
				<em>
					Linkletter
				</em>
				, violates basic norms of con-stitutional adjudication.  
				<em>
					Griffith
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra, 
				</em>
				at 322.  It treats the defendant in a case announcing a new rule one way while treating similarly situated defendants whose cases are pending on appeal in a different way.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1819.  Justice Harlan explained why this approach is wrong when he said:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				We cannot release criminals from jail merely because we think one case is a particularly appropriate one [to announce a constitutional doctrine] … .  Simply fishing one case from the stream of appellate review, using it as a vehicle for pronouncing new constitutional standards, and then permitting a stream of similar cases subsequently to flow by unaffected by that new rule constitute an indefensible departure from [our ordinary] model of judicial review.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Of course, the Court may, as it suggests, avoid this un-fairness by refusing to apply the exclusionary rule even 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				to the defendant in the very case in which it announces a new rule.  But that approach would make matters worse.  What would then happen in the lower courts?  How would courts of appeals, for example, come to reconsider their prior decisions when other circuits cases lead them to believe those decisions may be wrong?  Why would a defendant seek to overturn any such decision?  After all, if the (incorrect) circuit precedent is clear, then even if 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				the defendant wins (on the constitutional question), he loses (on relief).  See

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">301</a> (1967)
.  To what extent then could this Court rely upon lower courts to work out 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> differences among themselvesthrough circuit reconsideration of a precedent that other circuits have criticized?  See

				Perhaps more important, the Courts rationale for creating its new good faith exception threatens to undermine well-settled 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> law.  The Court correctly says that pre-
				<em>
					Gant
				</em>
				 Eleventh Circuit precedent had held that a 
				<em>
					Gant-
				</em>
				type search was constitutional; hence the police conduct in this case, consistent with that precedent, was innocent.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 10.  But the Court then finds this fact sufficient to create a new good faith exception to the exclusionary rule.  It reasons that the sole purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter future 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> violations,

				The fact that such exceptions are few and far between is understandable.  Defendants frequently move to suppress evidence on 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> grounds.  In many, perhaps most, of these instances the police, uncertain of how the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> applied to the particular factual circumstances they faced, will have acted in objective good faith.  Yet, in a significant percentage of these instances, courts will find that the police were wrong.  And, unless the police conduct falls into one of the exceptions previously noted, courts have required the suppression of the evidence seized.  1 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure §1.3, pp. 103104 (4th ed. 2004) (good faith exception has not yet been applied to warrantless searches and seizures beyond the rather special situations of

				But an officer who conducts a search that he believes complies with the Constitution but which, it ultimately turns out, falls just outside the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>s bounds is no more culpable than an officer who follows erroneous binding precedent.  Nor is an officer more culpable where circuit precedent is simply suggestive rather than binding, where it only describes how to treat roughly analogous instances, or where it just does not exist.  Thus, if the Court means what it now says, if it would place determinative weight upon the culpability of an individual officers conduct, and if it would apply the exclusionary rule only where a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> violation was deliberate, reckless, or grossly negligent, then the good faith exception will swallow the exclusionary rule.  Indeed, our broad dicta in

				In 2009, in 
				<em>
					Arizona
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Gant
				</em>
				, 556 U. S. ___, this Court held that a police search of an automobile without a warrant violates the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> if the police have pre-viously removed the automobiles occupants and placed them securely in a squad car.  The present case involves these same circumstances, and it was pending on appeal when this Court decided 
				<em>
					Gant
				</em>
				.  Because 
				<em>
					Gant 
				</em>
				represents a shift in the Courts

				<em>
					Linkletter
				</em>
				,
				<em>

				After 22 years of struggling with its 
				<em>

				approach, however, the Court decided in 
				<em>
					Griffith 
				</em>
				that 
				<em>
					Linkletter  
				</em>
				had proved unfair and unworkable.  It then substituted a clearer approach, stating that a new rule for the conduct of criminal prosecutions is to be applied retroactively to all cases, state or federal, pending on direct review or not yet final, with no exception for cases in which the new rule constitutes a clear break with the past.  479 U.

				The Court goes on, however, to decide

				<em>

				new rule will apply.  And here it adds a fatal twist.  While conceding that, like the search in 
				<em>
					Gant, 
				</em>
				this search violated the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>, it holds that, unlike Gant
				<em>
					, 
				</em>
				this defendant is not entitled to a remedy.  That is be-cause the Court finds a new good faith exception which prevents application of the normal remedy for a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> violation, namely, suppression of the illegally seized evidence.

				At this point I can no longer agree with the Court.  A new good faith exception and this Courts retroactivity decisions are incompatible.  For one thing, the Courts distinction between (1) retroactive application of a new rule and (2) availability of a remedy is highly artificial and runs counter to precedent.  To determine that a new rule is retroactive 
				<em>
					is 
				</em>
				to determine that, at least in the normal case, there is a remedy.  As we have previously said, the source of a new rule is the Constitution itself, not any judicial power to create new rules of law; hence, [w]hat we are actually determining when we assess the retroactivity of a new rule is not the temporal scope of a newly announced right, but whether a violation of the right that occurred prior to the announcement of the new rule will entitle a criminal defendant to the relief sought.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">271</a> (2008)
.  The Courts good faith exception (unlike, say, inevitable discovery, a remedial doctrine that applies only upon occasion) creates a categorical bar to obtaining redress in 
				<em>
					every

				case pending when a precedent is overturned.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 1314.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				For another thing, the Courts holding re-creates the very problems that led the Court to abandon 
				<em>
					Linkletter
				</em>
				s approach to retroactivity in favor of 
				<em>
					Griffith
				</em>
				s
				<em>
					.
				</em>
				  One such problem concerns workability.  The Court says that its exception applies where there is objectively reasonable police reliance on binding appellate precedent.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 1, 19.  But to apply the term binding appellate precedent often requires resolution of complex questions of degree.  Davis conceded that he faced binding anti-
				<em>
					Gant 
				</em>
				precedent in the Eleventh Circuit.  But future litigants will be less forthcoming.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 18.  Indeed, those litigants will now have to create distinctions to show that previous Circuit precedent was not binding lest they find relief foreclosed even if they win their constitutional claim.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				At the same time, 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> precedents frequently require courts to slosh their way through the factbound morass of reasonableness. 

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">383</a> (2007)
.  Suppose an officers conduct is consistent with the language of a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> rule that a court of appeals announced in a case with clearly distinguishable facts?  Suppose the case creating the rele-vant precedent did not directly announce any general 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				rule but involved highly analogous facts?  What about a rule that all other jurisdictions, but not the defendants jurisdiction, had previously accepted?  What rules can be developed for determining when, where, and how these different kinds of precedents do, or do not, count as relevant binding precedent?  The 
				<em>
					Linkletter-
				</em>
				like result is likely complex legal argument and police force confusion.  See 
				<em>

				</em>
				decisions as almost as difficult as trying to follow the tracks made by a beast of prey in search of its intended victim).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Another such problem concerns fairness.  Todays holding, like that in 
				<em>
					Linkletter
				</em>
				, violates basic norms of con-stitutional adjudication.  
				<em>
					Griffith
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra, 
				</em>
				at 322.  It treats the defendant in a case announcing a new rule one way while treating similarly situated defendants whose cases are pending on appeal in a different way.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1819.  Justice Harlan explained why this approach is wrong when he said:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				We cannot release criminals from jail merely because we think one case is a particularly appropriate one [to announce a constitutional doctrine] … .  Simply fishing one case from the stream of appellate review, using it as a vehicle for pronouncing new constitutional standards, and then permitting a stream of similar cases subsequently to flow by unaffected by that new rule constitute an indefensible departure from [our ordinary] model of judicial review.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Of course, the Court may, as it suggests, avoid this un-fairness by refusing to apply the exclusionary rule even 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				to the defendant in the very case in which it announces a new rule.  But that approach would make matters worse.  What would then happen in the lower courts?  How would courts of appeals, for example, come to reconsider their prior decisions when other circuits cases lead them to believe those decisions may be wrong?  Why would a defendant seek to overturn any such decision?  After all, if the (incorrect) circuit precedent is clear, then even if 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				the defendant wins (on the constitutional question), he loses (on relief).  See

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">301</a> (1967)
.  To what extent then could this Court rely upon lower courts to work out 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> differences among themselvesthrough circuit reconsideration of a precedent that other circuits have criticized?  See

				Perhaps more important, the Courts rationale for creating its new good faith exception threatens to undermine well-settled 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> law.  The Court correctly says that pre-

				The fact that such exceptions are few and far between is understandable.  Defendants frequently move to suppress evidence on 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> grounds.  In many, perhaps most, of these instances the police, uncertain of how the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> applied to the particular factual circumstances they faced, will have acted in objective good faith.  Yet, in a significant percentage of these instances, courts will find that the police were wrong.  And, unless the police conduct falls into one of the exceptions previously noted, courts have required the suppression of the evidence seized.  1 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure §1.3, pp. 103104 (4th ed. 2004) (good faith exception has not yet been applied to warrantless searches and seizures beyond the rather special situations of

				But an officer who conducts a search that he believes complies with the Constitution but which, it ultimately turns out, falls just outside the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>s bounds is no more culpable than an officer who follows erroneous binding precedent.  Nor is an officer more culpable where circuit precedent is simply suggestive rather than binding, where it only describes how to treat roughly analogous instances, or where it just does not exist.  Thus, if the Court means what it now says, if it would place determinative weight upon the culpability of an individual officers conduct, and if it would apply the exclusionary rule only where a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> violation was deliberate, reckless, or grossly negligent, then the good faith exception will swallow the exclusionary rule.  Indeed, our broad dicta in

				In 2009, in 
				<em>
					Arizona
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Gant
				</em>
				, 556 U. S. ___, this Court held that a police search of an automobile without a warrant violates the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> if the police have pre-viously removed the automobiles occupants and placed them securely in a squad car.  The present case involves these same circumstances, and it was pending on appeal when this Court decided 
				<em>
					Gant
				</em>
				.  Because 
				<em>
					Gant 
				</em>
				represents a shift in the Courts

				<em>
					Linkletter
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				the Court determined a new rules retroactivity by looking to several different factors, including whether the new rule represented a clear break with the past and the degree of reliance by law enforcement authorities on the old standards.

				After 22 years of struggling with its 
				<em>

				approach, however, the Court decided in 
				<em>
					Griffith 
				</em>
				that 
				<em>
					Linkletter  
				</em>
				had proved unfair and unworkable.  It then substituted a clearer approach, stating that a new rule for the conduct of criminal prosecutions is to be applied retroactively to all cases, state or federal, pending on direct review or not yet final, with no exception for cases in which the new rule constitutes a clear break with the past.  479 U.

				The Court goes on, however, to decide

				<em>
					 
				</em>
				new rule will apply.  And here it adds a fatal twist.  While conceding that, like the search in 
				<em>
					Gant, 
				</em>
				this search violated the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>, it holds that, unlike Gant
				<em>
					, 
				</em>
				this defendant is not entitled to a remedy.  That is be-cause the Court finds a new good faith exception which prevents application of the normal remedy for a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> violation, namely, suppression of the illegally seized evidence.

				At this point I can no longer agree with the Court.  A new good faith exception and this Courts retroactivity decisions are incompatible.  For one thing, the Courts distinction between (1) retroactive application of a new rule and (2) availability of a remedy is highly artificial and runs counter to precedent.  To determine that a new rule is retroactive 
				<em>
					is 
				</em>
				to determine that, at least in the normal case, there is a remedy.  As we have previously said, the source of a new rule is the Constitution itself, not any judicial power to create new rules of law; hence, [w]hat we are actually determining when we assess the retroactivity of a new rule is not the temporal scope of a newly announced right, but whether a violation of the right that occurred prior to the announcement of the new rule will entitle a criminal defendant to the relief sought.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">271</a> (2008)
.  The Courts good faith exception (unlike, say, inevitable discovery, a remedial doctrine that applies only upon occasion) creates a categorical bar to obtaining redress in 
				<em>
					every 
				</em>
				case pending when a precedent is overturned.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 1314.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				For another thing, the Courts holding re-creates the very problems that led the Court to abandon 
				<em>
					Linkletter
				</em>
				s approach to retroactivity in favor of 
				<em>
					Griffith
				</em>
				s
				<em>
					.
				</em>
				  One such problem concerns workability.  The Court says that its exception applies where there is objectively reasonable police reliance on binding appellate precedent.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 1, 19.  But to apply the term binding appellate precedent often requires resolution of complex questions of degree.  Davis conceded that he faced binding anti-
				<em>
					Gant 
				</em>
				precedent in the Eleventh Circuit.  But future litigants will be less forthcoming.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 18.  Indeed, those litigants will now have to create distinctions to show that previous Circuit precedent was not binding lest they find relief foreclosed even if they win their constitutional claim.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				At the same time, 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> precedents frequently require courts to slosh their way through the factbound morass of reasonableness. 

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">383</a> (2007)
.  Suppose an officers conduct is consistent with the language of a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> rule that a court of appeals announced in a case with clearly distinguishable facts?  Suppose the case creating the rele-vant precedent did not directly announce any general 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				rule but involved highly analogous facts?  What about a rule that all other jurisdictions, but not the defendants jurisdiction, had previously accepted?  What rules can be developed for determining when, where, and how these different kinds of precedents do, or do not, count as relevant binding precedent?  The 
				<em>
					Linkletter-
				</em>
				like result is likely complex legal argument and police force confusion.  See 
				<em>

				</em>
				decisions as almost as difficult as trying to follow the tracks made by a beast of prey in search of its intended victim).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Another such problem concerns fairness.  Todays holding, like that in 
				<em>
					Linkletter
				</em>
				, violates basic norms of con-stitutional adjudication.  
				<em>
					Griffith
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra, 
				</em>
				at 322.  It treats the defendant in a case announcing a new rule one way while treating similarly situated defendants whose cases are pending on appeal in a different way.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1819.  Justice Harlan explained why this approach is wrong when he said:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				We cannot release criminals from jail merely because we think one case is a particularly appropriate one [to announce a constitutional doctrine] … .  Simply fishing one case from the stream of appellate review, using it as a vehicle for pronouncing new constitutional standards, and then permitting a stream of similar cases subsequently to flow by unaffected by that new rule constitute an indefensible departure from [our ordinary] model of judicial review.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Of course, the Court may, as it suggests, avoid this un-fairness by refusing to apply the exclusionary rule even 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				to the defendant in the very case in which it announces a new rule.  But that approach would make matters worse.  What would then happen in the lower courts?  How would courts of appeals, for example, come to reconsider their prior decisions when other circuits cases lead them to believe those decisions may be wrong?  Why would a defendant seek to overturn any such decision?  After all, if the (incorrect) circuit precedent is clear, then even if 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				the defendant wins (on the constitutional question), he loses (on relief).  See

				Perhaps more important, the Courts rationale for creating its new good faith exception threatens to undermine well-settled 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> law.  The Court correctly says that pre-
				<em>
					Gant
				</em>
				 Eleventh Circuit precedent had held that a 
				<em>
					Gant-
				</em>
				type search was constitutional; hence the police conduct in this case, consistent with that precedent, was innocent.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 10.  But the Court then finds this fact sufficient to create a new good faith exception to the exclusionary rule.  It reasons that the sole purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter future 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> violations, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 6.  The deterrence benefits of exclusion vary with the culpability of the law enforcement conduct at issue, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 8 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).  Those benefits are sufficient to jus-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				tify exclusion where police exhibit deliberate, reckless, 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				or grossly negligent disregard for 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> rights, 
				<em>
					ibid. 
				</em>
				(internal quotation marks omitted).  But those benefits do not justify exclusion where, as here, the police act with simple, isolated negligence or an objectively reasonable good-faith belief that their conduct is lawful,

				The fact that such exceptions are few and far between is understandable.  Defendants frequently move to suppress evidence on 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> grounds.  In many, perhaps most, of these instances the police, uncertain of how the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> applied to the particular factual circumstances they faced, will have acted in objective good faith.  Yet, in a significant percentage of these instances, courts will find that the police were wrong.  And, unless the police conduct falls into one of the exceptions previously noted, courts have required the suppression of the evidence seized.  1 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure §1.3, pp. 103104 (4th ed. 2004) (good faith exception has not yet been applied to warrantless searches and seizures beyond the rather special situations of

				But an officer who conducts a search that he believes complies with the Constitution but which, it ultimately turns out, falls just outside the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>s bounds is no more culpable than an officer who follows erroneous binding precedent.  Nor is an officer more culpable where circuit precedent is simply suggestive rather than binding, where it only describes how to treat roughly analogous instances, or where it just does not exist.  Thus, if the Court means what it now says, if it would place determinative weight upon the culpability of an individual officers conduct, and if it would apply the exclusionary rule only where a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> violation was deliberate, reckless, or grossly negligent, then the good faith exception will swallow the exclusionary rule.  Indeed, our broad dicta in 
				<em>
					Herring

				<em>

				In 2009, in 
				<em>
					Arizona
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Gant
				</em>
				, 556 U. S. ___, this Court held that a police search of an automobile without a warrant violates the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> if the police have pre-viously removed the automobiles occupants and placed them securely in a squad car.  The present case involves these same circumstances, and it was pending on appeal when this Court decided 
				<em>
					Gant
				</em>
				.  Because 
				<em>
					Gant 
				</em>
				represents a shift in the Courts

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/479/314" class="subref" title="subref">479 U. S. 314</a>, that conclusion would have been more difficult to reach.  Under 
				<em>
					Linkletter
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				the Court determined a new rules retroactivity by looking to several different factors, including whether the new rule represented a clear break with the past and the degree of reliance by law enforcement authorities on the old standards.

				After 22 years of struggling with its 
				<em>
					Linkletter 
				</em>
				approach, however, the Court decided in 
				<em>
					Griffith 
				</em>
				that 
				<em>
					Linkletter  
				</em>
				had proved unfair and unworkable.  It then substituted a clearer approach, stating that a new rule for the conduct of criminal prosecutions is to be applied retroactively to all cases, state or federal, pending on direct review or not yet final, with no exception for cases in which the new rule constitutes a clear break with the past.  479 U.

				The Court goes on, however, to decide

				<em>

				new rule will apply.  And here it adds a fatal twist.  While conceding that, like the search in 
				<em>
					Gant, 
				</em>
				this search violated the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>, it holds that, unlike Gant
				<em>
					, 
				</em>
				this defendant is not entitled to a remedy.  That is be-cause the Court finds a new good faith exception which prevents application of the normal remedy for a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> violation, namely, suppression of the illegally seized evidence.

				At this point I can no longer agree with the Court.  A new good faith exception and this Courts retroactivity decisions are incompatible.  For one thing, the Courts distinction between (1) retroactive application of a new rule and (2) availability of a remedy is highly artificial and runs counter to precedent.  To determine that a new rule is retroactive 
				<em>
					is 
				</em>
				to determine that, at least in the normal case, there is a remedy.  As we have previously said, the source of a new rule is the Constitution itself, not any judicial power to create new rules of law; hence, [w]hat we are actually determining when we assess the retroactivity of a new rule is not the temporal scope of a newly announced right, but whether a violation of the right that occurred prior to the announcement of the new rule will entitle a criminal defendant to the relief sought.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">271</a> (2008)
.  The Courts good faith exception (unlike, say, inevitable discovery, a remedial doctrine that applies only upon occasion) creates a categorical bar to obtaining redress in 
				<em>
					every 
				</em>
				case pending when a precedent is overturned.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 1314.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				For another thing, the Courts holding re-creates the very problems that led the Court to abandon 
				<em>
					Linkletter
				</em>
				s approach to retroactivity in favor of 
				<em>
					Griffith
				</em>
				s
				<em>
					.
				</em>
				  One such problem concerns workability.  The Court says that its exception applies where there is objectively reasonable police reliance on binding appellate precedent.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 1, 19.  But to apply the term binding appellate precedent often requires resolution of complex questions of degree.  Davis conceded that he faced binding anti-
				<em>
					Gant 
				</em>
				precedent in the Eleventh Circuit.  But future litigants will be less forthcoming.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 18.  Indeed, those litigants will now have to create distinctions to show that previous Circuit precedent was not binding lest they find relief foreclosed even if they win their constitutional claim.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				At the same time, 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> precedents frequently require courts to slosh their way through the factbound morass of reasonableness. 

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">383</a> (2007)
.  Suppose an officers conduct is consistent with the language of a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> rule that a court of appeals announced in a case with clearly distinguishable facts?  Suppose the case creating the rele-vant precedent did not directly announce any general 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				rule but involved highly analogous facts?  What about a rule that all other jurisdictions, but not the defendants jurisdiction, had previously accepted?  What rules can be developed for determining when, where, and how these different kinds of precedents do, or do not, count as relevant binding precedent?  The 
				<em>
					Linkletter-
				</em>
				like result is likely complex legal argument and police force confusion.  See 
				<em>
					Williams
				</em>

					United States

				<em>

				</em>
				decisions as almost as difficult as trying to follow the tracks made by a beast of prey in search of its intended victim).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Another such problem concerns fairness.  Todays holding, like that in 
				<em>
					Linkletter
				</em>
				, violates basic norms of con-stitutional adjudication.  
				<em>
					Griffith
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra, 
				</em>
				at 322.  It treats the defendant in a case announcing a new rule one way while treating similarly situated defendants whose cases are pending on appeal in a different way.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1819.  Justice Harlan explained why this approach is wrong when he said:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				We cannot release criminals from jail merely because we think one case is a particularly appropriate one [to announce a constitutional doctrine] … .  Simply fishing one case from the stream of appellate review, using it as a vehicle for pronouncing new constitutional standards, and then permitting a stream of similar cases subsequently to flow by unaffected by that new rule constitute an indefensible departure from [our ordinary] model of judicial review.

And in 
				<em>
					Griffith
				</em>
				, the Court embraced to a significant extent the comprehensive analysis presented by Justice Harlan.  479 U. S., at 322.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Of course, the Court may, as it suggests, avoid this un-fairness by refusing to apply the exclusionary rule even 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				to the defendant in the very case in which it announces a new rule.  But that approach would make matters worse.  What would then happen in the lower courts?  How would courts of appeals, for example, come to reconsider their prior decisions when other circuits cases lead them to believe those decisions may be wrong?  Why would a defendant seek to overturn any such decision?  After all, if the (incorrect) circuit precedent is clear, then even if 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				the defendant wins (on the constitutional question), he loses (on relief).  See 
				<em>
					Stovall
				</em>
				 v.

				Perhaps more important, the Courts rationale for creating its new good faith exception threatens to undermine well-settled 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> law.  The Court correctly says that pre-
				<em>
					Gant
				</em>
				 Eleventh Circuit precedent had held that a 
				<em>
					Gant-
				</em>
				type search was constitutional; hence the police conduct in this case, consistent with that precedent, was innocent.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 10.  But the Court then finds this fact sufficient to create a new good faith exception to the exclusionary rule.  It reasons that the sole purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter future 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> violations, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 6.  The deterrence benefits of exclusion vary with the culpability of the law enforcement conduct at issue, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 8 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).  Those benefits are sufficient to jus-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				tify exclusion where police exhibit deliberate, reckless, 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				or grossly negligent disregard for 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> rights, 
				<em>
					ibid. 
				</em>
				(internal quotation marks omitted).  But those benefits do not justify exclusion where, as here, the police act with simple, isolated negligence or an objectively reasonable good-faith belief that their conduct is lawful,

				The fact that such exceptions are few and far between is understandable.  Defendants frequently move to suppress evidence on 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> grounds.  In many, perhaps most, of these instances the police, uncertain of how the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> applied to the particular factual circumstances they faced, will have acted in objective good faith.  Yet, in a significant percentage of these instances, courts will find that the police were wrong.  And, unless the police conduct falls into one of the exceptions previously noted, courts have required the suppression of the evidence seized.  1 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure §1.3, pp. 103104 (4th ed. 2004) (good faith exception has not yet been applied to warrantless searches and seizures beyond the rather special situations of

				But an officer who conducts a search that he believes complies with the Constitution but which, it ultimately turns out, falls just outside the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>s bounds is no more culpable than an officer who follows erroneous binding precedent.  Nor is an officer more culpable where circuit precedent is simply suggestive rather than binding, where it only describes how to treat roughly analogous instances, or where it just does not exist.  Thus, if the Court means what it now says, if it would place determinative weight upon the culpability of an individual officers conduct, and if it would apply the exclusionary rule only where a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> violation was deliberate, reckless, or grossly negligent, then the good faith exception will swallow the exclusionary rule.  Indeed, our broad dicta in 
				<em>
					Herring

				<em>

				In 2009, in 
				<em>
					Arizona
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Gant
				</em>
				, 556 U. S. ___, this Court held that a police search of an automobile without a warrant violates the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> if the police have pre-viously removed the automobiles occupants and placed them securely in a squad car.  The present case involves these same circumstances, and it was pending on appeal when this Court decided 
				<em>
					Gant
				</em>
				.  Because 
				<em>
					Gant 
				</em>
				represents a shift in the Courts

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/479/314" class="subref" title="subref">479 U. S. 314</a>, that conclusion would have been more difficult to reach.  Under 
				<em>
					Linkletter
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				the Court determined a new rules retroactivity by looking to several different factors, including whether the new rule represented a clear break with the past and the degree of reliance by law enforcement authorities on the old standards.

				After 22 years of struggling with its

				</em>
				that 
				<em>
					Linkletter

				had proved unfair and unworkable.  It then substituted a clearer approach, stating that a new rule for the conduct of criminal prosecutions is to be applied retroactively to all cases, state or federal, pending on direct review or not yet final, with no exception for cases in which the new rule constitutes a clear break with the past.  479 U.

				The Court goes on, however, to decide

				<em>
					Gant, 
				</em>
				this search violated the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>, it holds that, unlike Gant
				<em>
					, 
				</em>
				this defendant is not entitled to a remedy.  That is be-cause the Court finds a new good faith exception which prevents application of the normal remedy for a

				At this point I can no longer agree with the Court.  A new good faith exception and this Courts retroactivity decisions are incompatible.  For one thing, the Courts distinction between (1) retroactive application of a new rule and (2) availability of a remedy is highly artificial and runs counter to precedent.  To determine that a new rule is retroactive 
				<em>
					is 
				</em>
				to determine that, at least in the normal case, there is a remedy.  As we have previously said, the source of a new rule is the Constitution itself, not any judicial power to create new rules of law; hence, [w]hat we are actually determining when we assess the retroactivity of a new rule is not the temporal scope of a newly announced right, but whether a violation of the right that occurred prior to the announcement of the new rule will entitle a criminal defendant to the relief sought.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">271</a> (2008)
.  The Courts good faith exception (unlike, say, inevitable discovery, a remedial doctrine that applies only upon occasion) creates a categorical bar to obtaining redress in 
				<em>
					every 
				</em>
				case pending when a precedent is overturned.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 1314.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				For another thing, the Courts holding re-creates the very problems that led the Court to abandon 
				<em>
					Linkletter
				</em>
				s approach to retroactivity in favor of 
				<em>
					Griffith
				</em>
				s
				<em>
					.
				</em>
				  One such problem concerns workability.  The Court says that its exception applies where there is objectively reasonable police reliance on binding appellate precedent.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 1, 19.  But to apply the term binding appellate precedent often requires resolution of complex questions of degree.  Davis conceded that he faced binding anti-
				<em>
					Gant 
				</em>
				precedent in the Eleventh Circuit.  But future litigants will be less forthcoming.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 18.  Indeed, those litigants will now have to create distinctions to show that previous Circuit precedent was not binding lest they find relief foreclosed even if they win their constitutional claim.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				At the same time, 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> precedents frequently require courts to slosh their way through the factbound morass of reasonableness. 

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">383</a> (2007)
.  Suppose an officers conduct is consistent with the language of a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> rule that a court of appeals announced in a case with clearly distinguishable facts?  Suppose the case creating the rele-vant precedent did not directly announce any general 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				rule but involved highly analogous facts?  What about a rule that all other jurisdictions, but not the defendants jurisdiction, had previously accepted?  What rules can be developed for determining when, where, and how these different kinds of precedents do, or do not, count as relevant binding precedent?  The 
				<em>
					Linkletter-
				</em>
				like result is likely complex legal argument and police force confusion.  See 
				<em>
					Williams
				</em>

					United States

				<em>

				</em>
				decisions as almost as difficult as trying to follow the tracks made by a beast of prey in search of its intended victim).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Another such problem concerns fairness.  Todays holding, like that in 
				<em>
					Linkletter
				</em>
				, violates basic norms of con-stitutional adjudication.  
				<em>
					Griffith
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra, 
				</em>
				at 322.  It treats the defendant in a case announcing a new rule one way while treating similarly situated defendants whose cases are pending on appeal in a different way.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1819.  Justice Harlan explained why this approach is wrong when he said:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				We cannot release criminals from jail merely because we think one case is a particularly appropriate one [to announce a constitutional doctrine] … .  Simply fishing one case from the stream of appellate review, using it as a vehicle for pronouncing new constitutional standards, and then permitting a stream of similar cases subsequently to flow by unaffected by that new rule constitute an indefensible departure from [our ordinary] model of judicial review.

And in 
				<em>

				, the Court embraced to a significant extent the comprehensive analysis presented by Justice Harlan.  479 U. S., at 322.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Of course, the Court may, as it suggests, avoid this un-fairness by refusing to apply the exclusionary rule even 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				to the defendant in the very case in which it announces a new rule.  But that approach would make matters worse.  What would then happen in the lower courts?  How would courts of appeals, for example, come to reconsider their prior decisions when other circuits cases lead them to believe those decisions may be wrong?  Why would a defendant seek to overturn any such decision?  After all, if the (incorrect) circuit precedent is clear, then even if 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				the defendant wins (on the constitutional question), he loses (on relief).  See

				Perhaps more important, the Courts rationale for creating its new good faith exception threatens to undermine well-settled 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> law.  The Court correctly says that pre-
				<em>
					Gant
				</em>
				 Eleventh Circuit precedent had held that a 
				<em>
					Gant-
				</em>
				type search was constitutional; hence the police conduct in this case, consistent with that precedent, was innocent.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 10.  But the Court then finds this fact sufficient to create a new good faith exception to the exclusionary rule.  It reasons that the sole purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter future 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> violations, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 6.  The deterrence benefits of exclusion vary with the culpability of the law enforcement conduct at issue, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 8 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).  Those benefits are sufficient to jus-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				tify exclusion where police exhibit deliberate, reckless, 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				or grossly negligent disregard for 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> rights, 
				<em>
					ibid. 
				</em>
				(internal quotation marks omitted).  But those benefits do not justify exclusion where, as here, the police act with simple, isolated negligence or an objectively reasonable good-faith belief that their conduct is lawful,

				The fact that such exceptions are few and far between is understandable.  Defendants frequently move to suppress evidence on 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> grounds.  In many, perhaps most, of these instances the police, uncertain of how the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> applied to the particular factual circumstances they faced, will have acted in objective good faith.  Yet, in a significant percentage of these instances, courts will find that the police were wrong.  And, unless the police conduct falls into one of the exceptions previously noted, courts have required the suppression of the evidence seized.  1 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure §1.3, pp. 103104 (4th ed. 2004) (good faith exception has not yet been applied to warrantless searches and seizures beyond the rather special situations of

				But an officer who conducts a search that he believes complies with the Constitution but which, it ultimately turns out, falls just outside the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>s bounds is no more culpable than an officer who follows erroneous binding precedent.  Nor is an officer more culpable where circuit precedent is simply suggestive rather than binding, where it only describes how to treat roughly analogous instances, or where it just does not exist.  Thus, if the Court means what it now says, if it would place determinative weight upon the culpability of an individual officers conduct, and if it would apply the exclusionary rule only where a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> violation was deliberate, reckless, or grossly negligent, then the good faith exception will swallow the exclusionary rule.  Indeed, our broad dicta in 
				<em>

				In 2009, in 
				<em>
					Arizona
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Gant
				</em>
				, 556 U. S. ___, this Court held that a police search of an automobile without a warrant violates the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> if the police have pre-viously removed the automobiles occupants and placed them securely in a squad car.  The present case involves these same circumstances, and it was pending on appeal when this Court decided 
				<em>
					Gant
				</em>
				.  Because 
				<em>
					Gant

				represents a shift in the Courts

				<em>
					Linkletter
				</em>
				,
				<em>

				After 22 years of struggling with its

				<em>

It then substituted a clearer approach, stating that a new rule for the conduct of criminal prosecutions is to be applied retroactively to all cases, state or federal, pending on direct review or not yet final, with no exception for cases in which the new rule constitutes a clear break with the past.  479 U.

				The Court goes on, however, to decide

				<em>

				</em>
				this search violated the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>, it holds that, unlike Gant
				<em>
					, 
				</em>
				this defendant is not entitled to a remedy.  That is be-cause the Court finds a new good faith exception which prevents application of the normal remedy for a

				At this point I can no longer agree with the Court.  A new good faith exception and this Courts retroactivity decisions are incompatible.  For one thing, the Courts distinction between (1) retroactive application of a new rule and (2) availability of a remedy is highly artificial and runs counter to precedent.  To determine that a new rule is retroactive 
				<em>
					is 
				</em>
				to determine that, at least in the normal case, there is a remedy.  As we have previously said, the source of a new rule is the Constitution itself, not any judicial power to create new rules of law; hence, [w]hat we are actually determining when we assess the retroactivity of a new rule is not the temporal scope of a newly announced right, but whether a violation of the right that occurred prior to the announcement of the new rule will entitle a criminal defendant to the relief sought.

.  The Courts good faith exception (unlike, say, inevitable discovery, a remedial doctrine that applies only upon occasion) creates a categorical bar to obtaining redress in 
				<em>

				case pending when a precedent is overturned.  
				<em>

				</em>

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				For another thing, the Courts holding re-creates the very problems that led the Court to abandon 
				<em>
					Linkletter
				</em>
				s approach to retroactivity in favor of 
				<em>
					Griffith
				</em>
				s
				<em>
					.
				</em>
				  One such problem concerns workability.  The Court says that its exception applies where there is objectively reasonable police reliance on binding appellate precedent.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 1, 19.  But to apply the term binding appellate precedent often requires resolution of complex questions of degree.  Davis conceded that he faced binding anti-
				<em>
					Gant 
				</em>
				precedent in the Eleventh Circuit.  But future litigants will be less forthcoming.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 18.  Indeed, those litigants will now have to create distinctions to show that previous Circuit precedent was not binding lest they find relief foreclosed even if they win their constitutional claim.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				At the same time, 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> precedents frequently require courts to slosh their way through the factbound morass of reasonableness. 

.  Suppose an officers conduct is consistent with the language of a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> rule that a court of appeals announced in a case with clearly distinguishable facts?  Suppose the case creating the rele-vant precedent did not directly announce any general 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				rule but involved highly analogous facts?  What about a rule that all other jurisdictions, but not the defendants jurisdiction, had previously accepted?  What rules can be developed for determining when, where, and how these different kinds of precedents do, or do not, count as relevant binding precedent?  The 
				<em>
					Linkletter-
				</em>
				like result is likely complex legal argument and police force confusion.  See

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Another such problem concerns fairness.  Todays holding, like that in

				, violates basic norms of con-stitutional adjudication.  
				<em>
					Griffith

				Of course, the Court may, as it suggests, avoid this un-fairness by refusing to apply the exclusionary rule even 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				to the defendant in the very case in which it announces a new rule.  But that approach would make matters worse.  What would then happen in the lower courts?  How would courts of appeals, for example, come to reconsider their prior decisions when other circuits cases lead them to believe those decisions may be wrong?  Why would a defendant seek to overturn any such decision?  After all, if the (incorrect) circuit precedent is clear, then even if 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>

				Perhaps more important, the Courts rationale for creating its new good faith exception threatens to undermine well-settled 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> law.  The Court correctly says that pre-
				<em>
					Gant
				</em>
				 Eleventh Circuit precedent had held that a 
				<em>
					Gant-
				</em>
				type search was constitutional; hence the police conduct in this case, consistent with that precedent, was innocent.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 10.  But the Court then finds this fact sufficient to create a new good faith exception to the exclusionary rule.  It reasons that the sole purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter future 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> violations, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 6.  The deterrence benefits of exclusion vary with the culpability of the law enforcement conduct at issue, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 8 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).  Those benefits are sufficient to jus-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				tify exclusion where police exhibit deliberate, reckless, 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				or grossly negligent disregard for 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> rights, 
				<em>
					ibid. 
				</em>
				(internal quotation marks omitted).  But those benefits do not justify exclusion where, as here, the police act with simple, isolated negligence or an objectively reasonable good-faith belief that their conduct is lawful,

				The fact that such exceptions are few and far between is understandable.  Defendants frequently move to suppress evidence on 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> grounds.  In many, perhaps most, of these instances the police, uncertain of how the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> applied to the particular factual circumstances they faced, will have acted in objective good faith.  Yet, in a significant percentage of these instances, courts will find that the police were wrong.  And, unless the police conduct falls into one of the exceptions previously noted, courts have required the suppression of the evidence seized.  1 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure §1.3, pp. 103104 (4th ed. 2004) (good faith exception has not yet been applied to warrantless searches and seizures beyond the rather special situations of

				But an officer who conducts a search that he believes complies with the Constitution but which, it ultimately turns out, falls just outside the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>s bounds is no more culpable than an officer who follows erroneous binding precedent.  Nor is an officer more culpable where circuit precedent is simply suggestive rather than binding, where it only describes how to treat roughly analogous instances, or where it just does not exist.  Thus, if the Court means what it now says, if it would place determinative weight upon the culpability of an individual officers conduct, and if it would apply the exclusionary rule only where a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> violation was deliberate, reckless, or grossly negligent, then the good faith exception will swallow the exclusionary rule.  Indeed, our broad dicta in 
				<em>
					Herring
				</em>
				dicta the Court repeats and expands upon todaymay already be leading lower courts in this direction.  See 
				<em>

				In 2009, in 
				<em>
					Arizona
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Gant
				</em>
				, 556 U. S. ___, this Court held that a police search of an automobile without a warrant violates the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> if the police have pre-viously removed the automobiles occupants and placed them securely in a squad car.  The present case involves these same circumstances, and it was pending on appeal when this Court decided 
				<em>
					Gant
				</em>
				.  Because 
				<em>
					Gant

				represents a shift in the Courts

				<em>
					Linkletter
				</em>
				,
				<em>

				After 22 years of struggling with its

				<em>

It then substituted a clearer approach, stating that a new rule for the conduct of criminal prosecutions is to be applied retroactively to all cases, state or federal, pending on direct review or not yet final, with no exception for cases in which the new rule constitutes a clear break with the past.  479 U.

				The Court goes on, however, to decide

				<em>

				</em>
				this search violated the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>, it holds that, unlike Gant
				<em>
					, 
				</em>
				this defendant is not entitled to a remedy.  That is be-cause the Court finds a new good faith exception which prevents application of the normal remedy for a

				At this point I can no longer agree with the Court.  A new good faith exception and this Courts retroactivity decisions are incompatible.  For one thing, the Courts distinction between (1) retroactive application of a new rule and (2) availability of a remedy is highly artificial and runs counter to precedent.  To determine that a new rule is retroactive 
				<em>
					is 
				</em>
				to determine that, at least in the normal case, there is a remedy.  As we have previously said, the source of a new rule is the Constitution itself, not any judicial power to create new rules of law; hence, [w]hat we are actually determining when we assess the retroactivity of a new rule is not the temporal scope of a newly announced right, but whether a violation of the right that occurred prior to the announcement of the new rule will entitle a criminal defendant to the relief sought.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">271</a> (2008)
.  The Courts good faith exception (unlike, say, inevitable discovery, a remedial doctrine that applies only upon occasion) creates a categorical bar to obtaining redress in 
				<em>
					every 
				</em>
				case pending when a precedent is overturned.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 1314.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				For another thing, the Courts holding re-creates the very problems that led the Court to abandon 
				<em>
					Linkletter
				</em>
				s approach to retroactivity in favor of 
				<em>
					Griffith
				</em>
				s
				<em>
					.
				</em>
				  One such problem concerns workability.  The Court says that its exception applies where there is objectively reasonable police reliance on binding appellate precedent.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 1, 19.  But to apply the term binding appellate precedent often requires resolution of complex questions of degree.  Davis conceded that he faced binding anti-
				<em>
					Gant 
				</em>
				precedent in the Eleventh Circuit.  But future litigants will be less forthcoming.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 18.  Indeed, those litigants will now have to create distinctions to show that previous Circuit precedent was not binding lest they find relief foreclosed even if they win their constitutional claim.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				At the same time, 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> precedents frequently require courts to slosh their way through the factbound morass of reasonableness. 

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">383</a> (2007)
.  Suppose an officers conduct is consistent with the language of a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> rule that a court of appeals announced in a case with clearly distinguishable facts?  Suppose the case creating the rele-vant precedent did not directly announce any general 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				rule but involved highly analogous facts?  What about a rule that all other jurisdictions, but not the defendants jurisdiction, had previously accepted?  What rules can be developed for determining when, where, and how these different kinds of precedents do, or do not, count as relevant binding precedent?  The 
				<em>
					Linkletter-
				</em>
				like result is likely complex legal argument and police force confusion.  See 
				<em>

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Another such problem concerns fairness.  Todays holding, like that in

				We cannot release criminals from jail merely because we think one case is a particularly appropriate one [to announce a constitutional doctrine] … .  Simply fishing one case from the stream of appellate review, using it as a vehicle for pronouncing new constitutional standards, and then permitting a stream of similar cases subsequently to flow by unaffected by that new rule constitute an indefensible departure from [our ordinary] model of judicial review.

				Of course, the Court may, as it suggests, avoid this un-fairness by refusing to apply the exclusionary rule even 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				to the defendant in the very case in which it announces a new rule.  But that approach would make matters worse.  What would then happen in the lower courts?  How would courts of appeals, for example, come to reconsider their prior decisions when other circuits cases lead them to believe those decisions may be wrong?  Why would a defendant seek to overturn any such decision?  After all, if the (incorrect) circuit precedent is clear, then even if

				Perhaps more important, the Courts rationale for creating its new good faith exception threatens to undermine well-settled 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> law.  The Court correctly says that pre-
				<em>
					Gant
				</em>
				 Eleventh Circuit precedent had held that a 
				<em>
					Gant-
				</em>
				type search was constitutional; hence the police conduct in this case, consistent with that precedent, was innocent.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 10.  But the Court then finds this fact sufficient to create a new good faith exception to the exclusionary rule.  It reasons that the sole purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter future 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> violations, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 6.  The deterrence benefits of exclusion vary with the culpability of the law enforcement conduct at issue, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 8 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).  Those benefits are sufficient to jus-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				tify exclusion where police exhibit deliberate, reckless, 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				or grossly negligent disregard for 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> rights, 
				<em>
					ibid. 
				</em>
				(internal quotation marks omitted).  But those benefits do not justify exclusion where, as here, the police act with simple, isolated negligence or an objectively reasonable good-faith belief that their conduct is lawful,

				The fact that such exceptions are few and far between is understandable.  Defendants frequently move to suppress evidence on 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> grounds.  In many, perhaps most, of these instances the police, uncertain of how the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> applied to the particular factual circumstances they faced, will have acted in objective good faith.  Yet, in a significant percentage of these instances, courts will find that the police were wrong.  And, unless the police conduct falls into one of the exceptions previously noted, courts have required the suppression of the evidence seized.  1 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure §1.3, pp. 103104 (4th ed. 2004) (good faith exception has not yet been applied to warrantless searches and seizures beyond the rather special situations of

				But an officer who conducts a search that he believes complies with the Constitution but which, it ultimately turns out, falls just outside the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>s bounds is no more culpable than an officer who follows erroneous binding precedent.  Nor is an officer more culpable where circuit precedent is simply suggestive rather than binding, where it only describes how to treat roughly analogous instances, or where it just does not exist.  Thus, if the Court means what it now says, if it would place determinative weight upon the culpability of an individual officers conduct, and if it would apply the exclusionary rule only where a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> violation was deliberate, reckless, or grossly negligent, then the good faith exception will swallow the exclusionary rule.  Indeed, our broad dicta in 
				<em>
					Herring

				dicta the Court repeats and expands upon todaymay already be leading lower courts in this direction.  See 
				<em>

				In 2009, in 
				<em>

				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Gant

				, 556 U. S. ___, this Court held that a police search of an automobile without a warrant violates the

The present case involves these same circumstances, and it was pending on appeal when this Court decided 
				<em>

				.  Because 
				<em>

				After 22 years of struggling with its

				this defendant is not entitled to a remedy.  That is be-cause the Court finds a new good faith exception which prevents application of the normal remedy for a

				At this point I can no longer agree with the Court.  A new good faith exception and this Courts retroactivity decisions are incompatible.  For one thing, the Courts distinction between (1) retroactive application of a new rule and (2) availability of a remedy is highly artificial and runs counter to precedent.  To determine that a new rule is retroactive 
				<em>
					is 
				</em>
				to determine that, at least in the normal case, there is a remedy.  As we have previously said, the source of a new rule is the Constitution itself, not any judicial power to create new rules of law; hence, [w]hat we are actually determining when we assess the retroactivity of a new rule is not the temporal scope of a newly announced right, but whether a violation of the right that occurred prior to the announcement of the new rule will entitle a criminal defendant to the relief sought.

				For another thing, the Courts holding re-creates the very problems that led the Court to abandon 
				<em>
					Linkletter
				</em>
				s approach to retroactivity in favor of 
				<em>
					Griffith
				</em>
				s
				<em>
					.
				</em>
				  One such problem concerns workability.  The Court says that its exception applies where there is objectively reasonable police reliance on binding appellate precedent.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 1, 19.  But to apply the term binding appellate precedent often requires resolution of complex questions of degree.  Davis conceded that he faced binding anti-
				<em>

				precedent in the Eleventh Circuit.  But future litigants will be less forthcoming.  
				<em>

				At the same time,

What rules can be developed for determining when, where, and how these different kinds of precedents do, or do not, count as relevant binding precedent?  The

				Of course, the Court may, as it suggests, avoid this un-fairness by refusing to apply the exclusionary rule even 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				to the defendant in the very case in which it announces a new rule.  But that approach would make matters worse.  What would then happen in the lower courts?  How would courts of appeals, for example, come to reconsider their prior decisions when other circuits cases lead them to believe those decisions may be wrong?  Why would a defendant seek to overturn any such decision?  After all, if the (incorrect) circuit precedent is clear, then even if

				Perhaps more important, the Courts rationale for creating its new good faith exception threatens to undermine well-settled 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> law.  The Court correctly says that pre-
				<em>
					Gant
				</em>
				 Eleventh Circuit precedent had held that a 
				<em>
					Gant-
				</em>
				type search was constitutional; hence the police conduct in this case, consistent with that precedent, was innocent.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 10.  But the Court then finds this fact sufficient to create a new good faith exception to the exclusionary rule.  It reasons that the sole purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter future 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> violations, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 6.  The deterrence benefits of exclusion vary with the culpability of the law enforcement conduct at issue, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 8 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).  Those benefits are sufficient to jus-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				tify exclusion where police exhibit deliberate, reckless, 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				or grossly negligent disregard for 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> rights, 
				<em>
					ibid.

				(internal quotation marks omitted).  But those benefits do not justify exclusion where, as here, the police act with simple, isolated negligence or an objectively reasonable good-faith belief that their conduct is lawful,

				The fact that such exceptions are few and far between is understandable.  Defendants frequently move to suppress evidence on 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> grounds.  In many, perhaps most, of these instances the police, uncertain of how the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> applied to the particular factual circumstances they faced, will have acted in objective good faith.  Yet, in a significant percentage of these instances, courts will find that the police were wrong.  And, unless the police conduct falls into one of the exceptions previously noted, courts have required the suppression of the evidence seized.  1 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure §1.3, pp. 103104 (4th ed. 2004) (good faith exception has not yet been applied to warrantless searches and seizures beyond the rather special situations of

				But an officer who conducts a search that he believes complies with the Constitution but which, it ultimately turns out, falls just outside the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>s bounds is no more culpable than an officer who follows erroneous binding precedent.  Nor is an officer more culpable where circuit precedent is simply suggestive rather than binding, where it only describes how to treat roughly analogous instances, or where it just does not exist.  Thus, if the Court means what it now says, if it would place determinative weight upon the culpability of an individual officers conduct, and if it would apply the exclusionary rule only where a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> violation was deliberate, reckless, or grossly negligent, then the good faith exception will swallow the exclusionary rule.  Indeed, our broad dicta in 
				<em>

				<em>

				In 2009, in 
				<em>

				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>

The present case involves these same circumstances, and it was pending on appeal when this Court decided 
				<em>

				this defendant is not entitled to a remedy.  That is be-cause the Court finds a new good faith exception which prevents application of the normal remedy for a

				At this point I can no longer agree with the Court.  A new good faith exception and this Courts retroactivity decisions are incompatible.  For one thing, the Courts distinction between (1) retroactive application of a new rule and (2) availability of a remedy is highly artificial and runs counter to precedent.  To determine that a new rule is retroactive 
				<em>
					is 
				</em>
				to determine that, at least in the normal case, there is a remedy.  As we have previously said, the source of a new rule is the Constitution itself, not any judicial power to create new rules of law; hence, [w]hat we are actually determining when we assess the retroactivity of a new rule is not the temporal scope of a newly announced right, but whether a violation of the right that occurred prior to the announcement of the new rule will entitle a criminal defendant to the relief sought.

				For another thing, the Courts holding re-creates the very problems that led the Court to abandon

				</em>
				s approach to retroactivity in favor of 
				<em>
					Griffith
				</em>
				s
				<em>
					.

				  One such problem concerns workability.  The Court says that its exception applies where there is objectively reasonable police reliance on binding appellate precedent.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 1, 19.  But to apply the term binding appellate precedent often requires resolution of complex questions of degree.  Davis conceded that he faced binding anti-

				precedent in the Eleventh Circuit.  But future litigants will be less forthcoming.

				At the same time,

What rules can be developed for determining when, where, and how these different kinds of precedents do, or do not, count as relevant binding precedent?  The

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				We cannot release criminals from jail merely because we think one case is a particularly appropriate one [to announce a constitutional doctrine] … .  Simply fishing one case from the stream of appellate review, using it as a vehicle for pronouncing new constitutional standards, and then permitting a stream of similar cases subsequently to flow by unaffected by that new rule constitute an indefensible departure from [our ordinary] model of judicial review.

				Of course, the Court may, as it suggests, avoid this un-fairness by refusing to apply the exclusionary rule even 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				to the defendant in the very case in which it announces a new rule.  But that approach would make matters worse.  What would then happen in the lower courts?  How would courts of appeals, for example, come to reconsider their prior decisions when other circuits cases lead them to believe those decisions may be wrong?  Why would a defendant seek to overturn any such decision?  After all, if the (incorrect) circuit precedent is clear, then even if 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>

				Perhaps more important, the Courts rationale for creating its new good faith exception threatens to undermine well-settled 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> law.  The Court correctly says that pre-
				<em>
					Gant
				</em>
				 Eleventh Circuit precedent had held that a 
				<em>
					Gant-
				</em>
				type search was constitutional; hence the police conduct in this case, consistent with that precedent, was innocent.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 10.  But the Court then finds this fact sufficient to create a new good faith exception to the exclusionary rule.  It reasons that the sole purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter future 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> violations, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 6.  The deterrence benefits of exclusion vary with the culpability of the law enforcement conduct at issue, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 8 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).  Those benefits are sufficient to jus-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				tify exclusion where police exhibit deliberate, reckless, 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				or grossly negligent disregard for 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> rights, 
				<em>
					ibid. 
				</em>
				(internal quotation marks omitted).  But those benefits do not justify exclusion where, as here, the police act with simple, isolated negligence or an objectively reasonable good-faith belief that their conduct is lawful,

				(internal quotation marks omitted).

				The Court has thought of that rule not as punishment for the individual officer or as reparation for the individual defendant but more generally as 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				an effective way to secure enforcement of the

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The fact that such exceptions are few and far between is understandable.  Defendants frequently move to suppress evidence on 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> grounds.  In many, perhaps most, of these instances the police, uncertain of how the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> applied to the particular factual circumstances they faced, will have acted in objective good faith.  Yet, in a significant percentage of these instances, courts will find that the police were wrong.  And, unless the police conduct falls into one of the exceptions previously noted, courts have required the suppression of the evidence seized.  1 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure §1.3, pp. 103104 (4th ed. 2004) (good faith exception has not yet been applied to warrantless searches and seizures beyond the rather special situations of 
				<em>
					Evans

				, 
				<em>

				</em>
				, and 
				<em>
					Krull

				).  See Valdes, Frequency and Success: An Empirical Study of Criminal Law Defenses, Federal Constitutional Evidentiary Claims, and Plea Negotiations, 153

				But an officer who conducts a search that he believes complies with the Constitution but which, it ultimately turns out, falls just outside the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>s bounds is no more culpable than an officer who follows erroneous binding precedent.  Nor is an officer more culpable where circuit precedent is simply suggestive rather than binding, where it only describes how to treat roughly analogous instances, or where it just does not exist.  Thus, if the Court means what it now says, if it would place determinative weight upon the culpability of an individual officers conduct, and if it would apply the exclusionary rule only where a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> violation was deliberate, reckless, or grossly negligent, then the good faith exception will swallow the exclusionary rule.  Indeed, our broad dicta in 
				<em>
					Herring
				</em>
				dicta the Court repeats and expands upon todaymay already be leading lower courts in this direction.  See 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>

				</em>
				, 610 F. 3d 60, 6667 (CA2 2010) (assuming warrantless search was unconstitutional and remanding for District Court to perform the cost/benefit analysis required by 
				<em>
					Herring
				</em>
				 and to consider whether the degree of police culpability in this case rose beyond mere … negligence before ordering suppression); 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>

				</em>
				, 614 F. 3d 236, 243 (CA6 2010) ([T]he

				<em>
					Herring

				<em>

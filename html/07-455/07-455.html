        <h4 class="sylctb">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit</h4>
        <hr>
        <div class="opiniondates">No. 07455.Argued March 25, 2008Decided May 19, 2008</div>
        <hr>
        <p class="bodytext">After respondent gave false information on his customs form while attempting to enter the United States, a search of his car revealed explosives that he intended to detonate in this country.  He was convicted of, <em>inter alia, </em>(1) feloniously making a false statement to a customs official in violation of 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/1001.html" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. §1001</a>, and (2) carr[ying] an explosive during the commission of that felony in violation of §844(h)(2).  The Ninth Circuit set aside the latter conviction because it read during in §844(h)(2) to include a requirement that the explosive be carried in relation to the underlying felony.</p>
        <p class="SYLCTE">
            <em>Held:</em> Since respondent was carrying explosives when he violated §1001, he was carrying them during the commission of that felony.  The most natural reading of §844(h)(2) provides a sufficient basis for reversal.  It is undisputed that the items in respondents car were explosives, and that he was carr[ying] those explosives when he knowingly made false statements to a customs official in violation of §1001.  Dictionary definitions need not be consulted to arrive at the conclusion that he engaged in §844(h)(2)s precise conduct.  [D]uring denotes a temporal link.  Because his carrying of explosives was contemporaneous with his §1001 violation, he carried them during that violation.  The statutes history further supports the conclusion that Congress did not intend a relational requirement in §844(h) as presently written.  Pp. 26</p>

        <p class="bodytext">At respondent Musladins murder trial, members of the victims family sat in the front row of the spectators gallery wearing buttons displaying the victims image.  The trial court denied Musladins motion to order the family members not to wear the buttons.  The California Court of Appeal upheld Musladins conviction, stating that he had to show actual or inherent prejudice to succeed on the buttons claim; citing <em>Holbrook</em> v. <em>Flynn</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/475/560" class="subref" title="subref">475 U. S. 560</a>, as providing the test for inherent prejudice; and ruling that he had not satisfied that test.  The Federal District Court denied Musladins habeas petition, but the Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded, finding that the state courts decision was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2254.html#d_1" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1)</a>, as determined by this Court in <em>Estelle</em> v. <em>Williams</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/425/501" class="subref" title="subref">425 U. S. 501</a>, and <em>Flynn</em>, <em>supra</em>.</p>
        <p class="SYLCTE">
            <em>Held: </em>The Ninth Circuit improperly concluded that the California Court of Appeals decision was contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by this Court.  Pp. 37.</p>
        <p class="SYLCTF">    (a) Because clearly established Federal law in §2254(d)(1) refers to the holdings, as opposed to the dicta, of this Courts decisions as of the time of the relevant state-court decision, <em>Williams</em> v. <em>Taylor</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/529/362" class="subref" title="subref">529 U. S. 362</a>, federal habeas relief may be granted here if the California Court of Appeals decision was contrary to or involved an unreasonable application of this Courts applicable holdings.  Pp. 34.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    (b) This Court addressed the effect of courtroom practices on defendants fair-trial rights in <em>Williams</em>, in which the State compelled the defendant to stand trial in prison clothes, and <em>Flynn</em>, in which the State seated uniformed state troopers in the row of spectators seats immediately behind the defendant at trial.  In both cases, which dealt with government-sponsored practices, the Court noted that some practices are so inherently prejudicial that they must be justified by an essential state policy or interest.  <em> E.g., Williams</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 505.  Pp. 45.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    (c) In contrast to state-sponsored courtroom practices, the effect on a defendants fair-trial rights of the spectator conduct to which Musladin objects is an open question in this Courts jurisprudence.  The Court has never addressed a claim that such private-actor courtroom conduct was so inherently prejudicial that it deprived a defendant of a fair trial or applied the test for inherent prejudice in <em>Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em> to spectators conduct.  Indeed, part of that testasking whether the practices furthered an essential <em>state</em> interestsuggests that those cases apply only to state-sponsored practices.  Reflecting the lack of guidance from this Court, lower courts have diverged widely in their treatment of defendants spectator-conduct claims.  Given the lack of applicable holdings from this Court, it cannot be said that the state court unreasonably appli[ed] … clearly established Federal law.  Pp. 57.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    This Court has recognized that certain courtroom practices are so inherently prejudicial that they deprive the defendant of a fair trial.  <em>Estelle</em> v. <em>Williams</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/425/501" class="subref" title="subref">425 U. S. 501</a>,

.  In this case, a state court held that buttons displaying the victims image worn by the victims family during respondents trial did not deny respondent his right to a fair trial.  We must decide whether that holding was contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law, as determined by this Court.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2254.html#d_1" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1)</a>.  We hold that it was not.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">I</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    On May 13, 1994, respondent Mathew Musladin shot and killed Tom Studer outside the home of Musladins estranged wife, Pamela.  At trial, Musladin admitted that he killed Studer but argued that he did so in self-defense.  A California jury rejected Musladins self-defense argument and convicted him of first-degree murder and three related offenses.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    During Musladins trial, several members of Studers family sat in the front row of the spectators gallery.  On at least some of the trials 14 days, some members of Studers family wore buttons with a photo of Studer on them.<a name="ZO-1ref" href="#ZO-1" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>1</b>
                </sup>
            </a>  Prior to opening statements, Musladins counsel moved the court to order the Studer family not to wear the buttons during the trial.  The court denied the motion, stating that it saw no possible prejudice to the defendant.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 74a.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Musladin appealed his conviction to the California Court of Appeal in 1997.  He argued that the buttons deprived him of his 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a> and 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> rights.  At the outset of its analysis, the Court of Appeal stated that Musladin had to show actual or inherent prejudice to succeed on his claim and cited <em>Flynn</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 570, as providing the test for inherent prejudice.  The Court of Appeal, quoting part of <em>Flynn</em>s test, made clear that it consider[ed] the wearing of photographs of victims in a courtroom to be an impermissible factor coming into play, the practice of which should be discouraged.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 75a (quoting <em>Flynn</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 570).  Nevertheless, the court concluded, again quoting <em>Flynn, supra</em>, at 571, that the buttons had not branded defendant with an unmistakable mark of guilt in the eyes of the jurors because [t]he simple photograph of Tom Studer was unlikely to have been taken as a sign of anything other than the normal grief occasioned by the loss of [a] family member.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 75a.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    At the conclusion of the state appellate process, Musladin filed an application for writ of habeas corpus in federal district court pursuant to §2254.  In his application, Musladin argued that the buttons were inherently prejudicial and that the California Court of Appeal erred by holding that the Studers wearing of the buttons did not deprive him of a fair trial.  The District Court denied habeas relief but granted a certificate of appealability on the buttons issue.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded for issuance of the writ, finding that under §2254 the state courts decision was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.  §2254(d)(1).  According to the Court of Appeals, this Courts decisions in <em>Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em> clearly established a rule of federal law applicable to Musladins case.  <em>Musladin</em> v. <em>Lamarque</em>, 427 F. 3d 653, 656658 (2005).  Specifically, the Court of Appeals cited its own precedent in support of its conclusion that <em>Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em> clearly established the test for inherent prejudice applicable to spectators courtroom conduct.  427 F. 3d, at 657658 (citing <em>Norris</em> v. <em>Risley</em>, 918 F. 2d 828 (CA9 1990)).  The Court of Appeals held that the state courts application of a test for inherent prejudice that differed from the one stated in <em>Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em> was contrary to clearly established federal law and constituted an unreasonable application of that law.  427 F. 3d, at 659660.  The Court of Appeals denied rehearing en banc.  427 F. 3d 647 (2005).  We granted certiorari, 547 U. S. ___ (2006), and now vacate.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">
In <em>Williams</em> v. <em>Taylor</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/529/362" class="subref" title="subref">529 U. S. 362</a> (2000)
, we explained that clearly established Federal law in §2254(d)(1) refers to the holdings, as opposed to the dicta, of this Courts decisions as of the time of the relevant state-court decision.  <em>Id.,</em> at 412.  Therefore, federal habeas relief may be granted here if the California Court of Appeals decision was contrary to or involved an unreasonable application of this Courts applicable holdings.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">A</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In <em>Estelle</em> v. <em>Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em>, this Court addressed the effect of courtroom practices on defendants fair-trial rights.  In <em>Williams</em>, the Court considered whether an accused who is compelled to wear identifiable prison clothing at his trial by a jury is denied due process or equal protection of the laws.  425 U. S., at 502.  The Court stated that the State cannot, consistently with the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>, compel an accused to stand trial before a jury while dressed in identifiable prison clothes, <em>id.,</em> at 512, but held that the defendant in that case had waived any objection to being tried in prison clothes by failing to object at trial, <em>id.,</em> at 512513.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In <em>Flynn</em>, the Court addressed whether seating four uniformed state troopers in the row of spectators seats immediately behind the defendant at trial denied the defendant his right to a fair trial.  475 U. S., at 562.  The Court held that the presence of the troopers was not so inherently prejudicial that it denied the defendant a fair trial.  <em>Id.,</em> at 571.  In reaching that holding, the Court stated that the question must be … whether an unacceptable risk is presented of impermissible factors coming into play.   <em>Id.</em>, at 570 (quoting <em>Williams</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 505).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Both <em>Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em> dealt with government-sponsored practices: In <em>Williams</em>, the State compelled the defendant to stand trial in prison clothes, and in <em>Flynn</em>, the State seated the troopers immediately behind the defendant.  Moreover, in both cases, this Court noted that some practices are so inherently prejudicial that they must be justified by an essential state policy or interest.  <em>Williams, supra</em>, at 505 (concluding that the practice further[ed] no essential state policy); <em>Flynn, supra</em>, at 568569 (holding that the practice was not of the sort that had to be justified by an essential state interest).</p>
        <p class="opcentered">B</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In contrast to state-sponsored courtroom practices, the effect on a defendants fair-trial rights of the spectator conduct to which Musladin objects is an open question in our jurisprudence.  This Court has never addressed a claim that such private-actor courtroom conduct was so inherently prejudicial that it deprived a defendant of a fair trial.<a name="ZO-2ref" href="#ZO-2" class="">

                </sup>
            </a>  And although the Court articulated the test for inherent prejudice that applies to state conduct in <em>Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em>, we have never applied that test to spectators conduct.  Indeed, part of the legal test of<em> Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em>asking whether the practices furthered an essential <em>state</em> interestsuggests that those cases apply only to state-sponsored practices.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Reflecting the lack of guidance from this Court, lower courts have diverged widely in their treatment of defendants spectator-conduct claims.  Some courts have applied <em>Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em> to spectators conduct.  <em>Norris</em> v. <em>Risley, </em>918 F. 2d, at 830831 (applying <em>Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em> to hold spectators buttons worn during a trial deprived the defendant of a fair trial); <em>In re Woods</em>, 154 Wash. 2d 400, 416418, 114 P. 3d 607, 616617 (2005) (en banc) (applying <em>Flynn</em> but concluding that ribbons worn by spectators did not prejudice the defendant).  Other courts have declined to extend <em>Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em> to spectators conduct.  <em>Billings</em> v. <em>Polk</em>, 441 F. 3d 238, 246247 (CA4 2006) (These precedents do not clearly establish that a defendants right to a fair jury trial is violated whenever an article of clothing worn at trial arguably conveys a message about the matter before the jury); <em>Davis</em> v. <em>State</em>, No. 07030457CR, 2006 WL 1211091, *67 (Tex. App., May 3, 2006) (Appellant does not cite any authority holding the display of this type of item by spectators creates inherent prejudice).  Other courts have distinguished <em>Flynn</em> on the facts.  <em>Pachl</em> v. <em>Zenon</em>, 145 Ore. App. 350, 360, n. 1, 929 P. 2d 1088, 10931094, n. 1 (1996) (in banc).  And still other courts have ruled on spectator-conduct claims without relying on, discussing, or distinguishing <em>Williams</em> or <em>Flynn</em>.  <em>Buckner</em> v. <em>State</em>, 714 So. 2d 384, 388389 (Fla. 1998) <em>(per curiam);</em>
            <em>State</em> v. <em>Speed</em>, 265 Kan. 26, 4748, 961 P. 2d 13, 2930 (1998); <em>Nguyen</em> v. <em>State</em>, 977 S. W. 2d 450, 457 (Tex. App. 1998); <em>Kenyon</em> v. <em>State</em>, 58 Ark. App. 24, 3335, 946 S. W. 2d 705, 710711 (1997); <em>State</em> v. <em>Nelson, </em>960883, pp. 910 (La. App. 12/17/97), 705 So. 2d 758, 763.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Given the lack of holdings from this Court regarding the potentially prejudicial effect of spectators courtroom conduct of the kind involved here, it cannot be said that the state court unreasonabl[y] appli[ed] clearly established Federal law.  §2254(d)(1).  No holding of this Court required the California Court of Appeal to apply the test of <em>Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em> to the spectators conduct here.  Therefore, the state courts decision was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">III</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court of Appeals improperly concluded that the California Court of Appeals decision was contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by this Court.  For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is<span class="softbreak"></span>remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>

.  In this case, a state court held that buttons displaying the victims image worn by the victims family during respondents trial did not deny respondent his right to a fair trial.  We must decide whether that holding was contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law, as determined by this Court.

        <p class="bodytext">    On May 13, 1994, respondent Mathew Musladin shot and killed Tom Studer outside the home of Musladins estranged wife, Pamela.  At trial, Musladin admitted that he killed Studer but argued that he did so in self-defense.  A California jury rejected Musladins self-defense argument and convicted him of first-degree murder and three related offenses.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    During Musladins trial, several members of Studers family sat in the front row of the spectators gallery.  On at least some of the trials 14 days, some members of Studers family wore buttons with a photo of Studer on them.<a name="ZO-1ref" href="#ZO-1" class="">

                </sup>
            </a>  Prior to opening statements, Musladins counsel moved the court to order the Studer family not to wear the buttons during the trial.  The court denied the motion, stating that it saw no possible prejudice to the defendant.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 74a.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Musladin appealed his conviction to the California Court of Appeal in 1997.  He argued that the buttons deprived him of his 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a> and 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> rights.  At the outset of its analysis, the Court of Appeal stated that Musladin had to show actual or inherent prejudice to succeed on his claim and cited <em>Flynn</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 570, as providing the test for inherent prejudice.  The Court of Appeal, quoting part of <em>Flynn</em>s test, made clear that it consider[ed] the wearing of photographs of victims in a courtroom to be an impermissible factor coming into play, the practice of which should be discouraged.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 75a (quoting <em>Flynn</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 570).  Nevertheless, the court concluded, again quoting <em>Flynn, supra</em>, at 571, that the buttons had not branded defendant with an unmistakable mark of guilt in the eyes of the jurors because [t]he simple photograph of Tom Studer was unlikely to have been taken as a sign of anything other than the normal grief occasioned by the loss of [a] family member.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 75a.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    At the conclusion of the state appellate process, Musladin filed an application for writ of habeas corpus in federal district court pursuant to §2254.  In his application, Musladin argued that the buttons were inherently prejudicial and that the California Court of Appeal erred by holding that the Studers wearing of the buttons did not deprive him of a fair trial.  The District Court denied habeas relief but granted a certificate of appealability on the buttons issue.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded for issuance of the writ, finding that under §2254 the state courts decision was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.  §2254(d)(1).  According to the Court of Appeals, this Courts decisions in <em>Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em> clearly established a rule of federal law applicable to Musladins case.  <em>Musladin</em> v. <em>Lamarque</em>, 427 F. 3d 653, 656658 (2005).  Specifically, the Court of Appeals cited its own precedent in support of its conclusion that <em>Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em> clearly established the test for inherent prejudice applicable to spectators courtroom conduct.  427 F. 3d, at 657658 (citing <em>Norris</em> v. <em>Risley</em>, 918 F. 2d 828 (CA9 1990)).  The Court of Appeals held that the state courts application of a test for inherent prejudice that differed from the one stated in <em>Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em> was contrary to clearly established federal law and constituted an unreasonable application of that law.  427 F. 3d, at 659660.  The Court of Appeals denied rehearing en banc.  427 F. 3d 647 (2005).  We granted certiorari, 547 U. S. ___ (2006), and now vacate.</p>

In <em>Williams</em> v. <em>Taylor</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/529/362" class="subref" title="subref">529 U. S. 362</a> (2000)

Therefore, federal habeas relief may be granted here if the California Court of Appeals decision was contrary to or involved an unreasonable application of this Courts applicable holdings.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">A</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In <em>Estelle</em> v. <em>Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em>, this Court addressed the effect of courtroom practices on defendants fair-trial rights.  In <em>Williams</em>, the Court considered whether an accused who is compelled to wear identifiable prison clothing at his trial by a jury is denied due process or equal protection of the laws.  425 U. S., at 502.  The Court stated that the State cannot, consistently with the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>, compel an accused to stand trial before a jury while dressed in identifiable prison clothes, <em>id.,</em> at 512, but held that the defendant in that case had waived any objection to being tried in prison clothes by failing to object at trial, <em>id.,</em> at 512513.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In <em>Flynn</em>, the Court addressed whether seating four uniformed state troopers in the row of spectators seats immediately behind the defendant at trial denied the defendant his right to a fair trial.  475 U. S., at 562.  The Court held that the presence of the troopers was not so inherently prejudicial that it denied the defendant a fair trial.  <em>Id.,</em> at 571.  In reaching that holding, the Court stated that the question must be … whether an unacceptable risk is presented of impermissible factors coming into play.   <em>Id.</em>, at 570 (quoting <em>Williams</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 505).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Both <em>Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em> dealt with government-sponsored practices: In <em>Williams</em>, the State compelled the defendant to stand trial in prison clothes, and in <em>Flynn</em>, the State seated the troopers immediately behind the defendant.  Moreover, in both cases, this Court noted that some practices are so inherently prejudicial that they must be justified by an essential state policy or interest.  <em>Williams, supra</em>, at 505 (concluding that the practice further[ed] no essential state policy); <em>Flynn, supra</em>, at 568569 (holding that the practice was not of the sort that had to be justified by an essential state interest).</p>
        <p class="opcentered">B</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In contrast to state-sponsored courtroom practices, the effect on a defendants fair-trial rights of the spectator conduct to which Musladin objects is an open question in our jurisprudence.  This Court has never addressed a claim that such private-actor courtroom conduct was so inherently prejudicial that it deprived a defendant of a fair trial.<a name="ZO-2ref" href="#ZO-2" class="">

                </sup>
            </a>  And although the Court articulated the test for inherent prejudice that applies to state conduct in <em>Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em>, we have never applied that test to spectators conduct.  Indeed, part of the legal test of<em> Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em>asking whether the practices furthered an essential <em>state</em> interestsuggests that those cases apply only to state-sponsored practices.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Reflecting the lack of guidance from this Court, lower courts have diverged widely in their treatment of defendants spectator-conduct claims.  Some courts have applied <em>Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em> to spectators conduct.  <em>Norris</em> v. <em>Risley, </em>918 F. 2d, at 830831 (applying <em>Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em> to hold spectators buttons worn during a trial deprived the defendant of a fair trial); <em>In re Woods</em>, 154 Wash. 2d 400, 416418, 114 P. 3d 607, 616617 (2005) (en banc) (applying <em>Flynn</em> but concluding that ribbons worn by spectators did not prejudice the defendant).  Other courts have declined to extend <em>Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em> to spectators conduct.  <em>Billings</em> v. <em>Polk</em>, 441 F. 3d 238, 246247 (CA4 2006) (These precedents do not clearly establish that a defendants right to a fair jury trial is violated whenever an article of clothing worn at trial arguably conveys a message about the matter before the jury); <em>Davis</em> v. <em>State</em>, No. 07030457CR, 2006 WL 1211091, *67 (Tex. App., May 3, 2006) (Appellant does not cite any authority holding the display of this type of item by spectators creates inherent prejudice).  Other courts have distinguished <em>Flynn</em> on the facts.  <em>Pachl</em> v. <em>Zenon</em>, 145 Ore. App. 350, 360, n. 1, 929 P. 2d 1088, 10931094, n. 1 (1996) (in banc).  And still other courts have ruled on spectator-conduct claims without relying on, discussing, or distinguishing <em>Williams</em> or <em>Flynn</em>.  <em>Buckner</em> v. <em>State</em>, 714 So. 2d 384, 388389 (Fla. 1998) <em>(per curiam);</em>
            <em>State</em> v. <em>Speed</em>, 265 Kan. 26, 4748, 961 P. 2d 13, 2930 (1998); <em>Nguyen</em> v. <em>State</em>, 977 S. W. 2d 450, 457 (Tex. App. 1998); <em>Kenyon</em> v. <em>State</em>, 58 Ark. App. 24, 3335, 946 S. W. 2d 705, 710711 (1997); <em>State</em> v. <em>Nelson, </em>960883, pp. 910 (La. App. 12/17/97), 705 So. 2d 758, 763.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Given the lack of holdings from this Court regarding the potentially prejudicial effect of spectators courtroom conduct of the kind involved here, it cannot be said that the state court unreasonabl[y] appli[ed] clearly established Federal law.  §2254(d)(1).  No holding of this Court required the California Court of Appeal to apply the test of <em>Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em> to the spectators conduct here.  Therefore, the state courts decision was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">III</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court of Appeals improperly concluded that the California Court of Appeals decision was contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by this Court.  For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is<span class="softbreak"></span>remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>

            </a>  Prior to opening statements, Musladins counsel moved the court to order the Studer family not to wear the buttons during the trial.  The court denied the motion, stating that it saw no possible prejudice to the defendant.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 74a.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Musladin appealed his conviction to the California Court of Appeal in 1997.  He argued that the buttons deprived him of his 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a> and 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> rights.  At the outset of its analysis, the Court of Appeal stated that Musladin had to show actual or inherent prejudice to succeed on his claim and cited <em>Flynn</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 570, as providing the test for inherent prejudice.  The Court of Appeal, quoting part of <em>Flynn</em>s test, made clear that it consider[ed] the wearing of photographs of victims in a courtroom to be an impermissible factor coming into play, the practice of which should be discouraged.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 75a (quoting <em>Flynn</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 570).  Nevertheless, the court concluded, again quoting <em>Flynn, supra</em>, at 571, that the buttons had not branded defendant with an unmistakable mark of guilt in the eyes of the jurors because [t]he simple photograph of Tom Studer was unlikely to have been taken as a sign of anything other than the normal grief occasioned by the loss of [a] family member.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 75a.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    At the conclusion of the state appellate process, Musladin filed an application for writ of habeas corpus in federal district court pursuant to §2254.  In his application, Musladin argued that the buttons were inherently prejudicial and that the California Court of Appeal erred by holding that the Studers wearing of the buttons did not deprive him of a fair trial.  The District Court denied habeas relief but granted a certificate of appealability on the buttons issue.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded for issuance of the writ, finding that under §2254 the state courts decision was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.  §2254(d)(1).  According to the Court of Appeals, this Courts decisions in <em>Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em> clearly established a rule of federal law applicable to Musladins case.  <em>Musladin</em> v. <em>Lamarque</em>, 427 F. 3d 653, 656658 (2005).

Some courts have applied <em>Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em> to spectators conduct.  <em>Norris</em> v. <em>Risley, </em>918 F. 2d, at 830831 (applying <em>Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em> to hold spectators buttons worn during a trial deprived the defendant of a fair trial); <em>In re Woods</em>, 154 Wash. 2d 400, 416418, 114 P. 3d 607, 616617 (2005) (en banc) (applying <em>Flynn</em> but concluding that ribbons worn by spectators did not prejudice the defendant).  Other courts have declined to extend <em>Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em> to spectators conduct.  <em>Billings</em> v. <em>Polk</em>, 441 F. 3d 238, 246247 (CA4 2006) (These precedents do not clearly establish that a defendants right to a fair jury trial is violated whenever an article of clothing worn at trial arguably conveys a message about the matter before the jury); <em>Davis</em> v. <em>State</em>, No. 07030457CR, 2006 WL 1211091, *67 (Tex. App., May 3, 2006) (Appellant does not cite any authority holding the display of this type of item by spectators creates inherent prejudice).  Other courts have distinguished <em>Flynn</em> on the facts.  <em>Pachl</em> v. <em>Zenon</em>, 145 Ore. App. 350, 360, n. 1, 929 P. 2d 1088, 10931094, n. 1 (1996) (in banc).  And still other courts have ruled on spectator-conduct claims without relying on, discussing, or distinguishing <em>Williams</em> or <em>Flynn</em>.  <em>Buckner</em> v. <em>State</em>, 714 So. 2d 384, 388389 (Fla. 1998) <em>(per curiam);</em>
            <em>State</em> v. <em>Speed</em>, 265 Kan. 26, 4748, 961 P. 2d 13, 2930 (1998); <em>Nguyen</em> v. <em>State</em>, 977 S. W. 2d 450, 457 (Tex. App. 1998); <em>Kenyon</em> v. <em>State</em>, 58 Ark. App. 24, 3335, 946 S. W. 2d 705, 710711 (1997); <em>State</em> v. <em>Nelson, </em>960883, pp. 910 (La. App. 12/17/97), 705 So. 2d 758, 763.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Given the lack of holdings from this Court regarding the potentially prejudicial effect of spectators courtroom conduct of the kind involved here, it cannot be said that the state court unreasonabl[y] appli[ed] clearly established Federal law.  §2254(d)(1).  No holding of this Court required the California Court of Appeal to apply the test of <em>Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em> to the spectators conduct here.  Therefore, the state courts decision was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">III</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court of Appeals improperly concluded that the California Court of Appeals decision was contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by this Court.  For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is<span class="softbreak"></span>remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    This Court has recognized that certain courtroom practices are so inherently prejudicial that they deprive the defendant of a fair trial.  <em>Estelle</em> v. <em>Williams</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/425/501" class="subref" title="subref">425 U. S. 501</a>,

.  In this case, a state court held that buttons displaying the victims image worn by the victims family during respondents trial did not deny respondent his right to a fair trial.  We must decide whether that holding was contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law, as determined by this Court.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2254.html#d_1" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1)</a>.  We hold that it was not.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">I</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    On May 13, 1994, respondent Mathew Musladin shot and killed Tom Studer outside the home of Musladins estranged wife, Pamela.  At trial, Musladin admitted that he killed Studer but argued that he did so in self-defense.  A California jury rejected Musladins self-defense argument and convicted him of first-degree murder and three related offenses.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    During Musladins trial, several members of Studers family sat in the front row of the spectators gallery.  On at least some of the trials 14 days, some members of Studers family wore buttons with a photo of Studer on them.<a name="ZO-1ref" href="#ZO-1" class="">

                </sup>
            </a>  Prior to opening statements, Musladins counsel moved the court to order the Studer family not to wear the buttons during the trial.  The court denied the motion, stating that it saw no possible prejudice to the defendant.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 74a.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Musladin appealed his conviction to the California Court of Appeal in 1997.  He argued that the buttons deprived him of his 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a> and 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> rights.  At the outset of its analysis, the Court of Appeal stated that Musladin had to show actual or inherent prejudice to succeed on his claim and cited <em>Flynn</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 570, as providing the test for inherent prejudice.  The Court of Appeal, quoting part of <em>Flynn</em>s test, made clear that it consider[ed] the wearing of photographs of victims in a courtroom to be an impermissible factor coming into play, the practice of which should be discouraged.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 75a (quoting <em>Flynn</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 570).  Nevertheless, the court concluded, again quoting <em>Flynn, supra</em>, at 571, that the buttons had not branded defendant with an unmistakable mark of guilt in the eyes of the jurors because [t]he simple photograph of Tom Studer was unlikely to have been taken as a sign of anything other than the normal grief occasioned by the loss of [a] family member.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 75a.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    At the conclusion of the state appellate process, Musladin filed an application for writ of habeas corpus in federal district court pursuant to §2254.  In his application, Musladin argued that the buttons were inherently prejudicial and that the California Court of Appeal erred by holding that the Studers wearing of the buttons did not deprive him of a fair trial.  The District Court denied habeas relief but granted a certificate of appealability on the buttons issue.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded for issuance of the writ, finding that under §2254 the state courts decision was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.  §2254(d)(1).  According to the Court of Appeals, this Courts decisions in <em>Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em> clearly established a rule of federal law applicable to Musladins case.  <em>Musladin</em> v. <em>Lamarque</em>, 427 F. 3d 653, 656658 (2005).  Specifically, the Court of Appeals cited its own precedent in support of its conclusion that <em>Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em> clearly established the test for inherent prejudice applicable to spectators courtroom conduct.  427 F. 3d, at 657658 (citing <em>Norris</em> v. <em>Risley</em>, 918 F. 2d 828 (CA9 1990)).  The Court of Appeals held that the state courts application of a test for inherent prejudice that differed from the one stated in <em>Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em> was contrary to clearly established federal law and constituted an unreasonable application of that law.  427 F. 3d, at 659660.  The Court of Appeals denied rehearing en banc.  427 F. 3d 647 (2005).  We granted certiorari, 547 U. S. ___ (2006), and now vacate.</p>

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/529/362" class="subref" title="subref">529 U. S. 362</a> (2000)

Therefore, federal habeas relief may be granted here if the California Court of Appeals decision was contrary to or involved an unreasonable application of this Courts applicable holdings.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">A</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In <em>Estelle</em> v. <em>Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em>, this Court addressed the effect of courtroom practices on defendants fair-trial rights.  In <em>Williams</em>, the Court considered whether an accused who is compelled to wear identifiable prison clothing at his trial by a jury is denied due process or equal protection of the laws.  425 U. S., at 502.  The Court stated that the State cannot, consistently with the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>, compel an accused to stand trial before a jury while dressed in identifiable prison clothes, <em>id.,</em> at 512, but held that the defendant in that case had waived any objection to being tried in prison clothes by failing to object at trial, <em>id.,</em> at 512513.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In <em>Flynn</em>, the Court addressed whether seating four uniformed state troopers in the row of spectators seats immediately behind the defendant at trial denied the defendant his right to a fair trial.  475 U. S., at 562.  The Court held that the presence of the troopers was not so inherently prejudicial that it denied the defendant a fair trial.  <em>Id.,</em> at 571.  In reaching that holding, the Court stated that the question must be … whether an unacceptable risk is presented of impermissible factors coming into play.   <em>Id.</em>, at 570 (quoting <em>Williams</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 505).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Both <em>Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em> dealt with government-sponsored practices: In <em>Williams</em>, the State compelled the defendant to stand trial in prison clothes, and in <em>Flynn</em>, the State seated the troopers immediately behind the defendant.  Moreover, in both cases, this Court noted that some practices are so inherently prejudicial that they must be justified by an essential state policy or interest.  <em>Williams, supra</em>, at 505 (concluding that the practice further[ed] no essential state policy); <em>Flynn, supra</em>, at 568569 (holding that the practice was not of the sort that had to be justified by an essential state interest).</p>
        <p class="opcentered">B</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In contrast to state-sponsored courtroom practices, the effect on a defendants fair-trial rights of the spectator conduct to which Musladin objects is an open question in our jurisprudence.  This Court has never addressed a claim that such private-actor courtroom conduct was so inherently prejudicial that it deprived a defendant of a fair trial.<a name="ZO-2ref" href="#ZO-2" class="">

            </a>  And although the Court articulated the test for inherent prejudice that applies to state conduct in <em>Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em>, we have never applied that test to spectators conduct.  Indeed, part of the legal test of<em> Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em>asking whether the practices furthered an essential <em>state</em> interestsuggests that those cases apply only to state-sponsored practices.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Reflecting the lack of guidance from this Court, lower courts have diverged widely in their treatment of defendants spectator-conduct claims.  Some courts have applied <em>Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em> to spectators conduct.  <em>Norris</em> v. <em>Risley, </em>918 F. 2d, at 830831 (applying <em>Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em> to hold spectators buttons worn during a trial deprived the defendant of a fair trial); <em>In re Woods</em>, 154 Wash. 2d 400, 416418, 114 P. 3d 607, 616617 (2005) (en banc) (applying <em>Flynn</em> but concluding that ribbons worn by spectators did not prejudice the defendant).

        <p class="bodytext">    The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded for issuance of the writ, finding that under §2254 the state courts decision was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.  §2254(d)(1).  According to the Court of Appeals, this Courts decisions in <em>Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em> clearly established a rule of federal law applicable to Musladins case.  <em>Musladin</em> v. <em>Lamarque</em>, 427 F. 3d 653, 656658 (2005).  Specifically, the Court of Appeals cited its own precedent in support of its conclusion that <em>Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em> clearly established the test for inherent prejudice applicable to spectators courtroom conduct.  427 F. 3d, at 657658 (citing <em>Norris</em> v. <em>Risley</em>, 918 F. 2d 828 (CA9 1990)).  The Court of Appeals held that the state courts application of a test for inherent prejudice that differed from the one stated in <em>Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em> was contrary to clearly established federal law and constituted an unreasonable application of that law.  427 F. 3d, at 659660.  The Court of Appeals denied rehearing en banc.  427 F. 3d 647 (2005).  We granted certiorari, 547 U. S. ___ (2006), and now vacate.</p>

Therefore, federal habeas relief may be granted here if the California Court of Appeals decision was contrary to or involved an unreasonable application of this Courts applicable holdings.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">A</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In <em>Estelle</em> v. <em>Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em>, this Court addressed the effect of courtroom practices on defendants fair-trial rights.  In <em>Williams</em>, the Court considered whether an accused who is compelled to wear identifiable prison clothing at his trial by a jury is denied due process or equal protection of the laws.  425 U. S., at 502.  The Court stated that the State cannot, consistently with the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>, compel an accused to stand trial before a jury while dressed in identifiable prison clothes, <em>id.,</em> at 512, but held that the defendant in that case had waived any objection to being tried in prison clothes by failing to object at trial, <em>id.,</em> at 512513.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In <em>Flynn</em>, the Court addressed whether seating four uniformed state troopers in the row of spectators seats immediately behind the defendant at trial denied the defendant his right to a fair trial.  475 U. S., at 562.  The Court held that the presence of the troopers was not so inherently prejudicial that it denied the defendant a fair trial.  <em>Id.,</em> at 571.  In reaching that holding, the Court stated that the question must be … whether an unacceptable risk is presented of impermissible factors coming into play.   <em>Id.</em>, at 570 (quoting <em>Williams</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 505).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Both <em>Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em> dealt with government-sponsored practices: In <em>Williams</em>, the State compelled the defendant to stand trial in prison clothes, and in <em>Flynn</em>, the State seated the troopers immediately behind the defendant.  Moreover, in both cases, this Court noted that some practices are so inherently prejudicial that they must be justified by an essential state policy or interest.  <em>Williams, supra</em>, at 505 (concluding that the practice further[ed] no essential state policy); <em>Flynn, supra</em>, at 568569 (holding that the practice was not of the sort that had to be justified by an essential state interest).</p>
        <p class="opcentered">B</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In contrast to state-sponsored courtroom practices, the effect on a defendants fair-trial rights of the spectator conduct to which Musladin objects is an open question in our jurisprudence.  This Court has never addressed a claim that such private-actor courtroom conduct was so inherently prejudicial that it deprived a defendant of a fair trial.<a name="ZO-2ref" href="#ZO-2" class="">

                    <b>2</b>
                </sup>
            </a>  And although the Court articulated the test for inherent prejudice that applies to state conduct in <em>Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em>, we have never applied that test to spectators conduct.  Indeed, part of the legal test of<em> Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em>asking whether the practices furthered an essential <em>state</em> interestsuggests that those cases apply only to state-sponsored practices.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Reflecting the lack of guidance from this Court, lower courts have diverged widely in their treatment of defendants spectator-conduct claims.  Some courts have applied <em>Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em> to spectators conduct.  <em>Norris</em> v. <em>Risley, </em>918 F. 2d, at 830831 (applying <em>Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em> to hold spectators buttons worn during a trial deprived the defendant of a fair trial); <em>In re Woods</em>, 154 Wash. 2d 400, 416418, 114 P. 3d 607, 616617 (2005) (en banc) (applying <em>Flynn</em> but concluding that ribbons worn by spectators did not prejudice the defendant).  Other courts have declined to extend <em>Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em> to spectators conduct.  <em>Billings</em> v. <em>Polk</em>, 441 F. 3d 238, 246247 (CA4 2006) (These precedents do not clearly establish that a defendants right to a fair jury trial is violated whenever an article of clothing worn at trial arguably conveys a message about the matter before the jury); <em>Davis</em> v. <em>State</em>, No. 07030457CR, 2006 WL 1211091, *67 (Tex. App., May 3, 2006) (Appellant does not cite any authority holding the display of this type of item by spectators creates inherent prejudice).  Other courts have distinguished <em>Flynn</em> on the facts.  <em>Pachl</em> v. <em>Zenon</em>, 145 Ore. App. 350, 360, n. 1, 929 P. 2d 1088, 10931094, n. 1 (1996) (in banc).  And still other courts have ruled on spectator-conduct claims without relying on, discussing, or distinguishing <em>Williams</em> or <em>Flynn</em>.  <em>Buckner</em> v. <em>State</em>, 714 So. 2d 384, 388389 (Fla. 1998) <em>(per curiam);</em>
            <em>State</em> v. <em>Speed</em>, 265 Kan. 26, 4748, 961 P. 2d 13, 2930 (1998); <em>Nguyen</em> v. <em>State</em>, 977 S. W. 2d 450, 457 (Tex. App. 1998); <em>Kenyon</em> v. <em>State</em>, 58 Ark. App. 24, 3335, 946 S. W. 2d 705, 710711 (1997); <em>State</em> v. <em>Nelson, </em>960883, pp. 910 (La. App. 12/17/97), 705 So. 2d 758, 763.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Given the lack of holdings from this Court regarding the potentially prejudicial effect of spectators courtroom conduct of the kind involved here, it cannot be said that the state court unreasonabl[y] appli[ed] clearly established Federal law.  §2254(d)(1).  No holding of this Court required the California Court of Appeal to apply the test of <em>Williams</em> and <em>Flynn</em> to the spectators conduct here.  Therefore, the state courts decision was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">III</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court of Appeals improperly concluded that the California Court of Appeals decision was contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by this Court.  For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is<span class="softbreak"></span>remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>

, this Court issued two opinions announcing two separate holdings.  In Part IIB of Justice OConnors opinion, the Court held that an incorrect application of federal law was not necessarily an  unreasonable application of … clearly established Federal law  within the meaning of 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2254.html#d_1" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1)</a>.  529 U. S., at 409413.  In Parts III and IV of my opinion, in which Justice OConnor joined, the Court held that the Virginia Supreme Courts rejection of the petitioners claim that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel was both contrary to and an unreasonable application of law as determined by our earlier opinion in<em> Strickland</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/466/668" class="subref" title="subref">466 U. S. 668</a> (1984)

        <p class="bodytext">    In <em>Strickland</em>, we held that the petitioner had not been denied the effective assistance of counsel and upheld his sentence of death.  466 U. S., at 700.  While our ultimate <em>holding</em> rejected the petitioners ineffective assistance claim, the reasoning in our opinion (including carefully considered <em>dicta</em>) set forth the standards for evaluating such claims that have been accepted as clearly established law for over 20 years.  See <em>Williams</em>, 529 U. S., at 391.  Nevertheless, in a somewhat ironic dictum in her <em>Williams </em>opinion, Justice OConnor stated that the statutory phrase clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States refers to the holdings, as opposed to the dicta, of this Courts decisions as of the time of the relevant state-court decision.  <em>Id.,</em> at 412.

            </a>  Because I am persuaded that Justice OConnors dictum about dicta represents an incorrect interpretation of the statutes text, and because its repetition today is wholly unnecessary, I do not join the Courts opinion.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Virtually every one of the Courts opinions announcing a new application of a constitutional principle contains some explanatory language that is intended to provide guidance to lawyers and judges in future cases.  See, <em>e.g.,</em>

            <span class="smallcaps">Justice Stevens</span>, concurring in the judgment.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In<em> Williams</em> v. <em>Taylor</em>,

, this Court issued two opinions announcing two separate holdings.  In Part IIB of Justice OConnors opinion, the Court held that an incorrect application of federal law was not necessarily an  unreasonable application of … clearly established Federal law  within the meaning of 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2254.html#d_1" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1)</a>.  529 U. S., at 409413.  In Parts III and IV of my opinion, in which Justice OConnor joined, the Court held that the Virginia Supreme Courts rejection of the petitioners claim that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel was both contrary to and an unreasonable application of law as determined by our earlier opinion in<em> Strickland</em> v. <em>Washington</em>,

.  <em>Williams</em>, 529 U. S., at 390398.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In <em>Strickland</em>, we held that the petitioner had not been denied the effective assistance of counsel and upheld his sentence of death.  466 U. S., at 700.  While our ultimate <em>holding</em> rejected the petitioners ineffective assistance claim, the reasoning in our opinion (including carefully considered <em>dicta</em>) set forth the standards for evaluating such claims that have been accepted as clearly established law for over 20 years.  See <em>Williams</em>, 529 U. S., at 391.  Nevertheless, in a somewhat ironic dictum in her <em>Williams </em>opinion, Justice OConnor stated that the statutory phrase clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States refers to the holdings, as opposed to the dicta, of this Courts decisions as of the time of the relevant state-court decision.  <em>Id.,</em> at 412.  That dictum has been repeated in three subsequent opinions in which a bare majority of the Court rejected constitutional claims that four of us would have upheld.*<a name="ZC-*ref" href="#ZC-*" class="">

            </a>  Because I am persuaded that Justice OConnors dictum about dicta represents an incorrect interpretation of the statutes text, and because its repetition today is wholly unnecessary, I do not join the Courts opinion.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Virtually every one of the Courts opinions announcing a new application of a constitutional principle contains some explanatory language that is intended to provide guidance to lawyers and judges in future cases.  See, <em>e.g.,</em>
            <em>Crawford</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/541/36" class="subref" title="subref">541 U. S. 36</a> (2004)

; see also <em>Marbury</em> v. <em>Madison</em>, 1 Cranch 137 (1803).  It is quite wrong to invite state court judges to discount the importance of such guidance on the ground that it may not have been strictly necessary as an explanation of the Courts specific holding in the case.

The text of AEDPA itself provides sufficient obstacles to obtaining habeas relief without placing a judicial thumb on the wardens side of the scales.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Ultimately, however, my reasons for joining the Courts judgment in this case are essentially the same as those expressed by <span class="smallcaps">Justice Souter</span>, with one caveat.  In my opinion, there is no merit whatsoever to the suggestion that the

            <span class="smallcaps">Justice Stevens</span>, concurring in the judgment.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In<em> Williams</em> v. <em>Taylor</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/529/362" class="subref" title="subref">529 U. S. 362</a> (2000)
, this Court issued two opinions announcing two separate holdings.  In Part IIB of Justice OConnors opinion, the Court held that an incorrect application of federal law was not necessarily an  unreasonable application of … clearly established Federal law  within the meaning of 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2254.html#d_1" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1)</a>.  529 U. S., at 409413.  In Parts III and IV of my opinion, in which Justice OConnor joined, the Court held that the Virginia Supreme Courts rejection of the petitioners claim that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel was both contrary to and an unreasonable application of law as determined by our earlier opinion in<em> Strickland</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/466/668" class="subref" title="subref">466 U. S. 668</a> (1984)
.  <em>Williams</em>, 529 U. S., at 390398.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In <em>Strickland</em>, we held that the petitioner had not been denied the effective assistance of counsel and upheld his sentence of death.  466 U. S., at 700.  While our ultimate <em>holding</em> rejected the petitioners ineffective assistance claim, the reasoning in our opinion (including carefully considered <em>dicta</em>) set forth the standards for evaluating such claims that have been accepted as clearly established law for over 20 years.  See <em>Williams</em>, 529 U. S., at 391.  Nevertheless, in a somewhat ironic dictum in her <em>Williams </em>opinion, Justice OConnor stated that the statutory phrase clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States refers to the holdings, as opposed to the dicta, of this Courts decisions as of the time of the relevant state-court decision.  <em>Id.,</em> at 412.  That dictum has been repeated in three subsequent opinions in which a bare majority of the Court rejected constitutional claims that four of us would have upheld.*<a name="ZC-*ref" href="#ZC-*" class="">

                </sup>
            </a>  Because I am persuaded that Justice OConnors dictum about dicta represents an incorrect interpretation of the statutes text, and because its repetition today is wholly unnecessary, I do not join the Courts opinion.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Virtually every one of the Courts opinions announcing a new application of a constitutional principle contains some explanatory language that is intended to provide guidance to lawyers and judges in future cases.  See, <em>e.g.,</em>
            <em>Crawford</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/541/36" class="subref" title="subref">541 U. S. 36</a> (2004)

; see also <em>Marbury</em> v. <em>Madison</em>, 1 Cranch 137 (1803).  It is quite wrong to invite state court judges to discount the importance of such guidance on the ground that it may not have been strictly necessary as an explanation of the Courts specific holding in the case.  Cf. <em>County of Allegheny</em> v. <em>American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter</em>,

The text of AEDPA itself provides sufficient obstacles to obtaining habeas relief without placing a judicial thumb on the wardens side of the scales.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Ultimately, however, my reasons for joining the Courts judgment in this case are essentially the same as those expressed by <span class="smallcaps">Justice Souter</span>, with one caveat.  In my opinion, there is no merit whatsoever to the suggestion that the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> may provide some measure of protection to spectators in a courtroom who engage in actual or symbolic speech to express any point of view about an ongoing proceeding.</p>

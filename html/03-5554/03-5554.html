				Petitioner Hiibel was arrested and convicted in a Nevada court for refusing to identify himself to a police officer during an investigative stop involving a reported assault.  Nevadas stop and identify statute requires a person detained by an officer under suspicious circumstances to identify himself.  The state intermediate appellate court affirmed, rejecting Hiibels argument that the state laws application to his case violated the Fourth and 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a>s.  The Nevada Supreme Court affirmed.

				(a) State stop and identify statutes often combine elements of traditional vagrancy laws with provisions intended to regulate police behavior in the course of investigatory stops.  They vary from State to State, but all permit an officer to ask or require a suspect to disclose his identity.  In 
				<em>
					Papachristou
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Jacksonville,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/405/156" class="subref" title="subref">405 U. S. 156</a>, this Court invalidated a traditional vagrancy law for vagueness because of its broad scope and imprecise terms.  The Court recognized similar constitutional limitations in 
				<em>
					Brown
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Texas,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/443/47" class="subref" title="subref">443 U. S. 47</a>, where it invalidated a conviction for violating a Texas stop and identify statute on 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> grounds, and in 
				<em>
					Kolender
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Lawson,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/461/352" class="subref" title="subref">461 U. S. 352</a>, where it invalidated on vagueness grounds Californias modified stop and identify statute that required a suspect to give an officer credible and reliable  identification when asked to identify himself, 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 360.  This case begins where those cases left off.  Here, the initial stop was based on reasonable suspicion, satisfying the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> requirements noted in 
				<em>
					Brown
				</em>
				.  Further, Hiibel has not alleged that the Nevada statute is unconstitutionally vague, as in 
				<em>
					Kolender
				</em>
				.  This statute is narrower and more precise.  In contrast to the credible and reliable identification requirement in 
				<em>
					Kolender,
				</em>
				 the Nevada Supreme Court has interpreted the instant statute to require only that a suspect disclose his name.  It apparently does not require him to produce a drivers license or any other document.  If he chooses either to state his name or communicate it to the officer by other means, the statute is satisfied and no violation occurs

				(b) The officers conduct did not violate Hiibels 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> rights.  Ordinarily, an investigating officer is free to ask a person for identification without implicating the Amendment.  
				<em>
					INS

				 v. 
				<em>
					Delgado,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/466/210" class="subref" title="subref">466 U. S. 210</a>.  Beginning with 
				<em>
					Terry
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Ohio,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/392/1" class="subref" title="subref">392 U. S. 1</a>, the Court has recognized that an officers reasonable suspicion that a person may be involved in criminal activity permits the officer to stop the person for a brief time and take additional steps to investigate further.  Although it is well established that an officer may ask a suspect to identify himself during a 
				<em>
					Terry
				</em>
				 stop, see, 
				<em>
					e.g., United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Hensley,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/469/221" class="subref" title="subref">469 U. S. 221</a>, it has been an open question whether the suspect can be arrested and prosecuted for refusal to answer, see 
				<em>
					Brown, supra
				</em>
				, at 53, n. 3.  The Court is now of the view that 
				<em>
					Terry
				</em>
				 principles permit a State to require a suspect to disclose his name in the course of a 
				<em>
					Terry
				</em>
				 stop.  
				<em>
					Terry, supra,
				</em>
				 at 34.  The Nevada statute is consistent with 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> prohibitions against unreasonable searches and seizures because it properly balances the intrusion on the individuals interests against the promotion of legitimate government interests.  See 
				<em>
					Delaware
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Prouse,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/440/648" class="subref" title="subref">440 U. S. 648</a>.  An identity request has an immediate relation to the 
				<em>
					Terry
				</em>
				 stops purpose, rationale, and practical demands, and the threat of criminal sanction helps ensure that the request does not become a legal nullity.  On the other hand, the statute does not alter the nature of the stop itself, changing neither its duration nor its location.  Hiibel argues unpersuasively that the statute circumvents the probable-cause requirement by allowing an officer to arrest a person for being suspicious, thereby creating an impermissible risk of arbitrary police conduct.  These familiar concerns underlay 
				<em>
					Kolender,
				</em>
            <em>
					Brown
				</em>
				, and 
				<em>
					Papachristou.  
				</em>
				They are met by the requirement that a 
				<em>
					Terry
				</em>
				 stop be justified at its inception and be reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the initial stop.  
				<em>
					Terry
				</em>
				, 392 U. S., at 20.  Under those principles, an officer may not arrest a suspect for failure to identify himself if the identification request is not reasonably related to the circumstances justifying the stop.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Hayes
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Florida,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/470/811" class="subref" title="subref">470 U. S. 811</a>.  The request in this case was a commonsense inquiry, not an effort to obtain an arrest for failure to identify after a 
				<em>
					Terry
				</em>
				 stop yielded insufficient evidence.  The stop, the request, and the States requirement of a response did not contravene the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>.  Pp. 610.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				(c) Hiibels contention that his conviction violates the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a>s prohibition on self-incrimination fails because disclosure of his name and identity presented no reasonable danger of incrimination.  The 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> prohibits only compelled testimony that is incriminating, see 
				<em>
					Brown
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Walker,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/161/591" class="subref" title="subref">161 U. S. 591</a>, and protects only against disclosures that the witness reasonably believes could be used in a criminal prosecution or could lead to other evidence that might be so used, 
				<em>
					Kastigar
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					United States,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/406/441" class="subref" title="subref">406 U. S. 441</a>.  Hiibels refusal to disclose was not based on any articulated real and appreciable fear that his name would be used to incriminate him, or that it would furnish evidence needed to prosecute him.  
				<em>
					Hoffman
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					United States,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/341/479" class="subref" title="subref">341 U. S. 479</a>.  It appears he refused to identify himself only because he thought his name was none of the officers business.  While the Court recognizes his strong belief that he should not have to disclose his identity, the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> does not override the Nevada Legislatures judgment to the contrary absent a reasonable belief that the disclosure would tend to incriminate him.  Answering a request to disclose a name is likely to be so insignificant as to be incriminating only in unusual circumstances.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g., Baltimore City Dept. of Social Servs.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Bouknight,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/493/549" class="subref" title="subref">493 U. S. 549</a>.  If a case arises where there is a substantial allegation that furnishing identity at the time of a stop would have given the police a link in the chain of evidence needed to convict the individual of a separate offense, the court can then consider whether the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> privilege applies, whether it has been violated, and what remedy must follow.  Those questions need not be resolved here.  1013.

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> are directed squarely toward those who are the focus of the governments investigative and prosecutorial powers.

				There is no reason why the subject of police interrogation based on mere suspicion, rather than probable cause, should have any lesser protection.  Indeed, we have said that the

Given our statements to the effect that citizens are not required to respond to police officers questions during a

				Given a proper understanding of the category of incriminating communications that fall within the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> privilege, it is clear that the disclosure of petitioners identity is protected.

				  If the Court is correct, then petitioners refusal to cooperate did not impede the police investigation.  Indeed, if we accept the predicate for the Courts holding, the statute requires nothing more than a useless invasion of privacy.  I think that, on the contrary, the Nevada Legislature intended to provide its police officers with a useful law enforcement tool, and that the very existence of the statute demonstrates the value of the information it demands.

				A persons identity obviously bears informational and incriminating worth, even if the [name] itself is not inculpatory.

A name can provide the key to a broad array of information about the person, particularly in the hands of a police officer with access to a range of law enforcement databases.  And that information, in turn, can be tremendously useful in a criminal prosecution.  It is therefore quite wrong to suggest that a persons identity provides a link in the chain to incriminating evidence only in unusual circumstances.

				Given a proper understanding of the category of incriminating communications that fall within the

				  If the Court is correct, then petitioners refusal to cooperate did not impede the police investigation.  Indeed, if we accept the predicate for the Courts holding, the statute requires nothing more than a useless invasion of privacy.  I think that, on the contrary, the Nevada Legislature intended to provide its police officers with a useful law enforcement tool, and that the very existence of the statute demonstrates the value of the information it demands.

A name can provide the key to a broad array of information about the person, particularly in the hands of a police officer with access to a range of law enforcement databases.

				  If the Court is correct, then petitioners refusal to cooperate did not impede the police investigation.  Indeed, if we accept the predicate for the Courts holding, the statute requires nothing more than a useless invasion of privacy.  I think that, on the contrary, the Nevada Legislature intended to provide its police officers with a useful law enforcement tool, and that the very existence of the statute demonstrates the value of the information it demands.

				Considered in light of these precedents, the compelled statement at issue in this case is clearly testimonial.  It is significant that the communication must be made in response to a question posed by a police officer.  As we recently explained, albeit in the different context of the

				The Court correctly observes that a communication does not enjoy the

				Considered in light of these precedents, the compelled statement at issue in this case is clearly testimonial.  It is significant that the communication must be made in response to a question posed by a police officer.  As we recently explained, albeit in the different context of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a>s Confrontation Clause, [w]hatever else the term [testimonial] covers, it applies at a minimum … to police interrogations.

				Rather than determining whether the communication at issue is testimonial, the Court instead concludes that the State can compel the disclosure of ones identity because it is not incriminating.

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> protection to statements that are incriminating in a much broader sense than the Court suggests.  It has long been settled that [the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a>s] protection encompasses compelled statements that lead to the discovery of incriminating evidence even though the statements themselves are not incriminating and are not introduced into evidence.

				Given a proper understanding of the category of incriminating communications that fall within the

				  If the Court is correct, then petitioners refusal to cooperate did not impede the police investigation.  Indeed, if we accept the predicate for the Courts holding, the statute requires nothing more than a useless invasion of privacy.  I think that, on the contrary, the Nevada Legislature intended to provide its police officers with a useful law enforcement tool, and that the very existence of the statute demonstrates the value of the information it demands.

A name can provide the key to a broad array of information about the person, particularly in the hands of a police officer with access to a range of law enforcement databases.

It is therefore quite wrong to suggest that a persons identity provides a link in the chain to incriminating evidence only in unusual circumstances.

				The Court correctly observes that a communication does not enjoy the

				Considered in light of these precedents, the compelled statement at issue in this case is clearly testimonial.  It is significant that the communication must be made in response to a question posed by a police officer.  As we recently explained, albeit in the different context of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a>s Confrontation Clause, [w]hatever else the term [testimonial] covers, it applies at a minimum … to police interrogations.  
				<em>

				 541 U. S. ___, ___ (2004) (slip op., at 33).  Surely police questioning during a

				 stop qualifies as an interrogation, and it follows that responses to such questions are testimonial in nature.

				Rather than determining whether the communication at issue is testimonial, the Court instead concludes that the State can compel the disclosure of ones identity because it is not incriminating.

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> protection to statements that are incriminating in a much broader sense than the Court suggests.  It has long been settled that [the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a>s] protection encompasses compelled statements that lead to the discovery of incriminating evidence even though the statements themselves are not incriminating and are not introduced into evidence.

				Given a proper understanding of the category of incriminating communications that fall within the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> privilege, it is clear that the disclosure of petitioners identity is protected.  The Court reasons that we should not assume that the disclosure of petitioners name would be used to incriminate him or that it would furnish a link in a chain of evidence needed to prosecute him.  
				<em>

				  If the Court is correct, then petitioners refusal to cooperate did not impede the police investigation.  Indeed, if we accept the predicate for the Courts holding, the statute requires nothing more than a useless invasion of privacy.  I think that, on the contrary, the Nevada Legislature intended to provide its police officers with a useful law enforcement tool, and that the very existence of the statute demonstrates the value of the information it demands.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				A persons identity obviously bears informational and incriminating worth, even if the [name] itself is not inculpatory.  
				<em>
					Hubbell
				</em>
				, 530 U. S., at 38.  A name can provide the key to a broad array of information about the person, particularly in the hands of a police officer with access to a range of law enforcement databases.  And that information, in turn, can be tremendously useful in a criminal prosecution.  It is therefore quite wrong to suggest that a persons identity provides a link in the chain to incriminating evidence only in unusual circumstances.

				The Court correctly observes that a communication does not enjoy the

				Considered in light of these precedents, the compelled statement at issue in this case is clearly testimonial.  It is significant that the communication must be made in response to a question posed by a police officer.  As we recently explained, albeit in the different context of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a>s Confrontation Clause, [w]hatever else the term [testimonial] covers, it applies at a minimum … to police interrogations.

				Given a proper understanding of the category of incriminating communications that fall within the

				  If the Court is correct, then petitioners refusal to cooperate did not impede the police investigation.  Indeed, if we accept the predicate for the Courts holding, the statute requires nothing more than a useless invasion of privacy.  I think that, on the contrary, the Nevada Legislature intended to provide its police officers with a useful law enforcement tool, and that the very existence of the statute demonstrates the value of the information it demands.

				A persons identity obviously bears informational and incriminating worth, even if the [name] itself is not inculpatory.

A name can provide the key to a broad array of information about the person, particularly in the hands of a police officer with access to a range of law enforcement databases.  And that information, in turn, can be tremendously useful in a criminal prosecution.  It is therefore quite wrong to suggest that a persons identity provides a link in the chain to incriminating evidence only in unusual circumstances.

				Given a proper understanding of the category of incriminating communications that fall within the

				  If the Court is correct, then petitioners refusal to cooperate did not impede the police investigation.  Indeed, if we accept the predicate for the Courts holding, the statute requires nothing more than a useless invasion of privacy.  I think that, on the contrary, the Nevada Legislature intended to provide its police officers with a useful law enforcement tool, and that the very existence of the statute demonstrates the value of the information it demands.

A name can provide the key to a broad array of information about the person, particularly in the hands of a police officer with access to a range of law enforcement databases.

It is therefore quite wrong to suggest that a persons identity provides a link in the chain to incriminating evidence only in unusual circumstances.

				Given a proper understanding of the category of incriminating communications that fall within the

				  If the Court is correct, then petitioners refusal to cooperate did not impede the police investigation.  Indeed, if we accept the predicate for the Courts holding, the statute requires nothing more than a useless invasion of privacy.  I think that, on the contrary, the Nevada Legislature intended to provide its police officers with a useful law enforcement tool, and that the very existence of the statute demonstrates the value of the information it demands.

A name can provide the key to a broad array of information about the person, particularly in the hands of a police officer with access to a range of law enforcement databases.

It is therefore quite wrong to suggest that a persons identity provides a link in the chain to incriminating evidence only in unusual circumstances.

				Given a proper understanding of the category of incriminating communications that fall within the

				  If the Court is correct, then petitioners refusal to cooperate did not impede the police investigation.  Indeed, if we accept the predicate for the Courts holding, the statute requires nothing more than a useless invasion of privacy.  I think that, on the contrary, the Nevada Legislature intended to provide its police officers with a useful law enforcement tool, and that the very existence of the statute demonstrates the value of the information it demands.

A name can provide the key to a broad array of information about the person, particularly in the hands of a police officer with access to a range of law enforcement databases.

It is therefore quite wrong to suggest that a persons identity provides a link in the chain to incriminating evidence only in unusual circumstances.

				  If the Court is correct, then petitioners refusal to cooperate did not impede the police investigation.  Indeed, if we accept the predicate for the Courts holding, the statute requires nothing more than a useless invasion of privacy.  I think that, on the contrary, the Nevada Legislature intended to provide its police officers with a useful law enforcement tool, and that the very existence of the statute demonstrates the value of the information it demands.

A name can provide the key to a broad array of information about the person, particularly in the hands of a police officer with access to a range of law enforcement databases.

				The Law School ranks among the Nations top law schools.  It receives more than 3,500 applications each year for a class of around 350 students.  Seeking to admit a group of students who individually and collectively are among the most capable, the Law School looks for individuals with substantial promise for success in law school and a strong likelihood of succeeding in the practice of law and contributing in diverse ways to the well-being of others.  App. 110.  More broadly, the Law School seeks a mix of students with varying backgrounds and experiences who will respect and learn from each other.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  In 1992, the dean of the Law School charged a
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				faculty committee with crafting a written admissions policy to implement these goals.  In particular, the Law School sought to ensure that its efforts to achieve student body diversity complied with this Courts most recent ruling on the use of race in university admissions.  See 
				<em>
					Regents of Univ. of Cal. 
				</em>
				v.

.  Upon the unanimous adoption of the committees report by the Law School faculty, it became the Law Schools official admissions policy.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The hallmark of that policy is its focus on academic ability coupled with a flexible assessment of applicants talents, experiences, and potential to contribute to the learning of those around them.  App. 111.  The policy requires admissions officials to evaluate each applicant based on all the information available in the file, including a personal statement, letters of recommendation, and an essay describing the ways in which the applicant will contribute to the life and diversity of the Law School.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 8384, 114121.  In reviewing an applicants file, admissions officials must consider the applicants undergraduate grade point average (GPA) and Law School Admissions Test (LSAT) score because they are important (if imperfect) predictors of academic success in law school.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 112.  The policy stresses that no applicant should be admitted unless we expect that applicant to do well enough to graduate with no serious academic problems.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 111.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The policy makes clear, however, that even the highest possible score does not guarantee admission to the Law School.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 113.  Nor does a low score automatically disqualify an applicant.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  Rather, the policy requires admissions officials to look beyond grades and test scores to other criteria that are important to the Law Schools educational objectives.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 114.  So-called  soft variables such as the enthusiasm of recommenders, the quality of the undergraduate institution, the quality of the applicants essay, and the areas and difficulty of undergraduate course selection are all brought to bear in assessing an applicants likely contributions to the intellectual and social life of the institution.  
				<em>

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The policy aspires to achieve that diversity which has the potential to enrich everyones education and thus make a law school class stronger than the sum of its parts.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 118.  The policy does not restrict the types of diversity contributions eligible for substantial weight in the admissions process, but instead recognizes many possible bases for diversity admissions.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 118, 120.  The policy does, however, reaffirm the Law Schools longstanding commitment to one particular type of diversity, that is, racial and ethnic diversity with special reference to the inclusion of students from groups which have been historically discriminated against, like African-Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans, who without this commitment might not be represented in our student body in meaningful numbers.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 120.  By enrolling a  critical mass of [underrepresented] minority students, the Law School seeks to ensur[e] their ability to make unique contributions to the character of the Law School.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 120121.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The policy does not define diversity solely in terms of racial and ethnic status.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 121.  Nor is the policy insensitive to the competition among all students for admission to the [L]aw [S]chool.  
				<em>

				Petitioner Barbara Grutter is a white Michigan resident who applied to the Law School in 1996 with a 3.8 grade point average and 161 LSAT score.  The Law School initially placed petitioner on a waiting list, but subsequently rejected her application.  In December 1997, petitioner filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan against the Law School, the Regents of the University of Michigan, Lee Bollinger (Dean of the Law School from 1987 to 1994, and President of the University of Michigan from 1996 to 2002), Jeffrey Lehman (Dean of the Law School), and Dennis Shields (Director of Admissions at the Law School from 1991 until 1998).  Petitioner alleged that respondents discriminated against her on the basis of race in violation of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>; Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Petitioner further alleged that her application was rejected because the Law School uses race as a predominant factor, giving applicants who belong to certain minority groups a significantly greater chance of admission than students with similar credentials from disfavored racial groups.  App. 3334.  Petitioner also alleged that respondents had no compelling interest to justify their use of race in the admissions process.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 34.  Petitioner requested compensatory and punitive damages, an order requiring the Law School to offer her admission, and an injunction prohibiting the Law School from continuing to discriminate on the basis of race.

				The District Court granted petitioners motion for class certification and for bifurcation of the trial into liability and damages phases.  The class was defined as  all persons who (A) applied for and were not granted admission to the University of Michigan Law School for the academic years since (and including) 1995 until the time that judgment is entered herein; and (B) were members of those racial or ethnic groups, including Caucasian, that Defendants treated less favorably in considering their applications for admission to the Law School.   App. to Pet. for Cert. 191a192a.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The District Court heard oral argument on the parties cross-motions for summary judgment on December 22, 2000.  Taking the motions under advisement, the District Court indicated that it would decide as a matter of law whether the Law Schools asserted interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body was compelling.  The District Court also indicated that it would conduct a bench trial on the extent to which race was a factor in the Law Schools admissions decisions, and whether the Law Schools consideration of race in admissions decisions constituted a race-based double standard.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				During the 15-day bench trial, the parties introduced extensive evidence concerning the Law Schools use of race in the admissions process.  Dennis Shields, Director of Admissions when petitioner applied to the Law School, testified that he did not direct his staff to admit a particular percentage or number of minority students, but rather to consider an applicants race along with all other factors.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 206a.  Shields testified that at the height of the admissions season, he would frequently consult the so-called daily reports that kept track of the racial and ethnic composition of the class (along with other information such as residency status and gender).  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 207a.  This was done, Shields testified, to ensure that a critical mass of underrepresented minority students would be reached so as to realize the educational benefits of a diverse student body.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  Shields stressed, however, that he did not seek to admit any particular number or percentage of underrepresented minority students.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Erica Munzel, who succeeded Shields as Director of Admissions, testified that  critical mass  means  meaningful numbers  or  meaningful representation,  which she understood to mean a number that encourages underrepresented minority students to participate in the classroom and not feel isolated.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 208a209a.  Munzel stated there is no number, percentage, or range of numbers or percentages that constitute critical mass.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 209a.  Munzel also asserted that she must consider the race of applicants because a critical mass of underrepresented minority students could not be enrolled if admissions decisions were based primarily on undergraduate GPAs and LSAT scores.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The current Dean of the Law School, Jeffrey Lehman, also testified.  Like the other Law School witnesses, Lehman did not quantify critical mass in terms of numbers or percentages.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 211a.  He indicated that critical mass means numbers such that underrepresented minority students do not feel isolated or like spokespersons for their race.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  When asked about the extent to which race is considered in admissions, Lehman testified that it varies from one applicant to another.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  In some cases, according to Lehmans testimony, an applicants race may play no role, while in others it may be a  determinative  factor.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The District Court heard extensive testimony from Professor Richard Lempert, who chaired the faculty committee that drafted the 1992 policy.  Lempert emphasized that the Law School seeks students with diverse interests and backgrounds to enhance classroom discussion and the educational experience both inside and outside the classroom.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 213a.  When asked about the policys  commitment to racial and ethnic diversity with special reference to the inclusion of students from groups which have been historically discriminated against,   Lempert explained that this language did not purport to remedy past discrimination, but rather to include students who may bring to the Law School a perspective different from that of members of groups which have not been the victims of such discrimination.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  Lempert acknowledged that other groups, such as Asians and Jews, have experienced discrimination, but explained they were not mentioned in the policy because individuals who are members of those groups were already being admitted to the Law School in significant numbers.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Kent Syverud was the final witness to testify about the Law Schools use of race in admissions decisions.  Syverud was a professor at the Law School when the 1992 admissions policy was adopted and is now Dean of Vanderbilt Law School.  In addition to his testimony at trial, Syverud submitted several expert reports on the educational benefits of diversity.  Syveruds testimony indicated that when a critical mass of underrepresented minority students is present, racial stereotypes lose their force because nonminority students learn there is no  minority viewpoint  but rather a variety of viewpoints among minority students.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 215a.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In an attempt to quantify the extent to which the Law School actually considers race in making admissions decisions, the parties introduced voluminous evidence at trial.  Relying on data obtained from the Law School, petitioners expert, Dr. Kinley Larntz, generated and analyzed admissions grids for the years in question (19952000).  These grids show the number of applicants and the number of admittees for all combinations of GPAs and LSAT scores.  Dr. Larntz made  cell-by-cell  comparisons between applicants of different races to determine whether a statistically significant relationship existed between race and admission rates.  He concluded that membership in certain minority groups  is an extremely strong factor in the decision for acceptance,  and that applicants from these minority groups  are given an extremely large allowance for admission  as compared to applicants who are members of nonfavored groups.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 218a220a.  Dr. Larntz conceded, however, that race is not the predominant factor in the Law Schools admissions calculus.  12 Tr. 1113 (Feb. 10, 2001).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Dr. Stephen Raudenbush, the Law Schools expert, focused on the predicted effect of eliminating race as a factor in the Law Schools admission process.  In Dr. Raudenbushs view, a race-blind admissions system would have a  very dramatic,  negative effect on underrepresented minority admissions.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 223a.  He testified that in 2000, 35 percent of underrepresented minority applicants were admitted.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  Dr. Raudenbush predicted that if race were not considered, only 10 percent of those applicants would have been admitted.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  Under this scenario, underrepresented minority students would have comprised 4 percent of the entering class in 2000 instead of the actual figure of 14.5 percent.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In the end, the District Court concluded that the Law Schools use of race as a factor in admissions decisions was unlawful.  Applying strict scrutiny, the District Court  determined that the Law Schools asserted interest in assembling a diverse student body was not compelling because the attainment of a racially diverse class … was not recognized as such by 
				<em>
					Bakke
				</em>
				 and is not a remedy for past discrimination.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 246a.  The District Court went on to hold that even if diversity were compelling, the Law School had not narrowly tailored its use of race to further that interest.  The District Court granted petitioners request for declaratory relief and enjoined the Law School from using race as a factor in its admissions decisions.  The Court of Appeals entered a stay of the injunction pending appeal.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Sitting en banc, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Courts judgment and vacated the injunction.  The Court of Appeals first held that Justice Powells opinion in 
				<em>
					Bakke
				</em>
				 was binding precedent establishing diversity as a compelling state interest.  According to the Court of Appeals, Justice Powells opinion with respect to diversity comprised the controlling rationale for the judgment of this Court under the analysis set forth in 
				<em>
					Marks
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					United States,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/430/188" class="subref" title="subref">430 U. S. 188</a> (1977)
.  The Court of Appeals also held that the Law Schools use of race was narrowly tailored because race was merely a potential plus factor and because the Law Schools program was virtually identical to the Harvard admissions program described approvingly by Justice Powell and appended to his 
				<em>
					Bakke 
				</em>
				opinion.  288 F. 3d 732, 746, 749 (CA6 2002).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Four dissenting judges would have held the Law Schools use of race unconstitutional.  Three of the dissenters, rejecting the majoritys 
				<em>
					Marks
				</em>
				 analysis, examined the Law Schools interest in student body diversity on the merits and concluded it was not compelling.  The fourth dissenter, writing separately, found it unnecessary to decide whether diversity was a compelling interest because, like the other dissenters, he believed that the Law Schools use of race was not narrowly tailored to further that interest.

				We last addressed the use of race in public higher education over 25 years ago.  In the landmark 
				<em>
					Bakke 
				</em>
				case, we reviewed a racial set-aside program that reserved 16 out of 100 seats in a medical school class for members of certain minority groups.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/438/265" class="subref" title="subref">438 U. S. 265</a> (1978)
.  The decision produced six separate opinions, none of which commanded a majority of the Court.  Four Justices would have upheld the program against all attack on the ground that the government can use race to remedy disadvantages cast on minorities by past racial prejudice.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 325 (joint opinion of Brennan, White, Marshall, and Blackmun, JJ., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).  Four other Justices avoided the constitutional question altogether and struck down the program on statutory grounds.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 408 (opinion of 
				<span class="smallcaps">

				</span>
				 and Stewart and 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Rehnquist,
				</span>
				 JJ., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).  Justice Powell provided a fifth vote not only for invalidating the set-aside program, but also for reversing the state courts injunction against any use of race whatsoever.  The only holding for the Court in 
				<em>
					Bakke
				</em>
				 was that a State has a substantial interest that legitimately may be served by a properly devised admissions program involving the competitive consideration of race and ethnic origin.  
				<em>
					Id.

				Since this Courts splintered decision in 
				<em>
					Bakke
				</em>
				, Justice Powells opinion announcing the judgment of the Court has served as the touchstone for constitutional analysis of race-conscious admissions policies.  Public and private universities across the Nation have modeled their own admissions programs on Justice Powells views on permissible race-conscious policies.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, Brief for Judith Areen et al. as 
				<em>

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Justice Powell began by stating that [t]he guarantee of equal protection cannot mean one thing when applied to one individual and something else when applied to a person of another color.  If both are not accorded the same protection, then it is not equal.  
				<em>
					Bakke
				</em>

				</em>
				at 289
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				290.  In Justice Powells view, when governmental decisions touch upon an individuals race or ethnic background, he is entitled to a judicial determination that the burden he is asked to bear on that basis is precisely tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 299.  Under this exacting standard, only one of the interests asserted by the university survived Justice Powells scrutiny.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				First, Justice Powell rejected an interest in  reducing the historic deficit of traditionally disfavored minorities in medical schools and in the medical profession  as an unlawful interest in racial balancing.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 306307.  Second, Justice Powell rejected an interest in remedying societal discrimination because such measures would risk placing unnecessary burdens on innocent third parties who bear no responsibility for whatever harm the beneficiaries of the special admissions program are thought to have suffered.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 310.  Third, Justice Powell rejected an interest in increasing the number of physicians who will practice in communities currently underserved, concluding that even if such an interest could be compelling in some circumstances the program under review was not geared to promote that goal.  
				<em>
					Id.

				<em>

				<em>

				With these principles in mind, we turn to the question whether the Law Schools use of race is justified by a compelling state interest.  Before this Court, as they have throughout this litigation, respondents assert only one justification for their use of race in the admissions process: obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body.  Brief for Respondents Bollinger et al. i.  In other words, the Law School asks us to recognize, in the context of higher education, a compelling state interest in student body diversity.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				We first wish to dispel the notion that the Law Schools argument has been foreclosed, either expressly or implicitly, by our affirmative-action cases decided since 
				<em>
					Bakke
				</em>
				.  It is true that some language in those opinions might be read to suggest that remedying past discrimination is the only permissible justification for race-based governmental action.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Richmond
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					J. A. Croson Co.,
				</em>
            <em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 493 (plurality opinion) (stating that unless classifications based on race are strictly reserved for remedial settings, they may in fact promote notions of racial inferiority and lead to a politics of racial hostility).  But we have never held that the only governmental use of race that can survive strict scrutiny is remedying past discrimination.  Nor, since 
				<em>
					Bakke
				</em>
				, have we directly addressed the use of race in the context of public higher education.  Today, we hold that the Law School has a compelling interest in attaining a diverse student body.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Law Schools educational judgment that such diversity is essential to its educational mission is one to which we defer.  The Law Schools assessment that diversity will, in fact, yield educational benefits is substantiated by respondents and their 
				<em>

				</em>
				.  Our scrutiny of the interest asserted by the Law School is no less strict for taking into account complex educational judgments in an area that lies primarily within the expertise of the university.

				The Law School does not premise its need for critical mass on any belief that minority students always (or even consistently) express some characteristic minority viewpoint on any issue. Brief for Respondent Bollinger et al. 30.  To the contrary, diminishing the force of such stereotypes is both a crucial part of the Law Schools mission, and one that it cannot accomplish with only token numbers of minority students.  Just as growing up in a particular region or having particular professional experiences is likely to affect an individuals views, so too is ones own, unique experience of being a racial minority in a society, like our own, in which race unfortunately still matters.  The Law School has determined, based on its experience and expertise, that a critical mass of underrepresented minorities is necessary to further its compelling interest in securing the educational benefits of a diverse student body.

				Justice Powells distinction between the medical schools rigid 16-seat quota and Harvards flexible use of race as a plus factor is instructive.  Harvard certainly had minimum

				The Law Schools goal of attaining a critical mass of underrepresented minority students does not transform its program into a quota.

				That a race-conscious admissions program does not operate as a quota does not, by itself, satisfy the requirement of individualized consideration.  When using race as a plus factor in university admissions, a universitys admissions program must remain flexible enough to ensure that each applicant is evaluated as an individual and not in a way that makes an applicants race or ethnicity the defining feature of his or her application.  The importance of this individualized consideration in the context of a race-conscious admissions program is paramount.  See 
				<em>
					Bakke
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 318, n. 52 (opinion of Powell, J.) (identifying the denial … of th[e] right to individualized consideration as the principal evil of the medical schools admissions program).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Here, the Law School engages in a highly individualized, holistic review of each applicants file, giving serious consideration to all the ways an applicant might contribute to a diverse educational environment.  The Law School affords this individualized consideration to applicants of all races.  There is no policy, either 
				<em>
					de jure
				</em>
				 or 
				<em>
					de facto
				</em>
				, of automatic acceptance or rejection based on any single soft variable.  Unlike the program at issue in 
				<em>
					Gratz
				</em>
				 v.
				<em>
					 Bollinger
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, the Law School awards no mechanical, predetermined diversity bonuses based on race or ethnicity.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 23 (distinguishing a race-conscious admissions program that automatically awards 20 points based on race from the Harvard plan, which considered race but did not contemplate that any single characteristic automatically ensured a specific and identifiable contribution to a universitys diversity).  Like the Harvard plan, the Law Schools admissions policy is flexible enough to consider all pertinent elements of diversity in light of the particular qualifications of each applicant, and to place them on the same footing for consideration, although not necessarily according them the same weight.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We also find that, like the Harvard plan Justice Powell referenced in 
				<em>
					Bakke
				</em>
				, the Law Schools race-conscious admissions program adequately ensures that all factors that may contribute to student body diversity are meaningfully considered alongside race in admissions decisions.  With respect to the use of race itself, all underrepresented minority students admitted by the Law School have been deemed qualified.  By virtue of our Nations struggle with racial inequality, such students are both likely to have experiences of particular importance to the Law Schools mission, and less likely to be admitted in meaningful numbers on criteria that ignore those experiences.  See App. 120.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Law School does not, however, limit in any way the broad range of qualities and experiences that may be considered valuable contributions to student body diversity.  To the contrary, the 1992 policy makes clear [t]here are many possible bases for diversity admissions, and provides examples of admittees who have lived or traveled widely abroad, are fluent in several languages, have overcome personal adversity and family hardship, have exceptional records of extensive community service, and have had successful careers in other fields.  
				<em>

				, at 118119.  The Law School seriously considers each applicants promise of making a notable contribution to the class by way of a particular strength, attainment, or characteristic
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, an unusual intellectual achievement, employment experience, nonacademic performance, or personal background.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 8384.  All applicants have the opportunity to highlight their own potential diversity contributions through the submission of a personal statement, letters of recommendation, and an essay describing the ways in which the applicant will contribute to the life and diversity of the Law School.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				What is more, the Law School actually gives substantial weight to diversity factors besides race.  The Law School frequently accepts nonminority applicants with grades and test scores lower than underrepresented minority applicants (and other nonminority applicants) who are rejected.  See Brief for Respondents Bollinger et al. 10; App. 121122.  This shows that the Law School seriously weighs many other diversity factors besides race that can make a real and dispositive difference for nonminority applicants as well.  By this flexible approach, the Law School sufficiently takes into account, in practice as well as in theory, a wide variety of characteristics besides race and ethnicity that contribute to a diverse student body.

				Petitioner and the United States argue that the Law Schools plan is not narrowly tailored because race-neutral means exist to obtain the educational benefits of student body diversity that the Law School seeks.  We disagree.  Narrow tailoring does not require exhaustion of every conceivable race-neutral alternative.

				We agree with the Court of Appeals that the Law School sufficiently considered workable race-neutral alternatives.  The District Court took the Law School to task for failing to consider race-neutral alternatives such as using a lottery system or decreasing the emphasis for all applicants on undergraduate GPA and LSAT scores.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 251a.  But these alternatives would require a dramatic sacrifice of diversity, the academic quality of all admitted students, or both.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Law Schools current admissions program considers race as one factor among many, in an effort to assemble a student body that is diverse in ways broader than race.  Because a lottery would make that kind of nuanced judgment impossible, it would effectively sacrifice all other educational values, not to mention every other kind of diversity.  So too with the suggestion that the Law School simply lower admissions standards for all students, a drastic remedy that would require the Law School to become a much different institution and sacrifice a vital component of its educational mission.  The United States advocates percentage plans, recently adopted by public undergraduate institutions in Texas, Florida, and California to guarantee admission to all students above a certain class-rank threshold in every high school in the State.  Brief for United States as 
				<em>
					Amicus Curiae
				</em>
				 1418.  The United States does not, however, explain how such plans could work for graduate and professional schools.  More-over, even assuming such plans are race-neutral, they may preclude the university from conducting the individualized assessments necessary to assemble a student body that is not just racially diverse, but diverse along all the qualities valued by the university.  We are satisfied that the Law School adequately considered race-neutral alternatives currently capable of producing a critical mass without forcing the Law School to abandon the academic selectivity that is the cornerstone of its educational mission.

.  Accordingly, race-conscious admissions policies must be limited in time.  This requirement reflects that racial classifications, however compelling their goals, are potentially so dangerous that they may be employed no more broadly than the interest demands.  Enshrining a permanent justification for racial preferences would offend this fundamental equal protection principle.  We see no reason to exempt race-conscious admissions programs from the requirement that all governmental use of race must have a logical end point.  The Law School, too, concedes that all race-conscious programs must have reasonable durational limits.  Brief for Respondents Bollinger et al. 32.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In the context of higher education, the durational requirement can be met by sunset provisions in race-conscious admissions policies and periodic reviews to determine whether racial preferences are still necessary to achieve student body diversity.  Universities in California, Florida, and Washington State, where racial preferences in admissions are prohibited by state law, are currently engaged in experimenting with a wide variety of alternative approaches.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The hallmark of that policy is its focus on academic ability coupled with a flexible assessment of applicants talents, experiences, and potential to contribute to the learning of those around them.  App. 111.  The policy requires admissions officials to evaluate each applicant based on all the information available in the file, including a personal statement, letters of recommendation, and an essay describing the ways in which the applicant will contribute to the life and diversity of the Law School.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 8384, 114121.  In reviewing an applicants file, admissions officials must consider the applicants undergraduate grade point average (GPA) and Law School Admissions Test (LSAT) score because they are important (if imperfect) predictors of academic success in law school.  
				<em>
					Id.

				, at 112.  The policy stresses that no applicant should be admitted unless we expect that applicant to do well enough to graduate with no serious academic problems.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 111.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The policy makes clear, however, that even the highest possible score does not guarantee admission to the Law School.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 113.  Nor does a low score automatically disqualify an applicant.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  Rather, the policy requires admissions officials to look beyond grades and test scores to other criteria that are important to the Law Schools educational objectives.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 114.  So-called  soft variables such as the enthusiasm of recommenders, the quality of the undergraduate institution, the quality of the applicants essay, and the areas and difficulty of undergraduate course selection are all brought to bear in assessing an applicants likely contributions to the intellectual and social life of the institution.

				<em>

				, at 118, 120.  The policy does, however, reaffirm the Law Schools longstanding commitment to one particular type of diversity, that is, racial and ethnic diversity with special reference to the inclusion of students from groups which have been historically discriminated against, like African-Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans, who without this commitment might not be represented in our student body in meaningful numbers.  
				<em>

				Petitioner Barbara Grutter is a white Michigan resident who applied to the Law School in 1996 with a 3.8 grade point average and 161 LSAT score.  The Law School initially placed petitioner on a waiting list, but subsequently rejected her application.  In December 1997, petitioner filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan against the Law School, the Regents of the University of Michigan, Lee Bollinger (Dean of the Law School from 1987 to 1994, and President of the University of Michigan from 1996 to 2002), Jeffrey Lehman (Dean of the Law School), and Dennis Shields (Director of Admissions at the Law School from 1991 until 1998).  Petitioner alleged that respondents discriminated against her on the basis of race in violation of the

				Petitioner further alleged that her application was rejected because the Law School uses race as a predominant factor, giving applicants who belong to certain minority groups a significantly greater chance of admission than students with similar credentials from disfavored racial groups.  App. 3334.  Petitioner also alleged that respondents had no compelling interest to justify their use of race in the admissions process.

				The District Court granted petitioners motion for class certification and for bifurcation of the trial into liability and damages phases.  The class was defined as  all persons who (A) applied for and were not granted admission to the University of Michigan Law School for the academic years since (and including) 1995 until the time that judgment is entered herein; and (B) were members of those racial or ethnic groups, including Caucasian, that Defendants treated less favorably in considering their applications for admission to the Law School.   App. to Pet. for Cert. 191a192a.

				The District Court heard oral argument on the parties cross-motions for summary judgment on December 22, 2000.  Taking the motions under advisement, the District Court indicated that it would decide as a matter of law whether the Law Schools asserted interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body was compelling.  The District Court also indicated that it would conduct a bench trial on the extent to which race was a factor in the Law Schools admissions decisions, and whether the Law Schools consideration of race in admissions decisions constituted a race-based double standard.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				During the 15-day bench trial, the parties introduced extensive evidence concerning the Law Schools use of race in the admissions process.  Dennis Shields, Director of Admissions when petitioner applied to the Law School, testified that he did not direct his staff to admit a particular percentage or number of minority students, but rather to consider an applicants race along with all other factors.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 206a.  Shields testified that at the height of the admissions season, he would frequently consult the so-called daily reports that kept track of the racial and ethnic composition of the class (along with other information such as residency status and gender).  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 207a.  This was done, Shields testified, to ensure that a critical mass of underrepresented minority students would be reached so as to realize the educational benefits of a diverse student body.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  Shields stressed, however, that he did not seek to admit any particular number or percentage of underrepresented minority students.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Erica Munzel, who succeeded Shields as Director of Admissions, testified that  critical mass  means  meaningful numbers  or  meaningful representation,  which she understood to mean a number that encourages underrepresented minority students to participate in the classroom and not feel isolated.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 208a209a.  Munzel stated there is no number, percentage, or range of numbers or percentages that constitute critical mass.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 209a.  Munzel also asserted that she must consider the race of applicants because a critical mass of underrepresented minority students could not be enrolled if admissions decisions were based primarily on undergraduate GPAs and LSAT scores.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The current Dean of the Law School, Jeffrey Lehman, also testified.  Like the other Law School witnesses, Lehman did not quantify critical mass in terms of numbers or percentages.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 211a.  He indicated that critical mass means numbers such that underrepresented minority students do not feel isolated or like spokespersons for their race.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  When asked about the extent to which race is considered in admissions, Lehman testified that it varies from one applicant to another.  
				<em>
					Ibid

				The District Court heard extensive testimony from Professor Richard Lempert, who chaired the faculty committee that drafted the 1992 policy.  Lempert emphasized that the Law School seeks students with diverse interests and backgrounds to enhance classroom discussion and the educational experience both inside and outside the classroom.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 213a.  When asked about the policys  commitment to racial and ethnic diversity with special reference to the inclusion of students from groups which have been historically discriminated against,   Lempert explained that this language did not purport to remedy past discrimination, but rather to include students who may bring to the Law School a perspective different from that of members of groups which have not been the victims of such discrimination.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  Lempert acknowledged that other groups, such as Asians and Jews, have experienced discrimination, but explained they were not mentioned in the policy because individuals who are members of those groups were already being admitted to the Law School in significant numbers.

				Kent Syverud was the final witness to testify about the Law Schools use of race in admissions decisions.  Syverud was a professor at the Law School when the 1992 admissions policy was adopted and is now Dean of Vanderbilt Law School.  In addition to his testimony at trial, Syverud submitted several expert reports on the educational benefits of diversity.  Syveruds testimony indicated that when a critical mass of underrepresented minority students is present, racial stereotypes lose their force because nonminority students learn there is no  minority viewpoint  but rather a variety of viewpoints among minority students.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In an attempt to quantify the extent to which the Law School actually considers race in making admissions decisions, the parties introduced voluminous evidence at trial.  Relying on data obtained from the Law School, petitioners expert, Dr. Kinley Larntz, generated and analyzed admissions grids for the years in question (19952000).  These grids show the number of applicants and the number of admittees for all combinations of GPAs and LSAT scores.  Dr. Larntz made  cell-by-cell  comparisons between applicants of different races to determine whether a statistically significant relationship existed between race and admission rates.  He concluded that membership in certain minority groups  is an extremely strong factor in the decision for acceptance,  and that applicants from these minority groups  are given an extremely large allowance for admission  as compared to applicants who are members of nonfavored groups.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 218a220a.  Dr. Larntz conceded, however, that race is not the predominant factor in the Law Schools admissions calculus.  12 Tr. 1113 (Feb. 10, 2001).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Dr. Stephen Raudenbush, the Law Schools expert, focused on the predicted effect of eliminating race as a factor in the Law Schools admission process.  In Dr. Raudenbushs view, a race-blind admissions system would have a  very dramatic,  negative effect on underrepresented minority admissions.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 223a.  He testified that in 2000, 35 percent of underrepresented minority applicants were admitted.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  Dr. Raudenbush predicted that if race were not considered, only 10 percent of those applicants would have been admitted.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  Under this scenario, underrepresented minority students would have comprised 4 percent of the entering class in 2000 instead of the actual figure of 14.5 percent.  
				<em>

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In the end, the District Court concluded that the Law Schools use of race as a factor in admissions decisions was unlawful.  Applying strict scrutiny, the District Court  determined that the Law Schools asserted interest in assembling a diverse student body was not compelling because the attainment of a racially diverse class … was not recognized as such by 
				<em>
					Bakke
				</em>
				 and is not a remedy for past discrimination.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 246a.  The District Court went on to hold that even if diversity were compelling, the Law School had not narrowly tailored its use of race to further that interest.  The District Court granted petitioners request for declaratory relief and enjoined the Law School from using race as a factor in its admissions decisions.  The Court of Appeals entered a stay of the injunction pending appeal.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Sitting en banc, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Courts judgment and vacated the injunction.  The Court of Appeals first held that Justice Powells opinion in 
				<em>
					Bakke
				</em>
				 was binding precedent establishing diversity as a compelling state interest.  According to the Court of Appeals, Justice Powells opinion with respect to diversity comprised the controlling rationale for the judgment of this Court under the analysis set forth in

.  The Court of Appeals also held that the Law Schools use of race was narrowly tailored because race was merely a potential plus factor and because the Law Schools program was virtually identical to the Harvard admissions program described approvingly by Justice Powell and appended to his

				Four dissenting judges would have held the Law Schools use of race unconstitutional.  Three of the dissenters, rejecting the majoritys

				 analysis, examined the Law Schools interest in student body diversity on the merits and concluded it was not compelling.  The fourth dissenter, writing separately, found it unnecessary to decide whether diversity was a compelling interest because, like the other dissenters, he believed that the Law Schools use of race was not narrowly tailored to further that interest.

				We last addressed the use of race in public higher education over 25 years ago.  In the landmark 
				<em>

				case, we reviewed a racial set-aside program that reserved 16 out of 100 seats in a medical school class for members of certain minority groups.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/438/265" class="subref" title="subref">438 U. S. 265</a> (1978)
.  The decision produced six separate opinions, none of which commanded a majority of the Court.  Four Justices would have upheld the program against all attack on the ground that the government can use race to remedy disadvantages cast on minorities by past racial prejudice.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 325 (joint opinion of Brennan, White, Marshall, and Blackmun, JJ., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).  Four other Justices avoided the constitutional question altogether and struck down the program on statutory grounds.

				</em>
				 was that a State has a substantial interest that legitimately may be served by a properly devised admissions program involving the competitive consideration of race and ethnic origin.

				Since this Courts splintered decision in 
				<em>

				</em>
				, Justice Powells opinion announcing the judgment of the Court has served as the touchstone for constitutional analysis of race-conscious admissions policies.  Public and private universities across the Nation have modeled their own admissions programs on Justice Powells views on permissible race-conscious policies.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.

				, Brief for Judith Areen et al. as

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Justice Powell began by stating that [t]he guarantee of equal protection cannot mean one thing when applied to one individual and something else when applied to a person of another color.  If both are not accorded the same protection, then it is not equal.  
				<em>
					Bakke

				</em>
				at 289
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				290.  In Justice Powells view, when governmental decisions touch upon an individuals race or ethnic background, he is entitled to a judicial determination that the burden he is asked to bear on that basis is precisely tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 299.  Under this exacting standard, only one of the interests asserted by the university survived Justice Powells scrutiny.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				First, Justice Powell rejected an interest in  reducing the historic deficit of traditionally disfavored minorities in medical schools and in the medical profession  as an unlawful interest in racial balancing.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 306307.  Second, Justice Powell rejected an interest in remedying societal discrimination because such measures would risk placing unnecessary burdens on innocent third parties who bear no responsibility for whatever harm the beneficiaries of the special admissions program are thought to have suffered.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 310.  Third, Justice Powell rejected an interest in increasing the number of physicians who will practice in communities currently underserved, concluding that even if such an interest could be compelling in some circumstances the program under review was not geared to promote that goal.  
				<em>
					Id.

				<em>

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.  
				<em>
					Id.

In seeking the right to select those students who will contribute the most to the robust exchange of ideas,  a university seeks to achieve a goal that is of paramount importance in the fulfillment of its mission.  438 U.

				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 314.  For Justice Powell, [i]t is not an interest in simple ethnic diversity, in which a specified percentage of the student body is in effect guaranteed to be members of selected ethnic groups, that can justify the use of race.  
				<em>

				With these principles in mind, we turn to the question whether the Law Schools use of race is justified by a compelling state interest.  Before this Court, as they have throughout this litigation, respondents assert only one justification for their use of race in the admissions process: obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body.  Brief for Respondents Bollinger et al. i.  In other words, the Law School asks us to recognize, in the context of higher education, a compelling state interest in student body diversity.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				We first wish to dispel the notion that the Law Schools argument has been foreclosed, either expressly or implicitly, by our affirmative-action cases decided since 
				<em>
					Bakke
				</em>

				, at 493 (plurality opinion) (stating that unless classifications based on race are strictly reserved for remedial settings, they may in fact promote notions of racial inferiority and lead to a politics of racial hostility).  But we have never held that the only governmental use of race that can survive strict scrutiny is remedying past discrimination.  Nor, since 
				<em>
					Bakke
				</em>
				, have we directly addressed the use of race in the context of public higher education.  Today, we hold that the Law School has a compelling interest in attaining a diverse student body.

Our scrutiny of the interest asserted by the Law School is no less strict for taking into account complex educational judgments in an area that lies primarily within the expertise of the university.

				The Law School does not premise its need for critical mass on any belief that minority students always (or even consistently) express some characteristic minority viewpoint on any issue. Brief for Respondent Bollinger et al. 30.  To the contrary, diminishing the force of such stereotypes is both a crucial part of the Law Schools mission, and one that it cannot accomplish with only token numbers of minority students.  Just as growing up in a particular region or having particular professional experiences is likely to affect an individuals views, so too is ones own, unique experience of being a racial minority in a society, like our own, in which race unfortunately still matters.  The Law School has determined, based on its experience and expertise, that a critical mass of underrepresented minorities is necessary to further its compelling interest in securing the educational benefits of a diverse student body.

				We find that the Law Schools admissions program bears the hallmarks of a narrowly tailored plan.  As Justice Powell made clear in Bakke

				Justice Powells distinction between the medical schools rigid 16-seat quota and Harvards flexible use of race as a plus factor is instructive.  Harvard certainly had minimum 
				<em>
					goals

				 for minority enrollment, even if it had no specific number firmly in mind.  See

				, at 323 (opinion of Powell, J.) (10 or 20 black students could not begin to bring to their classmates and to each other the variety of points of view, backgrounds and experiences of blacks in the United States).  What is more, Justice Powell flatly rejected the argument that Harvards program was the functional equivalent of a quota merely because it had some  plus  for race, or gave greater weight to race than to some other factors, in order to achieve student body diversity.  438 U. S., at 317318.

				The Law Schools goal of attaining a critical mass of underrepresented minority students does not transform its program into a quota.  As the Harvard plan described by Justice Powell recognized, there is of course some relationship between numbers and achieving the benefits to be derived from a diverse student body, and between numbers and providing a reasonable environment for those students admitted.

See

				That a race-conscious admissions program does not operate as a quota does not, by itself, satisfy the requirement of individualized consideration.  When using race as a plus factor in university admissions, a universitys admissions program must remain flexible enough to ensure that each applicant is evaluated as an individual and not in a way that makes an applicants race or ethnicity the defining feature of his or her application.  The importance of this individualized consideration in the context of a race-conscious admissions program is paramount.  See 
				<em>
					Bakke
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 318, n. 52 (opinion of Powell, J.) (identifying the denial … of th[e] right to individualized consideration as the principal evil of the medical schools admissions program).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Here, the Law School engages in a highly individualized, holistic review of each applicants file, giving serious consideration to all the ways an applicant might contribute to a diverse educational environment.  The Law School affords this individualized consideration to applicants of all races.  There is no policy, either 
				<em>
					de jure
				</em>
				 or 
				<em>
					de facto
				</em>
				, of automatic acceptance or rejection based on any single soft variable.  Unlike the program at issue in 
				<em>
					Gratz
				</em>
				 v.
				<em>
					 Bollinger
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, the Law School awards no mechanical, predetermined diversity bonuses based on race or ethnicity.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 23 (distinguishing a race-conscious admissions program that automatically awards 20 points based on race from the Harvard plan, which considered race but did not contemplate that any single characteristic automatically ensured a specific and identifiable contribution to a universitys diversity).  Like the Harvard plan, the Law Schools admissions policy is flexible enough to consider all pertinent elements of diversity in light of the particular qualifications of each applicant, and to place them on the same footing for consideration, although not necessarily according them the same weight.  
				<em>
					Bakke,
				</em>
            <em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 317 (opinion of Powell, J.).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We also find that, like the Harvard plan Justice Powell referenced in 
				<em>
					Bakke
				</em>
				, the Law Schools race-conscious admissions program adequately ensures that all factors that may contribute to student body diversity are meaningfully considered alongside race in admissions decisions.  With respect to the use of race itself, all underrepresented minority students admitted by the Law School have been deemed qualified.  By virtue of our Nations struggle with racial inequality, such students are both likely to have experiences of particular importance to the Law Schools mission, and less likely to be admitted in meaningful numbers on criteria that ignore those experiences.  See App. 120.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Law School does not, however, limit in any way the broad range of qualities and experiences that may be considered valuable contributions to student body diversity.  To the contrary, the 1992 policy makes clear [t]here are many possible bases for diversity admissions, and provides examples of admittees who have lived or traveled widely abroad, are fluent in several languages, have overcome personal adversity and family hardship, have exceptional records of extensive community service, and have had successful careers in other fields.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 118119.  The Law School seriously considers each applicants promise of making a notable contribution to the class by way of a particular strength, attainment, or characteristic
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, an unusual intellectual achievement, employment experience, nonacademic performance, or personal background.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 8384.  All applicants have the opportunity to highlight their own potential diversity contributions through the submission of a personal statement, letters of recommendation, and an essay describing the ways in which the applicant will contribute to the life and diversity of the Law School.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				What is more, the Law School actually gives substantial weight to diversity factors besides race.  The Law School frequently accepts nonminority applicants with grades and test scores lower than underrepresented minority applicants (and other nonminority applicants) who are rejected.  See Brief for Respondents Bollinger et al. 10; App. 121122.  This shows that the Law School seriously weighs many other diversity factors besides race that can make a real and dispositive difference for nonminority applicants as well.  By this flexible approach, the Law School sufficiently takes into account, in practice as well as in theory, a wide variety of characteristics besides race and ethnicity that contribute to a diverse student body.

				Petitioner and the United States argue that the Law Schools plan is not narrowly tailored because race-neutral means exist to obtain the educational benefits of student body diversity that the Law School seeks.  We disagree.  Narrow tailoring does not require exhaustion of every conceivable race-neutral alternative.  Nor does it require a university to choose between maintaining a reputation for excellence or fulfilling a commitment to provide educational opportunities to members of all racial groups.  See

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We agree with the Court of Appeals that the Law School sufficiently considered workable race-neutral alternatives.  The District Court took the Law School to task for failing to consider race-neutral alternatives such as using a lottery system or decreasing the emphasis for all applicants on undergraduate GPA and LSAT scores.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 251a.  But these alternatives would require a dramatic sacrifice of diversity, the academic quality of all admitted students, or both.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Law Schools current admissions program considers race as one factor among many, in an effort to assemble a student body that is diverse in ways broader than race.  Because a lottery would make that kind of nuanced judgment impossible, it would effectively sacrifice all other educational values, not to mention every other kind of diversity.  So too with the suggestion that the Law School simply lower admissions standards for all students, a drastic remedy that would require the Law School to become a much different institution and sacrifice a vital component of its educational mission.  The United States advocates percentage plans, recently adopted by public undergraduate institutions in Texas, Florida, and California to guarantee admission to all students above a certain class-rank threshold in every high school in the State.  Brief for United States as 
				<em>
					Amicus Curiae
				</em>
				 1418.  The United States does not, however, explain how such plans could work for graduate and professional schools.  More-over, even assuming such plans are race-neutral, they may preclude the university from conducting the individualized assessments necessary to assemble a student body that is not just racially diverse, but diverse along all the qualities valued by the university.  We are satisfied that the Law School adequately considered race-neutral alternatives currently capable of producing a critical mass without forcing the Law School to abandon the academic selectivity that is the cornerstone of its educational mission.

				We are satisfied that the Law Schools admissions program does not.

				We are mindful, however, that [a] core purpose of the

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">432</a> (1984)
.  Accordingly, race-conscious admissions policies must be limited in time.  This requirement reflects that racial classifications, however compelling their goals, are potentially so dangerous that they may be employed no more broadly than the interest demands.  Enshrining a permanent justification for racial preferences would offend this fundamental equal protection principle.  We see no reason to exempt race-conscious admissions programs from the requirement that all governmental use of race must have a logical end point.  The Law School, too, concedes that all race-conscious programs must have reasonable durational limits.  Brief for Respondents Bollinger et al. 32.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In the context of higher education, the durational requirement can be met by sunset provisions in race-conscious admissions policies and periodic reviews to determine whether racial preferences are still necessary to achieve student body diversity.  Universities in California, Florida, and Washington State, where racial preferences in admissions are prohibited by state law, are currently engaged in experimenting with a wide variety of alternative approaches.  Universities in other States can and should draw on the most promising aspects of these race-neutral alternatives as they develop.  Cf.

Seeking to admit a group of students who individually and collectively are among the most capable, the Law School looks for individuals with substantial promise for success in law school and a strong likelihood of succeeding in the practice of law and contributing in diverse ways to the well-being of others.  App. 110.

				Petitioner Barbara Grutter is a white Michigan resident who applied to the Law School in 1996 with a 3.8 grade point average and 161 LSAT score.  The Law School initially placed petitioner on a waiting list, but subsequently rejected her application.  In December 1997, petitioner filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan against the Law School, the Regents of the University of Michigan, Lee Bollinger (Dean of the Law School from 1987 to 1994, and President of the University of Michigan from 1996 to 2002), Jeffrey Lehman (Dean of the Law School), and Dennis Shields (Director of Admissions at the Law School from 1991 until 1998).  Petitioner alleged that respondents discriminated against her on the basis of race in violation of the

				Petitioner further alleged that her application was rejected because the Law School uses race as a predominant factor, giving applicants who belong to certain minority groups a significantly greater chance of admission than students with similar credentials from disfavored racial groups.  App. 3334.  Petitioner also alleged that respondents had no compelling interest to justify their use of race in the admissions process.

				The District Court heard oral argument on the parties cross-motions for summary judgment on December 22, 2000.  Taking the motions under advisement, the District Court indicated that it would decide as a matter of law whether the Law Schools asserted interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body was compelling.  The District Court also indicated that it would conduct a bench trial on the extent to which race was a factor in the Law Schools admissions decisions, and whether the Law Schools consideration of race in admissions decisions constituted a race-based double standard.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				During the 15-day bench trial, the parties introduced extensive evidence concerning the Law Schools use of race in the admissions process.  Dennis Shields, Director of Admissions when petitioner applied to the Law School, testified that he did not direct his staff to admit a particular percentage or number of minority students, but rather to consider an applicants race along with all other factors.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 206a.  Shields testified that at the height of the admissions season, he would frequently consult the so-called daily reports that kept track of the racial and ethnic composition of the class (along with other information such as residency status and gender).  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 207a.  This was done, Shields testified, to ensure that a critical mass of underrepresented minority students would be reached so as to realize the educational benefits of a diverse student body.  
				<em>
					Ibid

				.  Shields stressed, however, that he did not seek to admit any particular number or percentage of underrepresented minority students.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Erica Munzel, who succeeded Shields as Director of Admissions, testified that  critical mass  means  meaningful numbers  or  meaningful representation,  which she understood to mean a number that encourages underrepresented minority students to participate in the classroom and not feel isolated.  
				<em>
					Id.

				, at 208a209a.  Munzel stated there is no number, percentage, or range of numbers or percentages that constitute critical mass.  
				<em>
					Id.

				<em>
					Id.

				, at 211a.  He indicated that critical mass means numbers such that underrepresented minority students do not feel isolated or like spokespersons for their race.

				The District Court heard extensive testimony from Professor Richard Lempert, who chaired the faculty committee that drafted the 1992 policy.  Lempert emphasized that the Law School seeks students with diverse interests and backgrounds to enhance classroom discussion and the educational experience both inside and outside the classroom.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 213a.  When asked about the policys  commitment to racial and ethnic diversity with special reference to the inclusion of students from groups which have been historically discriminated against,   Lempert explained that this language did not purport to remedy past discrimination, but rather to include students who may bring to the Law School a perspective different from that of members of groups which have not been the victims of such discrimination.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  Lempert acknowledged that other groups, such as Asians and Jews, have experienced discrimination, but explained they were not mentioned in the policy because individuals who are members of those groups were already being admitted to the Law School in significant numbers.

				Kent Syverud was the final witness to testify about the Law Schools use of race in admissions decisions.  Syverud was a professor at the Law School when the 1992 admissions policy was adopted and is now Dean of Vanderbilt Law School.  In addition to his testimony at trial, Syverud submitted several expert reports on the educational benefits of diversity.  Syveruds testimony indicated that when a critical mass of underrepresented minority students is present, racial stereotypes lose their force because nonminority students learn there is no  minority viewpoint  but rather a variety of viewpoints among minority students.

				In an attempt to quantify the extent to which the Law School actually considers race in making admissions decisions, the parties introduced voluminous evidence at trial.  Relying on data obtained from the Law School, petitioners expert, Dr. Kinley Larntz, generated and analyzed admissions grids for the years in question (19952000).  These grids show the number of applicants and the number of admittees for all combinations of GPAs and LSAT scores.  Dr. Larntz made  cell-by-cell  comparisons between applicants of different races to determine whether a statistically significant relationship existed between race and admission rates.  He concluded that membership in certain minority groups  is an extremely strong factor in the decision for acceptance,  and that applicants from these minority groups  are given an extremely large allowance for admission  as compared to applicants who are members of nonfavored groups.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 218a220a.  Dr. Larntz conceded, however, that race is not the predominant factor in the Law Schools admissions calculus.  12 Tr. 1113 (Feb. 10, 2001).

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Dr. Stephen Raudenbush, the Law Schools expert, focused on the predicted effect of eliminating race as a factor in the Law Schools admission process.  In Dr. Raudenbushs view, a race-blind admissions system would have a  very dramatic,  negative effect on underrepresented minority admissions.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 223a.  He testified that in 2000, 35 percent of underrepresented minority applicants were admitted.  
				<em>

				</em>
				.  Dr. Raudenbush predicted that if race were not considered, only 10 percent of those applicants would have been admitted.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In the end, the District Court concluded that the Law Schools use of race as a factor in admissions decisions was unlawful.  Applying strict scrutiny, the District Court  determined that the Law Schools asserted interest in assembling a diverse student body was not compelling because the attainment of a racially diverse class … was not recognized as such by 
				<em>
					Bakke
				</em>
				 and is not a remedy for past discrimination.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 246a.  The District Court went on to hold that even if diversity were compelling, the Law School had not narrowly tailored its use of race to further that interest.  The District Court granted petitioners request for declaratory relief and enjoined the Law School from using race as a factor in its admissions decisions.  The Court of Appeals entered a stay of the injunction pending appeal.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Sitting en banc, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Courts judgment and vacated the injunction.  The Court of Appeals first held that Justice Powells opinion in 
				<em>
					Bakke
				</em>
				 was binding precedent establishing diversity as a compelling state interest.  According to the Court of Appeals, Justice Powells opinion with respect to diversity comprised the controlling rationale for the judgment of this Court under the analysis set forth in

.  The Court of Appeals also held that the Law Schools use of race was narrowly tailored because race was merely a potential plus factor and because the Law Schools program was virtually identical to the Harvard admissions program described approvingly by Justice Powell and appended to his

The fourth dissenter, writing separately, found it unnecessary to decide whether diversity was a compelling interest because, like the other dissenters, he believed that the Law Schools use of race was not narrowly tailored to further that interest.

				We last addressed the use of race in public higher education over 25 years ago.  In the landmark

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/438/265" class="subref" title="subref">438 U. S. 265</a> (1978)

				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 325 (joint opinion of Brennan, White, Marshall, and Blackmun, JJ., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).  Four other Justices avoided the constitutional question altogether and struck down the program on statutory grounds.

				</em>
				 was that a State has a substantial interest that legitimately may be served by a properly devised admissions program involving the competitive consideration of race and ethnic origin.

				Since this Courts splintered decision in 
				<em>

				</em>
				, Justice Powells opinion announcing the judgment of the Court has served as the touchstone for constitutional analysis of race-conscious admissions policies.  Public and private universities across the Nation have modeled their own admissions programs on Justice Powells views on permissible race-conscious policies.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.

				, Brief for Judith Areen et al. as

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Justice Powell began by stating that [t]he guarantee of equal protection cannot mean one thing when applied to one individual and something else when applied to a person of another color.  If both are not accorded the same protection, then it is not equal.  
				<em>
					Bakke
				</em>
				, 438 U. S.,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				at 289
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				290.  In Justice Powells view, when governmental decisions touch upon an individuals race or ethnic background, he is entitled to a judicial determination that the burden he is asked to bear on that basis is precisely tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 299.  Under this exacting standard, only one of the interests asserted by the university survived Justice Powells scrutiny.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				First, Justice Powell rejected an interest in  reducing the historic deficit of traditionally disfavored minorities in medical schools and in the medical profession  as an unlawful interest in racial balancing.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 306307.  Second, Justice Powell rejected an interest in remedying societal discrimination because such measures would risk placing unnecessary burdens on innocent third parties who bear no responsibility for whatever harm the beneficiaries of the special admissions program are thought to have suffered.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 310.  Third, Justice Powell rejected an interest in increasing the number of physicians who will practice in communities currently underserved, concluding that even if such an interest could be compelling in some circumstances the program under review was not geared to promote that goal.  
				<em>
					Id.

				<em>
					Id.

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.  
				<em>
					Id.

In seeking the right to select those students who will contribute the most to the robust exchange of ideas,  a university seeks to achieve a goal that is of paramount importance in the fulfillment of its mission.  438 U.

				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 314.  For Justice Powell, [i]t is not an interest in simple ethnic diversity, in which a specified percentage of the student body is in effect guaranteed to be members of selected ethnic groups, that can justify the use of race.  
				<em>

				 In the wake of our fractured decision in Bakke

In that case, we explained that [w]hen a fragmented Court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five Justices, the holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.  430 U.

				With these principles in mind, we turn to the question whether the Law Schools use of race is justified by a compelling state interest.  Before this Court, as they have throughout this litigation, respondents assert only one justification for their use of race in the admissions process: obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body.  Brief for Respondents Bollinger et al. i.  In other words, the Law School asks us to recognize, in the context of higher education, a compelling state interest in student body diversity.

				We first wish to dispel the notion that the Law Schools argument has been foreclosed, either expressly or implicitly, by our affirmative-action cases decided since 
				<em>

				, at 493 (plurality opinion) (stating that unless classifications based on race are strictly reserved for remedial settings, they may in fact promote notions of racial inferiority and lead to a politics of racial hostility).  But we have never held that the only governmental use of race that can survive strict scrutiny is remedying past discrimination.  Nor, since 
				<em>
					Bakke

				The Law School does not premise its need for critical mass on any belief that minority students always (or even consistently) express some characteristic minority viewpoint on any issue. Brief for Respondent Bollinger et al. 30.  To the contrary, diminishing the force of such stereotypes is both a crucial part of the Law Schools mission, and one that it cannot accomplish with only token numbers of minority students.  Just as growing up in a particular region or having particular professional experiences is likely to affect an individuals views, so too is ones own, unique experience of being a racial minority in a society, like our own, in which race unfortunately still matters.  The Law School has determined, based on its experience and expertise, that a critical mass of underrepresented minorities is necessary to further its compelling interest in securing the educational benefits of a diverse student body.

				We find that the Law Schools admissions program bears the hallmarks of a narrowly tailored plan.  As Justice Powell made clear in Bakke

				That a race-conscious admissions program does not operate as a quota does not, by itself, satisfy the requirement of individualized consideration.  When using race as a plus factor in university admissions, a universitys admissions program must remain flexible enough to ensure that each applicant is evaluated as an individual and not in a way that makes an applicants race or ethnicity the defining feature of his or her application.  The importance of this individualized consideration in the context of a race-conscious admissions program is paramount.  See

				Here, the Law School engages in a highly individualized, holistic review of each applicants file, giving serious consideration to all the ways an applicant might contribute to a diverse educational environment.  The Law School affords this individualized consideration to applicants of all races.  There is no policy, either 
				<em>
					de jure
				</em>
				 or 
				<em>
					de facto
				</em>
				, of automatic acceptance or rejection based on any single soft variable.  Unlike the program at issue in 
				<em>
					Gratz
				</em>
				 v.
				<em>
					 Bollinger
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, the Law School awards no mechanical, predetermined diversity bonuses based on race or ethnicity.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 23 (distinguishing a race-conscious admissions program that automatically awards 20 points based on race from the Harvard plan, which considered race but did not contemplate that any single characteristic automatically ensured a specific and identifiable contribution to a universitys diversity).  Like the Harvard plan, the Law Schools admissions policy is flexible enough to consider all pertinent elements of diversity in light of the particular qualifications of each applicant, and to place them on the same footing for consideration, although not necessarily according them the same weight.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We also find that, like the Harvard plan Justice Powell referenced in 
				<em>
					Bakke
				</em>
				, the Law Schools race-conscious admissions program adequately ensures that all factors that may contribute to student body diversity are meaningfully considered alongside race in admissions decisions.  With respect to the use of race itself, all underrepresented minority students admitted by the Law School have been deemed qualified.  By virtue of our Nations struggle with racial inequality, such students are both likely to have experiences of particular importance to the Law Schools mission, and less likely to be admitted in meaningful numbers on criteria that ignore those experiences.  See App. 120.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Law School does not, however, limit in any way the broad range of qualities and experiences that may be considered valuable contributions to student body diversity.  To the contrary, the 1992 policy makes clear [t]here are many possible bases for diversity admissions, and provides examples of admittees who have lived or traveled widely abroad, are fluent in several languages, have overcome personal adversity and family hardship, have exceptional records of extensive community service, and have had successful careers in other fields.  
				<em>

				, at 118119.  The Law School seriously considers each applicants promise of making a notable contribution to the class by way of a particular strength, attainment, or characteristic
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, an unusual intellectual achievement, employment experience, nonacademic performance, or personal background.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 8384.  All applicants have the opportunity to highlight their own potential diversity contributions through the submission of a personal statement, letters of recommendation, and an essay describing the ways in which the applicant will contribute to the life and diversity of the Law School.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				What is more, the Law School actually gives substantial weight to diversity factors besides race.  The Law School frequently accepts nonminority applicants with grades and test scores lower than underrepresented minority applicants (and other nonminority applicants) who are rejected.  See Brief for Respondents Bollinger et al. 10; App. 121122.  This shows that the Law School seriously weighs many other diversity factors besides race that can make a real and dispositive difference for nonminority applicants as well.  By this flexible approach, the Law School sufficiently takes into account, in practice as well as in theory, a wide variety of characteristics besides race and ethnicity that contribute to a diverse student body.

				Petitioner and the United States argue that the Law Schools plan is not narrowly tailored because race-neutral means exist to obtain the educational benefits of student body diversity that the Law School seeks.  We disagree.  Narrow tailoring does not require exhaustion of every conceivable race-neutral alternative.  Nor does it require a university to choose between maintaining a reputation for excellence or fulfilling a commitment to provide educational opportunities to members of all racial groups.  See

				We agree with the Court of Appeals that the Law School sufficiently considered workable race-neutral alternatives.  The District Court took the Law School to task for failing to consider race-neutral alternatives such as using a lottery system or decreasing the emphasis for all applicants on undergraduate GPA and LSAT scores.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 251a.  But these alternatives would require a dramatic sacrifice of diversity, the academic quality of all admitted students, or both.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Law Schools current admissions program considers race as one factor among many, in an effort to assemble a student body that is diverse in ways broader than race.  Because a lottery would make that kind of nuanced judgment impossible, it would effectively sacrifice all other educational values, not to mention every other kind of diversity.  So too with the suggestion that the Law School simply lower admissions standards for all students, a drastic remedy that would require the Law School to become a much different institution and sacrifice a vital component of its educational mission.  The United States advocates percentage plans, recently adopted by public undergraduate institutions in Texas, Florida, and California to guarantee admission to all students above a certain class-rank threshold in every high school in the State.  Brief for United States as 
				<em>
					Amicus Curiae
				</em>
				 1418.  The United States does not, however, explain how such plans could work for graduate and professional schools.  More-over, even assuming such plans are race-neutral, they may preclude the university from conducting the individualized assessments necessary to assemble a student body that is not just racially diverse, but diverse along all the qualities valued by the university.  We are satisfied that the Law School adequately considered race-neutral alternatives currently capable of producing a critical mass without forcing the Law School to abandon the academic selectivity that is the cornerstone of its educational mission.

.  Accordingly, race-conscious admissions policies must be limited in time.  This requirement reflects that racial classifications, however compelling their goals, are potentially so dangerous that they may be employed no more broadly than the interest demands.  Enshrining a permanent justification for racial preferences would offend this fundamental equal protection principle.  We see no reason to exempt race-conscious admissions programs from the requirement that all governmental use of race must have a logical end point.  The Law School, too, concedes that all race-conscious programs must have reasonable durational limits.  Brief for Respondents Bollinger et al. 32.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In the context of higher education, the durational requirement can be met by sunset provisions in race-conscious admissions policies and periodic reviews to determine whether racial preferences are still necessary to achieve student body diversity.  Universities in California, Florida, and Washington State, where racial preferences in admissions are prohibited by state law, are currently engaged in experimenting with a wide variety of alternative approaches.  Universities in other States can and should draw on the most promising aspects of these race-neutral alternatives as they develop.  Cf.

				The District Court heard oral argument on the parties cross-motions for summary judgment on December 22, 2000.  Taking the motions under advisement, the District Court indicated that it would decide as a matter of law whether the Law Schools asserted interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body was compelling.  The District Court also indicated that it would conduct a bench trial on the extent to which race was a factor in the Law Schools admissions decisions, and whether the Law Schools consideration of race in admissions decisions constituted a race-based double standard.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				During the 15-day bench trial, the parties introduced extensive evidence concerning the Law Schools use of race in the admissions process.  Dennis Shields, Director of Admissions when petitioner applied to the Law School, testified that he did not direct his staff to admit a particular percentage or number of minority students, but rather to consider an applicants race along with all other factors.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 206a.  Shields testified that at the height of the admissions season, he would frequently consult the so-called daily reports that kept track of the racial and ethnic composition of the class (along with other information such as residency status and gender).  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 207a.  This was done, Shields testified, to ensure that a critical mass of underrepresented minority students would be reached so as to realize the educational benefits of a diverse student body.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  Shields stressed, however, that he did not seek to admit any particular number or percentage of underrepresented minority students.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Erica Munzel, who succeeded Shields as Director of Admissions, testified that  critical mass  means  meaningful numbers  or  meaningful representation,  which she understood to mean a number that encourages underrepresented minority students to participate in the classroom and not feel isolated.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 208a209a.  Munzel stated there is no number, percentage, or range of numbers or percentages that constitute critical mass.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 209a.  Munzel also asserted that she must consider the race of applicants because a critical mass of underrepresented minority students could not be enrolled if admissions decisions were based primarily on undergraduate GPAs and LSAT scores.  
				<em>

				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The current Dean of the Law School, Jeffrey Lehman, also testified.  Like the other Law School witnesses, Lehman did not quantify critical mass in terms of numbers or percentages.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 211a.  He indicated that critical mass means numbers such that underrepresented minority students do not feel isolated or like spokespersons for their race.  
				<em>

				.  When asked about the extent to which race is considered in admissions, Lehman testified that it varies from one applicant to another.  
				<em>

				The District Court heard extensive testimony from Professor Richard Lempert, who chaired the faculty committee that drafted the 1992 policy.  Lempert emphasized that the Law School seeks students with diverse interests and backgrounds to enhance classroom discussion and the educational experience both inside and outside the classroom.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 213a.  When asked about the policys  commitment to racial and ethnic diversity with special reference to the inclusion of students from groups which have been historically discriminated against,   Lempert explained that this language did not purport to remedy past discrimination, but rather to include students who may bring to the Law School a perspective different from that of members of groups which have not been the victims of such discrimination.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  Lempert acknowledged that other groups, such as Asians and Jews, have experienced discrimination, but explained they were not mentioned in the policy because individuals who are members of those groups were already being admitted to the Law School in significant numbers.

				Kent Syverud was the final witness to testify about the Law Schools use of race in admissions decisions.  Syverud was a professor at the Law School when the 1992 admissions policy was adopted and is now Dean of Vanderbilt Law School.  In addition to his testimony at trial, Syverud submitted several expert reports on the educational benefits of diversity.  Syveruds testimony indicated that when a critical mass of underrepresented minority students is present, racial stereotypes lose their force because nonminority students learn there is no  minority viewpoint  but rather a variety of viewpoints among minority students.

				In an attempt to quantify the extent to which the Law School actually considers race in making admissions decisions, the parties introduced voluminous evidence at trial.  Relying on data obtained from the Law School, petitioners expert, Dr. Kinley Larntz, generated and analyzed admissions grids for the years in question (19952000).  These grids show the number of applicants and the number of admittees for all combinations of GPAs and LSAT scores.  Dr. Larntz made  cell-by-cell  comparisons between applicants of different races to determine whether a statistically significant relationship existed between race and admission rates.  He concluded that membership in certain minority groups  is an extremely strong factor in the decision for acceptance,  and that applicants from these minority groups  are given an extremely large allowance for admission  as compared to applicants who are members of nonfavored groups.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 218a220a.  Dr. Larntz conceded, however, that race is not the predominant factor in the Law Schools admissions calculus.  12 Tr. 1113 (Feb. 10, 2001).

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Dr. Stephen Raudenbush, the Law Schools expert, focused on the predicted effect of eliminating race as a factor in the Law Schools admission process.  In Dr. Raudenbushs view, a race-blind admissions system would have a  very dramatic,  negative effect on underrepresented minority admissions.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 223a.  He testified that in 2000, 35 percent of underrepresented minority applicants were admitted.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  Dr. Raudenbush predicted that if race were not considered, only 10 percent of those applicants would have been admitted.  
				<em>

				In the end, the District Court concluded that the Law Schools use of race as a factor in admissions decisions was unlawful.  Applying strict scrutiny, the District Court  determined that the Law Schools asserted interest in assembling a diverse student body was not compelling because the attainment of a racially diverse class … was not recognized as such by 
				<em>
					Bakke
				</em>
				 and is not a remedy for past discrimination.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 246a.  The District Court went on to hold that even if diversity were compelling, the Law School had not narrowly tailored its use of race to further that interest.  The District Court granted petitioners request for declaratory relief and enjoined the Law School from using race as a factor in its admissions decisions.  The Court of Appeals entered a stay of the injunction pending appeal.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Sitting en banc, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Courts judgment and vacated the injunction.  The Court of Appeals first held that Justice Powells opinion in 
				<em>
					Bakke
				</em>
				 was binding precedent establishing diversity as a compelling state interest.  According to the Court of Appeals, Justice Powells opinion with respect to diversity comprised the controlling rationale for the judgment of this Court under the analysis set forth in

.  The Court of Appeals also held that the Law Schools use of race was narrowly tailored because race was merely a potential plus factor and because the Law Schools program was virtually identical to the Harvard admissions program described approvingly by Justice Powell and appended to his

The fourth dissenter, writing separately, found it unnecessary to decide whether diversity was a compelling interest because, like the other dissenters, he believed that the Law Schools use of race was not narrowly tailored to further that interest.

				We last addressed the use of race in public higher education over 25 years ago.  In the landmark 
				<em>
					Bakke

				case, we reviewed a racial set-aside program that reserved 16 out of 100 seats in a medical school class for members of certain minority groups.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/438/265" class="subref" title="subref">438 U. S. 265</a> (1978)
.  The decision produced six separate opinions, none of which commanded a majority of the Court.  Four Justices would have upheld the program against all attack on the ground that the government can use race to remedy disadvantages cast on minorities by past racial prejudice.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 325 (joint opinion of Brennan, White, Marshall, and Blackmun, JJ., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).  Four other Justices avoided the constitutional question altogether and struck down the program on statutory grounds.

				</em>
				 was that a State has a substantial interest that legitimately may be served by a properly devised admissions program involving the competitive consideration of race and ethnic origin.

				Since this Courts splintered decision in 
				<em>
					Bakke
				</em>
				, Justice Powells opinion announcing the judgment of the Court has served as the touchstone for constitutional analysis of race-conscious admissions policies.  Public and private universities across the Nation have modeled their own admissions programs on Justice Powells views on permissible race-conscious policies.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, Brief for Judith Areen et al. as

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Justice Powell began by stating that [t]he guarantee of equal protection cannot mean one thing when applied to one individual and something else when applied to a person of another color.  If both are not accorded the same protection, then it is not equal.  
				<em>
					Bakke
				</em>
				, 438 U. S.,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				at 289
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				290.  In Justice Powells view, when governmental decisions touch upon an individuals race or ethnic background, he is entitled to a judicial determination that the burden he is asked to bear on that basis is precisely tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 299.  Under this exacting standard, only one of the interests asserted by the university survived Justice Powells scrutiny.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				First, Justice Powell rejected an interest in  reducing the historic deficit of traditionally disfavored minorities in medical schools and in the medical profession  as an unlawful interest in racial balancing.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 306307.  Second, Justice Powell rejected an interest in remedying societal discrimination because such measures would risk placing unnecessary burdens on innocent third parties who bear no responsibility for whatever harm the beneficiaries of the special admissions program are thought to have suffered.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 310.  Third, Justice Powell rejected an interest in increasing the number of physicians who will practice in communities currently underserved, concluding that even if such an interest could be compelling in some circumstances the program under review was not geared to promote that goal.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 306, 310.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Justice Powell
				<span class="smallcaps">
					 
				</span>
				approved the universitys use of race to further only one interest: the attainment of a diverse student body.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 311.  With the important proviso that constitutional limitations protecting individual rights may not be disregarded, Justice Powell grounded his analysis in the academic freedom that long has been viewed as a special concern of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 312, 314.  Justice Powell emphasized that nothing less than the  nations future depends upon leaders trained through wide exposure to the ideas and mores of students as diverse as this Nation of many peoples.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">603</a> (1967)
).  In seeking the right to select those students who will contribute the most to the robust exchange of ideas,  a university seeks to achieve a goal that is of paramount importance in the fulfillment of its mission.  438 U.

				<em>

			</p>

				Justice Powell was, however, careful to emphasize that in his view race is only one element in a range of factors a university properly may consider in attaining the goal of a heterogeneous student body.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 314.  For Justice Powell, [i]t is not an interest in simple ethnic diversity, in which a specified percentage of the student body is in effect guaranteed to be members of selected ethnic groups, that can justify the use of race.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 315.  Rather, [t]he diversity that furthers a compelling state interest encompasses a far broader array of qualifications and characteristics of which racial or ethnic origin is but a single though important element.  Ibid.

				 In the wake of our fractured decision in Bakke
				, courts have struggled to discern whether Justice Powells diversity rationale, set forth in part of the opinion joined by no other Justice, is nonetheless binding precedent under 
				<em>
					Marks

				.  In that case, we explained that [w]hen a fragmented Court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five Justices, the holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.  430 U.

				With these principles in mind, we turn to the question whether the Law Schools use of race is justified by a compelling state interest.  Before this Court, as they have throughout this litigation, respondents assert only one justification for their use of race in the admissions process: obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body.  Brief for Respondents Bollinger et al. i.  In other words, the Law School asks us to recognize, in the context of higher education, a compelling state interest in student body diversity.

				We first wish to dispel the notion that the Law Schools argument has been foreclosed, either expressly or implicitly, by our affirmative-action cases decided since

But we have never held that the only governmental use of race that can survive strict scrutiny is remedying past discrimination.  Nor, since 
				<em>

				The Law School does not premise its need for critical mass on any belief that minority students always (or even consistently) express some characteristic minority viewpoint on any issue. Brief for Respondent Bollinger et al. 30.  To the contrary, diminishing the force of such stereotypes is both a crucial part of the Law Schools mission, and one that it cannot accomplish with only token numbers of minority students.  Just as growing up in a particular region or having particular professional experiences is likely to affect an individuals views, so too is ones own, unique experience of being a racial minority in a society, like our own, in which race unfortunately still matters.  The Law School has determined, based on its experience and expertise, that a critical mass of underrepresented minorities is necessary to further its compelling interest in securing the educational benefits of a diverse student body.

				We find that the Law Schools admissions program bears the hallmarks of a narrowly tailored plan.  As Justice Powell made clear in Bakke

				The Law Schools goal of attaining a critical mass of underrepresented minority students does not transform its program into a quota.

				That a race-conscious admissions program does not operate as a quota does not, by itself, satisfy the requirement of individualized consideration.  When using race as a plus factor in university admissions, a universitys admissions program must remain flexible enough to ensure that each applicant is evaluated as an individual and not in a way that makes an applicants race or ethnicity the defining feature of his or her application.

				Here, the Law School engages in a highly individualized, holistic review of each applicants file, giving serious consideration to all the ways an applicant might contribute to a diverse educational environment.  The Law School affords this individualized consideration to applicants of all races.  There is no policy, either 
				<em>
					de jure
				</em>
				 or 
				<em>
					de facto
				</em>
				, of automatic acceptance or rejection based on any single soft variable.  Unlike the program at issue in 
				<em>
					Gratz
				</em>
				 v.
				<em>
					 Bollinger
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, the Law School awards no mechanical, predetermined diversity bonuses based on race or ethnicity.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 23 (distinguishing a race-conscious admissions program that automatically awards 20 points based on race from the Harvard plan, which considered race but did not contemplate that any single characteristic automatically ensured a specific and identifiable contribution to a universitys diversity).  Like the Harvard plan, the Law Schools admissions policy is flexible enough to consider all pertinent elements of diversity in light of the particular qualifications of each applicant, and to place them on the same footing for consideration, although not necessarily according them the same weight.

				We also find that, like the Harvard plan Justice Powell referenced in 
				<em>
					Bakke
				</em>
				, the Law Schools race-conscious admissions program adequately ensures that all factors that may contribute to student body diversity are meaningfully considered alongside race in admissions decisions.  With respect to the use of race itself, all underrepresented minority students admitted by the Law School have been deemed qualified.  By virtue of our Nations struggle with racial inequality, such students are both likely to have experiences of particular importance to the Law Schools mission, and less likely to be admitted in meaningful numbers on criteria that ignore those experiences.  See App. 120.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Law School does not, however, limit in any way the broad range of qualities and experiences that may be considered valuable contributions to student body diversity.  To the contrary, the 1992 policy makes clear [t]here are many possible bases for diversity admissions, and provides examples of admittees who have lived or traveled widely abroad, are fluent in several languages, have overcome personal adversity and family hardship, have exceptional records of extensive community service, and have had successful careers in other fields.  
				<em>

				, at 118119.  The Law School seriously considers each applicants promise of making a notable contribution to the class by way of a particular strength, attainment, or characteristic
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, an unusual intellectual achievement, employment experience, nonacademic performance, or personal background.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 8384.  All applicants have the opportunity to highlight their own potential diversity contributions through the submission of a personal statement, letters of recommendation, and an essay describing the ways in which the applicant will contribute to the life and diversity of the Law School.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				What is more, the Law School actually gives substantial weight to diversity factors besides race.  The Law School frequently accepts nonminority applicants with grades and test scores lower than underrepresented minority applicants (and other nonminority applicants) who are rejected.  See Brief for Respondents Bollinger et al. 10; App. 121122.  This shows that the Law School seriously weighs many other diversity factors besides race that can make a real and dispositive difference for nonminority applicants as well.  By this flexible approach, the Law School sufficiently takes into account, in practice as well as in theory, a wide variety of characteristics besides race and ethnicity that contribute to a diverse student body.

				Petitioner and the United States argue that the Law Schools plan is not narrowly tailored because race-neutral means exist to obtain the educational benefits of student body diversity that the Law School seeks.  We disagree.  Narrow tailoring does not require exhaustion of every conceivable race-neutral alternative.  Nor does it require a university to choose between maintaining a reputation for excellence or fulfilling a commitment to provide educational opportunities to members of all racial groups.  See

				We agree with the Court of Appeals that the Law School sufficiently considered workable race-neutral alternatives.  The District Court took the Law School to task for failing to consider race-neutral alternatives such as using a lottery system or decreasing the emphasis for all applicants on undergraduate GPA and LSAT scores.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 251a.  But these alternatives would require a dramatic sacrifice of diversity, the academic quality of all admitted students, or both.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Law Schools current admissions program considers race as one factor among many, in an effort to assemble a student body that is diverse in ways broader than race.  Because a lottery would make that kind of nuanced judgment impossible, it would effectively sacrifice all other educational values, not to mention every other kind of diversity.  So too with the suggestion that the Law School simply lower admissions standards for all students, a drastic remedy that would require the Law School to become a much different institution and sacrifice a vital component of its educational mission.  The United States advocates percentage plans, recently adopted by public undergraduate institutions in Texas, Florida, and California to guarantee admission to all students above a certain class-rank threshold in every high school in the State.  Brief for United States as

				 1418.  The United States does not, however, explain how such plans could work for graduate and professional schools.  More-over, even assuming such plans are race-neutral, they may preclude the university from conducting the individualized assessments necessary to assemble a student body that is not just racially diverse, but diverse along all the qualities valued by the university.  We are satisfied that the Law School adequately considered race-neutral alternatives currently capable of producing a critical mass without forcing the Law School to abandon the academic selectivity that is the cornerstone of its educational mission.

.  Accordingly, race-conscious admissions policies must be limited in time.  This requirement reflects that racial classifications, however compelling their goals, are potentially so dangerous that they may be employed no more broadly than the interest demands.  Enshrining a permanent justification for racial preferences would offend this fundamental equal protection principle.  We see no reason to exempt race-conscious admissions programs from the requirement that all governmental use of race must have a logical end point.  The Law School, too, concedes that all race-conscious programs must have reasonable durational limits.  Brief for Respondents Bollinger et al. 32.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In the context of higher education, the durational requirement can be met by sunset provisions in race-conscious admissions policies and periodic reviews to determine whether racial preferences are still necessary to achieve student body diversity.  Universities in California, Florida, and Washington State, where racial preferences in admissions are prohibited by state law, are currently engaged in experimenting with a wide variety of alternative approaches.  Universities in other States can and should draw on the most promising aspects of these race-neutral alternatives as they develop.  Cf.

When asked about the policys  commitment to racial and ethnic diversity with special reference to the inclusion of students from groups which have been historically discriminated against,   Lempert explained that this language did not purport to remedy past discrimination, but rather to include students who may bring to the Law School a perspective different from that of members of groups which have not been the victims of such discrimination.  
				<em>

In addition to his testimony at trial, Syverud submitted several expert reports on the educational benefits of diversity.

				In an attempt to quantify the extent to which the Law School actually considers race in making admissions decisions, the parties introduced voluminous evidence at trial.  Relying on data obtained from the Law School, petitioners expert, Dr. Kinley Larntz, generated and analyzed admissions grids for the years in question (19952000).  These grids show the number of applicants and the number of admittees for all combinations of GPAs and LSAT scores.  Dr. Larntz made  cell-by-cell  comparisons between applicants of different races to determine whether a statistically significant relationship existed between race and admission rates.  He concluded that membership in certain minority groups  is an extremely strong factor in the decision for acceptance,  and that applicants from these minority groups  are given an extremely large allowance for admission  as compared to applicants who are members of nonfavored groups.

				Dr. Stephen Raudenbush, the Law Schools expert, focused on the predicted effect of eliminating race as a factor in the Law Schools admission process.

				In the end, the District Court concluded that the Law Schools use of race as a factor in admissions decisions was unlawful.  Applying strict scrutiny, the District Court  determined that the Law Schools asserted interest in assembling a diverse student body was not compelling because the attainment of a racially diverse class … was not recognized as such by 
				<em>
					Bakke
				</em>
				 and is not a remedy for past discrimination.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 246a.  The District Court went on to hold that even if diversity were compelling, the Law School had not narrowly tailored its use of race to further that interest.  The District Court granted petitioners request for declaratory relief and enjoined the Law School from using race as a factor in its admissions decisions.  The Court of Appeals entered a stay of the injunction pending appeal.

				Sitting en banc, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Courts judgment and vacated the injunction.  The Court of Appeals first held that Justice Powells opinion in

				We last addressed the use of race in public higher education over 25 years ago.  In the landmark

				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 325 (joint opinion of Brennan, White, Marshall, and Blackmun, JJ., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).  Four other Justices avoided the constitutional question altogether and struck down the program on statutory grounds.

				 was that a State has a substantial interest that legitimately may be served by a properly devised admissions program involving the competitive consideration of race and ethnic origin.

				Since this Courts splintered decision in 
				<em>
					Bakke
				</em>
				, Justice Powells opinion announcing the judgment of the Court has served as the touchstone for constitutional analysis of race-conscious admissions policies.  Public and private universities across the Nation have modeled their own admissions programs on Justice Powells views on permissible race-conscious policies.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.

				, Brief for Judith Areen et al. as

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Justice Powell began by stating that [t]he guarantee of equal protection cannot mean one thing when applied to one individual and something else when applied to a person of another color.  If both are not accorded the same protection, then it is not equal.  
				<em>
					Bakke
				</em>

				<em>
					 
				</em>
				at 289
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				290.  In Justice Powells view, when governmental decisions touch upon an individuals race or ethnic background, he is entitled to a judicial determination that the burden he is asked to bear on that basis is precisely tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 299.  Under this exacting standard, only one of the interests asserted by the university survived Justice Powells scrutiny.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				First, Justice Powell rejected an interest in  reducing the historic deficit of traditionally disfavored minorities in medical schools and in the medical profession  as an unlawful interest in racial balancing.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 306307.  Second, Justice Powell rejected an interest in remedying societal discrimination because such measures would risk placing unnecessary burdens on innocent third parties who bear no responsibility for whatever harm the beneficiaries of the special admissions program are thought to have suffered.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 310.  Third, Justice Powell rejected an interest in increasing the number of physicians who will practice in communities currently underserved, concluding that even if such an interest could be compelling in some circumstances the program under review was not geared to promote that goal.  
				<em>
					Id.

				<em>
					Id.

				, at 311.  With the important proviso that constitutional limitations protecting individual rights may not be disregarded, Justice Powell grounded his analysis in the academic freedom that long has been viewed as a special concern of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.  
				<em>
					Id.

).  In seeking the right to select those students who will contribute the most to the robust exchange of ideas,  a university seeks to achieve a goal that is of paramount importance in the fulfillment of its mission.  438 U.

				Justice Powell was, however, careful to emphasize that in his view race is only one element in a range of factors a university properly may consider in attaining the goal of a heterogeneous student body.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 314.  For Justice Powell, [i]t is not an interest in simple ethnic diversity, in which a specified percentage of the student body is in effect guaranteed to be members of selected ethnic groups, that can justify the use of race.  
				<em>
					Id.

				 In the wake of our fractured decision in Bakke

				<em>
					Marks

				.  In that case, we explained that [w]hen a fragmented Court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five Justices, the holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.  430 U.

				With these principles in mind, we turn to the question whether the Law Schools use of race is justified by a compelling state interest.  Before this Court, as they have throughout this litigation, respondents assert only one justification for their use of race in the admissions process: obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body.  Brief for Respondents Bollinger et al. i.  In other words, the Law School asks us to recognize, in the context of higher education, a compelling state interest in student body diversity.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				We first wish to dispel the notion that the Law Schools argument has been foreclosed, either expressly or implicitly, by our affirmative-action cases decided since 
				<em>
					Bakke
				</em>
				.  It is true that some language in those opinions might be read to suggest that remedying past discrimination is the only permissible justification for race-based governmental action.  See,

But we have never held that the only governmental use of race that can survive strict scrutiny is remedying past discrimination.  Nor, since 
				<em>
					Bakke
				</em>

				The Law School does not premise its need for critical mass on any belief that minority students always (or even consistently) express some characteristic minority viewpoint on any issue. Brief for Respondent Bollinger et al. 30.  To the contrary, diminishing the force of such stereotypes is both a crucial part of the Law Schools mission, and one that it cannot accomplish with only token numbers of minority students.  Just as growing up in a particular region or having particular professional experiences is likely to affect an individuals views, so too is ones own, unique experience of being a racial minority in a society, like our own, in which race unfortunately still matters.  The Law School has determined, based on its experience and expertise, that a critical mass of underrepresented minorities is necessary to further its compelling interest in securing the educational benefits of a diverse student body.

				We find that the Law Schools admissions program bears the hallmarks of a narrowly tailored plan.  As Justice Powell made clear in Bakke

				Justice Powells distinction between the medical schools rigid 16-seat quota and Harvards flexible use of race as a plus factor is instructive.  Harvard certainly had minimum

What is more, Justice Powell flatly rejected the argument that Harvards program was the functional equivalent of a quota merely because it had some  plus  for race, or gave greater weight to race than to some other factors, in order to achieve student body diversity.  438 U.

				The Law Schools goal of attaining a critical mass of underrepresented minority students does not transform its program into a quota.

				That a race-conscious admissions program does not operate as a quota does not, by itself, satisfy the requirement of individualized consideration.  When using race as a plus factor in university admissions, a universitys admissions program must remain flexible enough to ensure that each applicant is evaluated as an individual and not in a way that makes an applicants race or ethnicity the defining feature of his or her application.  The importance of this individualized consideration in the context of a race-conscious admissions program is paramount.  See 
				<em>
					Bakke
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Here, the Law School engages in a highly individualized, holistic review of each applicants file, giving serious consideration to all the ways an applicant might contribute to a diverse educational environment.  The Law School affords this individualized consideration to applicants of all races.  There is no policy, either 
				<em>
					de jure
				</em>
				 or 
				<em>
					de facto
				</em>
				, of automatic acceptance or rejection based on any single soft variable.  Unlike the program at issue in 
				<em>
					Gratz
				</em>
				 v.
				<em>
					 Bollinger
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, the Law School awards no mechanical, predetermined diversity bonuses based on race or ethnicity.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 23 (distinguishing a race-conscious admissions program that automatically awards 20 points based on race from the Harvard plan, which considered race but did not contemplate that any single characteristic automatically ensured a specific and identifiable contribution to a universitys diversity).  Like the Harvard plan, the Law Schools admissions policy is flexible enough to consider all pertinent elements of diversity in light of the particular qualifications of each applicant, and to place them on the same footing for consideration, although not necessarily according them the same weight.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We also find that, like the Harvard plan Justice Powell referenced in 
				<em>
					Bakke
				</em>
				, the Law Schools race-conscious admissions program adequately ensures that all factors that may contribute to student body diversity are meaningfully considered alongside race in admissions decisions.  With respect to the use of race itself, all underrepresented minority students admitted by the Law School have been deemed qualified.  By virtue of our Nations struggle with racial inequality, such students are both likely to have experiences of particular importance to the Law Schools mission, and less likely to be admitted in meaningful numbers on criteria that ignore those experiences.  See App. 120.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Law School does not, however, limit in any way the broad range of qualities and experiences that may be considered valuable contributions to student body diversity.  To the contrary, the 1992 policy makes clear [t]here are many possible bases for diversity admissions, and provides examples of admittees who have lived or traveled widely abroad, are fluent in several languages, have overcome personal adversity and family hardship, have exceptional records of extensive community service, and have had successful careers in other fields.

				What is more, the Law School actually gives substantial weight to diversity factors besides race.  The Law School frequently accepts nonminority applicants with grades and test scores lower than underrepresented minority applicants (and other nonminority applicants) who are rejected.  See Brief for Respondents Bollinger et al. 10; App. 121122.  This shows that the Law School seriously weighs many other diversity factors besides race that can make a real and dispositive difference for nonminority applicants as well.  By this flexible approach, the Law School sufficiently takes into account, in practice as well as in theory, a wide variety of characteristics besides race and ethnicity that contribute to a diverse student body.

				Petitioner and the United States argue that the Law Schools plan is not narrowly tailored because race-neutral means exist to obtain the educational benefits of student body diversity that the Law School seeks.  We disagree.  Narrow tailoring does not require exhaustion of every conceivable race-neutral alternative.

				We agree with the Court of Appeals that the Law School sufficiently considered workable race-neutral alternatives.  The District Court took the Law School to task for failing to consider race-neutral alternatives such as using a lottery system or decreasing the emphasis for all applicants on undergraduate GPA and LSAT scores.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 251a.  But these alternatives would require a dramatic sacrifice of diversity, the academic quality of all admitted students, or both.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Law Schools current admissions program considers race as one factor among many, in an effort to assemble a student body that is diverse in ways broader than race.  Because a lottery would make that kind of nuanced judgment impossible, it would effectively sacrifice all other educational values, not to mention every other kind of diversity.  So too with the suggestion that the Law School simply lower admissions standards for all students, a drastic remedy that would require the Law School to become a much different institution and sacrifice a vital component of its educational mission.  The United States advocates percentage plans, recently adopted by public undergraduate institutions in Texas, Florida, and California to guarantee admission to all students above a certain class-rank threshold in every high school in the State.  Brief for United States as

				 1418.  The United States does not, however, explain how such plans could work for graduate and professional schools.  More-over, even assuming such plans are race-neutral, they may preclude the university from conducting the individualized assessments necessary to assemble a student body that is not just racially diverse, but diverse along all the qualities valued by the university.  We are satisfied that the Law School adequately considered race-neutral alternatives currently capable of producing a critical mass without forcing the Law School to abandon the academic selectivity that is the cornerstone of its educational mission.

.  Accordingly, race-conscious admissions policies must be limited in time.  This requirement reflects that racial classifications, however compelling their goals, are potentially so dangerous that they may be employed no more broadly than the interest demands.  Enshrining a permanent justification for racial preferences would offend this fundamental equal protection principle.  We see no reason to exempt race-conscious admissions programs from the requirement that all governmental use of race must have a logical end point.  The Law School, too, concedes that all race-conscious programs must have reasonable durational limits.  Brief for Respondents Bollinger et al. 32.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In the context of higher education, the durational requirement can be met by sunset provisions in race-conscious admissions policies and periodic reviews to determine whether racial preferences are still necessary to achieve student body diversity.  Universities in California, Florida, and Washington State, where racial preferences in admissions are prohibited by state law, are currently engaged in experimenting with a wide variety of alternative approaches.  Universities in other States can and should draw on the most promising aspects of these race-neutral alternatives as they develop.  Cf.

Despite these inequalities, some minority students are able to meet the high threshold requirements set for admission to the countrys finest undergraduate and graduate educational institutions.  As lower school education in minority communities improves, an increase in the number of such students may be anticipated.

20 U. S. C. A. §7231 (2003 Supp. Pamphlet), it remains the current reality that many minority students encounter markedly inadequate and unequal educational opportunities.  Despite these inequalities, some minority students are able to meet the high threshold requirements set for admission to the countrys finest undergraduate and graduate educational institutions.  As lower school education in minority communities improves, an increase in the number of such students may be anticipated.  From todays vantage point, one may hope, but not firmly forecast, that over the next generations span, progress toward nondiscrimination and genuinely equal opportunity will make it safe to sunset affirmative action.*

20 U. S. C. A. §7231 (2003 Supp. Pamphlet), it remains the current reality that many minority students encounter markedly inadequate and unequal educational opportunities.  Despite these inequalities, some minority students are able to meet the high threshold requirements set for admission to the countrys finest undergraduate and graduate educational institutions.  As lower school education in minority communities improves, an increase in the number of such students may be anticipated.  From todays vantage point, one may hope, but not firmly forecast, that over the next generations span, progress toward nondiscrimination and genuinely equal opportunity will make it safe to sunset affirmative action.*

				However strong the publics desire for improved education systems may be, see P. Hart &amp; R.

20 U. S. C. A. §7231 (2003 Supp. Pamphlet), it remains the current reality that many minority students encounter markedly inadequate and unequal educational opportunities.  Despite these inequalities, some minority students are able to meet the high threshold requirements set for admission to the countrys finest undergraduate and graduate educational institutions.  As lower school education in minority communities improves, an increase in the number of such students may be anticipated.  From todays vantage point, one may hope, but not firmly forecast, that over the next generations span, progress toward nondiscrimination and genuinely equal opportunity will make it safe to sunset affirmative action.*

20 U. S. C. A. §7231 (2003 Supp. Pamphlet), it remains the current reality that many minority students encounter markedly inadequate and unequal educational opportunities.  Despite these inequalities, some minority students are able to meet the high threshold requirements set for admission to the countrys finest undergraduate and graduate educational institutions.  As lower school education in minority communities improves, an increase in the number of such students may be anticipated.  From todays vantage point, one may hope, but not firmly forecast, that over the next generations span, progress toward nondiscrimination and genuinely equal opportunity will make it safe to sunset affirmative action.*

				The Courts observation that race-conscious programs must have a logical end point, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 29, accords with the international understanding of the office of affirmative action.  The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, ratified by the United States in 1994, see State Dept., Treaties in Force 422423 (June 1996), endorses special and concrete measures to ensure the adequate development and protection of certain racial groups or individuals belonging to them, for the purpose of guaranteeing them the full and equal enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms.  Annex to G. A. Res. 2106, 20 U. N. GAOR Res. Supp. (No. 14) 47, U. N. Doc. A/6014, Art. 2(2) (1965).  But such measures, the Convention instructs, shall in no case entail as a consequence the maintenance of unequal or separate rights for different racial groups after the objectives for which they were taken have been achieved.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				; see also Art. 1(4) (similarly providing for temporally limited affirmative action); Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, Annex to G. A. Res. 34/180, 34 U. N. GAOR Res. Supp. (No. 46) 194, U. N. Doc. A/34/46, Art. 4(1) (1979) (authorizing temporary special measures aimed at accelerating 
				<em>

				However strong the publics desire for improved education systems may be, see P. Hart &amp; R.

20 U. S. C. A. §7231 (2003 Supp. Pamphlet), it remains the current reality that many minority students encounter markedly inadequate and unequal educational opportunities.  Despite these inequalities, some minority students are able to meet the high threshold requirements set for admission to the countrys finest undergraduate and graduate educational institutions.  As lower school education in minority communities improves, an increase in the number of such students may be anticipated.  From todays vantage point, one may hope, but not firmly forecast, that over the next generations span, progress toward nondiscrimination and genuinely equal opportunity will make it safe to sunset affirmative action.*

Nor does this case necessitate reconsideration whether interests other than student body diversity, ante, at 13, rank as sufficiently important to justify a race-conscious government program.  Cf.

				  I find particularly unanswerable his central point: that the allegedly compelling state interest at issue here is not the incremental educational benefit that emanates from the fabled critical mass of minority students, but rather Michigans interest in maintaining a prestige law school whose normal admissions standards disproportionately exclude blacks and other minorities.  If that is a compelling state interest, everything is.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I add the following: The educational benefit that the University of Michigan seeks to achieve by racial discrimination consists, according to the Court, of  cross-racial understanding,  
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 18, and  better prepar[ation of] students for an increasingly diverse workforce and society,  
				<em>
					ibid
				</em>
				., all of which is necessary not only for work, but also for good citizenship, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 19.  This is not, of course, an educational benefit on which students will be graded on their Law School transcript (Works and Plays Well with Others: B ) or tested by the bar examiners (Q: Describe in 500 words or less your cross-racial understanding).  For it is a lesson of life rather than lawessentially the same lesson taught to (or rather learned by, for it cannot be taught in the usual sense) people three feet shorter and twenty years younger than the full-grown adults at the University of Michigan Law School, in institutions ranging from Boy Scout troops to public-school kindergartens.  If properly considered an educational benefit at all, it is surely not one that is either uniquely relevant to law school or uniquely teachable in a formal educational setting.  
				<em>
					And therefore:
				</em>
				 If it is appropriate for the University of Michigan Law School to use racial discrimination for the purpose of putting together a critical mass that will convey generic lessons in socialization and good citizenship, surely it is no less appropriateindeed, 
				<em>
					particularly
				</em>
				 appropriatefor the civil service system of the State of Michigan to do so.  There, also, those exposed to critical masses of certain races will presumably become better Americans, better Michiganders, better civil servants.  And surely private employers cannot be criticizedindeed, should be praisedif they also teach good citizenship to their adult employees through a patriotic, all-American system of racial discrimination in hiring.  The nonminority individuals who are deprived of a legal education, a civil service job, or any job at all by reason of their skin color will surely understand.

				  I find particularly unanswerable his central point: that the allegedly compelling state interest at issue here is not the incremental educational benefit that emanates from the fabled critical mass of minority students, but rather Michigans interest in maintaining a prestige law school whose normal admissions standards disproportionately exclude blacks and other minorities.  If that is a compelling state interest, everything is.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I add the following: The educational benefit that the University of Michigan seeks to achieve by racial discrimination consists, according to the Court, of  cross-racial understanding,  
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 18, and  better prepar[ation of] students for an increasingly diverse workforce and society,  
				<em>
					ibid
				</em>
				., all of which is necessary not only for work, but also for good citizenship, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 19.  This is not, of course, an educational benefit on which students will be graded on their Law School transcript (Works and Plays Well with Others: B ) or tested by the bar examiners (Q: Describe in 500 words or less your cross-racial understanding).  For it is a lesson of life rather than lawessentially the same lesson taught to (or rather learned by, for it cannot be taught in the usual sense) people three feet shorter and twenty years younger than the full-grown adults at the University of Michigan Law School, in institutions ranging from Boy Scout troops to public-school kindergartens.  If properly considered an educational benefit at all, it is surely not one that is either uniquely relevant to law school or uniquely teachable in a formal educational setting.  
				<em>
					And therefore:
				</em>
				 If it is appropriate for the University of Michigan Law School to use racial discrimination for the purpose of putting together a critical mass that will convey generic lessons in socialization and good citizenship, surely it is no less appropriateindeed, 
				<em>
					particularly
				</em>
				 appropriatefor the civil service system of the State of Michigan to do so.  There, also, those exposed to critical masses of certain races will presumably become better Americans, better Michiganders, better civil servants.  And surely private employers cannot be criticizedindeed, should be praisedif they also teach good citizenship to their adult employees through a patriotic, all-American system of racial discrimination in hiring.  The nonminority individuals who are deprived of a legal education, a civil service job, or any job at all by reason of their skin color will surely understand.

(Tempting targets, one would suppose, will be those universities that talk the talk of multiculturalism and racial diversity in the courts but walk the walk of tribalism and racial segregation on their campusesthrough minority-only student organizations, separate minority housing opportunities, separate minority student centers, even separate minority-only graduation ceremonies.)  And still other suits may claim that the institutions racial preferences have gone below or above the mystical

				-approved critical mass.  Finally, litigation can be expected on behalf of minority groups intentionally short changed in the institutions composition of its generic minority critical mass.  I do not look forward to any of these cases.  The Constitution proscribes government discrimination on the basis of race, and state-provided education is no exception.

				  I find particularly unanswerable his central point: that the allegedly compelling state interest at issue here is not the incremental educational benefit that emanates from the fabled critical mass of minority students, but rather Michigans interest in maintaining a prestige law school whose normal admissions standards disproportionately exclude blacks and other minorities.  If that is a compelling state interest, everything is.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I add the following: The educational benefit that the University of Michigan seeks to achieve by racial discrimination consists, according to the Court, of  cross-racial understanding,  
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 18, and  better prepar[ation of] students for an increasingly diverse workforce and society,  
				<em>
					ibid
				</em>
				., all of which is necessary not only for work, but also for good citizenship, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 19.  This is not, of course, an educational benefit on which students will be graded on their Law School transcript (Works and Plays Well with Others: B ) or tested by the bar examiners (Q: Describe in 500 words or less your cross-racial understanding).  For it is a lesson of life rather than lawessentially the same lesson taught to (or rather learned by, for it cannot be taught in the usual sense) people three feet shorter and twenty years younger than the full-grown adults at the University of Michigan Law School, in institutions ranging from Boy Scout troops to public-school kindergartens.  If properly considered an educational benefit at all, it is surely not one that is either uniquely relevant to law school or uniquely teachable in a formal educational setting.  
				<em>
					And therefore:
				</em>
				 If it is appropriate for the University of Michigan Law School to use racial discrimination for the purpose of putting together a critical mass that will convey generic lessons in socialization and good citizenship, surely it is no less appropriateindeed, 
				<em>
					particularly
				</em>
				 appropriatefor the civil service system of the State of Michigan to do so.  There, also, those exposed to critical masses of certain races will presumably become better Americans, better Michiganders, better civil servants.  And surely private employers cannot be criticizedindeed, should be praisedif they also teach good citizenship to their adult employees through a patriotic, all-American system of racial discrimination in hiring.  The nonminority individuals who are deprived of a legal education, a civil service job, or any job at all by reason of their skin color will surely understand.

And still other suits may claim that the institutions racial preferences have gone below or above the mystical

				  I find particularly unanswerable his central point: that the allegedly compelling state interest at issue here is not the incremental educational benefit that emanates from the fabled critical mass of minority students, but rather Michigans interest in maintaining a prestige law school whose normal admissions standards disproportionately exclude blacks and other minorities.  If that is a compelling state interest, everything is.

				I add the following: The educational benefit that the University of Michigan seeks to achieve by racial discrimination consists, according to the Court, of  cross-racial understanding,  
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 18, and  better prepar[ation of] students for an increasingly diverse workforce and society,  
				<em>
					ibid
				</em>
				., all of which is necessary not only for work, but also for good citizenship, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 19.  This is not, of course, an educational benefit on which students will be graded on their Law School transcript (Works and Plays Well with Others: B ) or tested by the bar examiners (Q: Describe in 500 words or less your cross-racial understanding).  For it is a lesson of life rather than lawessentially the same lesson taught to (or rather learned by, for it cannot be taught in the usual sense) people three feet shorter and twenty years younger than the full-grown adults at the University of Michigan Law School, in institutions ranging from Boy Scout troops to public-school kindergartens.  If properly considered an educational benefit at all, it is surely not one that is either uniquely relevant to law school or uniquely teachable in a formal educational setting.  
				<em>
					And therefore:
				</em>
				 If it is appropriate for the University of Michigan Law School to use racial discrimination for the purpose of putting together a critical mass that will convey generic lessons in socialization and good citizenship, surely it is no less appropriateindeed, 
				<em>
					particularly
				</em>
				 appropriatefor the civil service system of the State of Michigan to do so.  There, also, those exposed to critical masses of certain races will presumably become better Americans, better Michiganders, better civil servants.  And surely private employers cannot be criticizedindeed, should be praisedif they also teach good citizenship to their adult employees through a patriotic, all-American system of racial discrimination in hiring.  The nonminority individuals who are deprived of a legal education, a civil service job, or any job at all by reason of their skin color will surely understand.

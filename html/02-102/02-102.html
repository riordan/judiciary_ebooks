				Liberty protects the person from unwarranted government intrusions into a dwelling or other private places.  In our tradition the State is not omnipresent in the home.  And there are other spheres of our lives and existence, outside the home, where the State should not be a dominant presence.  Freedom extends beyond spatial bounds.  Liberty presumes an autonomy of self that includes freedom of thought, belief, expression, and certain intimate conduct.  The instant case involves liberty of the person both in its spatial and more transcendent dimensions.

				The question before the Court is the validity of a Texas statute making it a crime for two persons of the same sex to engage in certain intimate sexual conduct.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In Houston, Texas, officers of the Harris County Police Department were dispatched to a private residence in response to a reported weapons disturbance.  They entered an apartment where one of the petitioners, John Geddes Lawrence, resided.  The right of the police to enter does not seem to have been questioned.  The officers observed Lawrence and another man, Tyron Garner, engaging in a sexual act.  The two petitioners were arrested, held in custody over night, and charged and convicted before a Justice of the Peace.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The complaints described their crime as deviate sexual intercourse, namely anal sex, with a member of the same sex (man).  App. to Pet. for Cert. 127a, 139a.  The applicable state law is Tex. Penal Code  Ann. §21.06(a) (2003).  It provides: A person commits an offense if he engages in deviate sexual intercourse with another individual of the same sex.  The statute defines [d]eviate sexual intercourse as follows:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				(A) any contact between any part of the genitals of one person and the mouth or anus of another person; or
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				(B) the penetration of the genitals or the anus of another person with an object.  §21.01(1).

        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				The petitioners exercised their right to a trial 
				<em>
					de novo
				</em>
				 in Harris County Criminal Court.  They challenged the statute as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a> and of a like provision of the Texas Constitution.  Tex. Const., Art. 1, §3a.  Those contentions were rejected.  The petitioners, having entered a plea of

				The Court of Appeals for the Texas Fourteenth District considered the petitioners federal constitutional arguments under both the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the

After hearing the case en banc the court, in a divided opinion, rejected the constitutional arguments and affirmed the convictions.  41 S. W. 3d 349 (Tex. App. 2001).

				In 
				<em>
					Griswold
				</em>
				 the Court invalidated a state law prohibiting the use of drugs or devices of contraception and counseling or aiding and abetting the use of contraceptives.  The Court described the protected interest as a right to privacy and placed emphasis on the marriage relation and the protected space of the marital bedroom.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 485.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				After 
				<em>
					Griswold
				</em>
				 it was established that the right to make certain decisions regarding sexual conduct extends beyond the marital relationship.  In 
				<em>
					Eisenstadt
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>

, the Court invalidated a law prohibiting the distribution of contraceptives to unmarried persons.  The case was decided under the Equal Protection Clause, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 454; but with respect to unmarried persons, the Court went on to state the fundamental proposition that the law impaired the exercise of their personal rights, 
				<em>
					ibid
				</em>
				.  It quoted from the statement of the Court of Appeals finding the law to be in conflict with fundamental human rights, and it followed with this statement of its own:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				It is true that in 
				<em>
					Griswold
				</em>
				 the right of privacy in question inhered in the marital relationship… . If the right of privacy means anything, it is the right of the 
				<em>

				</em>
				, married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child.  
				<em>
					Id.,

.  As is well known, the case involved a challenge to the Texas law prohibiting abortions, but the laws of other States were affected as well.  Although the Court held the womans rights were not absolute, her right to elect an abortion did have real and substantial protection as an exercise of her liberty under the Due Process Clause.  The Court cited cases that protect spatial freedom and cases that go well beyond it.  
				<em>
					Roe 
				</em>
				recognized the right of a woman to make certain fundamental decisions affecting her destiny and confirmed once more that the protection of liberty under the Due Process Clause has a substantive dimension of fundamental significance in defining the rights of the person.

, the Court confronted a New York law forbidding sale or distribution of contraceptive devices to persons under 16 years of age.  Although there was no single opinion for the Court, the law was invalidated.  Both 
				<em>
					Eisenstadt
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Carey
				</em>
				, as well as the holding and rationale in 
				<em>
					Roe
				</em>
				, confirmed that the reasoning of 
				<em>
					Griswold
				</em>
				 could not be confined to the protection of rights of married adults.  This was the state of the law with respect to some of the most relevant cases when the Court considered 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Hardwick
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The facts in 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 had some similarities to the instant case.  A police officer, whose right to enter seems not to have been in question, observed Hardwick, in his own bedroom, engaging in intimate sexual conduct with another adult male.  The conduct was in violation of a Georgia statute making it a criminal offense to engage in sodomy.  One difference between the two cases is that the Georgia statute prohibited the conduct whether or not the participants were of the same sex, while the Texas statute, as we have seen, applies only to participants of the same sex.  Hardwick was not prosecuted, but he brought an action in federal court to declare the state statute invalid.  He alleged he was a practicing homosexual and that the criminal prohibition violated rights guaranteed to him by the Constitution.  The Court, in an opinion by Justice White, sustained the Georgia law.  Chief Justice Burger and Justice Powell joined the opinion of the Court and filed separate, concurring opinions.  Four Justices dissented.  478 U. S., at 199 (opinion of Blackmun, J., joined by Brennan, Marshall, and 
				<span class="smallcaps">

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court began its substantive discussion in 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 as follows: The issue presented is whether the Federal Constitution confers a fundamental right upon homosexuals to engage in sodomy and hence invalidates the laws of the many States that still make such conduct illegal and have done so for a very long time.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 190.  That statement, we now conclude, discloses the Courts own failure to appreciate the extent of the liberty at stake.  To say that the issue in 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 was simply the right to engage in certain sexual conduct demeans the claim the individual put forward, just as it would demean a married couple were it to be said marriage is simply about the right to have sexual intercourse.  The laws involved in 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 and here are, to be sure, statutes that purport to do no more than prohibit a particular sexual act.  Their penalties and purposes, though, have more far-reaching consequences, touching upon the most private human conduct, sexual behavior, and in the most private of places, the home.  The statutes do seek to control a personal relationship that, whether or not entitled to formal recognition in the law, is within the liberty of persons to choose without being punished as criminals.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				This, as a general rule, should counsel against attempts by the State, or a court, to define the meaning of the relationship or to set its boundaries absent injury to a person or abuse of an institution the law protects.  It suffices for us to acknowledge that adults may choose to enter upon this relationship in the confines of their homes and their own private lives and still retain their dignity as free persons.  When sexuality finds overt expression in intimate conduct with another person, the conduct can be but one element in a personal bond that is more enduring.  The liberty protected by the Constitution allows homosexual persons the right to make this choice.

				Having misapprehended the claim of liberty there presented to it, and thus stating the claim to be whether there is a fundamental right to engage in consensual sodomy, the 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 Court said: Proscriptions against that conduct have ancient roots.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 192.  In academic writings, and in many of the scholarly 
				<em>
					amicus
				</em>
				 briefs filed to assist the Court in this case, there are fundamental criticisms of the historical premises relied upon by the majority and concurring opinions in 
				<em>
					Bowers

				 310.  We need not enter this debate in the attempt to reach a definitive historical judgment, but the following considerations counsel against adopting the definitive conclusions upon which 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 placed such reliance.  
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				At the outset it should be noted that there is no longstanding history in this country of laws directed at homosexual conduct as a distinct matter.  Beginning in colonial times there were prohibitions of sodomy derived from the English criminal laws passed in the first instance by the Reformation Parliament of 1533.  The English prohibition was understood to include relations between men and women as well as relations between men and men.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					King
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Wiseman
				</em>
				, 92 Eng. Rep. 774, 775 (K. B. 1718) (interpreting mankind in Act of 1533 as including women and girls).  Nineteenth-century commentators similarly read American sodomy, buggery, and crime-against-nature statutes as criminalizing certain relations between men and women and between men and men.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 2 J. Bishop, Criminal Law §1028 (1858); 2 J. Chitty, Criminal Law 4750 (5th Am. ed. 1847); R. Desty, A Compendium of American Criminal Law
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				143 (1882); J. May, The Law of Crimes §203 (2d ed. 1893).  The absence of legal prohibitions focusing on homosexual conduct may be explained in part by noting that according to some scholars the concept of the homosexual as a distinct category of person did not emerge until the late 19th century.  See,

				(2d ed. 1997) ( The modern terms 
				<em>
					homosexuality
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					heterosexuality
				</em>
				 do not apply to an era that had not yet articulated these distinctions).  Thus early American sodomy laws were not directed at homosexuals as such but instead sought to prohibit nonprocreative sexual activity more generally.  This does not suggest approval of homosexual conduct.  It does tend to show that this particular form of conduct was not thought of as a separate category from like conduct between heterosexual persons.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Laws prohibiting sodomy do not seem to have been enforced against consenting adults acting in private.  A substantial number of sodomy prosecutions and convictions for which there are surviving records were for predatory acts against those who could not or did not consent, as in the case of a minor or the victim of an assault.  As to these, one purpose for the prohibitions was to ensure there would be no lack of coverage if a predator committed a sexual assault that did not constitute rape as defined by the criminal law.  Thus the model sodomy indictments presented in a 19th-century treatise, see 2 Chitty, 
				<em>
					supra, 
				</em>
				at 49, addressed the predatory acts of an adult man against a minor girl or minor boy.  Instead of targeting relations between consenting adults in private, 19th-century sodomy prosecutions typically involved relations between men and minor girls or minor boys, relations between adults involving force, relations between adults implicating disparity in status, or relations between men and animals.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				To the extent that there were any prosecutions for the acts in question, 19th-century evidence rules imposed a burden that would make a conviction more difficult to obtain even taking into account the problems always inherent in prosecuting consensual acts committed in private.  Under then-prevailing standards, a man could not be convicted of sodomy based upon testimony of a consenting partner, because the partner was considered an accomplice.  A partners testimony, however, was admissible if he or she had not consented to the act or was a minor, and therefore incapable of consent.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 F. Wharton, Criminal Law 443 (2d ed. 1852); 1 F. Wharton, Criminal Law 512 (8th ed. 1880).  The rule may explain in part the infrequency of these prosecutions.  In all events that infrequency makes it difficult to say that society approved of a rigorous and systematic punishment of the consensual acts committed in private and by adults. The longstanding criminal prohibition of homosexual sodomy upon which the 
				<em>
					Bowers 
				</em>
				decision placed such reliance is as consistent with a general condemnation of nonprocreative sex as it is with an established tradition of prosecuting acts because of their homosexual character.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The policy of punishing consenting adults for private acts was not much discussed in the early legal literature.  We can infer that one reason for this was the very private nature of the conduct.  Despite the absence of prosecutions, there may have been periods in which there was public criticism of homosexuals as such and an insistence that the criminal laws be enforced to discourage their practices.  But far from possessing ancient roots, 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				, 478 U. S., at 192, American laws targeting same-sex couples did not develop until the last third of the 20th century.  The reported decisions concerning the prosecution of consensual, homosexual sodomy between adults for the years 18801995 are not always clear in the details, but a significant number involved conduct in a public place.  See Brief for American Civil Liberties Union et al. as 
				<em>
					Amici Curiae
				</em>
				 1415, and n. 18.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It was not until the 1970s that any State singled out same-sex relations for criminal prosecution, and only nine States have done so.  See 1977 Ark. Gen. Acts no. 828; 1983 Kan. Sess. Laws p. 652; 1974 Ky. Acts p. 847; 1977 Mo. Laws p. 687; 1973 Mont. Laws p. 1339; 1977 Nev. Stats. p. 1632; 1989 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 591; 1973 Tex. Gen. Laws ch. 399; see also 
				<em>

				v.
				<em>
					 State
				</em>
				, 715 P. 2d 1105 (Okla. Crim. App. 1986) (sodomy law invalidated as applied to different-sex couples).  Post-
				<em>
					Bowers 
				</em>
				even some of these States did not adhere to the policy of suppressing homosexual conduct.  Over the course of the last decades, States with same-sex prohibitions have moved toward abolishing them.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Jegley 
				</em>

				<em>

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In summary, the historical grounds relied upon in 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 are more complex than the majority opinion and the concurring opinion by Chief Justice Burger indicate.  Their historical premises are not without doubt and, at the very least, are overstated.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It must be acknowledged, of course, that the Court in 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 was making the broader point that for centuries there have been powerful voices to condemn homosexual conduct as immoral.  The condemnation has been shaped by religious beliefs, conceptions of right and acceptable behavior, and respect for the traditional family.  For many persons these are not trivial concerns but profound and deep convictions accepted as ethical and moral principles to which they aspire and which thus determine the course of their lives.  These considerations do not answer the question before us, however.  The issue is whether the majority may use the power of the State to enforce these views on the whole society through operation of the criminal law.  Our obligation is to define the liberty of all, not to mandate our own moral code.

				Chief Justice Burger joined the opinion for the Court in 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 and further explained his views as follows: Decisions of individuals relating to homosexual conduct have been subject to state intervention throughout the history of Western civilization.  Condemnation of those practices is firmly rooted in Judeao-Christian moral and ethical standards.  478 U. S., at 196.  As with Justice Whites assumptions about history, scholarship casts some doubt on the sweeping nature of the statement by Chief Justice Burger as it pertains to private homosexual conduct between consenting adults.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 Eskridge, Hardwick and Historiography, 1999 U. Ill. L. Rev. 631, 656.  In all events we think that our laws and traditions in the past half century are of most relevance here.  These references show an emerging awareness that liberty gives substantial protection to adult persons in deciding how to conduct their private lives in matters pertaining to sex.  [H]istory and tradition are the starting point but not in all cases the ending point of the substantive due process inquiry.

				This emerging recognition should have been apparent when 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 was decided.  In 1955 the American Law Institute promulgated the Model Penal Code and made clear that it did not recommend or provide for criminal penalties for consensual sexual relations conducted in private.  ALI, Model Penal Code §213.2, Comment 2, p. 372 (1980).  It justified its decision on three grounds: (1) The prohibitions undermined respect for the law by penalizing conduct many people engaged in; (2) the statutes regulated private conduct not harmful to others; and (3) the laws were arbitrarily enforced and thus invited the danger of blackmail.  ALI, Model Penal Code, Commentary 277280 (Tent. Draft No. 4, 1955).  In 1961 Illinois changed its laws to conform to the Model Penal Code.  Other States soon followed.  Brief for Cato Institute as

				In 
				<em>
					Bowers 
				</em>
				the Court referred to the fact that before 1961 all 50 States had outlawed sodomy, and that at the time of the Courts decision 24 States and the District of Columbia had sodomy laws. 478 U. S., at 192193.  Justice Powell pointed out that these prohibitions often were being ignored, however.  Georgia, for instance, had not sought to enforce its law for decades.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 197198, n. 2 (The history of nonenforcement suggests the moribund character today of laws criminalizing this type of private, consensual conduct).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The sweeping references by Chief Justice Burger to the history of Western civilization and to Judeo-Christian moral and ethical standards did not take account of other authorities pointing in an opposite direction.  A committee advising the British Parliament recommended in 1957 repeal of laws punishing homosexual conduct.  The Wolfenden Report: Report of the Committee on Homosexual Offenses and Prostitution (1963).  Parliament enacted the substance of those recommendations 10 years later.  Sexual Offences Act 1967, §1.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Of even more importance, almost five years before 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 was decided the European Court of Human Rights considered a case with parallels to 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 and to todays case.  An adult male resident in Northern Ireland alleged he was a practicing homosexual who desired to engage in consensual homosexual conduct.  The laws of Northern Ireland forbade him that right.  He alleged that he had been questioned, his home had been searched, and he feared criminal prosecution.  The court held that the laws proscribing the conduct were invalid under the European Convention on Human Rights.  
				<em>
					Dudgeon
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					United Kingdom
				</em>
				, 45 Eur. Ct. H. R. (1981) ¶52.  Authoritative in all countries that are members of the Council of Europe (21 nations then, 45 nations now), the decision is at odds with the premise in 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 that the claim put forward was insubstantial in our Western civilization.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In our own constitutional system the deficiencies in  
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 became even more apparent in the years following its announcement.  The 25 States with laws prohibiting the relevant conduct referenced in the 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 decision are reduced now to 13, of which 4 enforce their laws only against homosexual conduct.  In those States where sodomy is still proscribed, whether for same-sex or heterosexual conduct, there is a pattern of nonenforcement with respect to consenting adults acting in private.  The State of Texas admitted in 1994 that as of that date it had not prosecuted anyone under those circumstances.

				Two principal cases decided after 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 cast its holding into even more doubt.  In 
				<em>
					Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Casey,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/505/833" class="subref" title="subref">505 U. S. 833</a> (1992)
, the Court reaffirmed the substantive force of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause.  The 
				<em>
					Casey
				</em>
				 decision again confirmed that our laws and tradition afford constitutional protection to personal decisions relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, child rearing, and education.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 851.  In explaining the respect the Constitution demands for the autonomy of the person in making these choices, we stated as follows:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				 These matters, involving the most intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime, choices central to personal dignity and autonomy, are central to the liberty protected by the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>.  At the heart of liberty is the right to define ones own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.  Beliefs about these matters could not define the attributes of personhood were they formed under compulsion of the State.  Ibid.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
Persons in a homosexual relationship may seek autonomy for these purposes, just as heterosexual persons do.  The decision in 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 would deny them this right.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The second post-
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 case of principal relevance is 
				<em>
					Romer
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Evans,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/517/620" class="subref" title="subref">517 U. S. 620</a> (1996)
.  There the Court struck down class-based legislation directed at homosexuals as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.  
				<em>
					Romer
				</em>
				 invalidated an amendment to Colorados constitution which named as a solitary class persons who were homosexuals, lesbians, or bisexual either by orientation, conduct, practices or relationships, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 624 (internal quotation marks omitted), and deprived them of protection under state antidiscrimination laws.  We concluded that the provision was born of animosity toward the class of persons affected and further that it had no rational relation to a legitimate governmental purpose.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 634.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				As an alternative argument in this case, counsel for the petitioners and some 
				<em>
					amici
				</em>
				 contend that 
				<em>
					Romer
				</em>
				 provides the basis for declaring the Texas statute invalid under the Equal Protection Clause.  That is a tenable argument, but we conclude the instant case requires us to address whether 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 itself has continuing validity.  Were we to hold the statute invalid under the Equal Protection Clause some might question whether a prohibition would be valid if drawn differently, say, to prohibit the conduct both between same-sex and different-sex participants.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Equality of treatment and the due process right to demand respect for conduct protected by the substantive guarantee of liberty are linked in important respects, and a decision on the latter point advances both interests.  If protected conduct is made criminal and the law which does so remains unexamined for its substantive validity, its stigma might remain even if it were not enforceable as drawn for equal protection reasons.  When homosexual conduct is made criminal by the law of the State, that declaration in and of itself is an invitation to subject homosexual persons to discrimination both in the public and in the private spheres.  The central holding of 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 has been brought in question by this case, and it should be addressed.  Its continuance as precedent demeans the lives of homosexual persons.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The stigma this criminal statute imposes, moreover, is not trivial.  The offense, to be sure, is but a class C misdemeanor, a minor offense in the Texas legal system.  Still, it remains a criminal offense with all that imports for the dignity of the persons charged.  The petitioners will bear on their record the history of their criminal convictions.  Just this Term we rejected various challenges to state laws requiring the registration of sex offenders.

.  We are advised that if Texas convicted an adult for private, consensual homosexual conduct under the statute here in question the convicted person would come within the registration laws of a least four States were he or she to be subject to their jurisdiction.  Pet. for Cert. 13, and n. 12 (citing Idaho Code §§188301 to 188326 (Cum. Supp. 2002); La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., §§15:54015:549 (West 2003); Miss. Code Ann. §§453321 to 453357 (Lexis 2003); S. C. Code Ann. §§233400 to 233490 (West 2002)).  This underscores the consequential nature of the punishment and the state-sponsored condemnation attendant to the criminal prohibition.  Furthermore, the Texas criminal conviction carries with it the other collateral consequences always following a conviction, such as notations on job application forms, to mention but one example.

				The foundations of 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 have sustained serious erosion from our recent decisions in 
				<em>
					Casey
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Romer
				</em>
				.  When our precedent has been thus weakened, criticism from other sources is of greater significance.  In the United States criticism of

				To the extent 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 relied on values we share with a wider civilization, it should be noted that the reasoning and holding in 
				<em>

				have been rejected elsewhere.  The European Court of Human Rights has followed not

				 1112.  The right the petitioners seek in this case has been accepted as an integral part of human freedom in many other countries.  There has been no showing that in this country the governmental interest in circumscribing personal choice is somehow more legitimate or urgent.

				The present case does not involve minors.  It does not involve persons who might be injured or coerced or who are situated in relationships where consent might not easily be refused.  It does not involve public conduct or prostitution.  It does not involve whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual persons seek to enter.  The case does involve two adults who, with full and mutual consent from each other, engaged in sexual practices common to a homosexual lifestyle.  The petitioners are entitled to respect for their private lives.  The State cannot demean their existence or control their destiny by making their private sexual conduct a crime.  Their right to liberty under the Due Process Clause gives them the full right to engage in their conduct without intervention of the government.  It is a promise of the Constitution that there is a realm of personal liberty which the government may not enter.

				Liberty protects the person from unwarranted government intrusions into a dwelling or other private places.  In our tradition the State is not omnipresent in the home.  And there are other spheres of our lives and existence, outside the home, where the State should not be a dominant presence.  Freedom extends beyond spatial bounds.

				The complaints described their crime as deviate sexual intercourse, namely anal sex, with a member of the same sex (man).  App. to Pet. for Cert. 127a, 139a.  The applicable state law is Tex. Penal Code  Ann. §21.06(a) (2003).

				<em>

				<em>

				The facts in 
				<em>

				</em>
				 had some similarities to the instant case.  A police officer, whose right to enter seems not to have been in question, observed Hardwick, in his own bedroom, engaging in intimate sexual conduct with another adult male.  The conduct was in violation of a Georgia statute making it a criminal offense to engage in sodomy.  One difference between the two cases is that the Georgia statute prohibited the conduct whether or not the participants were of the same sex, while the Texas statute, as we have seen, applies only to participants of the same sex.  Hardwick was not prosecuted, but he brought an action in federal court to declare the state statute invalid.  He alleged he was a practicing homosexual and that the criminal prohibition violated rights guaranteed to him by the Constitution.  The Court, in an opinion by Justice White, sustained the Georgia law.  Chief Justice Burger and Justice Powell joined the opinion of the Court and filed separate, concurring opinions.  Four Justices dissented.  478 U. S., at 199 (opinion of Blackmun, J., joined by Brennan, Marshall, and

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court began its substantive discussion in 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 as follows: The issue presented is whether the Federal Constitution confers a fundamental right upon homosexuals to engage in sodomy and hence invalidates the laws of the many States that still make such conduct illegal and have done so for a very long time.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 190.  That statement, we now conclude, discloses the Courts own failure to appreciate the extent of the liberty at stake.  To say that the issue in 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 was simply the right to engage in certain sexual conduct demeans the claim the individual put forward, just as it would demean a married couple were it to be said marriage is simply about the right to have sexual intercourse.  The laws involved in 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 and here are, to be sure, statutes that purport to do no more than prohibit a particular sexual act.  Their penalties and purposes, though, have more far-reaching consequences, touching upon the most private human conduct, sexual behavior, and in the most private of places, the home.  The statutes do seek to control a personal relationship that, whether or not entitled to formal recognition in the law, is within the liberty of persons to choose without being punished as criminals.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				This, as a general rule, should counsel against attempts by the State, or a court, to define the meaning of the relationship or to set its boundaries absent injury to a person or abuse of an institution the law protects.  It suffices for us to acknowledge that adults may choose to enter upon this relationship in the confines of their homes and their own private lives and still retain their dignity as free persons.  When sexuality finds overt expression in intimate conduct with another person, the conduct can be but one element in a personal bond that is more enduring.  The liberty protected by the Constitution allows homosexual persons the right to make this choice.

				Having misapprehended the claim of liberty there presented to it, and thus stating the claim to be whether there is a fundamental right to engage in consensual sodomy, the

				</em>
				 placed such reliance.  
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				At the outset it should be noted that there is no longstanding history in this country of laws directed at homosexual conduct as a distinct matter.  Beginning in colonial times there were prohibitions of sodomy derived from the English criminal laws passed in the first instance by the Reformation Parliament of 1533.  The English prohibition was understood to include relations between men and women as well as relations between men and men.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					King
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Wiseman
				</em>
				, 92 Eng. Rep. 774, 775 (K. B. 1718) (interpreting mankind in Act of 1533 as including women and girls).  Nineteenth-century commentators similarly read American sodomy, buggery, and crime-against-nature statutes as criminalizing certain relations between men and women and between men and men.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 2 J. Bishop, Criminal Law §1028 (1858); 2 J. Chitty, Criminal Law 4750 (5th Am. ed. 1847); R. Desty, A Compendium of American Criminal Law
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				143 (1882); J. May, The Law of Crimes §203 (2d ed. 1893).  The absence of legal prohibitions focusing on homosexual conduct may be explained in part by noting that according to some scholars the concept of the homosexual as a distinct category of person did not emerge until the late 19th century.

				(2d ed. 1997) ( The modern terms 
				<em>
					homosexuality
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					heterosexuality
				</em>
				 do not apply to an era that had not yet articulated these distinctions).  Thus early American sodomy laws were not directed at homosexuals as such but instead sought to prohibit nonprocreative sexual activity more generally.  This does not suggest approval of homosexual conduct.  It does tend to show that this particular form of conduct was not thought of as a separate category from like conduct between heterosexual persons.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Laws prohibiting sodomy do not seem to have been enforced against consenting adults acting in private.  A substantial number of sodomy prosecutions and convictions for which there are surviving records were for predatory acts against those who could not or did not consent, as in the case of a minor or the victim of an assault.  As to these, one purpose for the prohibitions was to ensure there would be no lack of coverage if a predator committed a sexual assault that did not constitute rape as defined by the criminal law.  Thus the model sodomy indictments presented in a 19th-century treatise, see 2 Chitty, 
				<em>
					supra, 
				</em>
				at 49, addressed the predatory acts of an adult man against a minor girl or minor boy.  Instead of targeting relations between consenting adults in private, 19th-century sodomy prosecutions typically involved relations between men and minor girls or minor boys, relations between adults involving force, relations between adults implicating disparity in status, or relations between men and animals.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				To the extent that there were any prosecutions for the acts in question, 19th-century evidence rules imposed a burden that would make a conviction more difficult to obtain even taking into account the problems always inherent in prosecuting consensual acts committed in private.  Under then-prevailing standards, a man could not be convicted of sodomy based upon testimony of a consenting partner, because the partner was considered an accomplice.  A partners testimony, however, was admissible if he or she had not consented to the act or was a minor, and therefore incapable of consent.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 F. Wharton, Criminal Law 443 (2d ed. 1852); 1 F. Wharton, Criminal Law 512 (8th ed. 1880).  The rule may explain in part the infrequency of these prosecutions.  In all events that infrequency makes it difficult to say that society approved of a rigorous and systematic punishment of the consensual acts committed in private and by adults. The longstanding criminal prohibition of homosexual sodomy upon which the 
				<em>
					Bowers 
				</em>
				decision placed such reliance is as consistent with a general condemnation of nonprocreative sex as it is with an established tradition of prosecuting acts because of their homosexual character.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The policy of punishing consenting adults for private acts was not much discussed in the early legal literature.  We can infer that one reason for this was the very private nature of the conduct.  Despite the absence of prosecutions, there may have been periods in which there was public criticism of homosexuals as such and an insistence that the criminal laws be enforced to discourage their practices.  But far from possessing ancient roots, 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				, 478 U. S., at 192, American laws targeting same-sex couples did not develop until the last third of the 20th century.  The reported decisions concerning the prosecution of consensual, homosexual sodomy between adults for the years 18801995 are not always clear in the details, but a significant number involved conduct in a public place.  See Brief for American Civil Liberties Union et al. as 
				<em>
					Amici Curiae
				</em>
				 1415, and n. 18.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It was not until the 1970s that any State singled out same-sex relations for criminal prosecution, and only nine States have done so.  See 1977 Ark. Gen. Acts no. 828; 1983 Kan. Sess. Laws p. 652; 1974 Ky. Acts p. 847; 1977 Mo. Laws p. 687; 1973 Mont. Laws p. 1339; 1977 Nev. Stats. p. 1632; 1989 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 591; 1973 Tex. Gen. Laws ch. 399; see also

				v.
				<em>
					 State
				</em>
				, 715 P. 2d 1105 (Okla. Crim. App. 1986) (sodomy law invalidated as applied to different-sex couples).  Post-
				<em>
					Bowers 
				</em>
				even some of these States did not adhere to the policy of suppressing homosexual conduct.  Over the course of the last decades, States with same-sex prohibitions have moved toward abolishing them.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 
				<em>

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In summary, the historical grounds relied upon in 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 are more complex than the majority opinion and the concurring opinion by Chief Justice Burger indicate.  Their historical premises are not without doubt and, at the very least, are overstated.

				It must be acknowledged, of course, that the Court in 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 was making the broader point that for centuries there have been powerful voices to condemn homosexual conduct as immoral.  The condemnation has been shaped by religious beliefs, conceptions of right and acceptable behavior, and respect for the traditional family.  For many persons these are not trivial concerns but profound and deep convictions accepted as ethical and moral principles to which they aspire and which thus determine the course of their lives.  These considerations do not answer the question before us, however.  The issue is whether the majority may use the power of the State to enforce these views on the whole society through operation of the criminal law.  Our obligation is to define the liberty of all, not to mandate our own moral code.

				Chief Justice Burger joined the opinion for the Court in 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 and further explained his views as follows: Decisions of individuals relating to homosexual conduct have been subject to state intervention throughout the history of Western civilization.  Condemnation of those practices is firmly rooted in Judeao-Christian moral and ethical standards.  478 U. S., at 196.  As with Justice Whites assumptions about history, scholarship casts some doubt on the sweeping nature of the statement by Chief Justice Burger as it pertains to private homosexual conduct between consenting adults.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 Eskridge, Hardwick and Historiography, 1999 U. Ill. L. Rev. 631, 656.  In all events we think that our laws and traditions in the past half century are of most relevance here.  These references show an emerging awareness that liberty gives substantial protection to adult persons in deciding how to conduct their private lives in matters pertaining to sex.  [H]istory and tradition are the starting point but not in all cases the ending point of the substantive due process inquiry.

				This emerging recognition should have been apparent when 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 was decided.  In 1955 the American Law Institute promulgated the Model Penal Code and made clear that it did not recommend or provide for criminal penalties for consensual sexual relations conducted in private.  ALI, Model Penal Code §213.2, Comment 2, p. 372 (1980).  It justified its decision on three grounds: (1) The prohibitions undermined respect for the law by penalizing conduct many people engaged in; (2) the statutes regulated private conduct not harmful to others; and (3) the laws were arbitrarily enforced and thus invited the danger of blackmail.  ALI, Model Penal Code, Commentary 277280 (Tent. Draft No. 4, 1955).  In 1961 Illinois changed its laws to conform to the Model Penal Code.  Other States soon followed.  Brief for Cato Institute as

				</em>
				 1516.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In 
				<em>
					Bowers 
				</em>
				the Court referred to the fact that before 1961 all 50 States had outlawed sodomy, and that at the time of the Courts decision 24 States and the District of Columbia had sodomy laws. 478 U. S., at 192193.  Justice Powell pointed out that these prohibitions often were being ignored, however.  Georgia, for instance, had not sought to enforce its law for decades.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The sweeping references by Chief Justice Burger to the history of Western civilization and to Judeo-Christian moral and ethical standards did not take account of other authorities pointing in an opposite direction.  A committee advising the British Parliament recommended in 1957 repeal of laws punishing homosexual conduct.  The Wolfenden Report: Report of the Committee on Homosexual Offenses and Prostitution (1963).  Parliament enacted the substance of those recommendations 10 years later.  Sexual Offences Act 1967, §1.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Of even more importance, almost five years before 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 was decided the European Court of Human Rights considered a case with parallels to 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 and to todays case.  An adult male resident in Northern Ireland alleged he was a practicing homosexual who desired to engage in consensual homosexual conduct.  The laws of Northern Ireland forbade him that right.  He alleged that he had been questioned, his home had been searched, and he feared criminal prosecution.  The court held that the laws proscribing the conduct were invalid under the European Convention on Human Rights.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In our own constitutional system the deficiencies in  
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 became even more apparent in the years following its announcement.  The 25 States with laws prohibiting the relevant conduct referenced in the 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 decision are reduced now to 13, of which 4 enforce their laws only against homosexual conduct.  In those States where sodomy is still proscribed, whether for same-sex or heterosexual conduct, there is a pattern of nonenforcement with respect to consenting adults acting in private.  The State of Texas admitted in 1994 that as of that date it had not prosecuted anyone under those circumstances.

				<em>

				</em>
				, at 851.  In explaining the respect the Constitution demands for the autonomy of the person in making these choices, we stated as follows:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				 These matters, involving the most intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime, choices central to personal dignity and autonomy, are central to the liberty protected by the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>.  At the heart of liberty is the right to define ones own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.  Beliefs about these matters could not define the attributes of personhood were they formed under compulsion of the State.  Ibid.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
Persons in a homosexual relationship may seek autonomy for these purposes, just as heterosexual persons do.  The decision in 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 would deny them this right.

				The second post-
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 case of principal relevance is 
				<em>
					Romer
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Evans,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/517/620" class="subref" title="subref">517 U. S. 620</a> (1996)
.  There the Court struck down class-based legislation directed at homosexuals as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.  
				<em>
					Romer
				</em>
				 invalidated an amendment to Colorados constitution which named as a solitary class persons who were homosexuals, lesbians, or bisexual either by orientation, conduct, practices or relationships, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 624 (internal quotation marks omitted), and deprived them of protection under state antidiscrimination laws.  We concluded that the provision was born of animosity toward the class of persons affected and further that it had no rational relation to a legitimate governmental purpose.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 634.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				As an alternative argument in this case, counsel for the petitioners and some 
				<em>
					amici
				</em>
				 contend that 
				<em>
					Romer
				</em>
				 provides the basis for declaring the Texas statute invalid under the Equal Protection Clause.  That is a tenable argument, but we conclude the instant case requires us to address whether 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 itself has continuing validity.  Were we to hold the statute invalid under the Equal Protection Clause some might question whether a prohibition would be valid if drawn differently, say, to prohibit the conduct both between same-sex and different-sex participants.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Equality of treatment and the due process right to demand respect for conduct protected by the substantive guarantee of liberty are linked in important respects, and a decision on the latter point advances both interests.  If protected conduct is made criminal and the law which does so remains unexamined for its substantive validity, its stigma might remain even if it were not enforceable as drawn for equal protection reasons.  When homosexual conduct is made criminal by the law of the State, that declaration in and of itself is an invitation to subject homosexual persons to discrimination both in the public and in the private spheres.  The central holding of 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 has been brought in question by this case, and it should be addressed.  Its continuance as precedent demeans the lives of homosexual persons.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The stigma this criminal statute imposes, moreover, is not trivial.  The offense, to be sure, is but a class C misdemeanor, a minor offense in the Texas legal system.  Still, it remains a criminal offense with all that imports for the dignity of the persons charged.  The petitioners will bear on their record the history of their criminal convictions.  Just this Term we rejected various challenges to state laws requiring the registration of sex offenders.

We are advised that if Texas convicted an adult for private, consensual homosexual conduct under the statute here in question the convicted person would come within the registration laws of a least four States were he or she to be subject to their jurisdiction.  Pet. for Cert. 13, and n. 12 (citing Idaho Code §§188301 to 188326 (Cum. Supp. 2002); La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., §§15:54015:549 (West 2003); Miss. Code Ann. §§453321 to 453357 (Lexis 2003); S. C. Code Ann. §§233400 to 233490 (West 2002)).  This underscores the consequential nature of the punishment and the state-sponsored condemnation attendant to the criminal prohibition.  Furthermore, the Texas criminal conviction carries with it the other collateral consequences always following a conviction, such as notations on job application forms, to mention but one example.

				The present case does not involve minors.  It does not involve persons who might be injured or coerced or who are situated in relationships where consent might not easily be refused.  It does not involve public conduct or prostitution.  It does not involve whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual persons seek to enter.  The case does involve two adults who, with full and mutual consent from each other, engaged in sexual practices common to a homosexual lifestyle.  The petitioners are entitled to respect for their private lives.  The State cannot demean their existence or control their destiny by making their private sexual conduct a crime.  Their right to liberty under the Due Process Clause gives them the full right to engage in their conduct without intervention of the government.  It is a promise of the Constitution that there is a realm of personal liberty which the government may not enter.

				Liberty protects the person from unwarranted government intrusions into a dwelling or other private places.  In our tradition the State is not omnipresent in the home.  And there are other spheres of our lives and existence, outside the home, where the State should not be a dominant presence.  Freedom extends beyond spatial bounds.  Liberty presumes an autonomy of self that includes freedom of thought, belief, expression, and certain intimate conduct.

				The facts in 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 had some similarities to the instant case.  A police officer, whose right to enter seems not to have been in question, observed Hardwick, in his own bedroom, engaging in intimate sexual conduct with another adult male.  The conduct was in violation of a Georgia statute making it a criminal offense to engage in sodomy.  One difference between the two cases is that the Georgia statute prohibited the conduct whether or not the participants were of the same sex, while the Texas statute, as we have seen, applies only to participants of the same sex.  Hardwick was not prosecuted, but he brought an action in federal court to declare the state statute invalid.  He alleged he was a practicing homosexual and that the criminal prohibition violated rights guaranteed to him by the Constitution.  The Court, in an opinion by Justice White, sustained the Georgia law.  Chief Justice Burger and Justice Powell joined the opinion of the Court and filed separate, concurring opinions.  Four Justices dissented.  478 U. S., at 199 (opinion of Blackmun, J., joined by Brennan, Marshall, and

				The Court began its substantive discussion in 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 as follows: The issue presented is whether the Federal Constitution confers a fundamental right upon homosexuals to engage in sodomy and hence invalidates the laws of the many States that still make such conduct illegal and have done so for a very long time.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 190.  That statement, we now conclude, discloses the Courts own failure to appreciate the extent of the liberty at stake.  To say that the issue in 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 was simply the right to engage in certain sexual conduct demeans the claim the individual put forward, just as it would demean a married couple were it to be said marriage is simply about the right to have sexual intercourse.  The laws involved in 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 and here are, to be sure, statutes that purport to do no more than prohibit a particular sexual act.  Their penalties and purposes, though, have more far-reaching consequences, touching upon the most private human conduct, sexual behavior, and in the most private of places, the home.  The statutes do seek to control a personal relationship that, whether or not entitled to formal recognition in the law, is within the liberty of persons to choose without being punished as criminals.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				This, as a general rule, should counsel against attempts by the State, or a court, to define the meaning of the relationship or to set its boundaries absent injury to a person or abuse of an institution the law protects.  It suffices for us to acknowledge that adults may choose to enter upon this relationship in the confines of their homes and their own private lives and still retain their dignity as free persons.  When sexuality finds overt expression in intimate conduct with another person, the conduct can be but one element in a personal bond that is more enduring.  The liberty protected by the Constitution allows homosexual persons the right to make this choice.

				Having misapprehended the claim of liberty there presented to it, and thus stating the claim to be whether there is a fundamental right to engage in consensual sodomy, the

				 placed such reliance.  
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				At the outset it should be noted that there is no longstanding history in this country of laws directed at homosexual conduct as a distinct matter.  Beginning in colonial times there were prohibitions of sodomy derived from the English criminal laws passed in the first instance by the Reformation Parliament of 1533.  The English prohibition was understood to include relations between men and women as well as relations between men and men.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					King
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Wiseman
				</em>
				, 92 Eng. Rep. 774, 775 (K. B. 1718) (interpreting mankind in Act of 1533 as including women and girls).  Nineteenth-century commentators similarly read American sodomy, buggery, and crime-against-nature statutes as criminalizing certain relations between men and women and between men and men.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 2 J. Bishop, Criminal Law §1028 (1858); 2 J. Chitty, Criminal Law 4750 (5th Am. ed. 1847); R. Desty, A Compendium of American Criminal Law
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				143 (1882); J. May, The Law of Crimes §203 (2d ed. 1893).  The absence of legal prohibitions focusing on homosexual conduct may be explained in part by noting that according to some scholars the concept of the homosexual as a distinct category of person did not emerge until the late 19th century.

				(2d ed. 1997) ( The modern terms 
				<em>
					homosexuality
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					heterosexuality
				</em>
				 do not apply to an era that had not yet articulated these distinctions).  Thus early American sodomy laws were not directed at homosexuals as such but instead sought to prohibit nonprocreative sexual activity more generally.  This does not suggest approval of homosexual conduct.  It does tend to show that this particular form of conduct was not thought of as a separate category from like conduct between heterosexual persons.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Laws prohibiting sodomy do not seem to have been enforced against consenting adults acting in private.  A substantial number of sodomy prosecutions and convictions for which there are surviving records were for predatory acts against those who could not or did not consent, as in the case of a minor or the victim of an assault.  As to these, one purpose for the prohibitions was to ensure there would be no lack of coverage if a predator committed a sexual assault that did not constitute rape as defined by the criminal law.  Thus the model sodomy indictments presented in a 19th-century treatise, see 2 Chitty, 
				<em>
					supra, 
				</em>
				at 49, addressed the predatory acts of an adult man against a minor girl or minor boy.  Instead of targeting relations between consenting adults in private, 19th-century sodomy prosecutions typically involved relations between men and minor girls or minor boys, relations between adults involving force, relations between adults implicating disparity in status, or relations between men and animals.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				To the extent that there were any prosecutions for the acts in question, 19th-century evidence rules imposed a burden that would make a conviction more difficult to obtain even taking into account the problems always inherent in prosecuting consensual acts committed in private.  Under then-prevailing standards, a man could not be convicted of sodomy based upon testimony of a consenting partner, because the partner was considered an accomplice.  A partners testimony, however, was admissible if he or she had not consented to the act or was a minor, and therefore incapable of consent.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 F. Wharton, Criminal Law 443 (2d ed. 1852); 1 F. Wharton, Criminal Law 512 (8th ed. 1880).  The rule may explain in part the infrequency of these prosecutions.  In all events that infrequency makes it difficult to say that society approved of a rigorous and systematic punishment of the consensual acts committed in private and by adults. The longstanding criminal prohibition of homosexual sodomy upon which the 
				<em>
					Bowers 
				</em>
				decision placed such reliance is as consistent with a general condemnation of nonprocreative sex as it is with an established tradition of prosecuting acts because of their homosexual character.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The policy of punishing consenting adults for private acts was not much discussed in the early legal literature.  We can infer that one reason for this was the very private nature of the conduct.  Despite the absence of prosecutions, there may have been periods in which there was public criticism of homosexuals as such and an insistence that the criminal laws be enforced to discourage their practices.  But far from possessing ancient roots, 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				, 478 U. S., at 192, American laws targeting same-sex couples did not develop until the last third of the 20th century.  The reported decisions concerning the prosecution of consensual, homosexual sodomy between adults for the years 18801995 are not always clear in the details, but a significant number involved conduct in a public place.  See Brief for American Civil Liberties Union et al. as 
				<em>
					Amici Curiae
				</em>
				 1415, and n. 18.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It was not until the 1970s that any State singled out same-sex relations for criminal prosecution, and only nine States have done so.  See 1977 Ark. Gen. Acts no. 828; 1983 Kan. Sess. Laws p. 652; 1974 Ky. Acts p. 847; 1977 Mo. Laws p. 687; 1973 Mont. Laws p. 1339; 1977 Nev. Stats. p. 1632; 1989 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 591; 1973 Tex. Gen. Laws ch. 399; see also

				v.
				<em>
					 State
				</em>
				, 715 P. 2d 1105 (Okla. Crim. App. 1986) (sodomy law invalidated as applied to different-sex couples).  Post-
				<em>
					Bowers 
				</em>
				even some of these States did not adhere to the policy of suppressing homosexual conduct.  Over the course of the last decades, States with same-sex prohibitions have moved toward abolishing them.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In summary, the historical grounds relied upon in 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 are more complex than the majority opinion and the concurring opinion by Chief Justice Burger indicate.  Their historical premises are not without doubt and, at the very least, are overstated.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It must be acknowledged, of course, that the Court in 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 was making the broader point that for centuries there have been powerful voices to condemn homosexual conduct as immoral.  The condemnation has been shaped by religious beliefs, conceptions of right and acceptable behavior, and respect for the traditional family.  For many persons these are not trivial concerns but profound and deep convictions accepted as ethical and moral principles to which they aspire and which thus determine the course of their lives.  These considerations do not answer the question before us, however.  The issue is whether the majority may use the power of the State to enforce these views on the whole society through operation of the criminal law.  Our obligation is to define the liberty of all, not to mandate our own moral code.

				Chief Justice Burger joined the opinion for the Court in 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 and further explained his views as follows: Decisions of individuals relating to homosexual conduct have been subject to state intervention throughout the history of Western civilization.  Condemnation of those practices is firmly rooted in Judeao-Christian moral and ethical standards.  478 U. S., at 196.  As with Justice Whites assumptions about history, scholarship casts some doubt on the sweeping nature of the statement by Chief Justice Burger as it pertains to private homosexual conduct between consenting adults.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 Eskridge, Hardwick and Historiography, 1999 U. Ill. L. Rev. 631, 656.  In all events we think that our laws and traditions in the past half century are of most relevance here.  These references show an emerging awareness that liberty gives substantial protection to adult persons in deciding how to conduct their private lives in matters pertaining to sex.  [H]istory and tradition are the starting point but not in all cases the ending point of the substantive due process inquiry.

				This emerging recognition should have been apparent when 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 was decided.  In 1955 the American Law Institute promulgated the Model Penal Code and made clear that it did not recommend or provide for criminal penalties for consensual sexual relations conducted in private.  ALI, Model Penal Code §213.2, Comment 2, p. 372 (1980).  It justified its decision on three grounds: (1) The prohibitions undermined respect for the law by penalizing conduct many people engaged in; (2) the statutes regulated private conduct not harmful to others; and (3) the laws were arbitrarily enforced and thus invited the danger of blackmail.  ALI, Model Penal Code, Commentary 277280 (Tent. Draft No. 4, 1955).  In 1961 Illinois changed its laws to conform to the Model Penal Code.  Other States soon followed.  Brief for Cato Institute as

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In 
				<em>
					Bowers 
				</em>
				the Court referred to the fact that before 1961 all 50 States had outlawed sodomy, and that at the time of the Courts decision 24 States and the District of Columbia had sodomy laws. 478 U. S., at 192193.  Justice Powell pointed out that these prohibitions often were being ignored, however.  Georgia, for instance, had not sought to enforce its law for decades.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The sweeping references by Chief Justice Burger to the history of Western civilization and to Judeo-Christian moral and ethical standards did not take account of other authorities pointing in an opposite direction.  A committee advising the British Parliament recommended in 1957 repeal of laws punishing homosexual conduct.  The Wolfenden Report: Report of the Committee on Homosexual Offenses and Prostitution (1963).  Parliament enacted the substance of those recommendations 10 years later.  Sexual Offences Act 1967, §1.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Of even more importance, almost five years before 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 was decided the European Court of Human Rights considered a case with parallels to 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 and to todays case.  An adult male resident in Northern Ireland alleged he was a practicing homosexual who desired to engage in consensual homosexual conduct.  The laws of Northern Ireland forbade him that right.  He alleged that he had been questioned, his home had been searched, and he feared criminal prosecution.  The court held that the laws proscribing the conduct were invalid under the European Convention on Human Rights.  
				<em>

				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 that the claim put forward was insubstantial in our Western civilization.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In our own constitutional system the deficiencies in  
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 became even more apparent in the years following its announcement.  The 25 States with laws prohibiting the relevant conduct referenced in the 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 decision are reduced now to 13, of which 4 enforce their laws only against homosexual conduct.  In those States where sodomy is still proscribed, whether for same-sex or heterosexual conduct, there is a pattern of nonenforcement with respect to consenting adults acting in private.  The State of Texas admitted in 1994 that as of that date it had not prosecuted anyone under those circumstances.

				Two principal cases decided after

, the Court reaffirmed the substantive force of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause.  The 
				<em>
					Casey
				</em>
				 decision again confirmed that our laws and tradition afford constitutional protection to personal decisions relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, child rearing, and education.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 851.  In explaining the respect the Constitution demands for the autonomy of the person in making these choices, we stated as follows:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				 These matters, involving the most intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime, choices central to personal dignity and autonomy, are central to the liberty protected by the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>.  At the heart of liberty is the right to define ones own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.  Beliefs about these matters could not define the attributes of personhood were they formed under compulsion of the State.  Ibid.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
Persons in a homosexual relationship may seek autonomy for these purposes, just as heterosexual persons do.  The decision in 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 would deny them this right.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The second post-
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 case of principal relevance is 
				<em>
					Romer
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Evans,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/517/620" class="subref" title="subref">517 U. S. 620</a> (1996)
.  There the Court struck down class-based legislation directed at homosexuals as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.  
				<em>
					Romer
				</em>
				 invalidated an amendment to Colorados constitution which named as a solitary class persons who were homosexuals, lesbians, or bisexual either by orientation, conduct, practices or relationships, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 624 (internal quotation marks omitted), and deprived them of protection under state antidiscrimination laws.  We concluded that the provision was born of animosity toward the class of persons affected and further that it had no rational relation to a legitimate governmental purpose.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 634.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				As an alternative argument in this case, counsel for the petitioners and some 
				<em>
					amici
				</em>
				 contend that 
				<em>
					Romer
				</em>
				 provides the basis for declaring the Texas statute invalid under the Equal Protection Clause.  That is a tenable argument, but we conclude the instant case requires us to address whether 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 itself has continuing validity.  Were we to hold the statute invalid under the Equal Protection Clause some might question whether a prohibition would be valid if drawn differently, say, to prohibit the conduct both between same-sex and different-sex participants.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Equality of treatment and the due process right to demand respect for conduct protected by the substantive guarantee of liberty are linked in important respects, and a decision on the latter point advances both interests.  If protected conduct is made criminal and the law which does so remains unexamined for its substantive validity, its stigma might remain even if it were not enforceable as drawn for equal protection reasons.  When homosexual conduct is made criminal by the law of the State, that declaration in and of itself is an invitation to subject homosexual persons to discrimination both in the public and in the private spheres.  The central holding of 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 has been brought in question by this case, and it should be addressed.  Its continuance as precedent demeans the lives of homosexual persons.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The stigma this criminal statute imposes, moreover, is not trivial.  The offense, to be sure, is but a class C misdemeanor, a minor offense in the Texas legal system.  Still, it remains a criminal offense with all that imports for the dignity of the persons charged.  The petitioners will bear on their record the history of their criminal convictions.  Just this Term we rejected various challenges to state laws requiring the registration of sex offenders.

C. Code Ann. §§233400 to 233490 (West 2002)).  This underscores the consequential nature of the punishment and the state-sponsored condemnation attendant to the criminal prohibition.  Furthermore, the Texas criminal conviction carries with it the other collateral consequences always following a conviction, such as notations on job application forms, to mention but one example.

				The present case does not involve minors.  It does not involve persons who might be injured or coerced or who are situated in relationships where consent might not easily be refused.  It does not involve public conduct or prostitution.  It does not involve whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual persons seek to enter.  The case does involve two adults who, with full and mutual consent from each other, engaged in sexual practices common to a homosexual lifestyle.  The petitioners are entitled to respect for their private lives.  The State cannot demean their existence or control their destiny by making their private sexual conduct a crime.  Their right to liberty under the Due Process Clause gives them the full right to engage in their conduct without intervention of the government.  It is a promise of the Constitution that there is a realm of personal liberty which the government may not enter.

				Liberty protects the person from unwarranted government intrusions into a dwelling or other private places.  In our tradition the State is not omnipresent in the home.  And there are other spheres of our lives and existence, outside the home, where the State should not be a dominant presence.  Freedom extends beyond spatial bounds.  Liberty presumes an autonomy of self that includes freedom of thought, belief, expression, and certain intimate conduct.

				In Houston, Texas, officers of the Harris County Police Department were dispatched to a private residence in response to a reported weapons disturbance.

The officers observed Lawrence and another man, Tyron Garner, engaging in a sexual act.  The two petitioners were arrested, held in custody over night, and charged and convicted before a Justice of the Peace.

				The complaints described their crime as deviate sexual intercourse, namely anal sex, with a member of the same sex (man).  App. to Pet. for Cert. 127a, 139a.  The applicable state law is Tex. Penal Code  Ann. §21.06(a) (2003).  It provides: A person commits an offense if he engages in deviate sexual intercourse with another individual of the same sex.  The statute defines [d]eviate sexual intercourse as follows:

, the Court invalidated a law prohibiting the distribution of contraceptives to unmarried persons.  The case was decided under the Equal Protection Clause, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 454; but with respect to unmarried persons, the Court went on to state the fundamental proposition that the law impaired the exercise of their personal rights, 
				<em>
					ibid
				</em>
				.  It quoted from the statement of the Court of Appeals finding the law to be in conflict with fundamental human rights, and it followed with this statement of its own:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				It is true that in 
				<em>
					Griswold
				</em>
				 the right of privacy in question inhered in the marital relationship… . If the right of privacy means anything, it is the right of the

				</em>
				, married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child.

.  As is well known, the case involved a challenge to the Texas law prohibiting abortions, but the laws of other States were affected as well.  Although the Court held the womans rights were not absolute, her right to elect an abortion did have real and substantial protection as an exercise of her liberty under the Due Process Clause.  The Court cited cases that protect spatial freedom and cases that go well beyond it.  
				<em>

, the Court confronted a New York law forbidding sale or distribution of contraceptive devices to persons under 16 years of age.  Although there was no single opinion for the Court, the law was invalidated.  Both 
				<em>
					Eisenstadt
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Carey
				</em>
				, as well as the holding and rationale in 
				<em>

				</em>
				, confirmed that the reasoning of 
				<em>

				 could not be confined to the protection of rights of married adults.  This was the state of the law with respect to some of the most relevant cases when the Court considered 
				<em>

				 v. 
				<em>

				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The facts in 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 had some similarities to the instant case.  A police officer, whose right to enter seems not to have been in question, observed Hardwick, in his own bedroom, engaging in intimate sexual conduct with another adult male.  The conduct was in violation of a Georgia statute making it a criminal offense to engage in sodomy.  One difference between the two cases is that the Georgia statute prohibited the conduct whether or not the participants were of the same sex, while the Texas statute, as we have seen, applies only to participants of the same sex.  Hardwick was not prosecuted, but he brought an action in federal court to declare the state statute invalid.  He alleged he was a practicing homosexual and that the criminal prohibition violated rights guaranteed to him by the Constitution.  The Court, in an opinion by Justice White, sustained the Georgia law.  Chief Justice Burger and Justice Powell joined the opinion of the Court and filed separate, concurring opinions.  Four Justices dissented.  478 U. S., at 199 (opinion of Blackmun, J., joined by Brennan, Marshall, and 
				<span class="smallcaps">

				 JJ.);

				 J., joined by Brennan and Marshall, JJ.).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court began its substantive discussion in 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 as follows: The issue presented is whether the Federal Constitution confers a fundamental right upon homosexuals to engage in sodomy and hence invalidates the laws of the many States that still make such conduct illegal and have done so for a very long time.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 190.  That statement, we now conclude, discloses the Courts own failure to appreciate the extent of the liberty at stake.  To say that the issue in 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 was simply the right to engage in certain sexual conduct demeans the claim the individual put forward, just as it would demean a married couple were it to be said marriage is simply about the right to have sexual intercourse.  The laws involved in 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 and here are, to be sure, statutes that purport to do no more than prohibit a particular sexual act.  Their penalties and purposes, though, have more far-reaching consequences, touching upon the most private human conduct, sexual behavior, and in the most private of places, the home.  The statutes do seek to control a personal relationship that, whether or not entitled to formal recognition in the law, is within the liberty of persons to choose without being punished as criminals.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				This, as a general rule, should counsel against attempts by the State, or a court, to define the meaning of the relationship or to set its boundaries absent injury to a person or abuse of an institution the law protects.  It suffices for us to acknowledge that adults may choose to enter upon this relationship in the confines of their homes and their own private lives and still retain their dignity as free persons.  When sexuality finds overt expression in intimate conduct with another person, the conduct can be but one element in a personal bond that is more enduring.  The liberty protected by the Constitution allows homosexual persons the right to make this choice.

				Having misapprehended the claim of liberty there presented to it, and thus stating the claim to be whether there is a fundamental right to engage in consensual sodomy, the 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 Court said: Proscriptions against that conduct have ancient roots.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 192.  In academic writings, and in many of the scholarly 
				<em>
					amicus

				 briefs filed to assist the Court in this case, there are fundamental criticisms of the historical premises relied upon by the majority and concurring opinions in

				<em>

				</em>
				 placed such reliance.  
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				At the outset it should be noted that there is no longstanding history in this country of laws directed at homosexual conduct as a distinct matter.  Beginning in colonial times there were prohibitions of sodomy derived from the English criminal laws passed in the first instance by the Reformation Parliament of 1533.  The English prohibition was understood to include relations between men and women as well as relations between men and men.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					King
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Wiseman
				</em>
				, 92 Eng. Rep. 774, 775 (K. B. 1718) (interpreting mankind in Act of 1533 as including women and girls).  Nineteenth-century commentators similarly read American sodomy, buggery, and crime-against-nature statutes as criminalizing certain relations between men and women and between men and men.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 2 J. Bishop, Criminal Law §1028 (1858); 2 J. Chitty, Criminal Law 4750 (5th Am. ed. 1847); R. Desty, A Compendium of American Criminal Law
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				143 (1882); J. May, The Law of Crimes §203 (2d ed. 1893).  The absence of legal prohibitions focusing on homosexual conduct may be explained in part by noting that according to some scholars the concept of the homosexual as a distinct category of person did not emerge until the late 19th century.

				(2d ed. 1997) ( The modern terms 
				<em>
					homosexuality
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					heterosexuality
				</em>
				 do not apply to an era that had not yet articulated these distinctions).  Thus early American sodomy laws were not directed at homosexuals as such but instead sought to prohibit nonprocreative sexual activity more generally.  This does not suggest approval of homosexual conduct.  It does tend to show that this particular form of conduct was not thought of as a separate category from like conduct between heterosexual persons.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Laws prohibiting sodomy do not seem to have been enforced against consenting adults acting in private.  A substantial number of sodomy prosecutions and convictions for which there are surviving records were for predatory acts against those who could not or did not consent, as in the case of a minor or the victim of an assault.  As to these, one purpose for the prohibitions was to ensure there would be no lack of coverage if a predator committed a sexual assault that did not constitute rape as defined by the criminal law.  Thus the model sodomy indictments presented in a 19th-century treatise, see 2 Chitty, 
				<em>
					supra, 
				</em>
				at 49, addressed the predatory acts of an adult man against a minor girl or minor boy.  Instead of targeting relations between consenting adults in private, 19th-century sodomy prosecutions typically involved relations between men and minor girls or minor boys, relations between adults involving force, relations between adults implicating disparity in status, or relations between men and animals.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				To the extent that there were any prosecutions for the acts in question, 19th-century evidence rules imposed a burden that would make a conviction more difficult to obtain even taking into account the problems always inherent in prosecuting consensual acts committed in private.  Under then-prevailing standards, a man could not be convicted of sodomy based upon testimony of a consenting partner, because the partner was considered an accomplice.  A partners testimony, however, was admissible if he or she had not consented to the act or was a minor, and therefore incapable of consent.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 F. Wharton, Criminal Law 443 (2d ed. 1852); 1 F. Wharton, Criminal Law 512 (8th ed. 1880).  The rule may explain in part the infrequency of these prosecutions.  In all events that infrequency makes it difficult to say that society approved of a rigorous and systematic punishment of the consensual acts committed in private and by adults. The longstanding criminal prohibition of homosexual sodomy upon which the 
				<em>
					Bowers 
				</em>
				decision placed such reliance is as consistent with a general condemnation of nonprocreative sex as it is with an established tradition of prosecuting acts because of their homosexual character.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The policy of punishing consenting adults for private acts was not much discussed in the early legal literature.  We can infer that one reason for this was the very private nature of the conduct.  Despite the absence of prosecutions, there may have been periods in which there was public criticism of homosexuals as such and an insistence that the criminal laws be enforced to discourage their practices.  But far from possessing ancient roots, 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				, 478 U. S., at 192, American laws targeting same-sex couples did not develop until the last third of the 20th century.  The reported decisions concerning the prosecution of consensual, homosexual sodomy between adults for the years 18801995 are not always clear in the details, but a significant number involved conduct in a public place.  See Brief for American Civil Liberties Union et al. as 
				<em>
					Amici Curiae
				</em>
				 1415, and n. 18.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It was not until the 1970s that any State singled out same-sex relations for criminal prosecution, and only nine States have done so.  See 1977 Ark. Gen. Acts no. 828; 1983 Kan. Sess. Laws p. 652; 1974 Ky. Acts p. 847; 1977 Mo. Laws p. 687; 1973 Mont. Laws p. 1339; 1977 Nev. Stats. p. 1632; 1989 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 591; 1973 Tex. Gen. Laws ch. 399; see also

				In summary, the historical grounds relied upon in 
				<em>
					Bowers

				 are more complex than the majority opinion and the concurring opinion by Chief Justice Burger indicate.  Their historical premises are not without doubt and, at the very least, are overstated.

				It must be acknowledged, of course, that the Court in 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 was making the broader point that for centuries there have been powerful voices to condemn homosexual conduct as immoral.  The condemnation has been shaped by religious beliefs, conceptions of right and acceptable behavior, and respect for the traditional family.  For many persons these are not trivial concerns but profound and deep convictions accepted as ethical and moral principles to which they aspire and which thus determine the course of their lives.  These considerations do not answer the question before us, however.  The issue is whether the majority may use the power of the State to enforce these views on the whole society through operation of the criminal law.  Our obligation is to define the liberty of all, not to mandate our own moral code.

				Chief Justice Burger joined the opinion for the Court in 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 and further explained his views as follows: Decisions of individuals relating to homosexual conduct have been subject to state intervention throughout the history of Western civilization.  Condemnation of those practices is firmly rooted in Judeao-Christian moral and ethical standards.  478 U. S., at 196.  As with Justice Whites assumptions about history, scholarship casts some doubt on the sweeping nature of the statement by Chief Justice Burger as it pertains to private homosexual conduct between consenting adults.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 Eskridge, Hardwick and Historiography, 1999 U. Ill. L. Rev. 631, 656.  In all events we think that our laws and traditions in the past half century are of most relevance here.  These references show an emerging awareness that liberty gives substantial protection to adult persons in deciding how to conduct their private lives in matters pertaining to sex.  [H]istory and tradition are the starting point but not in all cases the ending point of the substantive due process inquiry.

				This emerging recognition should have been apparent when 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 was decided.  In 1955 the American Law Institute promulgated the Model Penal Code and made clear that it did not recommend or provide for criminal penalties for consensual sexual relations conducted in private.  ALI, Model Penal Code §213.2, Comment 2, p. 372 (1980).  It justified its decision on three grounds: (1) The prohibitions undermined respect for the law by penalizing conduct many people engaged in; (2) the statutes regulated private conduct not harmful to others; and (3) the laws were arbitrarily enforced and thus invited the danger of blackmail.  ALI, Model Penal Code, Commentary 277280 (Tent. Draft No. 4, 1955).  In 1961 Illinois changed its laws to conform to the Model Penal Code.  Other States soon followed.  Brief for Cato Institute as

				In 
				<em>
					Bowers 
				</em>
				the Court referred to the fact that before 1961 all 50 States had outlawed sodomy, and that at the time of the Courts decision 24 States and the District of Columbia had sodomy laws. 478 U. S., at 192193.  Justice Powell pointed out that these prohibitions often were being ignored, however.  Georgia, for instance, had not sought to enforce its law for decades.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The sweeping references by Chief Justice Burger to the history of Western civilization and to Judeo-Christian moral and ethical standards did not take account of other authorities pointing in an opposite direction.  A committee advising the British Parliament recommended in 1957 repeal of laws punishing homosexual conduct.  The Wolfenden Report: Report of the Committee on Homosexual Offenses and Prostitution (1963).  Parliament enacted the substance of those recommendations 10 years later.  Sexual Offences Act 1967, §1.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Of even more importance, almost five years before 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 was decided the European Court of Human Rights considered a case with parallels to 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 and to todays case.  An adult male resident in Northern Ireland alleged he was a practicing homosexual who desired to engage in consensual homosexual conduct.  The laws of Northern Ireland forbade him that right.  He alleged that he had been questioned, his home had been searched, and he feared criminal prosecution.  The court held that the laws proscribing the conduct were invalid under the European Convention on Human Rights.  
				<em>
					Dudgeon
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					United Kingdom
				</em>
				, 45 Eur. Ct. H. R. (1981) ¶52.  Authoritative in all countries that are members of the Council of Europe (21 nations then, 45 nations now), the decision is at odds with the premise in 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 that the claim put forward was insubstantial in our Western civilization.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In our own constitutional system the deficiencies in  
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 became even more apparent in the years following its announcement.  The 25 States with laws prohibiting the relevant conduct referenced in the 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 decision are reduced now to 13, of which 4 enforce their laws only against homosexual conduct.  In those States where sodomy is still proscribed, whether for same-sex or heterosexual conduct, there is a pattern of nonenforcement with respect to consenting adults acting in private.  The State of Texas admitted in 1994 that as of that date it had not prosecuted anyone under those circumstances.

				Two principal cases decided after

				 cast its holding into even more doubt.  In

				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/505/833" class="subref" title="subref">505 U. S. 833</a> (1992)
, the Court reaffirmed the substantive force of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause.  The 
				<em>
					Casey
				</em>
				 decision again confirmed that our laws and tradition afford constitutional protection to personal decisions relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, child rearing, and education.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 851.  In explaining the respect the Constitution demands for the autonomy of the person in making these choices, we stated as follows:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				 These matters, involving the most intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime, choices central to personal dignity and autonomy, are central to the liberty protected by the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>.  At the heart of liberty is the right to define ones own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.  Beliefs about these matters could not define the attributes of personhood were they formed under compulsion of the State.  Ibid.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
Persons in a homosexual relationship may seek autonomy for these purposes, just as heterosexual persons do.  The decision in 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 would deny them this right.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The second post-
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 case of principal relevance is 
				<em>
					Romer
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Evans,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/517/620" class="subref" title="subref">517 U. S. 620</a> (1996)
.  There the Court struck down class-based legislation directed at homosexuals as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.  
				<em>
					Romer
				</em>
				 invalidated an amendment to Colorados constitution which named as a solitary class persons who were homosexuals, lesbians, or bisexual either by orientation, conduct, practices or relationships, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 624 (internal quotation marks omitted), and deprived them of protection under state antidiscrimination laws.  We concluded that the provision was born of animosity toward the class of persons affected and further that it had no rational relation to a legitimate governmental purpose.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 634.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				As an alternative argument in this case, counsel for the petitioners and some 
				<em>
					amici
				</em>
				 contend that 
				<em>
					Romer
				</em>
				 provides the basis for declaring the Texas statute invalid under the Equal Protection Clause.  That is a tenable argument, but we conclude the instant case requires us to address whether 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 itself has continuing validity.  Were we to hold the statute invalid under the Equal Protection Clause some might question whether a prohibition would be valid if drawn differently, say, to prohibit the conduct both between same-sex and different-sex participants.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Equality of treatment and the due process right to demand respect for conduct protected by the substantive guarantee of liberty are linked in important respects, and a decision on the latter point advances both interests.  If protected conduct is made criminal and the law which does so remains unexamined for its substantive validity, its stigma might remain even if it were not enforceable as drawn for equal protection reasons.  When homosexual conduct is made criminal by the law of the State, that declaration in and of itself is an invitation to subject homosexual persons to discrimination both in the public and in the private spheres.  The central holding of 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 has been brought in question by this case, and it should be addressed.  Its continuance as precedent demeans the lives of homosexual persons.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The stigma this criminal statute imposes, moreover, is not trivial.  The offense, to be sure, is but a class C misdemeanor, a minor offense in the Texas legal system.  Still, it remains a criminal offense with all that imports for the dignity of the persons charged.  The petitioners will bear on their record the history of their criminal convictions.  Just this Term we rejected various challenges to state laws requiring the registration of sex offenders.

We are advised that if Texas convicted an adult for private, consensual homosexual conduct under the statute here in question the convicted person would come within the registration laws of a least four States were he or she to be subject to their jurisdiction.  Pet. for Cert. 13, and n. 12 (citing Idaho Code §§188301 to 188326 (Cum. Supp. 2002); La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., §§15:54015:549 (West 2003); Miss. Code Ann. §§453321 to 453357 (Lexis 2003); S. C. Code Ann. §§233400 to 233490 (West 2002)).  This underscores the consequential nature of the punishment and the state-sponsored condemnation attendant to the criminal prohibition.  Furthermore, the Texas criminal conviction carries with it the other collateral consequences always following a conviction, such as notations on job application forms, to mention but one example.

				The foundations of 
				<em>
					Bowers

				 have sustained serious erosion from our recent decisions in

				.  When our precedent has been thus weakened, criticism from other sources is of greater significance.  In the United States criticism of

				The present case does not involve minors.  It does not involve persons who might be injured or coerced or who are situated in relationships where consent might not easily be refused.  It does not involve public conduct or prostitution.  It does not involve whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual persons seek to enter.  The case does involve two adults who, with full and mutual consent from each other, engaged in sexual practices common to a homosexual lifestyle.  The petitioners are entitled to respect for their private lives.  The State cannot demean their existence or control their destiny by making their private sexual conduct a crime.  Their right to liberty under the Due Process Clause gives them the full right to engage in their conduct without intervention of the government.  It is a promise of the Constitution that there is a realm of personal liberty which the government may not enter.

				Liberty protects the person from unwarranted government intrusions into a dwelling or other private places.  In our tradition the State is not omnipresent in the home.  And there are other spheres of our lives and existence, outside the home, where the State should not be a dominant presence.  Freedom extends beyond spatial bounds.  Liberty presumes an autonomy of self that includes freedom of thought, belief, expression, and certain intimate conduct.  The instant case involves liberty of the person both in its spatial and more transcendent dimensions.

				In Houston, Texas, officers of the Harris County Police Department were dispatched to a private residence in response to a reported weapons disturbance.

The officers observed Lawrence and another man, Tyron Garner, engaging in a sexual act.  The two petitioners were arrested, held in custody over night, and charged and convicted before a Justice of the Peace.

Penal Code  Ann. §21.06(a) (2003).

				<em>

				 at 454; but with respect to unmarried persons, the Court went on to state the fundamental proposition that the law impaired the exercise of their personal rights, 
				<em>
					ibid

				.  It quoted from the statement of the Court of Appeals finding the law to be in conflict with fundamental human rights, and it followed with this statement of its own:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				It is true that in

Although the Court held the womans rights were not absolute, her right to elect an abortion did have real and substantial protection as an exercise of her liberty under the Due Process Clause.  The Court cited cases that protect spatial freedom and cases that go well beyond it.

				<em>

				</em>
				 and 
				<em>

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The facts in 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 had some similarities to the instant case.  A police officer, whose right to enter seems not to have been in question, observed Hardwick, in his own bedroom, engaging in intimate sexual conduct with another adult male.  The conduct was in violation of a Georgia statute making it a criminal offense to engage in sodomy.  One difference between the two cases is that the Georgia statute prohibited the conduct whether or not the participants were of the same sex, while the Texas statute, as we have seen, applies only to participants of the same sex.  Hardwick was not prosecuted, but he brought an action in federal court to declare the state statute invalid.  He alleged he was a practicing homosexual and that the criminal prohibition violated rights guaranteed to him by the Constitution.  The Court, in an opinion by Justice White, sustained the Georgia law.  Chief Justice Burger and Justice Powell joined the opinion of the Court and filed separate, concurring opinions.  Four Justices dissented.  478 U. S., at 199 (opinion of Blackmun, J., joined by Brennan, Marshall, and

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court began its substantive discussion in 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 as follows: The issue presented is whether the Federal Constitution confers a fundamental right upon homosexuals to engage in sodomy and hence invalidates the laws of the many States that still make such conduct illegal and have done so for a very long time.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 190.  That statement, we now conclude, discloses the Courts own failure to appreciate the extent of the liberty at stake.  To say that the issue in 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 was simply the right to engage in certain sexual conduct demeans the claim the individual put forward, just as it would demean a married couple were it to be said marriage is simply about the right to have sexual intercourse.  The laws involved in 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 and here are, to be sure, statutes that purport to do no more than prohibit a particular sexual act.  Their penalties and purposes, though, have more far-reaching consequences, touching upon the most private human conduct, sexual behavior, and in the most private of places, the home.  The statutes do seek to control a personal relationship that, whether or not entitled to formal recognition in the law, is within the liberty of persons to choose without being punished as criminals.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				This, as a general rule, should counsel against attempts by the State, or a court, to define the meaning of the relationship or to set its boundaries absent injury to a person or abuse of an institution the law protects.  It suffices for us to acknowledge that adults may choose to enter upon this relationship in the confines of their homes and their own private lives and still retain their dignity as free persons.  When sexuality finds overt expression in intimate conduct with another person, the conduct can be but one element in a personal bond that is more enduring.  The liberty protected by the Constitution allows homosexual persons the right to make this choice.

				Having misapprehended the claim of liberty there presented to it, and thus stating the claim to be whether there is a fundamental right to engage in consensual sodomy, the

				</em>
				 placed such reliance.  
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				At the outset it should be noted that there is no longstanding history in this country of laws directed at homosexual conduct as a distinct matter.  Beginning in colonial times there were prohibitions of sodomy derived from the English criminal laws passed in the first instance by the Reformation Parliament of 1533.  The English prohibition was understood to include relations between men and women as well as relations between men and men.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					King
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Wiseman
				</em>
				, 92 Eng. Rep. 774, 775 (K. B. 1718) (interpreting mankind in Act of 1533 as including women and girls).  Nineteenth-century commentators similarly read American sodomy, buggery, and crime-against-nature statutes as criminalizing certain relations between men and women and between men and men.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 2 J. Bishop, Criminal Law §1028 (1858); 2 J. Chitty, Criminal Law 4750 (5th Am. ed. 1847); R. Desty, A Compendium of American Criminal Law
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				143 (1882); J. May, The Law of Crimes §203 (2d ed. 1893).  The absence of legal prohibitions focusing on homosexual conduct may be explained in part by noting that according to some scholars the concept of the homosexual as a distinct category of person did not emerge until the late 19th century.

				(2d ed. 1997) ( The modern terms 
				<em>
					homosexuality
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					heterosexuality
				</em>
				 do not apply to an era that had not yet articulated these distinctions).  Thus early American sodomy laws were not directed at homosexuals as such but instead sought to prohibit nonprocreative sexual activity more generally.  This does not suggest approval of homosexual conduct.  It does tend to show that this particular form of conduct was not thought of as a separate category from like conduct between heterosexual persons.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Laws prohibiting sodomy do not seem to have been enforced against consenting adults acting in private.  A substantial number of sodomy prosecutions and convictions for which there are surviving records were for predatory acts against those who could not or did not consent, as in the case of a minor or the victim of an assault.  As to these, one purpose for the prohibitions was to ensure there would be no lack of coverage if a predator committed a sexual assault that did not constitute rape as defined by the criminal law.  Thus the model sodomy indictments presented in a 19th-century treatise, see 2 Chitty, 
				<em>
					supra, 
				</em>
				at 49, addressed the predatory acts of an adult man against a minor girl or minor boy.  Instead of targeting relations between consenting adults in private, 19th-century sodomy prosecutions typically involved relations between men and minor girls or minor boys, relations between adults involving force, relations between adults implicating disparity in status, or relations between men and animals.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				To the extent that there were any prosecutions for the acts in question, 19th-century evidence rules imposed a burden that would make a conviction more difficult to obtain even taking into account the problems always inherent in prosecuting consensual acts committed in private.  Under then-prevailing standards, a man could not be convicted of sodomy based upon testimony of a consenting partner, because the partner was considered an accomplice.  A partners testimony, however, was admissible if he or she had not consented to the act or was a minor, and therefore incapable of consent.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 F. Wharton, Criminal Law 443 (2d ed. 1852); 1 F. Wharton, Criminal Law 512 (8th ed. 1880).  The rule may explain in part the infrequency of these prosecutions.  In all events that infrequency makes it difficult to say that society approved of a rigorous and systematic punishment of the consensual acts committed in private and by adults. The longstanding criminal prohibition of homosexual sodomy upon which the 
				<em>
					Bowers 
				</em>
				decision placed such reliance is as consistent with a general condemnation of nonprocreative sex as it is with an established tradition of prosecuting acts because of their homosexual character.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The policy of punishing consenting adults for private acts was not much discussed in the early legal literature.  We can infer that one reason for this was the very private nature of the conduct.  Despite the absence of prosecutions, there may have been periods in which there was public criticism of homosexuals as such and an insistence that the criminal laws be enforced to discourage their practices.  But far from possessing ancient roots, 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				, 478 U. S., at 192, American laws targeting same-sex couples did not develop until the last third of the 20th century.  The reported decisions concerning the prosecution of consensual, homosexual sodomy between adults for the years 18801995 are not always clear in the details, but a significant number involved conduct in a public place.  See Brief for American Civil Liberties Union et al. as 
				<em>
					Amici Curiae
				</em>
				 1415, and n. 18.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It was not until the 1970s that any State singled out same-sex relations for criminal prosecution, and only nine States have done so.  See 1977 Ark. Gen. Acts no. 828; 1983 Kan. Sess. Laws p. 652; 1974 Ky. Acts p. 847; 1977 Mo. Laws p. 687; 1973 Mont. Laws p. 1339; 1977 Nev. Stats. p. 1632; 1989 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 591; 1973 Tex. Gen. Laws ch. 399; see also

				It must be acknowledged, of course, that the Court in 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 was making the broader point that for centuries there have been powerful voices to condemn homosexual conduct as immoral.  The condemnation has been shaped by religious beliefs, conceptions of right and acceptable behavior, and respect for the traditional family.  For many persons these are not trivial concerns but profound and deep convictions accepted as ethical and moral principles to which they aspire and which thus determine the course of their lives.  These considerations do not answer the question before us, however.  The issue is whether the majority may use the power of the State to enforce these views on the whole society through operation of the criminal law.  Our obligation is to define the liberty of all, not to mandate our own moral code.

				Chief Justice Burger joined the opinion for the Court in 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 and further explained his views as follows: Decisions of individuals relating to homosexual conduct have been subject to state intervention throughout the history of Western civilization.  Condemnation of those practices is firmly rooted in Judeao-Christian moral and ethical standards.  478 U. S., at 196.  As with Justice Whites assumptions about history, scholarship casts some doubt on the sweeping nature of the statement by Chief Justice Burger as it pertains to private homosexual conduct between consenting adults.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 Eskridge, Hardwick and Historiography, 1999 U. Ill. L. Rev. 631, 656.  In all events we think that our laws and traditions in the past half century are of most relevance here.  These references show an emerging awareness that liberty gives substantial protection to adult persons in deciding how to conduct their private lives in matters pertaining to sex.  [H]istory and tradition are the starting point but not in all cases the ending point of the substantive due process inquiry.

				This emerging recognition should have been apparent when 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 was decided.  In 1955 the American Law Institute promulgated the Model Penal Code and made clear that it did not recommend or provide for criminal penalties for consensual sexual relations conducted in private.  ALI, Model Penal Code §213.2, Comment 2, p. 372 (1980).  It justified its decision on three grounds: (1) The prohibitions undermined respect for the law by penalizing conduct many people engaged in; (2) the statutes regulated private conduct not harmful to others; and (3) the laws were arbitrarily enforced and thus invited the danger of blackmail.  ALI, Model Penal Code, Commentary 277280 (Tent. Draft No. 4, 1955).  In 1961 Illinois changed its laws to conform to the Model Penal Code.  Other States soon followed.  Brief for Cato Institute as

				In 
				<em>
					Bowers 
				</em>
				the Court referred to the fact that before 1961 all 50 States had outlawed sodomy, and that at the time of the Courts decision 24 States and the District of Columbia had sodomy laws. 478 U. S., at 192193.  Justice Powell pointed out that these prohibitions often were being ignored, however.  Georgia, for instance, had not sought to enforce its law for decades.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The sweeping references by Chief Justice Burger to the history of Western civilization and to Judeo-Christian moral and ethical standards did not take account of other authorities pointing in an opposite direction.  A committee advising the British Parliament recommended in 1957 repeal of laws punishing homosexual conduct.  The Wolfenden Report: Report of the Committee on Homosexual Offenses and Prostitution (1963).  Parliament enacted the substance of those recommendations 10 years later.  Sexual Offences Act 1967, §1.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Of even more importance, almost five years before 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 was decided the European Court of Human Rights considered a case with parallels to 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 and to todays case.  An adult male resident in Northern Ireland alleged he was a practicing homosexual who desired to engage in consensual homosexual conduct.  The laws of Northern Ireland forbade him that right.  He alleged that he had been questioned, his home had been searched, and he feared criminal prosecution.  The court held that the laws proscribing the conduct were invalid under the European Convention on Human Rights.  
				<em>
					Dudgeon

				 v. 
				<em>
					United Kingdom
				</em>
				, 45 Eur. Ct. H. R. (1981) ¶52.  Authoritative in all countries that are members of the Council of Europe (21 nations then, 45 nations now), the decision is at odds with the premise in 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 that the claim put forward was insubstantial in our Western civilization.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In our own constitutional system the deficiencies in  
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 became even more apparent in the years following its announcement.  The 25 States with laws prohibiting the relevant conduct referenced in the 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 decision are reduced now to 13, of which 4 enforce their laws only against homosexual conduct.  In those States where sodomy is still proscribed, whether for same-sex or heterosexual conduct, there is a pattern of nonenforcement with respect to consenting adults acting in private.  The State of Texas admitted in 1994 that as of that date it had not prosecuted anyone under those circumstances.

				Two principal cases decided after 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 cast its holding into even more doubt.  In 
				<em>
					Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Casey,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/505/833" class="subref" title="subref">505 U. S. 833</a> (1992)
, the Court reaffirmed the substantive force of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause.  The 
				<em>
					Casey
				</em>
				 decision again confirmed that our laws and tradition afford constitutional protection to personal decisions relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, child rearing, and education.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 851.  In explaining the respect the Constitution demands for the autonomy of the person in making these choices, we stated as follows:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				 These matters, involving the most intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime, choices central to personal dignity and autonomy, are central to the liberty protected by the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>.  At the heart of liberty is the right to define ones own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.  Beliefs about these matters could not define the attributes of personhood were they formed under compulsion of the State.  Ibid.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
Persons in a homosexual relationship may seek autonomy for these purposes, just as heterosexual persons do.  The decision in 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 would deny them this right.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The second post-
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 case of principal relevance is 
				<em>
					Romer
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Evans,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/517/620" class="subref" title="subref">517 U. S. 620</a> (1996)
.  There the Court struck down class-based legislation directed at homosexuals as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.  
				<em>
					Romer
				</em>
				 invalidated an amendment to Colorados constitution which named as a solitary class persons who were homosexuals, lesbians, or bisexual either by orientation, conduct, practices or relationships, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 624 (internal quotation marks omitted), and deprived them of protection under state antidiscrimination laws.  We concluded that the provision was born of animosity toward the class of persons affected and further that it had no rational relation to a legitimate governmental purpose.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 634.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				As an alternative argument in this case, counsel for the petitioners and some 
				<em>
					amici
				</em>
				 contend that 
				<em>
					Romer
				</em>
				 provides the basis for declaring the Texas statute invalid under the Equal Protection Clause.  That is a tenable argument, but we conclude the instant case requires us to address whether 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 itself has continuing validity.  Were we to hold the statute invalid under the Equal Protection Clause some might question whether a prohibition would be valid if drawn differently, say, to prohibit the conduct both between same-sex and different-sex participants.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Equality of treatment and the due process right to demand respect for conduct protected by the substantive guarantee of liberty are linked in important respects, and a decision on the latter point advances both interests.  If protected conduct is made criminal and the law which does so remains unexamined for its substantive validity, its stigma might remain even if it were not enforceable as drawn for equal protection reasons.  When homosexual conduct is made criminal by the law of the State, that declaration in and of itself is an invitation to subject homosexual persons to discrimination both in the public and in the private spheres.  The central holding of 
				<em>
					Bowers
				</em>
				 has been brought in question by this case, and it should be addressed.  Its continuance as precedent demeans the lives of homosexual persons.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The stigma this criminal statute imposes, moreover, is not trivial.  The offense, to be sure, is but a class C misdemeanor, a minor offense in the Texas legal system.  Still, it remains a criminal offense with all that imports for the dignity of the persons charged.  The petitioners will bear on their record the history of their criminal convictions.  Just this Term we rejected various challenges to state laws requiring the registration of sex offenders.

.  We are advised that if Texas convicted an adult for private, consensual homosexual conduct under the statute here in question the convicted person would come within the registration laws of a least four States were he or she to be subject to their jurisdiction.  Pet. for Cert. 13, and n. 12 (citing Idaho Code §§188301 to 188326 (Cum. Supp. 2002); La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., §§15:54015:549 (West 2003); Miss. Code Ann. §§453321 to 453357 (Lexis 2003); S. C. Code Ann. §§233400 to 233490 (West 2002)).  This underscores the consequential nature of the punishment and the state-sponsored condemnation attendant to the criminal prohibition.  Furthermore, the Texas criminal conviction carries with it the other collateral consequences always following a conviction, such as notations on job application forms, to mention but one example.

				The foundations of 
				<em>
					Bowers

				 have sustained serious erosion from our recent decisions in

				<em>

				.  When our precedent has been thus weakened, criticism from other sources is of greater significance.  In the United States criticism of

				To the extent 
				<em>

				 relied on values we share with a wider civilization, it should be noted that the reasoning and holding in 
				<em>

				 1112.  The right the petitioners seek in this case has been accepted as an integral part of human freedom in many other countries.  There has been no showing that in this country the governmental interest in circumscribing personal choice is somehow more legitimate or urgent.

The case does involve two adults who, with full and mutual consent from each other, engaged in sexual practices common to a homosexual lifestyle.  The petitioners are entitled to respect for their private lives.  The State cannot demean their existence or control their destiny by making their private sexual conduct a crime.  Their right to liberty under the Due Process Clause gives them the full right to engage in their conduct without intervention of the government.  It is a promise of the Constitution that there is a realm of personal liberty which the government may not enter.

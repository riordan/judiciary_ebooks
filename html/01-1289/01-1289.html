				We address once again the measure of punishment, by means of punitive damages, a State may impose upon a defendant in a civil case.  The question is whether, in the circumstances we shall recount, an award of $145 million in punitive damages, where full compensatory damages are $1 million, is excessive and in violation of the Due Process Clause of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a> to the Constitution of the United States.

				In 1981, Curtis Campbell (Campbell) was driving with his wife, Inez Preece Campbell, in Cache County, Utah.  He decided to pass six vans traveling ahead of them on a two-lane highway.  Todd Ospital was driving a small car approaching from the opposite direction.  To avoid a head-on collision with Campbell, who by then was driving on the wrong side of the highway and toward oncoming traffic, Ospital swerved onto the shoulder, lost control of his automobile, and collided with a vehicle driven by Robert G. Slusher.  Ospital was killed, and Slusher was rendered permanently disabled.  The Campbells escaped unscathed.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In the ensuing wrongful death and tort action, Campbell insisted he was not at fault.  Early investigations did support differing conclusions as to who caused the accident, but a consensus was reached early on by the investigators and witnesses that Mr. Campbells unsafe pass had indeed caused the crash.  ___ P. 3d ___, 2001 WL 1246676, *1 (Utah, Oct. 19, 2001).  Campbells insurance company, petitioner State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (State Farm), nonetheless decided to contest liability and declined offers by Slusher and Ospitals estate (Ospital) to settle the claims for the policy limit of $50,000 ($25,000 per claimant).  State Farm also ignored the advice of one of its own investigators and took the case to trial, assuring the Campbells that their assets were safe, that they had no liability for the accident, that [State Farm] would represent their interests, and that they did not need to procure separate counsel.

				., at ___, 2001 WL 1246676, at *2.  To the contrary, a jury determined that Campbell was 100 percent at fault, and a judgment was returned for $185,849, far more than the amount offered in settlement.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				At first State Farm refused to cover the $135,849 in excess liability.  Its counsel made this clear to the Campbells:  You may want to put for sale signs on your property to get things moving.   
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  Nor was State Farm willing to post a supersedeas bond to allow Campbell to appeal the judgment against him.  Campbell obtained his own counsel to appeal the verdict.  During the pendency of the appeal, in late 1984, Slusher, Ospital, and the Campbells reached an agreement whereby Slusher and Ospital agreed not to seek satisfaction of their claims against the Campbells.  In exchange the Campbells agreed to pursue a bad faith action against State Farm and to be represented by Slushers and Ospitals attorneys.  The Campbells also agreed that Slusher and Ospital would have a right to play a part in all major decisions concerning the bad faith action.  No settlement could be concluded without Slushers and Ospitals approval, and Slusher and Ospital would receive 90 percent of any verdict against State Farm.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In 1989, the Utah Supreme Court denied Campbells appeal in the wrongful death and tort actions.  
				<em>
					Slusher 
				</em>
				v.
				<em>
					 Ospital
				</em>
				, 777 P. 2d 437.  State Farm then paid the entire judgment, including the amounts in excess of the policy limits.  The Campbells nonetheless filed a complaint against State Farm alleging bad faith, fraud, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.  The trial court initially granted State Farms motion for summary judgment because State Farm had paid the excess verdict, but that ruling was reversed on appeal.  840 P. 2d 130 (Utah App. 1992).  On remand State Farm moved 
				<em>
					in limine
				</em>
				 to exclude evidence of alleged conduct that occurred in unrelated cases outside of Utah, but the trial court denied the motion.  At State Farms request the trial court bifurcated the trial into two phases conducted before different juries.  In the first phase the jury determined that State Farms decision not to settle was unreasonable because there was a substantial likelihood of an excess verdict.

, and refused to sustain a $2 million punitive damages award which accompanied a verdict of only $4,000 in compensatory damages.  Based on that decision, State Farm again moved for the exclusion of evidence of dissimilar out-of-state conduct.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 168a172a.  The trial court denied State Farms motion.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The second phase addressed State Farms liability for fraud and intentional infliction of emotional distress, as well as compensatory and punitive damages.  The Utah Supreme Court aptly characterized this phase of the trial:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				State Farm argued during phase II that its decision to take the case to trial was an honest mistake that did not warrant punitive damages.  In contrast, the Campbells introduced evidence that State Farms decision to take the case to trial was a result of a national scheme to meet corporate fiscal goals by capping payouts on claims company wide.  This scheme was referred to as State Farms Performance, Planning and Review, or PP &amp; R, policy.  To prove the existence of this scheme, the trial court allowed the Campbells to introduce extensive expert testimony regarding fraudulent practices by State Farm in its nation-wide operations.  Although State Farm moved prior to phase II of the trial for the exclusion of such evidence and continued to object to it at trial, the trial court ruled that such evidence was admissible to determine whether State Farms conduct in the Campbell case was indeed intentional and sufficiently egregious to warrant punitive damages.  ___ P. 3d, at ___, 2001 WL 1246676, at *3.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
Evidence pertaining to the PP&amp;R policy concerned State Farms business practices for over 20 years in numerous States.  Most of these practices bore no relation to third-party automobile insurance claims, the type of claim underlying the Campbells complaint against the company.  The jury awarded the Campbells $2.6 million in compensatory damages and $145 million in punitive damages, which the trial court reduced to $1 million and $25 million respectively.  Both parties appealed.

				The Utah Supreme Court sought to apply the three guideposts we identified in 
				<em>
					Gore
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra,
				</em>
				 at 574575, and it reinstated the $145 million punitive damages award.  Relying in large part on the extensive evidence concerning the PP&amp;R policy, the court concluded State Farms conduct was reprehensible.  The court also relied upon State Farms massive wealth and on testimony indicating that State Farms actions, because of their clandestine nature, will be punished at most in one out of every 50,000 cases as a matter of statistical probability, ___ P. 3d, at ___, 2001 WL 1246676, at *15, and concluded that the ratio between punitive and compensatory damages was not unwarranted.  Finally, the court noted that the punitive damages award was not excessive when compared to various civil and criminal penalties State Farm could have faced, including $10,000 for each act of fraud, the suspension of its license to conduct business in Utah, the disgorgement of profits, and imprisonment.

				Although these awards serve the same purposes as criminal penalties, defendants subjected to punitive damages in civil cases have not been accorded the protections applicable in a criminal proceeding.  This increases our concerns over the imprecise manner in which punitive damages systems are administered.  We have admonished that [p]unitive damages pose an acute danger of arbitrary deprivation of property.  Jury instructions typically leave the jury with wide discretion in choosing amounts, and the presentation of evidence of a defendants net worth creates the potential that juries will use their verdicts to express biases against big businesses, particularly those without strong local presences.

Indeed, the point of due processof the law in generalis to allow citizens to order their behavior.  A State can have no legitimate interest in deliberately making the law so arbitrary that citizens will be unable to avoid punishment based solely upon bias or whim).  Our concerns are heightened when the decisionmaker is presented, as we shall discuss, with evidence that has little bearing as to the amount of punitive damages that should be awarded.  Vague instructions, or those that merely inform the jury to avoid passion or prejudice, App. to Pet. for Cert. 108a109a, do little to aid the decisionmaker in its task of assigning appropriate weight to evidence that is relevant and evidence that is tangential or only inflammatory.

				In light of these concerns, in 
				<em>
					Gore
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, we instructed courts reviewing punitive damages to consider three guideposts: (1) the degree of reprehensibility of the defendants misconduct; (2) the disparity between the actual or potential harm suffered by the plaintiff and the punitive damages award; and (3) the difference between the punitive damages awarded by the jury and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases.  
				<em>

				<em>

				 and mandated appellate courts to conduct 
				<em>

				 review of a trial courts application of them to the jurys award.  532 U. S., at 424.  Exacting appellate review ensures that an award of punitive damages is based upon an  application of law, rather than a decisionmakers caprice. 

				[T]he most important indicium of the reasonableness of a punitive damages award is the degree of reprehensibility of the defendants conduct.  
				<em>
					Gore
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 575.  We have instructed courts to determine the reprehensibility of a defendant by considering whether: the harm caused was physical as opposed to economic; the tortious conduct evinced an indifference to or a reckless disregard of the health or safety of others; the target of the conduct had financial vulnerability; the conduct involved repeated actions or was an isolated incident; and the harm was the result of intentional malice, trickery, or deceit, or mere accident.  517 U. S., at 576577.  The existence of any one of these factors weighing in favor of a plaintiff may not be sufficient to sustain a punitive damages award; and the absence of all of them renders any award suspect.  It should be presumed a plaintiff has been made whole for his injuries by compensatory damages, so punitive damages should only be awarded if the defendants culpability, after having paid compensatory damages, is so reprehensible as to warrant the imposition of further sanctions to achieve punishment or deterrence.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 575.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Applying these factors in the instant case, we must acknowledge that State Farms handling of the claims against the Campbells merits no praise.  The trial court found that State Farms employees altered the companys records to make Campbell appear less culpable.  State Farm disregarded the overwhelming likelihood of liability and the near-certain probability that, by taking the case to trial, a judgment in excess of the policy limits would be awarded.  State Farm amplified the harm by at first assuring the Campbells their assets would be safe from any verdict and by later telling them, postjudgment, to put a for-sale sign on their house.  While we do not suggest there was error in awarding punitive damages based upon State Farms conduct toward the Campbells, a more modest punishment for this reprehensible conduct could have satisfied the States legitimate objectives, and the Utah courts should have gone no further.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				This case, instead, was used as a platform to expose, and punish, the perceived deficiencies of State Farms operations throughout the country.  The Utah Supreme Courts opinion makes explicit that State Farm was being condemned for its nationwide policies rather than for the conduct direct toward the Campbells.  ___ P. 3d, at ___, 2001 WL 1246676, at *3 ([T]he Campbells introduced evidence that State Farms decision to take the case to trial was a result of a national scheme to meet corporate fiscal goals by capping payouts on claims company wide).  This was, as well, an explicit rationale of the trial courts decision in approving the award, though reduced from $145 million to $25 million.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 120a ([T]he Campbells demonstrated, through the testimony of State Farm employees who had worked outside of Utah, and through expert testimony, that this pattern of claims adjustment under the PP&amp;R program was not a local anomaly, but was a consistent, nationwide feature of State Farms business operations, orchestrated from the highest levels of corporate management).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Campbells contend that State Farm has only itself to blame for the reliance upon dissimilar and out-of-state conduct evidence.  The record does not support this contention.  From their opening statements onward the Campbells framed this case as a chance to rebuke State Farm for its nationwide activities.  App. 208 (Youre going to hear evidence that even the insurance commission in Utah and around the country are unwilling or inept at protecting people against abuses); 
				<em>
					id.

				, at 242 ([T]his is a very important case. . . .  [I]t transcends the Campbell file.  It involves a nationwide practice.  And you, here, are going to be evaluating and assessing, and hopefully requiring State Farm to stand accountable for what its doing across the country, which is the purpose of punitive damages).  This was a position maintained throughout the litigation.  In opposing State Farms motion to exclude such evidence under 
				<em>
					Gore
				</em>
				, the Campbells counsel convinced the trial court that there was no limitation on the scope of evidence that could be considered under our precedents.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 172a (As I read the case [

				Here, the Campbells do not dispute that much of the out-of-state conduct was lawful where it occurred.  They argue, however, that such evidence was not the primary basis for the punitive damages award and was relevant to the extent it demonstrated, in a general sense, State Farms motive against its insured.  Brief for Respondents 4647 ([E]ven if the practices described by State Farm were not malum in se or malum prohibitum, they became relevant to punitive damages to the extent they were used as tools to implement State Farms wrongful PP&amp;R policy).  This argument misses the mark.  Lawful out-of-state conduct may be probative when it demonstrates the deliberateness and culpability of the defendants action in the State where it is tortious, but that conduct must have a nexus to the specific harm suffered by the plaintiff.  A jury must be instructed, furthermore, that it may not use evidence of out-of-state conduct to punish a defendant for action that was lawful in the jurisdiction where it occurred.

				For a more fundamental reason, however, the Utah courts erred in relying upon this and other evidence: The courts awarded punitive damages to punish and deter conduct that bore no relation to the Campbells harm.
				  
				A defendants dissimilar acts, independent from the acts upon which liability was premised, may not serve as the basis for punitive damages.  A defendant should be punished for the conduct that harmed the plaintiff, not for being an unsavory individual or business.  Due process does not permit courts, in the calculation of punitive damages, to adjudicate the merits of other parties hypothetical claims against a defendant under the guise of the reprehensibility analysis, but we have no doubt the Utah Supreme Court did that here.  __ P. 3d, at __, 2001 WL 1246676, at *11 (Even if the harm to the Campbells can be appropriately characterized as minimal, the trial courts assessment of the situation is on target: The harm is minor to the individual but massive in the aggregate ).  Punishment on these bases creates the possibility of multiple punitive damages awards for the same conduct; for in the usual case nonparties are not bound by the judgment some other plaintiff obtains.

				The same reasons lead us to conclude the Utah Supreme Courts decision cannot be justified on the grounds that State Farm was a recidivist.

				The Campbells have identified scant evidence of repeated misconduct of the sort that injured them.  Nor does our review of the Utah courts decisions convince us that State Farm was only punished for its actions toward the Campbells.  Although evidence of other acts need not be identical to have relevance in the calculation of punitive damages, the Utah court erred here because evidence pertaining to claims that had nothing to do with a third-party lawsuit was introduced at length.  Other evidence concerning reprehensibility was even more tangential.  For example, the Utah Supreme Court criticized State Farms investigation into the personal life of one of its employees and, in a broader approach, the manner in which State Farms policies corrupted its employees.  ___ P. 3d, at ___, 2001 WL 1246676, at *10; 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at ___, 2001 WL 1246676, at *12.  The Campbells attempt to justify the courts reliance upon this unrelated testimony on the theory that each dollar of profit made by underpaying a third-party claimant is the same as a dollar made by underpaying a first-party one.  Brief for Respondents 45; see also ___ P. 3d, at ___, 2001 WL 1246676, at *12 (State Farms continuing illicit practice created market disadvantages for other honest insurance companies because these practices increased profits.  As plaintiffs expert witnesses established, such wrongfully obtained competitive advantages have the potential to pressure other companies to adopt similar fraudulent tactics, or to force them out of business.  Thus, such actions cause distortions throughout the insurance market and ultimately hurt all consumers).  For the reasons already stated, this argument is unconvincing.  The reprehensibility guidepost does not permit courts to expand the scope of the case so that a defendant may be punished for any malfeasance, which in this case extended for a 20-year period.  In this case, because the Campbells have shown no conduct by State Farm similar to that which harmed them, the conduct that harmed them is the only conduct relevant to the reprehensibility analysis.

				Turning to the second 
				<em>
					Gore
				</em>
				 guidepost, we have been reluctant to identify concrete constitutional limits on the ratio between harm, or potential harm, to the plaintiff and the punitive damages award.  
				<em>
					Gore
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 582 ([W]e have consistently rejected the notion that the constitutional line is marked by a simple mathematical formula, even one that compares actual 
				<em>
					and potential
				</em>
				 damages to the punitive award); 
				<em>
					TXO
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra,
				</em>
				 at 458.  We decline again to impose a bright-line ratio which a punitive damages award cannot exceed.  Our jurisprudence and the principles it has now established demonstrate, however, that, in practice, few awards exceeding a single-digit ratio between punitive and compensatory damages, to a significant degree, will satisfy due process.  In 
				<em>
					Haslip
				</em>
				, in upholding a punitive damages award, we concluded that an award of more than four times the amount of compensatory damages might be close to the line of constitutional impropriety.  499 U. S., at 2324.  We cited that 4-to-1 ratio again in 
				<em>
					Gore
				</em>
				.  517 U. S., at 581.  The Court further referenced a long legislative history, dating back over 700 years and going forward to today, providing for sanctions of double, treble, or quadruple damages to deter and punish.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 581, and n. 33.  While these ratios are not binding, they are instructive.  They demonstrate what should be obvious: Single-digit multipliers are more likely to comport with due process, while still achieving the States goals of deterrence and retribution, than awards with ratios in range of 500 to 1, 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 582, or, in this case, of 145 to 1.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Nonetheless, because there are no rigid benchmarks that a punitive damages award may not surpass, ratios greater than those we have previously upheld may comport with due process where a particularly egregious act has resulted in only a small amount of economic damages.  
				<em>
					Ibid.;
				</em>
				 see also 
				<em>
					ibid. 
				</em>
				(positing that a higher ratio 
				<em>
					might
				</em>
				 be necessary where the injury is hard to detect or the monetary value of noneconomic harm might have been difficult to determine).  The converse is also true, however.  When compensatory damages are substantial, then a lesser ratio, perhaps only equal to compensatory damages, can reach the outermost limit of the due process guarantee.  The precise award in any case, of course, must be based upon the facts and circumstances of the defendants conduct and the harm to the plaintiff.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In sum, courts must ensure that the measure of punishment is both reasonable and proportionate to the amount of harm to the plaintiff and to the general damages recovered.  In the context of this case, we have no doubt that there is a presumption against an award that has a 145-to-1 ratio.  The compensatory award in this case was substantial; the Campbells were awarded $1 million for a year and a half of emotional distress.  This was complete compensation.  The harm arose from a transaction in the economic realm, not from some physical assault or trauma; there were no physical injuries; and State Farm paid the excess verdict before the complaint was filed, so the Campbells suffered only minor economic injuries for the 18-month period in which State Farm refused to resolve the claim against them.  The compensatory damages for the injury suffered here, moreover, likely were based on a component which was duplicated in the punitive award.  Much of the distress was caused by the outrage and humiliation the Campbells suffered at the actions of their insurer; and it is a major role of punitive damages to condemn such conduct.  Compensatory damages, however, already contain this punitive element.  See Restatement (Second) of Torts §908, Comment 
				<em>
					c,
				</em>
				 p. 466 (1977) (In many cases in which compensatory damages include an amount for emotional distress, such as humiliation or indignation aroused by the defendants act, there is no clear line of demarcation between punishment and compensation and a verdict for a specified amount frequently includes elements of both).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Utah Supreme Court sought to justify the massive award by pointing to State Farms purported failure to report a prior $100 million punitive damages award in Texas to its corporate headquarters; the fact that State Farms policies have affected numerous Utah consumers; the fact that State Farm will only be punished in one out of every 50,000 cases as a matter of statistical probability; and State Farms enormous wealth.  ___ P. 3d, at ___, 2001 WL 1246676, at *15.  Since the Supreme Court of Utah discussed the Texas award when applying the ratio guidepost, we discuss it here.  The Texas award, however, should have been analyzed in the context of the reprehensibility guidepost only.  The failure of the company to report the Texas award is out-of-state conduct that, if the conduct were similar, might have had some bearing on the degree of reprehensibility, subject to the limitations we have described.  Here, it was dissimilar, and of such marginal relevance that it should have been accorded little or no weight.  The award was rendered in a first-party lawsuit; no judgment was entered in the case; and it was later settled for a fraction of the verdict.  With respect to the Utah Supreme Courts second justification, the Campbells inability to direct us to testimony demonstrating harm to the people of Utah (other than those directly involved in this case) indicates that the adverse effect on the States general population was in fact minor.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The remaining premises for the Utah Supreme Courts decision bear no relation to the awards reasonableness or proportionality to the harm.  They are, rather, arguments that seek to defend a departure from well-established constraints on punitive damages.  While States enjoy considerable discretion in deducing when punitive damages are warranted, each award must comport with the principles set forth in 
				<em>
					Gore
				</em>
				.  Here the argument that State Farm will be punished in only the rare case, coupled with reference to its assets (which, of course, are what other insured parties in Utah and other States must rely upon for payment of claims) had little to do with the actual harm sustained by the Campbells.  The wealth of a defendant cannot justify an otherwise unconstitutional punitive damages award.  
				<em>
					Gore
				</em>
				, 517 U. S., at 585 (The fact that BMW is a large corporation rather than an impecunious individual does not diminish its entitlement to fair notice of the demands that the several States impose on the conduct of its business); see also

That does not make its use unlawful or inappropriate; it simply means that this factor cannot make up for the failure of other factors, such as reprehensibility, to constrain significantly an award that purports to punish a defendants conduct).  The principles set forth in 
				<em>

				</em>

				The third guidepost in 
				<em>
					Gore
				</em>
				 is the disparity between the punitive damages award and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 575.  We note that, in the past, we have also looked to criminal penalties that could be imposed.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 583; 
				<em>
					Haslip
				</em>
				, 499 U. S., at 23.  The existence of a criminal penalty does have bearing on the seriousness with which a State views the wrongful action.  When used to determine the dollar amount of the award, however, the criminal penalty has less utility.  Great care must be taken to avoid use of the civil process to assess criminal penalties that can be imposed only after the heightened protections of a criminal trial have been observed, including, of course, its higher standards of proof.  Punitive damages are not a substitute for the criminal process, and the remote possibility of a criminal sanction does not automatically sustain a punitive damages award.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Here, we need not dwell long on this guidepost.  The most relevant civil sanction under Utah state law for the wrong done to the Campbells appears to be a $10,000 fine for an act of fraud, ___ P. 3d, at ___, 2001 WL 1246676, at *17, an amount dwarfed by the $145 million punitive damages award.  The Supreme Court of Utah speculated about the loss of State Farms business license, the disgorgement of profits, and possible imprisonment, but here again its references were to the broad fraudulent scheme drawn from evidence of out-of-state and dissimilar conduct.  This analysis was insufficient to justify the award.

				An application of the 
				<em>
					Gore

				 guideposts to the facts of this case, especially in light of the substantial compensatory damages awarded (a portion of which contained a punitive element), likely would justify a punitive damages award at or near the amount of compensatory damages.  The punitive award of $145 million, therefore, was neither reasonable nor proportionate to the wrong committed, and it was an irrational and arbitrary deprivation of the property of the defendant.  The proper calculation of punitive damages under the principles we have discussed should be resolved, in the first instance, by the Utah courts.

				We address once again the measure of punishment, by means of punitive damages, a State may impose upon a defendant in a civil case.  The question is whether, in the circumstances we shall recount, an award of $145 million in punitive damages, where full compensatory damages are $1 million, is excessive and in violation of the Due Process Clause of the

				In 1981, Curtis Campbell (Campbell) was driving with his wife, Inez Preece Campbell, in Cache County, Utah.  He decided to pass six vans traveling ahead of them on a two-lane highway.  Todd Ospital was driving a small car approaching from the opposite direction.  To avoid a head-on collision with Campbell, who by then was driving on the wrong side of the highway and toward oncoming traffic, Ospital swerved onto the shoulder, lost control of his automobile, and collided with a vehicle driven by Robert G. Slusher.  Ospital was killed, and Slusher was rendered permanently disabled.  The Campbells escaped unscathed.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In the ensuing wrongful death and tort action, Campbell insisted he was not at fault.  Early investigations did support differing conclusions as to who caused the accident, but a consensus was reached early on by the investigators and witnesses that Mr. Campbells unsafe pass had indeed caused the crash.  ___ P. 3d ___, 2001 WL 1246676, *1 (Utah, Oct. 19, 2001).  Campbells insurance company, petitioner State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (State Farm), nonetheless decided to contest liability and declined offers by Slusher and Ospitals estate (Ospital) to settle the claims for the policy limit of $50,000 ($25,000 per claimant).  State Farm also ignored the advice of one of its own investigators and took the case to trial, assuring the Campbells that their assets were safe, that they had no liability for the accident, that [State Farm] would represent their interests, and that they did not need to procure separate counsel.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at ___, 2001 WL 1246676, at *2.  To the contrary, a jury determined that Campbell was 100 percent at fault, and a judgment was returned for $185,849, far more than the amount offered in settlement.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				At first State Farm refused to cover the $135,849 in excess liability.  Its counsel made this clear to the Campbells:  You may want to put for sale signs on your property to get things moving.   
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  Nor was State Farm willing to post a supersedeas bond to allow Campbell to appeal the judgment against him.  Campbell obtained his own counsel to appeal the verdict.  During the pendency of the appeal, in late 1984, Slusher, Ospital, and the Campbells reached an agreement whereby Slusher and Ospital agreed not to seek satisfaction of their claims against the Campbells.  In exchange the Campbells agreed to pursue a bad faith action against State Farm and to be represented by Slushers and Ospitals attorneys.  The Campbells also agreed that Slusher and Ospital would have a right to play a part in all major decisions concerning the bad faith action.  No settlement could be concluded without Slushers and Ospitals approval, and Slusher and Ospital would receive 90 percent of any verdict against State Farm.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In 1989, the Utah Supreme Court denied Campbells appeal in the wrongful death and tort actions.  
				<em>
					Slusher 
				</em>
				v.
				<em>
					 Ospital
				</em>
				, 777 P. 2d 437.  State Farm then paid the entire judgment, including the amounts in excess of the policy limits.  The Campbells nonetheless filed a complaint against State Farm alleging bad faith, fraud, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.  The trial court initially granted State Farms motion for summary judgment because State Farm had paid the excess verdict, but that ruling was reversed on appeal.  840 P. 2d 130 (Utah App. 1992).  On remand State Farm moved 
				<em>
					in limine
				</em>
				 to exclude evidence of alleged conduct that occurred in unrelated cases outside of Utah, but the trial court denied the motion.  At State Farms request the trial court bifurcated the trial into two phases conducted before different juries.  In the first phase the jury determined that State Farms decision not to settle was unreasonable because there was a substantial likelihood of an excess verdict.

, and refused to sustain a $2 million punitive damages award which accompanied a verdict of only $4,000 in compensatory damages.  Based on that decision, State Farm again moved for the exclusion of evidence of dissimilar out-of-state conduct.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 168a172a.  The trial court denied State Farms motion.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The second phase addressed State Farms liability for fraud and intentional infliction of emotional distress, as well as compensatory and punitive damages.  The Utah Supreme Court aptly characterized this phase of the trial:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				State Farm argued during phase II that its decision to take the case to trial was an honest mistake that did not warrant punitive damages.  In contrast, the Campbells introduced evidence that State Farms decision to take the case to trial was a result of a national scheme to meet corporate fiscal goals by capping payouts on claims company wide.  This scheme was referred to as State Farms Performance, Planning and Review, or PP &amp; R, policy.  To prove the existence of this scheme, the trial court allowed the Campbells to introduce extensive expert testimony regarding fraudulent practices by State Farm in its nation-wide operations.  Although State Farm moved prior to phase II of the trial for the exclusion of such evidence and continued to object to it at trial, the trial court ruled that such evidence was admissible to determine whether State Farms conduct in the Campbell case was indeed intentional and sufficiently egregious to warrant punitive damages.  ___ P. 3d, at ___, 2001 WL 1246676, at *3.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
Evidence pertaining to the PP&amp;R policy concerned State Farms business practices for over 20 years in numerous States.  Most of these practices bore no relation to third-party automobile insurance claims, the type of claim underlying the Campbells complaint against the company.  The jury awarded the Campbells $2.6 million in compensatory damages and $145 million in punitive damages, which the trial court reduced to $1 million and $25 million respectively.  Both parties appealed.

				 at 574575, and it reinstated the $145 million punitive damages award.  Relying in large part on the extensive evidence concerning the PP&amp;R policy, the court concluded State Farms conduct was reprehensible.  The court also relied upon State Farms massive wealth and on testimony indicating that State Farms actions, because of their clandestine nature, will be punished at most in one out of every 50,000 cases as a matter of statistical probability, ___ P. 3d, at ___, 2001 WL 1246676, at *15, and concluded that the ratio between punitive and compensatory damages was not unwarranted.  Finally, the court noted that the punitive damages award was not excessive when compared to various civil and criminal penalties State Farm could have faced, including $10,000 for each act of fraud, the suspension of its license to conduct business in Utah, the disgorgement of profits, and imprisonment.

				Although these awards serve the same purposes as criminal penalties, defendants subjected to punitive damages in civil cases have not been accorded the protections applicable in a criminal proceeding.

We have admonished that [p]unitive damages pose an acute danger of arbitrary deprivation of property.  Jury instructions typically leave the jury with wide discretion in choosing amounts, and the presentation of evidence of a defendants net worth creates the potential that juries will use their verdicts to express biases against big businesses, particularly those without strong local presences.

				[T]he most important indicium of the reasonableness of a punitive damages award is the degree of reprehensibility of the defendants conduct.  
				<em>
					Gore
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 575.  We have instructed courts to determine the reprehensibility of a defendant by considering whether: the harm caused was physical as opposed to economic; the tortious conduct evinced an indifference to or a reckless disregard of the health or safety of others; the target of the conduct had financial vulnerability; the conduct involved repeated actions or was an isolated incident; and the harm was the result of intentional malice, trickery, or deceit, or mere accident.  517 U. S., at 576577.  The existence of any one of these factors weighing in favor of a plaintiff may not be sufficient to sustain a punitive damages award; and the absence of all of them renders any award suspect.  It should be presumed a plaintiff has been made whole for his injuries by compensatory damages, so punitive damages should only be awarded if the defendants culpability, after having paid compensatory damages, is so reprehensible as to warrant the imposition of further sanctions to achieve punishment or deterrence.

				Applying these factors in the instant case, we must acknowledge that State Farms handling of the claims against the Campbells merits no praise.  The trial court found that State Farms employees altered the companys records to make Campbell appear less culpable.  State Farm disregarded the overwhelming likelihood of liability and the near-certain probability that, by taking the case to trial, a judgment in excess of the policy limits would be awarded.  State Farm amplified the harm by at first assuring the Campbells their assets would be safe from any verdict and by later telling them, postjudgment, to put a for-sale sign on their house.  While we do not suggest there was error in awarding punitive damages based upon State Farms conduct toward the Campbells, a more modest punishment for this reprehensible conduct could have satisfied the States legitimate objectives, and the Utah courts should have gone no further.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				This case, instead, was used as a platform to expose, and punish, the perceived deficiencies of State Farms operations throughout the country.  The Utah Supreme Courts opinion makes explicit that State Farm was being condemned for its nationwide policies rather than for the conduct direct toward the Campbells.  ___ P. 3d, at ___, 2001 WL 1246676, at *3 ([T]he Campbells introduced evidence that State Farms decision to take the case to trial was a result of a national scheme to meet corporate fiscal goals by capping payouts on claims company wide).  This was, as well, an explicit rationale of the trial courts decision in approving the award, though reduced from $145 million to $25 million.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 120a ([T]he Campbells demonstrated, through the testimony of State Farm employees who had worked outside of Utah, and through expert testimony, that this pattern of claims adjustment under the PP&amp;R program was not a local anomaly, but was a consistent, nationwide feature of State Farms business operations, orchestrated from the highest levels of corporate management).

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Campbells contend that State Farm has only itself to blame for the reliance upon dissimilar and out-of-state conduct evidence.  The record does not support this contention.  From their opening statements onward the Campbells framed this case as a chance to rebuke State Farm for its nationwide activities.  App. 208 (Youre going to hear evidence that even the insurance commission in Utah and around the country are unwilling or inept at protecting people against abuses);

				Here, the Campbells do not dispute that much of the out-of-state conduct was lawful where it occurred.  They argue, however, that such evidence was not the primary basis for the punitive damages award and was relevant to the extent it demonstrated, in a general sense, State Farms motive against its insured.  Brief for Respondents 4647 ([E]ven if the practices described by State Farm were not malum in se or malum prohibitum, they became relevant to punitive damages to the extent they were used as tools to implement State Farms wrongful PP&amp;R policy).  This argument misses the mark.  Lawful out-of-state conduct may be probative when it demonstrates the deliberateness and culpability of the defendants action in the State where it is tortious, but that conduct must have a nexus to the specific harm suffered by the plaintiff.  A jury must be instructed, furthermore, that it may not use evidence of out-of-state conduct to punish a defendant for action that was lawful in the jurisdiction where it occurred.

				For a more fundamental reason, however, the Utah courts erred in relying upon this and other evidence: The courts awarded punitive damages to punish and deter conduct that bore no relation to the Campbells harm.
				  
				A defendants dissimilar acts, independent from the acts upon which liability was premised, may not serve as the basis for punitive damages.  A defendant should be punished for the conduct that harmed the plaintiff, not for being an unsavory individual or business.  Due process does not permit courts, in the calculation of punitive damages, to adjudicate the merits of other parties hypothetical claims against a defendant under the guise of the reprehensibility analysis, but we have no doubt the Utah Supreme Court did that here.  __ P. 3d, at __, 2001 WL 1246676, at *11 (Even if the harm to the Campbells can be appropriately characterized as minimal, the trial courts assessment of the situation is on target: The harm is minor to the individual but massive in the aggregate ).  Punishment on these bases creates the possibility of multiple punitive damages awards for the same conduct; for in the usual case nonparties are not bound by the judgment some other plaintiff obtains.

				The same reasons lead us to conclude the Utah Supreme Courts decision cannot be justified on the grounds that State Farm was a recidivist.

				The Campbells have identified scant evidence of repeated misconduct of the sort that injured them.  Nor does our review of the Utah courts decisions convince us that State Farm was only punished for its actions toward the Campbells.  Although evidence of other acts need not be identical to have relevance in the calculation of punitive damages, the Utah court erred here because evidence pertaining to claims that had nothing to do with a third-party lawsuit was introduced at length.  Other evidence concerning reprehensibility was even more tangential.  For example, the Utah Supreme Court criticized State Farms investigation into the personal life of one of its employees and, in a broader approach, the manner in which State Farms policies corrupted its employees.  ___ P. 3d, at ___, 2001 WL 1246676, at *10; 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at ___, 2001 WL 1246676, at *12.  The Campbells attempt to justify the courts reliance upon this unrelated testimony on the theory that each dollar of profit made by underpaying a third-party claimant is the same as a dollar made by underpaying a first-party one.  Brief for Respondents 45; see also ___ P. 3d, at ___, 2001 WL 1246676, at *12 (State Farms continuing illicit practice created market disadvantages for other honest insurance companies because these practices increased profits.  As plaintiffs expert witnesses established, such wrongfully obtained competitive advantages have the potential to pressure other companies to adopt similar fraudulent tactics, or to force them out of business.  Thus, such actions cause distortions throughout the insurance market and ultimately hurt all consumers).  For the reasons already stated, this argument is unconvincing.  The reprehensibility guidepost does not permit courts to expand the scope of the case so that a defendant may be punished for any malfeasance, which in this case extended for a 20-year period.  In this case, because the Campbells have shown no conduct by State Farm similar to that which harmed them, the conduct that harmed them is the only conduct relevant to the reprehensibility analysis.

				Turning to the second 
				<em>
					Gore
				</em>
				 guidepost, we have been reluctant to identify concrete constitutional limits on the ratio between harm, or potential harm, to the plaintiff and the punitive damages award.  
				<em>
					Gore
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 582 ([W]e have consistently rejected the notion that the constitutional line is marked by a simple mathematical formula, even one that compares actual 
				<em>

				</em>
				 damages to the punitive award); 
				<em>
					TXO
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra,
				</em>
				 at 458.  We decline again to impose a bright-line ratio which a punitive damages award cannot exceed.  Our jurisprudence and the principles it has now established demonstrate, however, that, in practice, few awards exceeding a single-digit ratio between punitive and compensatory damages, to a significant degree, will satisfy due process.  In 
				<em>
					Haslip
				</em>
				, in upholding a punitive damages award, we concluded that an award of more than four times the amount of compensatory damages might be close to the line of constitutional impropriety.  499 U. S., at 2324.  We cited that 4-to-1 ratio again in 
				<em>
					Gore
				</em>
				.  517 U. S., at 581.  The Court further referenced a long legislative history, dating back over 700 years and going forward to today, providing for sanctions of double, treble, or quadruple damages to deter and punish.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 581, and n. 33.  While these ratios are not binding, they are instructive.  They demonstrate what should be obvious: Single-digit multipliers are more likely to comport with due process, while still achieving the States goals of deterrence and retribution, than awards with ratios in range of 500 to 1, 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 582, or, in this case, of 145 to 1.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Nonetheless, because there are no rigid benchmarks that a punitive damages award may not surpass, ratios greater than those we have previously upheld may comport with due process where a particularly egregious act has resulted in only a small amount of economic damages.  
				<em>
					Ibid.;
				</em>
				 see also 
				<em>
					ibid. 
				</em>
				(positing that a higher ratio 
				<em>
					might
				</em>
				 be necessary where the injury is hard to detect or the monetary value of noneconomic harm might have been difficult to determine).  The converse is also true, however.  When compensatory damages are substantial, then a lesser ratio, perhaps only equal to compensatory damages, can reach the outermost limit of the due process guarantee.  The precise award in any case, of course, must be based upon the facts and circumstances of the defendants conduct and the harm to the plaintiff.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In sum, courts must ensure that the measure of punishment is both reasonable and proportionate to the amount of harm to the plaintiff and to the general damages recovered.  In the context of this case, we have no doubt that there is a presumption against an award that has a 145-to-1 ratio.  The compensatory award in this case was substantial; the Campbells were awarded $1 million for a year and a half of emotional distress.  This was complete compensation.  The harm arose from a transaction in the economic realm, not from some physical assault or trauma; there were no physical injuries; and State Farm paid the excess verdict before the complaint was filed, so the Campbells suffered only minor economic injuries for the 18-month period in which State Farm refused to resolve the claim against them.  The compensatory damages for the injury suffered here, moreover, likely were based on a component which was duplicated in the punitive award.  Much of the distress was caused by the outrage and humiliation the Campbells suffered at the actions of their insurer; and it is a major role of punitive damages to condemn such conduct.  Compensatory damages, however, already contain this punitive element.  See Restatement (Second) of Torts §908, Comment 
				<em>
					c,
				</em>
				 p. 466 (1977) (In many cases in which compensatory damages include an amount for emotional distress, such as humiliation or indignation aroused by the defendants act, there is no clear line of demarcation between punishment and compensation and a verdict for a specified amount frequently includes elements of both).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Utah Supreme Court sought to justify the massive award by pointing to State Farms purported failure to report a prior $100 million punitive damages award in Texas to its corporate headquarters; the fact that State Farms policies have affected numerous Utah consumers; the fact that State Farm will only be punished in one out of every 50,000 cases as a matter of statistical probability; and State Farms enormous wealth.  ___ P. 3d, at ___, 2001 WL 1246676, at *15.  Since the Supreme Court of Utah discussed the Texas award when applying the ratio guidepost, we discuss it here.  The Texas award, however, should have been analyzed in the context of the reprehensibility guidepost only.  The failure of the company to report the Texas award is out-of-state conduct that, if the conduct were similar, might have had some bearing on the degree of reprehensibility, subject to the limitations we have described.  Here, it was dissimilar, and of such marginal relevance that it should have been accorded little or no weight.  The award was rendered in a first-party lawsuit; no judgment was entered in the case; and it was later settled for a fraction of the verdict.  With respect to the Utah Supreme Courts second justification, the Campbells inability to direct us to testimony demonstrating harm to the people of Utah (other than those directly involved in this case) indicates that the adverse effect on the States general population was in fact minor.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The remaining premises for the Utah Supreme Courts decision bear no relation to the awards reasonableness or proportionality to the harm.  They are, rather, arguments that seek to defend a departure from well-established constraints on punitive damages.  While States enjoy considerable discretion in deducing when punitive damages are warranted, each award must comport with the principles set forth in 
				<em>
					Gore
				</em>
				.  Here the argument that State Farm will be punished in only the rare case, coupled with reference to its assets (which, of course, are what other insured parties in Utah and other States must rely upon for payment of claims) had little to do with the actual harm sustained by the Campbells.  The wealth of a defendant cannot justify an otherwise unconstitutional punitive damages award.

					Gore

				The third guidepost in 
				<em>
					Gore
				</em>
				 is the disparity between the punitive damages award and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases.  
				<em>
					Id.,

				 at 575.  We note that, in the past, we have also looked to criminal penalties that could be imposed.  
				<em>
					Id.

				, at 583; 
				<em>
					Haslip
				</em>
				, 499 U. S., at 23.  The existence of a criminal penalty does have bearing on the seriousness with which a State views the wrongful action.  When used to determine the dollar amount of the award, however, the criminal penalty has less utility.  Great care must be taken to avoid use of the civil process to assess criminal penalties that can be imposed only after the heightened protections of a criminal trial have been observed, including, of course, its higher standards of proof.  Punitive damages are not a substitute for the criminal process, and the remote possibility of a criminal sanction does not automatically sustain a punitive damages award.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Here, we need not dwell long on this guidepost.  The most relevant civil sanction under Utah state law for the wrong done to the Campbells appears to be a $10,000 fine for an act of fraud, ___ P. 3d, at ___, 2001 WL 1246676, at *17, an amount dwarfed by the $145 million punitive damages award.  The Supreme Court of Utah speculated about the loss of State Farms business license, the disgorgement of profits, and possible imprisonment, but here again its references were to the broad fraudulent scheme drawn from evidence of out-of-state and dissimilar conduct.  This analysis was insufficient to justify the award.

				An application of the

The punitive award of $145 million, therefore, was neither reasonable nor proportionate to the wrong committed, and it was an irrational and arbitrary deprivation of the property of the defendant.  The proper calculation of punitive damages under the principles we have discussed should be resolved, in the first instance, by the Utah courts.

				We address once again the measure of punishment, by means of punitive damages, a State may impose upon a defendant in a civil case.  The question is whether, in the circumstances we shall recount, an award of $145 million in punitive damages, where full compensatory damages are $1 million, is excessive and in violation of the Due Process Clause of the

				In 1981, Curtis Campbell (Campbell) was driving with his wife, Inez Preece Campbell, in Cache County, Utah.  He decided to pass six vans traveling ahead of them on a two-lane highway.  Todd Ospital was driving a small car approaching from the opposite direction.  To avoid a head-on collision with Campbell, who by then was driving on the wrong side of the highway and toward oncoming traffic, Ospital swerved onto the shoulder, lost control of his automobile, and collided with a vehicle driven by Robert G. Slusher.  Ospital was killed, and Slusher was rendered permanently disabled.  The Campbells escaped unscathed.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In the ensuing wrongful death and tort action, Campbell insisted he was not at fault.  Early investigations did support differing conclusions as to who caused the accident, but a consensus was reached early on by the investigators and witnesses that Mr. Campbells unsafe pass had indeed caused the crash.  ___ P. 3d ___, 2001 WL 1246676, *1 (Utah, Oct. 19, 2001).  Campbells insurance company, petitioner State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (State Farm), nonetheless decided to contest liability and declined offers by Slusher and Ospitals estate (Ospital) to settle the claims for the policy limit of $50,000 ($25,000 per claimant).  State Farm also ignored the advice of one of its own investigators and took the case to trial, assuring the Campbells that their assets were safe, that they had no liability for the accident, that [State Farm] would represent their interests, and that they did not need to procure separate counsel.

				., at ___, 2001 WL 1246676, at *2.  To the contrary, a jury determined that Campbell was 100 percent at fault, and a judgment was returned for $185,849, far more than the amount offered in settlement.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				At first State Farm refused to cover the $135,849 in excess liability.  Its counsel made this clear to the Campbells:  You may want to put for sale signs on your property to get things moving.   
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  Nor was State Farm willing to post a supersedeas bond to allow Campbell to appeal the judgment against him.  Campbell obtained his own counsel to appeal the verdict.  During the pendency of the appeal, in late 1984, Slusher, Ospital, and the Campbells reached an agreement whereby Slusher and Ospital agreed not to seek satisfaction of their claims against the Campbells.  In exchange the Campbells agreed to pursue a bad faith action against State Farm and to be represented by Slushers and Ospitals attorneys.  The Campbells also agreed that Slusher and Ospital would have a right to play a part in all major decisions concerning the bad faith action.  No settlement could be concluded without Slushers and Ospitals approval, and Slusher and Ospital would receive 90 percent of any verdict against State Farm.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In 1989, the Utah Supreme Court denied Campbells appeal in the wrongful death and tort actions.  
				<em>
					Slusher 
				</em>
				v.
				<em>
					 Ospital
				</em>
				, 777 P. 2d 437.  State Farm then paid the entire judgment, including the amounts in excess of the policy limits.  The Campbells nonetheless filed a complaint against State Farm alleging bad faith, fraud, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.  The trial court initially granted State Farms motion for summary judgment because State Farm had paid the excess verdict, but that ruling was reversed on appeal.  840 P. 2d 130 (Utah App. 1992).  On remand State Farm moved 
				<em>
					in limine
				</em>
				 to exclude evidence of alleged conduct that occurred in unrelated cases outside of Utah, but the trial court denied the motion.  At State Farms request the trial court bifurcated the trial into two phases conducted before different juries.  In the first phase the jury determined that State Farms decision not to settle was unreasonable because there was a substantial likelihood of an excess verdict.

, and refused to sustain a $2 million punitive damages award which accompanied a verdict of only $4,000 in compensatory damages.  Based on that decision, State Farm again moved for the exclusion of evidence of dissimilar out-of-state conduct.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 168a172a.  The trial court denied State Farms motion.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The second phase addressed State Farms liability for fraud and intentional infliction of emotional distress, as well as compensatory and punitive damages.  The Utah Supreme Court aptly characterized this phase of the trial:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				State Farm argued during phase II that its decision to take the case to trial was an honest mistake that did not warrant punitive damages.  In contrast, the Campbells introduced evidence that State Farms decision to take the case to trial was a result of a national scheme to meet corporate fiscal goals by capping payouts on claims company wide.  This scheme was referred to as State Farms Performance, Planning and Review, or PP &amp; R, policy.  To prove the existence of this scheme, the trial court allowed the Campbells to introduce extensive expert testimony regarding fraudulent practices by State Farm in its nation-wide operations.  Although State Farm moved prior to phase II of the trial for the exclusion of such evidence and continued to object to it at trial, the trial court ruled that such evidence was admissible to determine whether State Farms conduct in the Campbell case was indeed intentional and sufficiently egregious to warrant punitive damages.  ___ P. 3d, at ___, 2001 WL 1246676, at *3.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
Evidence pertaining to the PP&amp;R policy concerned State Farms business practices for over 20 years in numerous States.  Most of these practices bore no relation to third-party automobile insurance claims, the type of claim underlying the Campbells complaint against the company.  The jury awarded the Campbells $2.6 million in compensatory damages and $145 million in punitive damages, which the trial court reduced to $1 million and $25 million respectively.  Both parties appealed.

				The Utah Supreme Court sought to apply the three guideposts we identified in 
				<em>
					Gore
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra,
				</em>
				 at 574575, and it reinstated the $145 million punitive damages award.  Relying in large part on the extensive evidence concerning the PP&amp;R policy, the court concluded State Farms conduct was reprehensible.  The court also relied upon State Farms massive wealth and on testimony indicating that State Farms actions, because of their clandestine nature, will be punished at most in one out of every 50,000 cases as a matter of statistical probability, ___ P. 3d, at ___, 2001 WL 1246676, at *15, and concluded that the ratio between punitive and compensatory damages was not unwarranted.  Finally, the court noted that the punitive damages award was not excessive when compared to various civil and criminal penalties State Farm could have faced, including $10,000 for each act of fraud, the suspension of its license to conduct business in Utah, the disgorgement of profits, and imprisonment.

				Although these awards serve the same purposes as criminal penalties, defendants subjected to punitive damages in civil cases have not been accorded the protections applicable in a criminal proceeding.  This increases our concerns over the imprecise manner in which punitive damages systems are administered.  We have admonished that [p]unitive damages pose an acute danger of arbitrary deprivation of property.  Jury instructions typically leave the jury with wide discretion in choosing amounts, and the presentation of evidence of a defendants net worth creates the potential that juries will use their verdicts to express biases against big businesses, particularly those without strong local presences.

Indeed, the point of due processof the law in generalis to allow citizens to order their behavior.  A State can have no legitimate interest in deliberately making the law so arbitrary that citizens will be unable to avoid punishment based solely upon bias or whim).  Our concerns are heightened when the decisionmaker is presented, as we shall discuss, with evidence that has little bearing as to the amount of punitive damages that should be awarded.  Vague instructions, or those that merely inform the jury to avoid passion or prejudice, App. to Pet. for Cert. 108a109a, do little to aid the decisionmaker in its task of assigning appropriate weight to evidence that is relevant and evidence that is tangential or only inflammatory.

				In light of these concerns, in 
				<em>
					Gore
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, we instructed courts reviewing punitive damages to consider three guideposts: (1) the degree of reprehensibility of the defendants misconduct; (2) the disparity between the actual or potential harm suffered by the plaintiff and the punitive damages award; and (3) the difference between the punitive damages awarded by the jury and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases.  
				<em>

				 and mandated appellate courts to conduct

				 review of a trial courts application of them to the jurys award.  532 U. S., at 424.  Exacting appellate review ensures that an award of punitive damages is based upon an  application of law, rather than a decisionmakers caprice. 

				[T]he most important indicium of the reasonableness of a punitive damages award is the degree of reprehensibility of the defendants conduct.  
				<em>
					Gore
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 575.  We have instructed courts to determine the reprehensibility of a defendant by considering whether: the harm caused was physical as opposed to economic; the tortious conduct evinced an indifference to or a reckless disregard of the health or safety of others; the target of the conduct had financial vulnerability; the conduct involved repeated actions or was an isolated incident; and the harm was the result of intentional malice, trickery, or deceit, or mere accident.  517 U. S., at 576577.  The existence of any one of these factors weighing in favor of a plaintiff may not be sufficient to sustain a punitive damages award; and the absence of all of them renders any award suspect.  It should be presumed a plaintiff has been made whole for his injuries by compensatory damages, so punitive damages should only be awarded if the defendants culpability, after having paid compensatory damages, is so reprehensible as to warrant the imposition of further sanctions to achieve punishment or deterrence.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 575.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Applying these factors in the instant case, we must acknowledge that State Farms handling of the claims against the Campbells merits no praise.  The trial court found that State Farms employees altered the companys records to make Campbell appear less culpable.  State Farm disregarded the overwhelming likelihood of liability and the near-certain probability that, by taking the case to trial, a judgment in excess of the policy limits would be awarded.  State Farm amplified the harm by at first assuring the Campbells their assets would be safe from any verdict and by later telling them, postjudgment, to put a for-sale sign on their house.  While we do not suggest there was error in awarding punitive damages based upon State Farms conduct toward the Campbells, a more modest punishment for this reprehensible conduct could have satisfied the States legitimate objectives, and the Utah courts should have gone no further.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				This case, instead, was used as a platform to expose, and punish, the perceived deficiencies of State Farms operations throughout the country.  The Utah Supreme Courts opinion makes explicit that State Farm was being condemned for its nationwide policies rather than for the conduct direct toward the Campbells.  ___ P. 3d, at ___, 2001 WL 1246676, at *3 ([T]he Campbells introduced evidence that State Farms decision to take the case to trial was a result of a national scheme to meet corporate fiscal goals by capping payouts on claims company wide).  This was, as well, an explicit rationale of the trial courts decision in approving the award, though reduced from $145 million to $25 million.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 120a ([T]he Campbells demonstrated, through the testimony of State Farm employees who had worked outside of Utah, and through expert testimony, that this pattern of claims adjustment under the PP&amp;R program was not a local anomaly, but was a consistent, nationwide feature of State Farms business operations, orchestrated from the highest levels of corporate management).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Campbells contend that State Farm has only itself to blame for the reliance upon dissimilar and out-of-state conduct evidence.  The record does not support this contention.  From their opening statements onward the Campbells framed this case as a chance to rebuke State Farm for its nationwide activities.  App. 208 (Youre going to hear evidence that even the insurance commission in Utah and around the country are unwilling or inept at protecting people against abuses); 
				<em>
					id.

				, at 242 ([T]his is a very important case. . . .  [I]t transcends the Campbell file.  It involves a nationwide practice.  And you, here, are going to be evaluating and assessing, and hopefully requiring State Farm to stand accountable for what its doing across the country, which is the purpose of punitive damages).  This was a position maintained throughout the litigation.  In opposing State Farms motion to exclude such evidence under 
				<em>
					Gore
				</em>
				, the Campbells counsel convinced the trial court that there was no limitation on the scope of evidence that could be considered under our precedents.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 172a (As I read the case [

				Here, the Campbells do not dispute that much of the out-of-state conduct was lawful where it occurred.  They argue, however, that such evidence was not the primary basis for the punitive damages award and was relevant to the extent it demonstrated, in a general sense, State Farms motive against its insured.  Brief for Respondents 4647 ([E]ven if the practices described by State Farm were not malum in se or malum prohibitum, they became relevant to punitive damages to the extent they were used as tools to implement State Farms wrongful PP&amp;R policy).  This argument misses the mark.  Lawful out-of-state conduct may be probative when it demonstrates the deliberateness and culpability of the defendants action in the State where it is tortious, but that conduct must have a nexus to the specific harm suffered by the plaintiff.  A jury must be instructed, furthermore, that it may not use evidence of out-of-state conduct to punish a defendant for action that was lawful in the jurisdiction where it occurred.

				For a more fundamental reason, however, the Utah courts erred in relying upon this and other evidence: The courts awarded punitive damages to punish and deter conduct that bore no relation to the Campbells harm.
				  
				A defendants dissimilar acts, independent from the acts upon which liability was premised, may not serve as the basis for punitive damages.  A defendant should be punished for the conduct that harmed the plaintiff, not for being an unsavory individual or business.  Due process does not permit courts, in the calculation of punitive damages, to adjudicate the merits of other parties hypothetical claims against a defendant under the guise of the reprehensibility analysis, but we have no doubt the Utah Supreme Court did that here.  __ P. 3d, at __, 2001 WL 1246676, at *11 (Even if the harm to the Campbells can be appropriately characterized as minimal, the trial courts assessment of the situation is on target: The harm is minor to the individual but massive in the aggregate ).  Punishment on these bases creates the possibility of multiple punitive damages awards for the same conduct; for in the usual case nonparties are not bound by the judgment some other plaintiff obtains.

				The same reasons lead us to conclude the Utah Supreme Courts decision cannot be justified on the grounds that State Farm was a recidivist.

				The Campbells have identified scant evidence of repeated misconduct of the sort that injured them.  Nor does our review of the Utah courts decisions convince us that State Farm was only punished for its actions toward the Campbells.  Although evidence of other acts need not be identical to have relevance in the calculation of punitive damages, the Utah court erred here because evidence pertaining to claims that had nothing to do with a third-party lawsuit was introduced at length.  Other evidence concerning reprehensibility was even more tangential.  For example, the Utah Supreme Court criticized State Farms investigation into the personal life of one of its employees and, in a broader approach, the manner in which State Farms policies corrupted its employees.  ___ P. 3d, at ___, 2001 WL 1246676, at *10; 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at ___, 2001 WL 1246676, at *12.  The Campbells attempt to justify the courts reliance upon this unrelated testimony on the theory that each dollar of profit made by underpaying a third-party claimant is the same as a dollar made by underpaying a first-party one.  Brief for Respondents 45; see also ___ P. 3d, at ___, 2001 WL 1246676, at *12 (State Farms continuing illicit practice created market disadvantages for other honest insurance companies because these practices increased profits.  As plaintiffs expert witnesses established, such wrongfully obtained competitive advantages have the potential to pressure other companies to adopt similar fraudulent tactics, or to force them out of business.  Thus, such actions cause distortions throughout the insurance market and ultimately hurt all consumers).  For the reasons already stated, this argument is unconvincing.  The reprehensibility guidepost does not permit courts to expand the scope of the case so that a defendant may be punished for any malfeasance, which in this case extended for a 20-year period.  In this case, because the Campbells have shown no conduct by State Farm similar to that which harmed them, the conduct that harmed them is the only conduct relevant to the reprehensibility analysis.

				Turning to the second 
				<em>
					Gore
				</em>
				 guidepost, we have been reluctant to identify concrete constitutional limits on the ratio between harm, or potential harm, to the plaintiff and the punitive damages award.  
				<em>
					Gore
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 582 ([W]e have consistently rejected the notion that the constitutional line is marked by a simple mathematical formula, even one that compares actual 
				<em>
					and potential
				</em>
				 damages to the punitive award); 
				<em>
					TXO
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra,
				</em>
				 at 458.  We decline again to impose a bright-line ratio which a punitive damages award cannot exceed.  Our jurisprudence and the principles it has now established demonstrate, however, that, in practice, few awards exceeding a single-digit ratio between punitive and compensatory damages, to a significant degree, will satisfy due process.  In 
				<em>
					Haslip
				</em>
				, in upholding a punitive damages award, we concluded that an award of more than four times the amount of compensatory damages might be close to the line of constitutional impropriety.  499 U. S., at 2324.  We cited that 4-to-1 ratio again in 
				<em>
					Gore
				</em>
				.  517 U. S., at 581.  The Court further referenced a long legislative history, dating back over 700 years and going forward to today, providing for sanctions of double, treble, or quadruple damages to deter and punish.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 581, and n. 33.  While these ratios are not binding, they are instructive.  They demonstrate what should be obvious: Single-digit multipliers are more likely to comport with due process, while still achieving the States goals of deterrence and retribution, than awards with ratios in range of 500 to 1, 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 582, or, in this case, of 145 to 1.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Nonetheless, because there are no rigid benchmarks that a punitive damages award may not surpass, ratios greater than those we have previously upheld may comport with due process where a particularly egregious act has resulted in only a small amount of economic damages.  
				<em>
					Ibid.;
				</em>
				 see also 
				<em>
					ibid. 
				</em>
				(positing that a higher ratio 
				<em>
					might
				</em>
				 be necessary where the injury is hard to detect or the monetary value of noneconomic harm might have been difficult to determine).  The converse is also true, however.  When compensatory damages are substantial, then a lesser ratio, perhaps only equal to compensatory damages, can reach the outermost limit of the due process guarantee.  The precise award in any case, of course, must be based upon the facts and circumstances of the defendants conduct and the harm to the plaintiff.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In sum, courts must ensure that the measure of punishment is both reasonable and proportionate to the amount of harm to the plaintiff and to the general damages recovered.  In the context of this case, we have no doubt that there is a presumption against an award that has a 145-to-1 ratio.  The compensatory award in this case was substantial; the Campbells were awarded $1 million for a year and a half of emotional distress.  This was complete compensation.  The harm arose from a transaction in the economic realm, not from some physical assault or trauma; there were no physical injuries; and State Farm paid the excess verdict before the complaint was filed, so the Campbells suffered only minor economic injuries for the 18-month period in which State Farm refused to resolve the claim against them.  The compensatory damages for the injury suffered here, moreover, likely were based on a component which was duplicated in the punitive award.  Much of the distress was caused by the outrage and humiliation the Campbells suffered at the actions of their insurer; and it is a major role of punitive damages to condemn such conduct.  Compensatory damages, however, already contain this punitive element.  See Restatement (Second) of Torts §908, Comment 
				<em>
					c,
				</em>
				 p. 466 (1977) (In many cases in which compensatory damages include an amount for emotional distress, such as humiliation or indignation aroused by the defendants act, there is no clear line of demarcation between punishment and compensation and a verdict for a specified amount frequently includes elements of both).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Utah Supreme Court sought to justify the massive award by pointing to State Farms purported failure to report a prior $100 million punitive damages award in Texas to its corporate headquarters; the fact that State Farms policies have affected numerous Utah consumers; the fact that State Farm will only be punished in one out of every 50,000 cases as a matter of statistical probability; and State Farms enormous wealth.  ___ P. 3d, at ___, 2001 WL 1246676, at *15.  Since the Supreme Court of Utah discussed the Texas award when applying the ratio guidepost, we discuss it here.  The Texas award, however, should have been analyzed in the context of the reprehensibility guidepost only.  The failure of the company to report the Texas award is out-of-state conduct that, if the conduct were similar, might have had some bearing on the degree of reprehensibility, subject to the limitations we have described.  Here, it was dissimilar, and of such marginal relevance that it should have been accorded little or no weight.  The award was rendered in a first-party lawsuit; no judgment was entered in the case; and it was later settled for a fraction of the verdict.  With respect to the Utah Supreme Courts second justification, the Campbells inability to direct us to testimony demonstrating harm to the people of Utah (other than those directly involved in this case) indicates that the adverse effect on the States general population was in fact minor.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The remaining premises for the Utah Supreme Courts decision bear no relation to the awards reasonableness or proportionality to the harm.  They are, rather, arguments that seek to defend a departure from well-established constraints on punitive damages.  While States enjoy considerable discretion in deducing when punitive damages are warranted, each award must comport with the principles set forth in 
				<em>
					Gore
				</em>
				.  Here the argument that State Farm will be punished in only the rare case, coupled with reference to its assets (which, of course, are what other insured parties in Utah and other States must rely upon for payment of claims) had little to do with the actual harm sustained by the Campbells.  The wealth of a defendant cannot justify an otherwise unconstitutional punitive damages award.  
				<em>
					Gore
				</em>
				, 517 U. S., at 585 (The fact that BMW is a large corporation rather than an impecunious individual does not diminish its entitlement to fair notice of the demands that the several States impose on the conduct of its business); see also

				, at 591 (

				, J., concurring) ([Wealth] provides an open-ended basis for inflating awards when the defendant is wealthy … .  That does not make its use unlawful or inappropriate; it simply means that this factor cannot make up for the failure of other factors, such as reprehensibility, to constrain significantly an award that purports to punish a defendants conduct).  The principles set forth in 
				<em>

				</em>
				must be implemented with care, to ensure both reasonableness and proportionality.

				The third guidepost in 
				<em>
					Gore
				</em>
				 is the disparity between the punitive damages award and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 575.  We note that, in the past, we have also looked to criminal penalties that could be imposed.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 583; 
				<em>
					Haslip
				</em>
				, 499 U. S., at 23.  The existence of a criminal penalty does have bearing on the seriousness with which a State views the wrongful action.  When used to determine the dollar amount of the award, however, the criminal penalty has less utility.  Great care must be taken to avoid use of the civil process to assess criminal penalties that can be imposed only after the heightened protections of a criminal trial have been observed, including, of course, its higher standards of proof.  Punitive damages are not a substitute for the criminal process, and the remote possibility of a criminal sanction does not automatically sustain a punitive damages award.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Here, we need not dwell long on this guidepost.  The most relevant civil sanction under Utah state law for the wrong done to the Campbells appears to be a $10,000 fine for an act of fraud, ___ P. 3d, at ___, 2001 WL 1246676, at *17, an amount dwarfed by the $145 million punitive damages award.  The Supreme Court of Utah speculated about the loss of State Farms business license, the disgorgement of profits, and possible imprisonment, but here again its references were to the broad fraudulent scheme drawn from evidence of out-of-state and dissimilar conduct.  This analysis was insufficient to justify the award.

				An application of the 
				<em>
					Gore
				</em>
				 guideposts to the facts of this case, especially in light of the substantial compensatory damages awarded (a portion of which contained a punitive element), likely would justify a punitive damages award at or near the amount of compensatory damages.  The punitive award of $145 million, therefore, was neither reasonable nor proportionate to the wrong committed, and it was an irrational and arbitrary deprivation of the property of the defendant.  The proper calculation of punitive damages under the principles we have discussed should be resolved, in the first instance, by the Utah courts.

				We address once again the measure of punishment, by means of punitive damages, a State may impose upon a defendant in a civil case.  The question is whether, in the circumstances we shall recount, an award of $145 million in punitive damages, where full compensatory damages are $1 million, is excessive and in violation of the Due Process Clause of the

				In 1981, Curtis Campbell (Campbell) was driving with his wife, Inez Preece Campbell, in Cache County, Utah.  He decided to pass six vans traveling ahead of them on a two-lane highway.  Todd Ospital was driving a small car approaching from the opposite direction.  To avoid a head-on collision with Campbell, who by then was driving on the wrong side of the highway and toward oncoming traffic, Ospital swerved onto the shoulder, lost control of his automobile, and collided with a vehicle driven by Robert G. Slusher.  Ospital was killed, and Slusher was rendered permanently disabled.  The Campbells escaped unscathed.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In the ensuing wrongful death and tort action, Campbell insisted he was not at fault.  Early investigations did support differing conclusions as to who caused the accident, but a consensus was reached early on by the investigators and witnesses that Mr. Campbells unsafe pass had indeed caused the crash.  ___ P. 3d ___, 2001 WL 1246676, *1 (Utah, Oct. 19, 2001).  Campbells insurance company, petitioner State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (State Farm), nonetheless decided to contest liability and declined offers by Slusher and Ospitals estate (Ospital) to settle the claims for the policy limit of $50,000 ($25,000 per claimant).  State Farm also ignored the advice of one of its own investigators and took the case to trial, assuring the Campbells that their assets were safe, that they had no liability for the accident, that [State Farm] would represent their interests, and that they did not need to procure separate counsel.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at ___, 2001 WL 1246676, at *2.  To the contrary, a jury determined that Campbell was 100 percent at fault, and a judgment was returned for $185,849, far more than the amount offered in settlement.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				At first State Farm refused to cover the $135,849 in excess liability.  Its counsel made this clear to the Campbells:  You may want to put for sale signs on your property to get things moving.   
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  Nor was State Farm willing to post a supersedeas bond to allow Campbell to appeal the judgment against him.  Campbell obtained his own counsel to appeal the verdict.  During the pendency of the appeal, in late 1984, Slusher, Ospital, and the Campbells reached an agreement whereby Slusher and Ospital agreed not to seek satisfaction of their claims against the Campbells.  In exchange the Campbells agreed to pursue a bad faith action against State Farm and to be represented by Slushers and Ospitals attorneys.  The Campbells also agreed that Slusher and Ospital would have a right to play a part in all major decisions concerning the bad faith action.  No settlement could be concluded without Slushers and Ospitals approval, and Slusher and Ospital would receive 90 percent of any verdict against State Farm.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In 1989, the Utah Supreme Court denied Campbells appeal in the wrongful death and tort actions.  
				<em>
					Slusher 
				</em>
				v.
				<em>
					 Ospital
				</em>
				, 777 P. 2d 437.  State Farm then paid the entire judgment, including the amounts in excess of the policy limits.  The Campbells nonetheless filed a complaint against State Farm alleging bad faith, fraud, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.  The trial court initially granted State Farms motion for summary judgment because State Farm had paid the excess verdict, but that ruling was reversed on appeal.  840 P. 2d 130 (Utah App. 1992).  On remand State Farm moved 
				<em>
					in limine
				</em>
				 to exclude evidence of alleged conduct that occurred in unrelated cases outside of Utah, but the trial court denied the motion.  At State Farms request the trial court bifurcated the trial into two phases conducted before different juries.  In the first phase the jury determined that State Farms decision not to settle was unreasonable because there was a substantial likelihood of an excess verdict.

, and refused to sustain a $2 million punitive damages award which accompanied a verdict of only $4,000 in compensatory damages.  Based on that decision, State Farm again moved for the exclusion of evidence of dissimilar out-of-state conduct.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 168a172a.  The trial court denied State Farms motion.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The second phase addressed State Farms liability for fraud and intentional infliction of emotional distress, as well as compensatory and punitive damages.  The Utah Supreme Court aptly characterized this phase of the trial:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				State Farm argued during phase II that its decision to take the case to trial was an honest mistake that did not warrant punitive damages.  In contrast, the Campbells introduced evidence that State Farms decision to take the case to trial was a result of a national scheme to meet corporate fiscal goals by capping payouts on claims company wide.  This scheme was referred to as State Farms Performance, Planning and Review, or PP &amp; R, policy.  To prove the existence of this scheme, the trial court allowed the Campbells to introduce extensive expert testimony regarding fraudulent practices by State Farm in its nation-wide operations.  Although State Farm moved prior to phase II of the trial for the exclusion of such evidence and continued to object to it at trial, the trial court ruled that such evidence was admissible to determine whether State Farms conduct in the Campbell case was indeed intentional and sufficiently egregious to warrant punitive damages.  ___ P. 3d, at ___, 2001 WL 1246676, at *3.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
Evidence pertaining to the PP&amp;R policy concerned State Farms business practices for over 20 years in numerous States.  Most of these practices bore no relation to third-party automobile insurance claims, the type of claim underlying the Campbells complaint against the company.  The jury awarded the Campbells $2.6 million in compensatory damages and $145 million in punitive damages, which the trial court reduced to $1 million and $25 million respectively.  Both parties appealed.

				 at 574575, and it reinstated the $145 million punitive damages award.  Relying in large part on the extensive evidence concerning the PP&amp;R policy, the court concluded State Farms conduct was reprehensible.  The court also relied upon State Farms massive wealth and on testimony indicating that State Farms actions, because of their clandestine nature, will be punished at most in one out of every 50,000 cases as a matter of statistical probability, ___ P. 3d, at ___, 2001 WL 1246676, at *15, and concluded that the ratio between punitive and compensatory damages was not unwarranted.  Finally, the court noted that the punitive damages award was not excessive when compared to various civil and criminal penalties State Farm could have faced, including $10,000 for each act of fraud, the suspension of its license to conduct business in Utah, the disgorgement of profits, and imprisonment.

				Although these awards serve the same purposes as criminal penalties, defendants subjected to punitive damages in civil cases have not been accorded the protections applicable in a criminal proceeding.

We have admonished that [p]unitive damages pose an acute danger of arbitrary deprivation of property.  Jury instructions typically leave the jury with wide discretion in choosing amounts, and the presentation of evidence of a defendants net worth creates the potential that juries will use their verdicts to express biases against big businesses, particularly those without strong local presences.

				[T]he most important indicium of the reasonableness of a punitive damages award is the degree of reprehensibility of the defendants conduct.  
				<em>
					Gore
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 575.  We have instructed courts to determine the reprehensibility of a defendant by considering whether: the harm caused was physical as opposed to economic; the tortious conduct evinced an indifference to or a reckless disregard of the health or safety of others; the target of the conduct had financial vulnerability; the conduct involved repeated actions or was an isolated incident; and the harm was the result of intentional malice, trickery, or deceit, or mere accident.  517 U. S., at 576577.  The existence of any one of these factors weighing in favor of a plaintiff may not be sufficient to sustain a punitive damages award; and the absence of all of them renders any award suspect.  It should be presumed a plaintiff has been made whole for his injuries by compensatory damages, so punitive damages should only be awarded if the defendants culpability, after having paid compensatory damages, is so reprehensible as to warrant the imposition of further sanctions to achieve punishment or deterrence.

				Applying these factors in the instant case, we must acknowledge that State Farms handling of the claims against the Campbells merits no praise.  The trial court found that State Farms employees altered the companys records to make Campbell appear less culpable.  State Farm disregarded the overwhelming likelihood of liability and the near-certain probability that, by taking the case to trial, a judgment in excess of the policy limits would be awarded.  State Farm amplified the harm by at first assuring the Campbells their assets would be safe from any verdict and by later telling them, postjudgment, to put a for-sale sign on their house.  While we do not suggest there was error in awarding punitive damages based upon State Farms conduct toward the Campbells, a more modest punishment for this reprehensible conduct could have satisfied the States legitimate objectives, and the Utah courts should have gone no further.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				This case, instead, was used as a platform to expose, and punish, the perceived deficiencies of State Farms operations throughout the country.  The Utah Supreme Courts opinion makes explicit that State Farm was being condemned for its nationwide policies rather than for the conduct direct toward the Campbells.  ___ P. 3d, at ___, 2001 WL 1246676, at *3 ([T]he Campbells introduced evidence that State Farms decision to take the case to trial was a result of a national scheme to meet corporate fiscal goals by capping payouts on claims company wide).  This was, as well, an explicit rationale of the trial courts decision in approving the award, though reduced from $145 million to $25 million.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 120a ([T]he Campbells demonstrated, through the testimony of State Farm employees who had worked outside of Utah, and through expert testimony, that this pattern of claims adjustment under the PP&amp;R program was not a local anomaly, but was a consistent, nationwide feature of State Farms business operations, orchestrated from the highest levels of corporate management).

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Campbells contend that State Farm has only itself to blame for the reliance upon dissimilar and out-of-state conduct evidence.  The record does not support this contention.  From their opening statements onward the Campbells framed this case as a chance to rebuke State Farm for its nationwide activities.  App. 208 (Youre going to hear evidence that even the insurance commission in Utah and around the country are unwilling or inept at protecting people against abuses);

				Here, the Campbells do not dispute that much of the out-of-state conduct was lawful where it occurred.  They argue, however, that such evidence was not the primary basis for the punitive damages award and was relevant to the extent it demonstrated, in a general sense, State Farms motive against its insured.  Brief for Respondents 4647 ([E]ven if the practices described by State Farm were not malum in se or malum prohibitum, they became relevant to punitive damages to the extent they were used as tools to implement State Farms wrongful PP&amp;R policy).  This argument misses the mark.  Lawful out-of-state conduct may be probative when it demonstrates the deliberateness and culpability of the defendants action in the State where it is tortious, but that conduct must have a nexus to the specific harm suffered by the plaintiff.  A jury must be instructed, furthermore, that it may not use evidence of out-of-state conduct to punish a defendant for action that was lawful in the jurisdiction where it occurred.

				For a more fundamental reason, however, the Utah courts erred in relying upon this and other evidence: The courts awarded punitive damages to punish and deter conduct that bore no relation to the Campbells harm.
				  
				A defendants dissimilar acts, independent from the acts upon which liability was premised, may not serve as the basis for punitive damages.  A defendant should be punished for the conduct that harmed the plaintiff, not for being an unsavory individual or business.  Due process does not permit courts, in the calculation of punitive damages, to adjudicate the merits of other parties hypothetical claims against a defendant under the guise of the reprehensibility analysis, but we have no doubt the Utah Supreme Court did that here.  __ P. 3d, at __, 2001 WL 1246676, at *11 (Even if the harm to the Campbells can be appropriately characterized as minimal, the trial courts assessment of the situation is on target: The harm is minor to the individual but massive in the aggregate ).  Punishment on these bases creates the possibility of multiple punitive damages awards for the same conduct; for in the usual case nonparties are not bound by the judgment some other plaintiff obtains.

				The same reasons lead us to conclude the Utah Supreme Courts decision cannot be justified on the grounds that State Farm was a recidivist.

				The Campbells have identified scant evidence of repeated misconduct of the sort that injured them.  Nor does our review of the Utah courts decisions convince us that State Farm was only punished for its actions toward the Campbells.  Although evidence of other acts need not be identical to have relevance in the calculation of punitive damages, the Utah court erred here because evidence pertaining to claims that had nothing to do with a third-party lawsuit was introduced at length.  Other evidence concerning reprehensibility was even more tangential.  For example, the Utah Supreme Court criticized State Farms investigation into the personal life of one of its employees and, in a broader approach, the manner in which State Farms policies corrupted its employees.  ___ P. 3d, at ___, 2001 WL 1246676, at *10; 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at ___, 2001 WL 1246676, at *12.  The Campbells attempt to justify the courts reliance upon this unrelated testimony on the theory that each dollar of profit made by underpaying a third-party claimant is the same as a dollar made by underpaying a first-party one.  Brief for Respondents 45; see also ___ P. 3d, at ___, 2001 WL 1246676, at *12 (State Farms continuing illicit practice created market disadvantages for other honest insurance companies because these practices increased profits.  As plaintiffs expert witnesses established, such wrongfully obtained competitive advantages have the potential to pressure other companies to adopt similar fraudulent tactics, or to force them out of business.  Thus, such actions cause distortions throughout the insurance market and ultimately hurt all consumers).  For the reasons already stated, this argument is unconvincing.  The reprehensibility guidepost does not permit courts to expand the scope of the case so that a defendant may be punished for any malfeasance, which in this case extended for a 20-year period.  In this case, because the Campbells have shown no conduct by State Farm similar to that which harmed them, the conduct that harmed them is the only conduct relevant to the reprehensibility analysis.

				Turning to the second 
				<em>
					Gore
				</em>
				 guidepost, we have been reluctant to identify concrete constitutional limits on the ratio between harm, or potential harm, to the plaintiff and the punitive damages award.  
				<em>
					Gore
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 582 ([W]e have consistently rejected the notion that the constitutional line is marked by a simple mathematical formula, even one that compares actual 
				<em>

				</em>
				 damages to the punitive award); 
				<em>
					TXO
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra,
				</em>
				 at 458.  We decline again to impose a bright-line ratio which a punitive damages award cannot exceed.  Our jurisprudence and the principles it has now established demonstrate, however, that, in practice, few awards exceeding a single-digit ratio between punitive and compensatory damages, to a significant degree, will satisfy due process.  In 
				<em>
					Haslip
				</em>
				, in upholding a punitive damages award, we concluded that an award of more than four times the amount of compensatory damages might be close to the line of constitutional impropriety.  499 U. S., at 2324.  We cited that 4-to-1 ratio again in 
				<em>
					Gore
				</em>
				.  517 U. S., at 581.  The Court further referenced a long legislative history, dating back over 700 years and going forward to today, providing for sanctions of double, treble, or quadruple damages to deter and punish.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 581, and n. 33.  While these ratios are not binding, they are instructive.  They demonstrate what should be obvious: Single-digit multipliers are more likely to comport with due process, while still achieving the States goals of deterrence and retribution, than awards with ratios in range of 500 to 1, 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 582, or, in this case, of 145 to 1.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Nonetheless, because there are no rigid benchmarks that a punitive damages award may not surpass, ratios greater than those we have previously upheld may comport with due process where a particularly egregious act has resulted in only a small amount of economic damages.  
				<em>
					Ibid.;
				</em>
				 see also 
				<em>
					ibid. 
				</em>
				(positing that a higher ratio 
				<em>
					might
				</em>
				 be necessary where the injury is hard to detect or the monetary value of noneconomic harm might have been difficult to determine).  The converse is also true, however.  When compensatory damages are substantial, then a lesser ratio, perhaps only equal to compensatory damages, can reach the outermost limit of the due process guarantee.  The precise award in any case, of course, must be based upon the facts and circumstances of the defendants conduct and the harm to the plaintiff.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In sum, courts must ensure that the measure of punishment is both reasonable and proportionate to the amount of harm to the plaintiff and to the general damages recovered.  In the context of this case, we have no doubt that there is a presumption against an award that has a 145-to-1 ratio.  The compensatory award in this case was substantial; the Campbells were awarded $1 million for a year and a half of emotional distress.  This was complete compensation.  The harm arose from a transaction in the economic realm, not from some physical assault or trauma; there were no physical injuries; and State Farm paid the excess verdict before the complaint was filed, so the Campbells suffered only minor economic injuries for the 18-month period in which State Farm refused to resolve the claim against them.  The compensatory damages for the injury suffered here, moreover, likely were based on a component which was duplicated in the punitive award.  Much of the distress was caused by the outrage and humiliation the Campbells suffered at the actions of their insurer; and it is a major role of punitive damages to condemn such conduct.  Compensatory damages, however, already contain this punitive element.  See Restatement (Second) of Torts §908, Comment 
				<em>
					c,
				</em>
				 p. 466 (1977) (In many cases in which compensatory damages include an amount for emotional distress, such as humiliation or indignation aroused by the defendants act, there is no clear line of demarcation between punishment and compensation and a verdict for a specified amount frequently includes elements of both).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Utah Supreme Court sought to justify the massive award by pointing to State Farms purported failure to report a prior $100 million punitive damages award in Texas to its corporate headquarters; the fact that State Farms policies have affected numerous Utah consumers; the fact that State Farm will only be punished in one out of every 50,000 cases as a matter of statistical probability; and State Farms enormous wealth.  ___ P. 3d, at ___, 2001 WL 1246676, at *15.  Since the Supreme Court of Utah discussed the Texas award when applying the ratio guidepost, we discuss it here.  The Texas award, however, should have been analyzed in the context of the reprehensibility guidepost only.  The failure of the company to report the Texas award is out-of-state conduct that, if the conduct were similar, might have had some bearing on the degree of reprehensibility, subject to the limitations we have described.  Here, it was dissimilar, and of such marginal relevance that it should have been accorded little or no weight.  The award was rendered in a first-party lawsuit; no judgment was entered in the case; and it was later settled for a fraction of the verdict.  With respect to the Utah Supreme Courts second justification, the Campbells inability to direct us to testimony demonstrating harm to the people of Utah (other than those directly involved in this case) indicates that the adverse effect on the States general population was in fact minor.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The remaining premises for the Utah Supreme Courts decision bear no relation to the awards reasonableness or proportionality to the harm.  They are, rather, arguments that seek to defend a departure from well-established constraints on punitive damages.  While States enjoy considerable discretion in deducing when punitive damages are warranted, each award must comport with the principles set forth in 
				<em>
					Gore
				</em>
				.  Here the argument that State Farm will be punished in only the rare case, coupled with reference to its assets (which, of course, are what other insured parties in Utah and other States must rely upon for payment of claims) had little to do with the actual harm sustained by the Campbells.  The wealth of a defendant cannot justify an otherwise unconstitutional punitive damages award.

					Gore

				The third guidepost in 
				<em>
					Gore
				</em>
				 is the disparity between the punitive damages award and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases.  
				<em>
					Id.,

				 at 575.  We note that, in the past, we have also looked to criminal penalties that could be imposed.  
				<em>
					Id.

				, at 583; 
				<em>
					Haslip
				</em>
				, 499 U. S., at 23.  The existence of a criminal penalty does have bearing on the seriousness with which a State views the wrongful action.  When used to determine the dollar amount of the award, however, the criminal penalty has less utility.  Great care must be taken to avoid use of the civil process to assess criminal penalties that can be imposed only after the heightened protections of a criminal trial have been observed, including, of course, its higher standards of proof.  Punitive damages are not a substitute for the criminal process, and the remote possibility of a criminal sanction does not automatically sustain a punitive damages award.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Here, we need not dwell long on this guidepost.  The most relevant civil sanction under Utah state law for the wrong done to the Campbells appears to be a $10,000 fine for an act of fraud, ___ P. 3d, at ___, 2001 WL 1246676, at *17, an amount dwarfed by the $145 million punitive damages award.  The Supreme Court of Utah speculated about the loss of State Farms business license, the disgorgement of profits, and possible imprisonment, but here again its references were to the broad fraudulent scheme drawn from evidence of out-of-state and dissimilar conduct.  This analysis was insufficient to justify the award.

				An application of the

The punitive award of $145 million, therefore, was neither reasonable nor proportionate to the wrong committed, and it was an irrational and arbitrary deprivation of the property of the defendant.  The proper calculation of punitive damages under the principles we have discussed should be resolved, in the first instance, by the Utah courts.

				We address once again the measure of punishment, by means of punitive damages, a State may impose upon a defendant in a civil case.  The question is whether, in the circumstances we shall recount, an award of $145 million in punitive damages, where full compensatory damages are $1 million, is excessive and in violation of the Due Process Clause of the

				In 1981, Curtis Campbell (Campbell) was driving with his wife, Inez Preece Campbell, in Cache County, Utah.  He decided to pass six vans traveling ahead of them on a two-lane highway.  Todd Ospital was driving a small car approaching from the opposite direction.  To avoid a head-on collision with Campbell, who by then was driving on the wrong side of the highway and toward oncoming traffic, Ospital swerved onto the shoulder, lost control of his automobile, and collided with a vehicle driven by Robert G. Slusher.  Ospital was killed, and Slusher was rendered permanently disabled.  The Campbells escaped unscathed.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In the ensuing wrongful death and tort action, Campbell insisted he was not at fault.  Early investigations did support differing conclusions as to who caused the accident, but a consensus was reached early on by the investigators and witnesses that Mr. Campbells unsafe pass had indeed caused the crash.  ___ P. 3d ___, 2001 WL 1246676, *1 (Utah, Oct. 19, 2001).  Campbells insurance company, petitioner State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (State Farm), nonetheless decided to contest liability and declined offers by Slusher and Ospitals estate (Ospital) to settle the claims for the policy limit of $50,000 ($25,000 per claimant).  State Farm also ignored the advice of one of its own investigators and took the case to trial, assuring the Campbells that their assets were safe, that they had no liability for the accident, that [State Farm] would represent their interests, and that they did not need to procure separate counsel.

				., at ___, 2001 WL 1246676, at *2.  To the contrary, a jury determined that Campbell was 100 percent at fault, and a judgment was returned for $185,849, far more than the amount offered in settlement.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				At first State Farm refused to cover the $135,849 in excess liability.  Its counsel made this clear to the Campbells:  You may want to put for sale signs on your property to get things moving.   
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  Nor was State Farm willing to post a supersedeas bond to allow Campbell to appeal the judgment against him.  Campbell obtained his own counsel to appeal the verdict.  During the pendency of the appeal, in late 1984, Slusher, Ospital, and the Campbells reached an agreement whereby Slusher and Ospital agreed not to seek satisfaction of their claims against the Campbells.  In exchange the Campbells agreed to pursue a bad faith action against State Farm and to be represented by Slushers and Ospitals attorneys.  The Campbells also agreed that Slusher and Ospital would have a right to play a part in all major decisions concerning the bad faith action.  No settlement could be concluded without Slushers and Ospitals approval, and Slusher and Ospital would receive 90 percent of any verdict against State Farm.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In 1989, the Utah Supreme Court denied Campbells appeal in the wrongful death and tort actions.  
				<em>
					Slusher 
				</em>
				v.
				<em>
					 Ospital
				</em>
				, 777 P. 2d 437.  State Farm then paid the entire judgment, including the amounts in excess of the policy limits.  The Campbells nonetheless filed a complaint against State Farm alleging bad faith, fraud, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.  The trial court initially granted State Farms motion for summary judgment because State Farm had paid the excess verdict, but that ruling was reversed on appeal.  840 P. 2d 130 (Utah App. 1992).  On remand State Farm moved 
				<em>
					in limine
				</em>
				 to exclude evidence of alleged conduct that occurred in unrelated cases outside of Utah, but the trial court denied the motion.  At State Farms request the trial court bifurcated the trial into two phases conducted before different juries.  In the first phase the jury determined that State Farms decision not to settle was unreasonable because there was a substantial likelihood of an excess verdict.

, and refused to sustain a $2 million punitive damages award which accompanied a verdict of only $4,000 in compensatory damages.  Based on that decision, State Farm again moved for the exclusion of evidence of dissimilar out-of-state conduct.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 168a172a.  The trial court denied State Farms motion.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The second phase addressed State Farms liability for fraud and intentional infliction of emotional distress, as well as compensatory and punitive damages.  The Utah Supreme Court aptly characterized this phase of the trial:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				State Farm argued during phase II that its decision to take the case to trial was an honest mistake that did not warrant punitive damages.  In contrast, the Campbells introduced evidence that State Farms decision to take the case to trial was a result of a national scheme to meet corporate fiscal goals by capping payouts on claims company wide.  This scheme was referred to as State Farms Performance, Planning and Review, or PP &amp; R, policy.  To prove the existence of this scheme, the trial court allowed the Campbells to introduce extensive expert testimony regarding fraudulent practices by State Farm in its nation-wide operations.  Although State Farm moved prior to phase II of the trial for the exclusion of such evidence and continued to object to it at trial, the trial court ruled that such evidence was admissible to determine whether State Farms conduct in the Campbell case was indeed intentional and sufficiently egregious to warrant punitive damages.  ___ P. 3d, at ___, 2001 WL 1246676, at *3.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
Evidence pertaining to the PP&amp;R policy concerned State Farms business practices for over 20 years in numerous States.  Most of these practices bore no relation to third-party automobile insurance claims, the type of claim underlying the Campbells complaint against the company.  The jury awarded the Campbells $2.6 million in compensatory damages and $145 million in punitive damages, which the trial court reduced to $1 million and $25 million respectively.  Both parties appealed.

				The Utah Supreme Court sought to apply the three guideposts we identified in 
				<em>
					Gore
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra,
				</em>
				 at 574575, and it reinstated the $145 million punitive damages award.  Relying in large part on the extensive evidence concerning the PP&amp;R policy, the court concluded State Farms conduct was reprehensible.  The court also relied upon State Farms massive wealth and on testimony indicating that State Farms actions, because of their clandestine nature, will be punished at most in one out of every 50,000 cases as a matter of statistical probability, ___ P. 3d, at ___, 2001 WL 1246676, at *15, and concluded that the ratio between punitive and compensatory damages was not unwarranted.  Finally, the court noted that the punitive damages award was not excessive when compared to various civil and criminal penalties State Farm could have faced, including $10,000 for each act of fraud, the suspension of its license to conduct business in Utah, the disgorgement of profits, and imprisonment.

				Although these awards serve the same purposes as criminal penalties, defendants subjected to punitive damages in civil cases have not been accorded the protections applicable in a criminal proceeding.  This increases our concerns over the imprecise manner in which punitive damages systems are administered.  We have admonished that [p]unitive damages pose an acute danger of arbitrary deprivation of property.  Jury instructions typically leave the jury with wide discretion in choosing amounts, and the presentation of evidence of a defendants net worth creates the potential that juries will use their verdicts to express biases against big businesses, particularly those without strong local presences.

Indeed, the point of due processof the law in generalis to allow citizens to order their behavior.  A State can have no legitimate interest in deliberately making the law so arbitrary that citizens will be unable to avoid punishment based solely upon bias or whim).  Our concerns are heightened when the decisionmaker is presented, as we shall discuss, with evidence that has little bearing as to the amount of punitive damages that should be awarded.  Vague instructions, or those that merely inform the jury to avoid passion or prejudice, App. to Pet. for Cert. 108a109a, do little to aid the decisionmaker in its task of assigning appropriate weight to evidence that is relevant and evidence that is tangential or only inflammatory.

				In light of these concerns, in 
				<em>
					Gore
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, we instructed courts reviewing punitive damages to consider three guideposts: (1) the degree of reprehensibility of the defendants misconduct; (2) the disparity between the actual or potential harm suffered by the plaintiff and the punitive damages award; and (3) the difference between the punitive damages awarded by the jury and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases.  
				<em>

				 and mandated appellate courts to conduct

				 review of a trial courts application of them to the jurys award.  532 U. S., at 424.  Exacting appellate review ensures that an award of punitive damages is based upon an  application of law, rather than a decisionmakers caprice. 

				[T]he most important indicium of the reasonableness of a punitive damages award is the degree of reprehensibility of the defendants conduct.  
				<em>
					Gore
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 575.  We have instructed courts to determine the reprehensibility of a defendant by considering whether: the harm caused was physical as opposed to economic; the tortious conduct evinced an indifference to or a reckless disregard of the health or safety of others; the target of the conduct had financial vulnerability; the conduct involved repeated actions or was an isolated incident; and the harm was the result of intentional malice, trickery, or deceit, or mere accident.  517 U. S., at 576577.  The existence of any one of these factors weighing in favor of a plaintiff may not be sufficient to sustain a punitive damages award; and the absence of all of them renders any award suspect.  It should be presumed a plaintiff has been made whole for his injuries by compensatory damages, so punitive damages should only be awarded if the defendants culpability, after having paid compensatory damages, is so reprehensible as to warrant the imposition of further sanctions to achieve punishment or deterrence.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 575.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Applying these factors in the instant case, we must acknowledge that State Farms handling of the claims against the Campbells merits no praise.  The trial court found that State Farms employees altered the companys records to make Campbell appear less culpable.  State Farm disregarded the overwhelming likelihood of liability and the near-certain probability that, by taking the case to trial, a judgment in excess of the policy limits would be awarded.  State Farm amplified the harm by at first assuring the Campbells their assets would be safe from any verdict and by later telling them, postjudgment, to put a for-sale sign on their house.  While we do not suggest there was error in awarding punitive damages based upon State Farms conduct toward the Campbells, a more modest punishment for this reprehensible conduct could have satisfied the States legitimate objectives, and the Utah courts should have gone no further.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				This case, instead, was used as a platform to expose, and punish, the perceived deficiencies of State Farms operations throughout the country.  The Utah Supreme Courts opinion makes explicit that State Farm was being condemned for its nationwide policies rather than for the conduct direct toward the Campbells.  ___ P. 3d, at ___, 2001 WL 1246676, at *3 ([T]he Campbells introduced evidence that State Farms decision to take the case to trial was a result of a national scheme to meet corporate fiscal goals by capping payouts on claims company wide).  This was, as well, an explicit rationale of the trial courts decision in approving the award, though reduced from $145 million to $25 million.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 120a ([T]he Campbells demonstrated, through the testimony of State Farm employees who had worked outside of Utah, and through expert testimony, that this pattern of claims adjustment under the PP&amp;R program was not a local anomaly, but was a consistent, nationwide feature of State Farms business operations, orchestrated from the highest levels of corporate management).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Campbells contend that State Farm has only itself to blame for the reliance upon dissimilar and out-of-state conduct evidence.  The record does not support this contention.  From their opening statements onward the Campbells framed this case as a chance to rebuke State Farm for its nationwide activities.  App. 208 (Youre going to hear evidence that even the insurance commission in Utah and around the country are unwilling or inept at protecting people against abuses); 
				<em>
					id.

				, at 242 ([T]his is a very important case. . . .  [I]t transcends the Campbell file.  It involves a nationwide practice.  And you, here, are going to be evaluating and assessing, and hopefully requiring State Farm to stand accountable for what its doing across the country, which is the purpose of punitive damages).  This was a position maintained throughout the litigation.  In opposing State Farms motion to exclude such evidence under 
				<em>
					Gore
				</em>
				, the Campbells counsel convinced the trial court that there was no limitation on the scope of evidence that could be considered under our precedents.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 172a (As I read the case [

				Here, the Campbells do not dispute that much of the out-of-state conduct was lawful where it occurred.  They argue, however, that such evidence was not the primary basis for the punitive damages award and was relevant to the extent it demonstrated, in a general sense, State Farms motive against its insured.  Brief for Respondents 4647 ([E]ven if the practices described by State Farm were not malum in se or malum prohibitum, they became relevant to punitive damages to the extent they were used as tools to implement State Farms wrongful PP&amp;R policy).  This argument misses the mark.  Lawful out-of-state conduct may be probative when it demonstrates the deliberateness and culpability of the defendants action in the State where it is tortious, but that conduct must have a nexus to the specific harm suffered by the plaintiff.  A jury must be instructed, furthermore, that it may not use evidence of out-of-state conduct to punish a defendant for action that was lawful in the jurisdiction where it occurred.

				For a more fundamental reason, however, the Utah courts erred in relying upon this and other evidence: The courts awarded punitive damages to punish and deter conduct that bore no relation to the Campbells harm.
				  
				A defendants dissimilar acts, independent from the acts upon which liability was premised, may not serve as the basis for punitive damages.  A defendant should be punished for the conduct that harmed the plaintiff, not for being an unsavory individual or business.  Due process does not permit courts, in the calculation of punitive damages, to adjudicate the merits of other parties hypothetical claims against a defendant under the guise of the reprehensibility analysis, but we have no doubt the Utah Supreme Court did that here.  __ P. 3d, at __, 2001 WL 1246676, at *11 (Even if the harm to the Campbells can be appropriately characterized as minimal, the trial courts assessment of the situation is on target: The harm is minor to the individual but massive in the aggregate ).  Punishment on these bases creates the possibility of multiple punitive damages awards for the same conduct; for in the usual case nonparties are not bound by the judgment some other plaintiff obtains.

				The same reasons lead us to conclude the Utah Supreme Courts decision cannot be justified on the grounds that State Farm was a recidivist.

				The Campbells have identified scant evidence of repeated misconduct of the sort that injured them.  Nor does our review of the Utah courts decisions convince us that State Farm was only punished for its actions toward the Campbells.  Although evidence of other acts need not be identical to have relevance in the calculation of punitive damages, the Utah court erred here because evidence pertaining to claims that had nothing to do with a third-party lawsuit was introduced at length.  Other evidence concerning reprehensibility was even more tangential.  For example, the Utah Supreme Court criticized State Farms investigation into the personal life of one of its employees and, in a broader approach, the manner in which State Farms policies corrupted its employees.  ___ P. 3d, at ___, 2001 WL 1246676, at *10; 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at ___, 2001 WL 1246676, at *12.  The Campbells attempt to justify the courts reliance upon this unrelated testimony on the theory that each dollar of profit made by underpaying a third-party claimant is the same as a dollar made by underpaying a first-party one.  Brief for Respondents 45; see also ___ P. 3d, at ___, 2001 WL 1246676, at *12 (State Farms continuing illicit practice created market disadvantages for other honest insurance companies because these practices increased profits.  As plaintiffs expert witnesses established, such wrongfully obtained competitive advantages have the potential to pressure other companies to adopt similar fraudulent tactics, or to force them out of business.  Thus, such actions cause distortions throughout the insurance market and ultimately hurt all consumers).  For the reasons already stated, this argument is unconvincing.  The reprehensibility guidepost does not permit courts to expand the scope of the case so that a defendant may be punished for any malfeasance, which in this case extended for a 20-year period.  In this case, because the Campbells have shown no conduct by State Farm similar to that which harmed them, the conduct that harmed them is the only conduct relevant to the reprehensibility analysis.

				Turning to the second 
				<em>
					Gore
				</em>
				 guidepost, we have been reluctant to identify concrete constitutional limits on the ratio between harm, or potential harm, to the plaintiff and the punitive damages award.  
				<em>
					Gore
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 582 ([W]e have consistently rejected the notion that the constitutional line is marked by a simple mathematical formula, even one that compares actual 
				<em>
					and potential
				</em>
				 damages to the punitive award); 
				<em>
					TXO
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra,
				</em>
				 at 458.  We decline again to impose a bright-line ratio which a punitive damages award cannot exceed.  Our jurisprudence and the principles it has now established demonstrate, however, that, in practice, few awards exceeding a single-digit ratio between punitive and compensatory damages, to a significant degree, will satisfy due process.  In 
				<em>
					Haslip
				</em>
				, in upholding a punitive damages award, we concluded that an award of more than four times the amount of compensatory damages might be close to the line of constitutional impropriety.  499 U. S., at 2324.  We cited that 4-to-1 ratio again in 
				<em>
					Gore
				</em>
				.  517 U. S., at 581.  The Court further referenced a long legislative history, dating back over 700 years and going forward to today, providing for sanctions of double, treble, or quadruple damages to deter and punish.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 581, and n. 33.  While these ratios are not binding, they are instructive.  They demonstrate what should be obvious: Single-digit multipliers are more likely to comport with due process, while still achieving the States goals of deterrence and retribution, than awards with ratios in range of 500 to 1, 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 582, or, in this case, of 145 to 1.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Nonetheless, because there are no rigid benchmarks that a punitive damages award may not surpass, ratios greater than those we have previously upheld may comport with due process where a particularly egregious act has resulted in only a small amount of economic damages.  
				<em>
					Ibid.;
				</em>
				 see also 
				<em>
					ibid. 
				</em>
				(positing that a higher ratio 
				<em>
					might
				</em>
				 be necessary where the injury is hard to detect or the monetary value of noneconomic harm might have been difficult to determine).  The converse is also true, however.  When compensatory damages are substantial, then a lesser ratio, perhaps only equal to compensatory damages, can reach the outermost limit of the due process guarantee.  The precise award in any case, of course, must be based upon the facts and circumstances of the defendants conduct and the harm to the plaintiff.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In sum, courts must ensure that the measure of punishment is both reasonable and proportionate to the amount of harm to the plaintiff and to the general damages recovered.  In the context of this case, we have no doubt that there is a presumption against an award that has a 145-to-1 ratio.  The compensatory award in this case was substantial; the Campbells were awarded $1 million for a year and a half of emotional distress.  This was complete compensation.  The harm arose from a transaction in the economic realm, not from some physical assault or trauma; there were no physical injuries; and State Farm paid the excess verdict before the complaint was filed, so the Campbells suffered only minor economic injuries for the 18-month period in which State Farm refused to resolve the claim against them.  The compensatory damages for the injury suffered here, moreover, likely were based on a component which was duplicated in the punitive award.  Much of the distress was caused by the outrage and humiliation the Campbells suffered at the actions of their insurer; and it is a major role of punitive damages to condemn such conduct.  Compensatory damages, however, already contain this punitive element.  See Restatement (Second) of Torts §908, Comment 
				<em>
					c,
				</em>
				 p. 466 (1977) (In many cases in which compensatory damages include an amount for emotional distress, such as humiliation or indignation aroused by the defendants act, there is no clear line of demarcation between punishment and compensation and a verdict for a specified amount frequently includes elements of both).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Utah Supreme Court sought to justify the massive award by pointing to State Farms purported failure to report a prior $100 million punitive damages award in Texas to its corporate headquarters; the fact that State Farms policies have affected numerous Utah consumers; the fact that State Farm will only be punished in one out of every 50,000 cases as a matter of statistical probability; and State Farms enormous wealth.  ___ P. 3d, at ___, 2001 WL 1246676, at *15.  Since the Supreme Court of Utah discussed the Texas award when applying the ratio guidepost, we discuss it here.  The Texas award, however, should have been analyzed in the context of the reprehensibility guidepost only.  The failure of the company to report the Texas award is out-of-state conduct that, if the conduct were similar, might have had some bearing on the degree of reprehensibility, subject to the limitations we have described.  Here, it was dissimilar, and of such marginal relevance that it should have been accorded little or no weight.  The award was rendered in a first-party lawsuit; no judgment was entered in the case; and it was later settled for a fraction of the verdict.  With respect to the Utah Supreme Courts second justification, the Campbells inability to direct us to testimony demonstrating harm to the people of Utah (other than those directly involved in this case) indicates that the adverse effect on the States general population was in fact minor.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The remaining premises for the Utah Supreme Courts decision bear no relation to the awards reasonableness or proportionality to the harm.  They are, rather, arguments that seek to defend a departure from well-established constraints on punitive damages.  While States enjoy considerable discretion in deducing when punitive damages are warranted, each award must comport with the principles set forth in 
				<em>
					Gore
				</em>
				.  Here the argument that State Farm will be punished in only the rare case, coupled with reference to its assets (which, of course, are what other insured parties in Utah and other States must rely upon for payment of claims) had little to do with the actual harm sustained by the Campbells.  The wealth of a defendant cannot justify an otherwise unconstitutional punitive damages award.  
				<em>
					Gore
				</em>
				, 517 U. S., at 585 (The fact that BMW is a large corporation rather than an impecunious individual does not diminish its entitlement to fair notice of the demands that the several States impose on the conduct of its business); see also 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 591 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Breyer
				</span>
				, J., concurring) ([Wealth] provides an open-ended basis for inflating awards when the defendant is wealthy … .  That does not make its use unlawful or inappropriate; it simply means that this factor cannot make up for the failure of other factors, such as reprehensibility, to constrain significantly an award that purports to punish a defendants conduct).  The principles set forth in 
				<em>
					Gore 
				</em>
				must be implemented with care, to ensure both reasonableness and proportionality.

        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				The third guidepost in 
				<em>
					Gore
				</em>
				 is the disparity between the punitive damages award and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 575.  We note that, in the past, we have also looked to criminal penalties that could be imposed.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 583; 
				<em>
					Haslip
				</em>
				, 499 U. S., at 23.  The existence of a criminal penalty does have bearing on the seriousness with which a State views the wrongful action.  When used to determine the dollar amount of the award, however, the criminal penalty has less utility.  Great care must be taken to avoid use of the civil process to assess criminal penalties that can be imposed only after the heightened protections of a criminal trial have been observed, including, of course, its higher standards of proof.  Punitive damages are not a substitute for the criminal process, and the remote possibility of a criminal sanction does not automatically sustain a punitive damages award.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Here, we need not dwell long on this guidepost.  The most relevant civil sanction under Utah state law for the wrong done to the Campbells appears to be a $10,000 fine for an act of fraud, ___ P. 3d, at ___, 2001 WL 1246676, at *17, an amount dwarfed by the $145 million punitive damages award.  The Supreme Court of Utah speculated about the loss of State Farms business license, the disgorgement of profits, and possible imprisonment, but here again its references were to the broad fraudulent scheme drawn from evidence of out-of-state and dissimilar conduct.  This analysis was insufficient to justify the award.

				An application of the 
				<em>
					Gore
				</em>
				 guideposts to the facts of this case, especially in light of the substantial compensatory damages awarded (a portion of which contained a punitive element), likely would justify a punitive damages award at or near the amount of compensatory damages.  The punitive award of $145 million, therefore, was neither reasonable nor proportionate to the wrong committed, and it was an irrational and arbitrary deprivation of the property of the defendant.  The proper calculation of punitive damages under the principles we have discussed should be resolved, in the first instance, by the Utah courts.

				The California Department of Corrections (CDC) has an unwritten policy of racially segregating prisoners in double cells in reception centers for up to 60 days each time they enter a new correctional facility.  We consider whether strict scrutiny is the proper standard of review for an equal protection challenge to that policy.

				CDC institutions house all new male inmates and all male inmates transferred from other state facilities in reception centers for up to 60 days upon their arrival.  During that time, prison officials evaluate the inmates to determine their ultimate placement.  Double-cell assignments in the reception centers are based on a number of factors, predominantly race.  In fact, the CDC has admitted that the chances of an inmate being assigned a cellmate of another race are  [p]retty close  to zero percent.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a.  The CDC further subdivides prisoners within each racial group.  Thus, Japanese-Americans are housed separately from Chinese-Americans, and Northern California Hispanics are separated from Southern California Hispanics.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The CDCs asserted rationale for this practice is that it is necessary to prevent violence caused by racial gangs.  Brief for Respondents 16.  It cites numerous incidents of racial violence in CDC facilities and identifies five major prison gangs in the State: Mexican Mafia, Nuestra Familia, Black Guerilla Family, Aryan Brotherhood, and Nazi Low Riders.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 2.  The CDC also notes that prison-gang culture is violent and murderous.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 3.  An associate warden testified that if race were not considered in making initial housing assignments, she is certain there would be racial conflict in the cells and in the yard.  App. 215a.  Other prison officials also expressed their belief that violence and conflict would result if prisoners were not segregated.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g., id.,
				</em>
				 at 305a306a.  The CDC claims that it must therefore segregate all inmates while it determines whether they pose a danger to others.  See Brief for Respondents 29.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				With the exception of the double cells in reception areas, the rest of the state prison facilitiesdining areas, yards, and cellsare fully integrated.  After the initial 60-day period, prisoners are allowed to choose their own cellmates.  The CDC usually grants inmate requests to be housed together, unless there are security reasons for denying them.

				Garrison Johnson is an African-American inmate in the custody of the CDC.  He has been incarcerated since 1987 and, during that time, has been housed at a number of California prison facilities.  Fourth Amended Complaint 3, Record, Doc. No. 78.  Upon his arrival at Folsom prison in 1987, and each time he was transferred to a new facility thereafter, Johnson was double-celled with another African-American inmate.  See

				Johnson filed a complaint 
				<em>
					pro se
				</em>
				 in the United States District Court for the Central District of California on February 24, 1995, alleging that the CDCs reception-center housing policy violated his right to equal protection under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a> by assigning him cellmates on the basis of his race.  He alleged that, from 1987 to 1991, former CDC Director James Rowland instituted and enforced an unconstitutional policy of housing inmates according to race.  Second Amended Complaint 24, Record, Doc. No. 21.  Johnson made the same allegations against former Director James Gomez for the period from 1991 until the filing of his complaint.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  The District Court dismissed his complaint for failure to state a claim.  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded, holding that Johnson had stated a claim for racial discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>.

				On remand, Johnson was appointed counsel and granted leave to amend his complaint.  On July 5, 2000, he filed his Fourth Amended Complaint.  Record, Doc. No. 81.  Johnson claimed that the CDCs policy of racially segregating all inmates in reception-center cells violated his rights under the Equal Protection Clause.  Johnson sought damages, alleging that former CDC Directors Rowland and Gomez, in their individual capacities, violated his constitutional rights by formulating and implementing the CDCs housing policy.  He also sought injunctive relief against former CDC Director Stephen Cambra.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Johnson has consistently challenged, and the CDC has consistently defended, the policy as a wholeas it relates to both new inmates and inmates transferred from other facilities.  Johnson was first segregated in 1987 as a new inmate when he entered the CDC facility at Folsom.  Since 1987, he has been segregated each time he has been transferred to a new facility.  Thus, he has been subject to the CDCs policy both as a new inmate and as an inmate transferred from one facility to another.

				After discovery, the parties moved for summary judgment.  The District Court granted summary judgment to the defendants on grounds that they were entitled to qualified immunity because their conduct was not clearly unconstitutional.  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed.  321 F. 3d 791 (2003).  It held that the constitutionality of the CDCs policy should be reviewed under the deferential standard we articulated in

				The Court of Appeals denied Johnsons petition for rehearing en banc.  Judge Ferguson, joined by three others, dissented on grounds that [t]he panels decision ignore[d] the Supreme Courts repeated and unequivocal command that all racial classifications imposed by the government must be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny, and fail[ed] to recognize that [the]

				The reasons for strict scrutiny are familiar.  Racial classifications raise special fears that they are motivated by an invidious purpose.  Thus, we have admonished time and again that, [a]bsent searching judicial inquiry into the justification for such race-based measures, there is simply no way of determining … what classifications are in fact motivated by illegitimate notions of racial inferiority or simple racial politics.

				The CDC claims that its policy should be exempt from our categorical rule because it is neutralthat is, it neither benefits nor burdens one group or individual more than any other group or individual.  Brief for Respondents 16.  In other words, strict scrutiny should not apply because all prisoners are equally segregated.  The CDCs argument ignores our repeated command that racial classifications receive close scrutiny even when they may be said to burden or benefit the races equally.

				,

				 we upheld a three-judge courts decision striking down Alabamas policy of segregation in its prisons.  
				<em>
					Id

				<em>
					id

				The need for strict scrutiny is no less important here, where prison officials cite racial violence as the reason for their policy.  As we have recognized in the past, racial classifications threaten to stigmatize individuals by reason of their membership in a racial group and to 
				<em>
					incite racial hostility

				<em>

				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 493 (plurality opinion) (emphasis added)).  Indeed, by insisting that inmates be housed only with other inmates of the same race, it is possible that prison officials will breed further hostility among prisoners and reinforce racial and ethnic divisions.  By perpetuating the notion that race matters most, racial segregation of inmates may exacerbate the very patterns of [violence that it is] said to counteract.

See also Brief for Former State Corrections Officials as

				The CDCs policy is unwritten.  Although California claimed at oral argument that two other States follow a similar policy, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 3031, this assertion was unsubstantiated, and we are unable to confirm or deny its accuracy.

				  Virtually all other States and the Federal Government manage their prison systems without reliance on racial segregation.  See Brief for United States as

This includes the making of administrative decisions and providing access to work, housing and programs).  The United States contends that racial integration actually leads to less violence in BOPs institutions and better prepares inmates for re-entry into society.  Brief for United States as 
				<em>
					Amicus Curiae

				 25.  Indeed, the United States argues, based on its experience with the BOP, that it is possible to address concerns of prison security through individualized consideration without the use of racial segregation, unless warranted as a necessary and temporary response to a race riot or other serious threat of race-related violence.

						 Though, as Justice Thomas points out, see post, at 2223, and n. 12, inmates in reception centers in Oklahoma and Texas are not generally assigned randomly to racially integrated cells, it is also the case that these inmates are not precluded from integrated cell assignments.  Oklahoma Dept. of Corrections, Policies and Procedures, Operations Memorandum No. OP030102, Inmate Housing (Sept. 16, 2004), available at http://www.doc.state.ok.us/docs/policies.htm (as visited Jan. 21, 2005, and available in the Clerk of Courts case file); Texas Dept. of Criminal Justice, Security Memorandum No. SM01.28, Assignment to General Population Two-Person Cells (June 15, 2002).  See also Brief for Former State Corrections Officials as Amici Curiae 20, n. 10 (To the extent that race is considered in the assignment calculus in Oklahoma, it appears to be one factor among many, and as a result, individualized consideration is given to all inmates).  We therefore have no way of knowing whether, in practice, inmates in Oklahoma and Texas, like those in California, have close to no chance, App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a, of being celled with a person of a different race.  See also Brief for Former State Corrections Officials as Amici Curiae 1920 ([W]e are aware of no state other than California that assumes that every incoming prisoner is incapable of getting along with a cell mate of a different race.

						 Justice Thomas characterizes the CDCs policy as a limited one, see post, at 2, but the CDCs policy is in fact sweeping in its application.  It applies to all prisoners housed in double cells in reception centers, whether newly admitted or transferred from one facility to another.  Moreover, despite Justice Thomas suggestion that the CDC considers other nonracial factors in determining housing placements, the CDC itself has admitted that, in practice, there is a  [p]retty close  to zero percent chance that an inmate will be housed with a person of a different race.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a.  See also generally post, at 12, and n. 1 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  Thus, despite an inmates age, physical size, mental health, medical needs, [and] criminal history, post, at 13 (Thomas, J., dissenting), the fact that he is black categorically precludes him from being celled with a white inmate.  As we explain, see infra, at 15, we do not decide whether the threat of violence in California prisons is sufficient to justify such a broad policy.

				The California Department of Corrections (CDC) has an unwritten policy of racially segregating prisoners in double cells in reception centers for up to 60 days each time they enter a new correctional facility.  We consider whether strict scrutiny is the proper standard of review for an equal protection challenge to that policy.

				CDC institutions house all new male inmates and all male inmates transferred from other state facilities in reception centers for up to 60 days upon their arrival.  During that time, prison officials evaluate the inmates to determine their ultimate placement.  Double-cell assignments in the reception centers are based on a number of factors, predominantly race.  In fact, the CDC has admitted that the chances of an inmate being assigned a cellmate of another race are  [p]retty close  to zero percent.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a.  The CDC further subdivides prisoners within each racial group.  Thus, Japanese-Americans are housed separately from Chinese-Americans, and Northern California Hispanics are separated from Southern California Hispanics.

				The CDCs asserted rationale for this practice is that it is necessary to prevent violence caused by racial gangs.  Brief for Respondents 16.

				<em>
					e.g., id.,

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				With the exception of the double cells in reception areas, the rest of the state prison facilitiesdining areas, yards, and cellsare fully integrated.  After the initial 60-day period, prisoners are allowed to choose their own cellmates.  The CDC usually grants inmate requests to be housed together, unless there are security reasons for denying them.

				On remand, Johnson was appointed counsel and granted leave to amend his complaint.  On July 5, 2000, he filed his Fourth Amended Complaint.  Record, Doc. No. 81.  Johnson claimed that the CDCs policy of racially segregating all inmates in reception-center cells violated his rights under the Equal Protection Clause.  Johnson sought damages, alleging that former CDC Directors Rowland and Gomez, in their individual capacities, violated his constitutional rights by formulating and implementing the CDCs housing policy.  He also sought injunctive relief against former CDC Director Stephen Cambra.

				Johnson has consistently challenged, and the CDC has consistently defended, the policy as a wholeas it relates to both new inmates and inmates transferred from other facilities.  Johnson was first segregated in 1987 as a new inmate when he entered the CDC facility at Folsom.  Since 1987, he has been segregated each time he has been transferred to a new facility.  Thus, he has been subject to the CDCs policy both as a new inmate and as an inmate transferred from one facility to another.

It is not readily apparent why, if segregation in reception centers is justified, segregation in the dining halls, yards, and general housing areas is not also permissible.

						 Justice Thomas takes a hands-off approach to racial classifications in prisons, suggesting that a compelling showing [is] needed to overcome the deference we owe to prison administrators.  Post, at 21 (dissenting opinion).  But such deference is fundamentally at odds with our equal protection jurisprudence.  We put the burden on state actors to demonstrate that their race-based policies are justified.

						 Though, as Justice Thomas points out, see post, at 2223, and n. 12, inmates in reception centers in Oklahoma and Texas are not generally assigned randomly to racially integrated cells, it is also the case that these inmates are not precluded from integrated cell assignments.  Oklahoma Dept. of Corrections, Policies and Procedures, Operations Memorandum No. OP030102, Inmate Housing (Sept. 16, 2004), available at http://www.doc.state.ok.us/docs/policies.htm (as visited Jan. 21, 2005, and available in the Clerk of Courts case file); Texas Dept. of Criminal Justice, Security Memorandum No. SM01.28, Assignment to General Population Two-Person Cells (June 15, 2002).  See also Brief for Former State Corrections Officials as Amici Curiae 20, n. 10 (To the extent that race is considered in the assignment calculus in Oklahoma, it appears to be one factor among many, and as a result, individualized consideration is given to all inmates).  We therefore have no way of knowing whether, in practice, inmates in Oklahoma and Texas, like those in California, have close to no chance, App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a, of being celled with a person of a different race.  See also Brief for Former State Corrections Officials as Amici Curiae 1920 ([W]e are aware of no state other than California that assumes that every incoming prisoner is incapable of getting along with a cell mate of a different race.  And we are aware of no state other than California that has acted on such an assumption by adopting an inflexible and absolute policy of racial segregation of double cells in receptioncenters).

						 Justice Thomas characterizes the CDCs policy as a limited one, see post, at 2, but the CDCs policy is in fact sweeping in its application.  It applies to all prisoners housed in double cells in reception centers, whether newly admitted or transferred from one facility to another.  Moreover, despite Justice Thomas suggestion that the CDC considers other nonracial factors in determining housing placements, the CDC itself has admitted that, in practice, there is a  [p]retty close  to zero percent chance that an inmate will be housed with a person of a different race.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a.  See also generally post, at 12, and n. 1 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  Thus, despite an inmates age, physical size, mental health, medical needs, [and] criminal history, post, at 13 (Thomas, J., dissenting), the fact that he is black categorically precludes him from being celled with a white inmate.  As we explain, see infra, at 15, we do not decide whether the threat of violence in California prisons is sufficient to justify such a broad policy.

				The California Department of Corrections (CDC) has an unwritten policy of racially segregating prisoners in double cells in reception centers for up to 60 days each time they enter a new correctional facility.  We consider whether strict scrutiny is the proper standard of review for an equal protection challenge to that policy.

				CDC institutions house all new male inmates and all male inmates transferred from other state facilities in reception centers for up to 60 days upon their arrival.  During that time, prison officials evaluate the inmates to determine their ultimate placement.  Double-cell assignments in the reception centers are based on a number of factors, predominantly race.  In fact, the CDC has admitted that the chances of an inmate being assigned a cellmate of another race are  [p]retty close  to zero percent.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a.  The CDC further subdivides prisoners within each racial group.  Thus, Japanese-Americans are housed separately from Chinese-Americans, and Northern California Hispanics are separated from Southern California Hispanics.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The CDCs asserted rationale for this practice is that it is necessary to prevent violence caused by racial gangs.  Brief for Respondents 16.  It cites numerous incidents of racial violence in CDC facilities and identifies five major prison gangs in the State: Mexican Mafia, Nuestra Familia, Black Guerilla Family, Aryan Brotherhood, and Nazi Low Riders.

				., at 3.  An associate warden testified that if race were not considered in making initial housing assignments, she is certain there would be racial conflict in the cells and in the yard.  App. 215a.  Other prison officials also expressed their belief that violence and conflict would result if prisoners were not segregated.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g., id.,
				</em>
				 at 305a306a.  The CDC claims that it must therefore segregate all inmates while it determines whether they pose a danger to others.  See Brief for Respondents 29.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				With the exception of the double cells in reception areas, the rest of the state prison facilitiesdining areas, yards, and cellsare fully integrated.  After the initial 60-day period, prisoners are allowed to choose their own cellmates.  The CDC usually grants inmate requests to be housed together, unless there are security reasons for denying them.

				Garrison Johnson is an African-American inmate in the custody of the CDC.  He has been incarcerated since 1987 and, during that time, has been housed at a number of California prison facilities.  Fourth Amended Complaint 3, Record, Doc. No. 78.

				Johnson filed a complaint 
				<em>

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a> by assigning him cellmates on the basis of his race.  He alleged that, from 1987 to 1991, former CDC Director James Rowland instituted and enforced an unconstitutional policy of housing inmates according to race.

				On remand, Johnson was appointed counsel and granted leave to amend his complaint.  On July 5, 2000, he filed his Fourth Amended Complaint.  Record, Doc. No. 81.  Johnson claimed that the CDCs policy of racially segregating all inmates in reception-center cells violated his rights under the Equal Protection Clause.  Johnson sought damages, alleging that former CDC Directors Rowland and Gomez, in their individual capacities, violated his constitutional rights by formulating and implementing the CDCs housing policy.  He also sought injunctive relief against former CDC Director Stephen Cambra.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Johnson has consistently challenged, and the CDC has consistently defended, the policy as a wholeas it relates to both new inmates and inmates transferred from other facilities.  Johnson was first segregated in 1987 as a new inmate when he entered the CDC facility at Folsom.  Since 1987, he has been segregated each time he has been transferred to a new facility.  Thus, he has been subject to the CDCs policy both as a new inmate and as an inmate transferred from one facility to another.

				After discovery, the parties moved for summary judgment.

				The CDC claims that its policy should be exempt from our categorical rule because it is neutralthat is, it neither benefits nor burdens one group or individual more than any other group or individual.  Brief for Respondents 16.  In other words, strict scrutiny should not apply because all prisoners are equally segregated.

						 Though, as Justice Thomas points out, see post, at 2223, and n. 12, inmates in reception centers in Oklahoma and Texas are not generally assigned randomly to racially integrated cells, it is also the case that these inmates are not precluded from integrated cell assignments.  Oklahoma Dept. of Corrections, Policies and Procedures, Operations Memorandum No. OP030102, Inmate Housing (Sept. 16, 2004), available at http://www.doc.state.ok.us/docs/policies.htm (as visited Jan. 21, 2005, and available in the Clerk of Courts case file); Texas Dept. of Criminal Justice, Security Memorandum No. SM01.28, Assignment to General Population Two-Person Cells (June 15, 2002).  See also Brief for Former State Corrections Officials as Amici Curiae 20, n. 10 (To the extent that race is considered in the assignment calculus in Oklahoma, it appears to be one factor among many, and as a result, individualized consideration is given to all inmates).  We therefore have no way of knowing whether, in practice, inmates in Oklahoma and Texas, like those in California, have close to no chance, App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a, of being celled with a person of a different race.  See also Brief for Former State Corrections Officials as Amici Curiae 1920 ([W]e are aware of no state other than California that assumes that every incoming prisoner is incapable of getting along with a cell mate of a different race.

						 Justice Thomas characterizes the CDCs policy as a limited one, see post, at 2, but the CDCs policy is in fact sweeping in its application.  It applies to all prisoners housed in double cells in reception centers, whether newly admitted or transferred from one facility to another.  Moreover, despite Justice Thomas suggestion that the CDC considers other nonracial factors in determining housing placements, the CDC itself has admitted that, in practice, there is a  [p]retty close  to zero percent chance that an inmate will be housed with a person of a different race.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a.  See also generally post, at 12, and n. 1 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  Thus, despite an inmates age, physical size, mental health, medical needs, [and] criminal history, post, at 13 (Thomas, J., dissenting), the fact that he is black categorically precludes him from being celled with a white inmate.  As we explain, see infra, at 15, we do not decide whether the threat of violence in California prisons is sufficient to justify such a broad policy.

				CDC institutions house all new male inmates and all male inmates transferred from other state facilities in reception centers for up to 60 days upon their arrival.  During that time, prison officials evaluate the inmates to determine their ultimate placement.  Double-cell assignments in the reception centers are based on a number of factors, predominantly race.  In fact, the CDC has admitted that the chances of an inmate being assigned a cellmate of another race are  [p]retty close  to zero percent.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a.  The CDC further subdivides prisoners within each racial group.  Thus, Japanese-Americans are housed separately from Chinese-Americans, and Northern California Hispanics are separated from Southern California Hispanics.

				With the exception of the double cells in reception areas, the rest of the state prison facilitiesdining areas, yards, and cellsare fully integrated.  After the initial 60-day period, prisoners are allowed to choose their own cellmates.  The CDC usually grants inmate requests to be housed together, unless there are security reasons for denying them.

				On remand, Johnson was appointed counsel and granted leave to amend his complaint.  On July 5, 2000, he filed his Fourth Amended Complaint.  Record, Doc. No. 81.  Johnson claimed that the CDCs policy of racially segregating all inmates in reception-center cells violated his rights under the Equal Protection Clause.  Johnson sought damages, alleging that former CDC Directors Rowland and Gomez, in their individual capacities, violated his constitutional rights by formulating and implementing the CDCs housing policy.  He also sought injunctive relief against former CDC Director Stephen Cambra.

				Johnson has consistently challenged, and the CDC has consistently defended, the policy as a wholeas it relates to both new inmates and inmates transferred from other facilities.  Johnson was first segregated in 1987 as a new inmate when he entered the CDC facility at Folsom.  Since 1987, he has been segregated each time he has been transferred to a new facility.  Thus, he has been subject to the CDCs policy both as a new inmate and as an inmate transferred from one facility to another.

Indeed, by insisting that inmates be housed only with other inmates of the same race, it is possible that prison officials will breed further hostility among prisoners and reinforce racial and ethnic divisions.

						 Though, as Justice Thomas points out, see post, at 2223, and n. 12, inmates in reception centers in Oklahoma and Texas are not generally assigned randomly to racially integrated cells, it is also the case that these inmates are not precluded from integrated cell assignments.  Oklahoma Dept. of Corrections, Policies and Procedures, Operations Memorandum No. OP030102, Inmate Housing (Sept. 16, 2004), available at http://www.doc.state.ok.us/docs/policies.htm (as visited Jan. 21, 2005, and available in the Clerk of Courts case file); Texas Dept. of Criminal Justice, Security Memorandum No. SM01.28, Assignment to General Population Two-Person Cells (June 15, 2002).  See also Brief for Former State Corrections Officials as Amici Curiae 20, n. 10 (To the extent that race is considered in the assignment calculus in Oklahoma, it appears to be one factor among many, and as a result, individualized consideration is given to all inmates).  We therefore have no way of knowing whether, in practice, inmates in Oklahoma and Texas, like those in California, have close to no chance, App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a, of being celled with a person of a different race.  See also Brief for Former State Corrections Officials as Amici Curiae 1920 ([W]e are aware of no state other than California that assumes that every incoming prisoner is incapable of getting along with a cell mate of a different race.

						 Justice Thomas characterizes the CDCs policy as a limited one, see post, at 2, but the CDCs policy is in fact sweeping in its application.  It applies to all prisoners housed in double cells in reception centers, whether newly admitted or transferred from one facility to another.  Moreover, despite Justice Thomas suggestion that the CDC considers other nonracial factors in determining housing placements, the CDC itself has admitted that, in practice, there is a  [p]retty close  to zero percent chance that an inmate will be housed with a person of a different race.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a.  See also generally post, at 12, and n. 1 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  Thus, despite an inmates age, physical size, mental health, medical needs, [and] criminal history, post, at 13 (Thomas, J., dissenting), the fact that he is black categorically precludes him from being celled with a white inmate.  As we explain, see infra, at 15, we do not decide whether the threat of violence in California prisons is sufficient to justify such a broad policy.

				The California Department of Corrections (CDC) has an unwritten policy of racially segregating prisoners in double cells in reception centers for up to 60 days each time they enter a new correctional facility.  We consider whether strict scrutiny is the proper standard of review for an equal protection challenge to that policy.

				CDC institutions house all new male inmates and all male inmates transferred from other state facilities in reception centers for up to 60 days upon their arrival.  During that time, prison officials evaluate the inmates to determine their ultimate placement.  Double-cell assignments in the reception centers are based on a number of factors, predominantly race.  In fact, the CDC has admitted that the chances of an inmate being assigned a cellmate of another race are  [p]retty close  to zero percent.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a.  The CDC further subdivides prisoners within each racial group.  Thus, Japanese-Americans are housed separately from Chinese-Americans, and Northern California Hispanics are separated from Southern California Hispanics.

				The CDCs asserted rationale for this practice is that it is necessary to prevent violence caused by racial gangs.  Brief for Respondents 16.

				<em>
					e.g., id.,

				With the exception of the double cells in reception areas, the rest of the state prison facilitiesdining areas, yards, and cellsare fully integrated.  After the initial 60-day period, prisoners are allowed to choose their own cellmates.  The CDC usually grants inmate requests to be housed together, unless there are security reasons for denying them.

				On remand, Johnson was appointed counsel and granted leave to amend his complaint.  On July 5, 2000, he filed his Fourth Amended Complaint.  Record, Doc. No. 81.  Johnson claimed that the CDCs policy of racially segregating all inmates in reception-center cells violated his rights under the Equal Protection Clause.

He also sought injunctive relief against former CDC Director Stephen Cambra.

				Johnson has consistently challenged, and the CDC has consistently defended, the policy as a wholeas it relates to both new inmates and inmates transferred from other facilities.  Johnson was first segregated in 1987 as a new inmate when he entered the CDC facility at Folsom.  Since 1987, he has been segregated each time he has been transferred to a new facility.  Thus, he has been subject to the CDCs policy both as a new inmate and as an inmate transferred from one facility to another.

On remand, the CDC will have the burden of demonstrating that its policy is narrowly tailored with regard to new inmates as well as transferees.  Prisons are dangerous places, and the special circumstances they present may justify racial classifications in some contexts.  Such circumstances can be considered in applying strict scrutiny, which is designed to take relevant differences into account.

						 Justice Thomas takes a hands-off approach to racial classifications in prisons, suggesting that a compelling showing [is] needed to overcome the deference we owe to prison administrators.  Post, at 21 (dissenting opinion).  But such deference is fundamentally at odds with our equal protection jurisprudence.  We put the burden on state actors to demonstrate that their race-based policies are justified.

						 Though, as Justice Thomas points out, see post, at 2223, and n. 12, inmates in reception centers in Oklahoma and Texas are not generally assigned randomly to racially integrated cells, it is also the case that these inmates are not precluded from integrated cell assignments.  Oklahoma Dept. of Corrections, Policies and Procedures, Operations Memorandum No. OP030102, Inmate Housing (Sept. 16, 2004), available at http://www.doc.state.ok.us/docs/policies.htm (as visited Jan. 21, 2005, and available in the Clerk of Courts case file); Texas Dept. of Criminal Justice, Security Memorandum No. SM01.28, Assignment to General Population Two-Person Cells (June 15, 2002).  See also Brief for Former State Corrections Officials as Amici Curiae 20, n. 10 (To the extent that race is considered in the assignment calculus in Oklahoma, it appears to be one factor among many, and as a result, individualized consideration is given to all inmates).  We therefore have no way of knowing whether, in practice, inmates in Oklahoma and Texas, like those in California, have close to no chance, App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a, of being celled with a person of a different race.  See also Brief for Former State Corrections Officials as Amici Curiae 1920 ([W]e are aware of no state other than California that assumes that every incoming prisoner is incapable of getting along with a cell mate of a different race.  And we are aware of no state other than California that has acted on such an assumption by adopting an inflexible and absolute policy of racial segregation of double cells in receptioncenters).

						 Justice Thomas characterizes the CDCs policy as a limited one, see post, at 2, but the CDCs policy is in fact sweeping in its application.  It applies to all prisoners housed in double cells in reception centers, whether newly admitted or transferred from one facility to another.  Moreover, despite Justice Thomas suggestion that the CDC considers other nonracial factors in determining housing placements, the CDC itself has admitted that, in practice, there is a  [p]retty close  to zero percent chance that an inmate will be housed with a person of a different race.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a.  See also generally post, at 12, and n. 1 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  Thus, despite an inmates age, physical size, mental health, medical needs, [and] criminal history, post, at 13 (Thomas, J., dissenting), the fact that he is black categorically precludes him from being celled with a white inmate.  As we explain, see infra, at 15, we do not decide whether the threat of violence in California prisons is sufficient to justify such a broad policy.

				In my judgment a state policy of segregating prisoners by race during the first 60 days of their incarceration, as well as the first 60 days after their transfer from one facility to another, violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>.  The California Department of Corrections (CDC) has had an ample opportunity to justify its policy during the course of this litigation, but has utterly failed to do so whether judged under strict scrutiny or the more deferential standard set out in 
				<em>
					Turner
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Safley,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/482/78" class="subref" title="subref">482 U. S. 78</a> (1987)
.  The CDC had no incentive in the proceedings below to withhold evidence supporting its policy; nor has the CDC made any offer of proof to suggest that a remand for further factual development would serve any purpose other than to postpone the inevitable.  I therefore agree with the submission of the United States as 
				<em>
					amicus curiae
				</em>
				 that the Court should hold the policy unconstitutional on the current record.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The CDCs segregation policy
				<a name="ZD-1ref" href="#ZD-1" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>
					1
				</b>
                </sup>
            </a>
				 is based on a conclusive presumption that housing inmates of different races together creates an unacceptable risk of racial violence.  Under the policys logic, an inmates race is a proxy for gang membership, and gang membership is a proxy for violence.  The CDC, however, has offered scant empirical evidence or expert opinion to justify this use of race under even a minimal level of constitutional scrutiny.  The presumption underlying the policy is undoubtedly overbroad.  The CDC has made no effort to prove what fraction of new or transferred inmates are members of race-based gangs, nor has it shown more generally that interracial violence is disproportionately greater than intraracial violence in its prisons.  Proclivity toward racial violence unquestionably varies from inmate to inmate, yet the CDC applies its blunderbuss policy to 
				<em>
					all 
				</em>
				new and transferred inmates housed in double cells regardless of their criminal histories or records of previous incarceration.  Under the CDCs policy, for example, two car thieves of different racesneither of whom has any history of gang involvement, or of violence, for that matterwould be barred from being housed together during their first two months of prison.  This result derives from the CDCs inflexible judgment that such integrated living conditions are simply too dangerous.  This Court has never countenanced such racial prophylaxis.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				To establish a link between integrated cells and violence, the CDC relies on the views of two state corrections officials.  They attested to their belief that double-celling members of different races would lead to violence and that this violence would spill out into the prison yards.  One of these officials, an associate warden, testified as follows: 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				[W]ith the Asian population, the control sergeants have to be more careful than they do with Blacks, Whites, and Hispanics because, for example, you cannot house a Japanese inmate with a Chinese inmate.  You cannot.  They will kill each other.  They wont even tell you about it.  They will just do it.  The same with Laotians, Vietnamese, Cambodians, Filipinos.  You have to be very careful about housing other Asians with other Asians.  Its very culturally heavy.  App. 189a.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
Such musings inspire little confidence.  Indeed, this comment supports the suspicion that the policy is based on racial stereotypes and outmoded fears about the dangers of racial integration.  This Court should give no credence to such cynical, reflexive conclusions about race.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 Palmore
				</em>

				<em>
					Sidoti

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">536</a> (1963)
 (rejecting the citys plea for delay in desegregating public facilities when neither the asserted fears of violence and tumult nor the asserted inability to preserve the peace was demonstrated at trial to be anything more than personal speculations or vague disquietudes of city officials).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The very real risk that prejudice (whether conscious or not) partly underlies the CDCs policy counsels in favor of relaxing the usual deference we pay to corrections officials in these matters.  We should instead insist on hard evidence, especially given that Californias policy is an outlier when compared to nationwide practice.  The Federal Bureau of Prisons administers 104 institutions; no similar policy is applied in any of them.  Countless state penal institutions are operated without such a policy.  An 
				<em>
					amici
				</em>
				 brief filed by six former state corrections officials with an aggregate of over 120 years of experience managing prison systems in Wisconsin, Georgia, Oklahoma, Kansas, Alaska, and Washington makes clear that a blanket policy of even temporary segregation runs counter to the great weight of professional opinion on sound prison management.  See Brief for Former State Corrections Officials as 
				<em>
					Amici Curiae 
				</em>
				19.  Tellingly, the CDC can only point to two other States, Texas and Oklahoma, that use racial status in assigning inmates in prison reception areas.  It is doubtful from the record that these States policies have the same broad and inflexible sweep as Californias, and this is ultimately beside the point.  What is important is that the Federal Government and the vast majority of States address the threat of interracial violence in prisons without resorting to the expedient of segregation.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In support of its policy, the CDC offers poignant evidence that its prisons are infested with violent race-based gangs.  The most striking of this evidence involves a series of riots that took place between 1998 and 2001 at Pelican Bay State Prison.  That prison houses some of the States most violent criminal offenders, including validated gang members who have been transferred from other prisons.  The riots involved both interracial and intraracial violence.  In the most serious incident, involving 250300 inmates, Southern Hispanic gang members, joined by some white inmates, attacked a number of black inmates.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Our judicial role, however, requires that we scratch below the surface of this evidence, lest the sheer gravity of a threat be allowed to authorize any policy justified in its name.  Upon inspection, the CDCs 
				<em>
					post hoc
				</em>
				, generalized evidence of gang violence is only tenuously related to its segregation policy.  Significantly, the CDC has not cited a single specific incident of interracial violence between cellmatesmuch less a 
				<em>
					pattern 
				</em>
				of such violencethat prompted the adoption of its unique policy years ago.  Nor is there any indication that antagonism between cellmates played any role in the more recent riots the CDC mentions.  And despite the CDCs focus on prison gangs and its suggestion that such gangs will recruit new inmates into committing racial violence during their 60-day stays in the reception centers, the CDC has cited no evidence of such recruitment, nor has it identified any instances in which new inmates committed racial violence against other new inmates in the common areas, such as the yard or the cafeteria.  Perhaps the CDCs evidence might provide a basis for arguing that at Pelican Bay and other facilities that have experienced similar riots, some race-conscious measures are justified if properly tailored.  See
				<em>
					 Lee 
				</em>
				v.
				<em>
					 Washington
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/390/333" class="subref" title="subref">390 U. S. 333</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">334</a> (1968)
 (Black, J., concurring).  But even if the incidents cited by the CDC, which occurred in the general prison population, were relevant to the conditions in the reception centers, they provide no support for the CDCs decision to apply its segregation policy to 
				<em>

The Federal Bureau of Prisons and other state systems do so without any apparent difficulty.  For inmates who are being transferred from one facility to anotherwho represent approximately 85% of those subject to the segregation policythe CDC can simply examine their prison records to determine if they have any known gang affiliations or if they have ever engaged in or threatened racial violence.

				In my judgment a state policy of segregating prisoners by race during the first 60 days of their incarceration, as well as the first 60 days after their transfer from one facility to another, violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>.  The California Department of Corrections (CDC) has had an ample opportunity to justify its policy during the course of this litigation, but has utterly failed to do so whether judged under strict scrutiny or the more deferential standard set out in

.  The CDC had no incentive in the proceedings below to withhold evidence supporting its policy; nor has the CDC made any offer of proof to suggest that a remand for further factual development would serve any purpose other than to postpone the inevitable.  I therefore agree with the submission of the United States as 
				<em>

				 that the Court should hold the policy unconstitutional on the current record.

				The CDCs segregation policy

                    <b>

            </a>
				 is based on a conclusive presumption that housing inmates of different races together creates an unacceptable risk of racial violence.  Under the policys logic, an inmates race is a proxy for gang membership, and gang membership is a proxy for violence.  The CDC, however, has offered scant empirical evidence or expert opinion to justify this use of race under even a minimal level of constitutional scrutiny.  The presumption underlying the policy is undoubtedly overbroad.  The CDC has made no effort to prove what fraction of new or transferred inmates are members of race-based gangs, nor has it shown more generally that interracial violence is disproportionately greater than intraracial violence in its prisons.  Proclivity toward racial violence unquestionably varies from inmate to inmate, yet the CDC applies its blunderbuss policy to 
				<em>
					all 
				</em>
				new and transferred inmates housed in double cells regardless of their criminal histories or records of previous incarceration.  Under the CDCs policy, for example, two car thieves of different racesneither of whom has any history of gang involvement, or of violence, for that matterwould be barred from being housed together during their first two months of prison.  This result derives from the CDCs inflexible judgment that such integrated living conditions are simply too dangerous.  This Court has never countenanced such racial prophylaxis.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				To establish a link between integrated cells and violence, the CDC relies on the views of two state corrections officials.  They attested to their belief that double-celling members of different races would lead to violence and that this violence would spill out into the prison yards.  One of these officials, an associate warden, testified as follows: 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				[W]ith the Asian population, the control sergeants have to be more careful than they do with Blacks, Whites, and Hispanics because, for example, you cannot house a Japanese inmate with a Chinese inmate.  You cannot.  They will kill each other.  They wont even tell you about it.  They will just do it.  The same with Laotians, Vietnamese, Cambodians, Filipinos.  You have to be very careful about housing other Asians with other Asians.  Its very culturally heavy.  App. 189a.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
Such musings inspire little confidence.  Indeed, this comment supports the suspicion that the policy is based on racial stereotypes and outmoded fears about the dangers of racial integration.  This Court should give no credence to such cynical, reflexive conclusions about race.  See,

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The very real risk that prejudice (whether conscious or not) partly underlies the CDCs policy counsels in favor of relaxing the usual deference we pay to corrections officials in these matters.  We should instead insist on hard evidence, especially given that Californias policy is an outlier when compared to nationwide practice.  The Federal Bureau of Prisons administers 104 institutions; no similar policy is applied in any of them.  Countless state penal institutions are operated without such a policy.  An 
				<em>
					amici
				</em>
				 brief filed by six former state corrections officials with an aggregate of over 120 years of experience managing prison systems in Wisconsin, Georgia, Oklahoma, Kansas, Alaska, and Washington makes clear that a blanket policy of even temporary segregation runs counter to the great weight of professional opinion on sound prison management.  See Brief for Former State Corrections Officials as 
				<em>
					Amici Curiae 
				</em>
				19.  Tellingly, the CDC can only point to two other States, Texas and Oklahoma, that use racial status in assigning inmates in prison reception areas.  It is doubtful from the record that these States policies have the same broad and inflexible sweep as Californias, and this is ultimately beside the point.  What is important is that the Federal Government and the vast majority of States address the threat of interracial violence in prisons without resorting to the expedient of segregation.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In support of its policy, the CDC offers poignant evidence that its prisons are infested with violent race-based gangs.  The most striking of this evidence involves a series of riots that took place between 1998 and 2001 at Pelican Bay State Prison.  That prison houses some of the States most violent criminal offenders, including validated gang members who have been transferred from other prisons.  The riots involved both interracial and intraracial violence.  In the most serious incident, involving 250300 inmates, Southern Hispanic gang members, joined by some white inmates, attacked a number of black inmates.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Our judicial role, however, requires that we scratch below the surface of this evidence, lest the sheer gravity of a threat be allowed to authorize any policy justified in its name.  Upon inspection, the CDCs 
				<em>
					post hoc
				</em>
				, generalized evidence of gang violence is only tenuously related to its segregation policy.  Significantly, the CDC has not cited a single specific incident of interracial violence between cellmatesmuch less a 
				<em>
					pattern 
				</em>
				of such violencethat prompted the adoption of its unique policy years ago.  Nor is there any indication that antagonism between cellmates played any role in the more recent riots the CDC mentions.  And despite the CDCs focus on prison gangs and its suggestion that such gangs will recruit new inmates into committing racial violence during their 60-day stays in the reception centers, the CDC has cited no evidence of such recruitment, nor has it identified any instances in which new inmates committed racial violence against other new inmates in the common areas, such as the yard or the cafeteria.  Perhaps the CDCs evidence might provide a basis for arguing that at Pelican Bay and other facilities that have experienced similar riots, some race-conscious measures are justified if properly tailored.  See
				<em>
					 Lee 
				</em>
				v.
				<em>
					 Washington

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">334</a> (1968)
 (Black, J., concurring).  But even if the incidents cited by the CDC, which occurred in the general prison population, were relevant to the conditions in the reception centers, they provide no support for the CDCs decision to apply its segregation policy to 
				<em>
					all 
				</em>
				of its reception centers, without regard for each centers security level or history of racial violence.  Nor do the incidents provide any support for a policy applicable only to cellmates, while the common areas of the prison in which the disturbances occurred remain fully integrated.

				 is based on a conclusive presumption that housing inmates of different races together creates an unacceptable risk of racial violence.  Under the policys logic, an inmates race is a proxy for gang membership, and gang membership is a proxy for violence.  The CDC, however, has offered scant empirical evidence or expert opinion to justify this use of race under even a minimal level of constitutional scrutiny.  The presumption underlying the policy is undoubtedly overbroad.  The CDC has made no effort to prove what fraction of new or transferred inmates are members of race-based gangs, nor has it shown more generally that interracial violence is disproportionately greater than intraracial violence in its prisons.  Proclivity toward racial violence unquestionably varies from inmate to inmate, yet the CDC applies its blunderbuss policy to 
				<em>

				new and transferred inmates housed in double cells regardless of their criminal histories or records of previous incarceration.  Under the CDCs policy, for example, two car thieves of different racesneither of whom has any history of gang involvement, or of violence, for that matterwould be barred from being housed together during their first two months of prison.  This result derives from the CDCs inflexible judgment that such integrated living conditions are simply too dangerous.  This Court has never countenanced such racial prophylaxis.

				The very real risk that prejudice (whether conscious or not) partly underlies the CDCs policy counsels in favor of relaxing the usual deference we pay to corrections officials in these matters.  We should instead insist on hard evidence, especially given that Californias policy is an outlier when compared to nationwide practice.  The Federal Bureau of Prisons administers 104 institutions; no similar policy is applied in any of them.  Countless state penal institutions are operated without such a policy.  An 
				<em>

				19.  Tellingly, the CDC can only point to two other States, Texas and Oklahoma, that use racial status in assigning inmates in prison reception areas.  It is doubtful from the record that these States policies have the same broad and inflexible sweep as Californias, and this is ultimately beside the point.  What is important is that the Federal Government and the vast majority of States address the threat of interracial violence in prisons without resorting to the expedient of segregation.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In support of its policy, the CDC offers poignant evidence that its prisons are infested with violent race-based gangs.  The most striking of this evidence involves a series of riots that took place between 1998 and 2001 at Pelican Bay State Prison.  That prison houses some of the States most violent criminal offenders, including validated gang members who have been transferred from other prisons.  The riots involved both interracial and intraracial violence.  In the most serious incident, involving 250300 inmates, Southern Hispanic gang members, joined by some white inmates, attacked a number of black inmates.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Our judicial role, however, requires that we scratch below the surface of this evidence, lest the sheer gravity of a threat be allowed to authorize any policy justified in its name.  Upon inspection, the CDCs 
				<em>
					post hoc
				</em>
				, generalized evidence of gang violence is only tenuously related to its segregation policy.  Significantly, the CDC has not cited a single specific incident of interracial violence between cellmatesmuch less a 
				<em>
					pattern 
				</em>
				of such violencethat prompted the adoption of its unique policy years ago.  Nor is there any indication that antagonism between cellmates played any role in the more recent riots the CDC mentions.  And despite the CDCs focus on prison gangs and its suggestion that such gangs will recruit new inmates into committing racial violence during their 60-day stays in the reception centers, the CDC has cited no evidence of such recruitment, nor has it identified any instances in which new inmates committed racial violence against other new inmates in the common areas, such as the yard or the cafeteria.  Perhaps the CDCs evidence might provide a basis for arguing that at Pelican Bay and other facilities that have experienced similar riots, some race-conscious measures are justified if properly tailored.  See

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">334</a> (1968)
 (Black, J., concurring).  But even if the incidents cited by the CDC, which occurred in the general prison population, were relevant to the conditions in the reception centers, they provide no support for the CDCs decision to apply its segregation policy to 
				<em>
					all 
				</em>
				of its reception centers, without regard for each centers security level or history of racial violence.  Nor do the incidents provide any support for a policy applicable only to cellmates, while the common areas of the prison in which the disturbances occurred remain fully integrated.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Given the inherent indignity of segregation and its shameful historical connotations, one might assume that the CDC came to its policy only as a last resort.  Distressingly, this is not so: There is no evidence that the CDC has ever experimented with, or even carefully considered, race-neutral methods of achieving its goals.  That the policy is unwritten reflects, I think, the evident lack of deliberation that preceded its creation.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Specifically, the CDC has failed to explain why it could not, as an alternative to automatic segregation, rely on an individualized assessment of each inmates risk of violence when assigning him to a cell in a reception center.  The Federal Bureau of Prisons and other state systems do so without any apparent difficulty.  For inmates who are being transferred from one facility to anotherwho represent approximately 85% of those subject to the segregation policythe CDC can simply examine their prison records to determine if they have any known gang affiliations or if they have ever engaged in or threatened racial violence.  For example, the CDC has had an opportunity to observe the petitioner for almost 20 years; surely the CDC could have determined his placement without subjecting him to a period of segregation.

            </a>
				  For new inmates, assignments can be based on their presentence reports, which contain information about offense conduct, criminal record, and personal historyincluding any available information about gang affiliations.  In fact, state law requires the county probation officer to transmit a presentence report to the CDC along with an inmates commitment papers.  See Cal. Penal Code Ann. §1203c (West 2004); Cal. Rule of Court 4.411(d) (Criminal Cases) (West Supp. 2004).

				Despite the rich information available in these records, the CDC considers these records only rarely in assigning inmates to cells in the reception centers.  The CDCs primary explanation for this is administrative inefficiencythe records, it says, simply do not arrive in time.  The CDCs counsel conceded at oral argument that presentence reports have a fair amount of information, but she stated that, in California, the presentence report does not always accompany the inmate and frequently does not.  It follows some period of time later from the county.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 33.  Despite the state-law requirement to the contrary, counsel informed the Court that the counties are not preparing the presentence reports in a timely fashion.

				In fact, the CDCs failure to demand timely presentence reports and prison records undercuts the sincerity of its concern for inmate security during the reception process.  Race is an unreliable and necessarily underinclusive predictor of violence.  Without the inmate-specific information found in the records, there is a risk that corrections officials will, for example, house together inmates of the same race who are nevertheless members of rival gangs, such as the Bloods and Crips.

						 The CDC operates 32 prisons, 7 of which house reception centers.  All new inmates and all inmates transferring between prisons are funneled through one of these reception centers before they are permanently placed.  At the centers, inmates are housed either in dormitories, double cells, or single cells (of which there are few).  Under the CDCs segregation policy, race is a determinative factor in placing inmates in double cells, regardless of the other factors considered in such decisions.  While a corrections official with 24 years of experience testified that an exception to this policy was once granted to a Hispanic inmate who had been raised with Crips, App. 184a, the CDCs suggestion that its policy is therefore flexible, see Brief for Respondents 9, strains credulity.  There is no evidence that the CDC routinely allows inmates to opt-out of segregation, much less evidence that the CDC informs inmates of their supposed right to do so.

						 In explaining why it cannot prescreen new inmates, the CDCs brief all but concedes that segregating transferred inmates is unnecessary.  See Brief for Respondents 42 (If the officials had all of the necessary information to assess the inmates violence potential when the inmates arrived, perhaps a different practice could be used.  But unlike the federal system, where the inmates are generally in federal custody from the moment they are arrested, state inmates are in county custody until they are convicted and later transferred to the custody of the CDC).

, I find it unnecessary to address specifically the other factors, such as whether new and transferred inmates have alternative means of exercising their right to equal protection during their period of housing segregation, id., at 89.  Indeed, this case demonstrates once again that [h]ow a court describes its standard of review when a prison regulation infringes fundamental constitutional rights often has far less consequences for the inmates than the actual showing that the court demands of the State in order to uphold the regulation.  Id., at 100 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)

						 The CDCs policy may be counterproductive in other ways.  For example, an official policy of segregation may initiate new arrivals into a corrosive culture of prison racial segregation, lending credence to the view that members of other races are to be feared and that racial alliances are necessary.  While integrated cells encourage inmates to gain valuable cross-racial experiences, segregated cells may well facilitate the formation of race-based gangs.  See Brief for Former State Corrections Officials as Amici Curiae 19 (citing evidence and experience suggesting that the racial integration of cells on balance decreases interracial violence).

The Federal Bureau of Prisons and other state systems do so without any apparent difficulty.  For inmates who are being transferred from one facility to anotherwho represent approximately 85% of those subject to the segregation policythe CDC can simply examine their prison records to determine if they have any known gang affiliations or if they have ever engaged in or threatened racial violence.  For example, the CDC has had an opportunity to observe the petitioner for almost 20 years; surely the CDC could have determined his placement without subjecting him to a period of segregation.

				In my judgment a state policy of segregating prisoners by race during the first 60 days of their incarceration, as well as the first 60 days after their transfer from one facility to another, violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>.  The California Department of Corrections (CDC) has had an ample opportunity to justify its policy during the course of this litigation, but has utterly failed to do so whether judged under strict scrutiny or the more deferential standard set out in

				 v.

.  The CDC had no incentive in the proceedings below to withhold evidence supporting its policy; nor has the CDC made any offer of proof to suggest that a remand for further factual development would serve any purpose other than to postpone the inevitable.  I therefore agree with the submission of the United States as 
				<em>

				 that the Court should hold the policy unconstitutional on the current record.

				The CDCs segregation policy

            </a>
				 is based on a conclusive presumption that housing inmates of different races together creates an unacceptable risk of racial violence.  Under the policys logic, an inmates race is a proxy for gang membership, and gang membership is a proxy for violence.  The CDC, however, has offered scant empirical evidence or expert opinion to justify this use of race under even a minimal level of constitutional scrutiny.  The presumption underlying the policy is undoubtedly overbroad.  The CDC has made no effort to prove what fraction of new or transferred inmates are members of race-based gangs, nor has it shown more generally that interracial violence is disproportionately greater than intraracial violence in its prisons.  Proclivity toward racial violence unquestionably varies from inmate to inmate, yet the CDC applies its blunderbuss policy to 
				<em>
					all 
				</em>
				new and transferred inmates housed in double cells regardless of their criminal histories or records of previous incarceration.  Under the CDCs policy, for example, two car thieves of different racesneither of whom has any history of gang involvement, or of violence, for that matterwould be barred from being housed together during their first two months of prison.  This result derives from the CDCs inflexible judgment that such integrated living conditions are simply too dangerous.  This Court has never countenanced such racial prophylaxis.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				To establish a link between integrated cells and violence, the CDC relies on the views of two state corrections officials.  They attested to their belief that double-celling members of different races would lead to violence and that this violence would spill out into the prison yards.  One of these officials, an associate warden, testified as follows: 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				[W]ith the Asian population, the control sergeants have to be more careful than they do with Blacks, Whites, and Hispanics because, for example, you cannot house a Japanese inmate with a Chinese inmate.  You cannot.  They will kill each other.  They wont even tell you about it.  They will just do it.  The same with Laotians, Vietnamese, Cambodians, Filipinos.  You have to be very careful about housing other Asians with other Asians.  Its very culturally heavy.  App. 189a.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
Such musings inspire little confidence.  Indeed, this comment supports the suspicion that the policy is based on racial stereotypes and outmoded fears about the dangers of racial integration.  This Court should give no credence to such cynical, reflexive conclusions about race.  See,

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The very real risk that prejudice (whether conscious or not) partly underlies the CDCs policy counsels in favor of relaxing the usual deference we pay to corrections officials in these matters.  We should instead insist on hard evidence, especially given that Californias policy is an outlier when compared to nationwide practice.  The Federal Bureau of Prisons administers 104 institutions; no similar policy is applied in any of them.  Countless state penal institutions are operated without such a policy.  An 
				<em>
					amici
				</em>
				 brief filed by six former state corrections officials with an aggregate of over 120 years of experience managing prison systems in Wisconsin, Georgia, Oklahoma, Kansas, Alaska, and Washington makes clear that a blanket policy of even temporary segregation runs counter to the great weight of professional opinion on sound prison management.  See Brief for Former State Corrections Officials as 
				<em>
					Amici Curiae 
				</em>
				19.  Tellingly, the CDC can only point to two other States, Texas and Oklahoma, that use racial status in assigning inmates in prison reception areas.  It is doubtful from the record that these States policies have the same broad and inflexible sweep as Californias, and this is ultimately beside the point.  What is important is that the Federal Government and the vast majority of States address the threat of interracial violence in prisons without resorting to the expedient of segregation.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In support of its policy, the CDC offers poignant evidence that its prisons are infested with violent race-based gangs.  The most striking of this evidence involves a series of riots that took place between 1998 and 2001 at Pelican Bay State Prison.  That prison houses some of the States most violent criminal offenders, including validated gang members who have been transferred from other prisons.  The riots involved both interracial and intraracial violence.  In the most serious incident, involving 250300 inmates, Southern Hispanic gang members, joined by some white inmates, attacked a number of black inmates.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Our judicial role, however, requires that we scratch below the surface of this evidence, lest the sheer gravity of a threat be allowed to authorize any policy justified in its name.  Upon inspection, the CDCs 
				<em>
					post hoc
				</em>
				, generalized evidence of gang violence is only tenuously related to its segregation policy.  Significantly, the CDC has not cited a single specific incident of interracial violence between cellmatesmuch less a 
				<em>
					pattern 
				</em>
				of such violencethat prompted the adoption of its unique policy years ago.  Nor is there any indication that antagonism between cellmates played any role in the more recent riots the CDC mentions.  And despite the CDCs focus on prison gangs and its suggestion that such gangs will recruit new inmates into committing racial violence during their 60-day stays in the reception centers, the CDC has cited no evidence of such recruitment, nor has it identified any instances in which new inmates committed racial violence against other new inmates in the common areas, such as the yard or the cafeteria.  Perhaps the CDCs evidence might provide a basis for arguing that at Pelican Bay and other facilities that have experienced similar riots, some race-conscious measures are justified if properly tailored.

Under the policys logic, an inmates race is a proxy for gang membership, and gang membership is a proxy for violence.  The CDC, however, has offered scant empirical evidence or expert opinion to justify this use of race under even a minimal level of constitutional scrutiny.  The presumption underlying the policy is undoubtedly overbroad.  The CDC has made no effort to prove what fraction of new or transferred inmates are members of race-based gangs, nor has it shown more generally that interracial violence is disproportionately greater than intraracial violence in its prisons.  Proclivity toward racial violence unquestionably varies from inmate to inmate, yet the CDC applies its blunderbuss policy to

				new and transferred inmates housed in double cells regardless of their criminal histories or records of previous incarceration.  Under the CDCs policy, for example, two car thieves of different racesneither of whom has any history of gang involvement, or of violence, for that matterwould be barred from being housed together during their first two months of prison.  This result derives from the CDCs inflexible judgment that such integrated living conditions are simply too dangerous.  This Court has never countenanced such racial prophylaxis.

				The very real risk that prejudice (whether conscious or not) partly underlies the CDCs policy counsels in favor of relaxing the usual deference we pay to corrections officials in these matters.  We should instead insist on hard evidence, especially given that Californias policy is an outlier when compared to nationwide practice.  The Federal Bureau of Prisons administers 104 institutions; no similar policy is applied in any of them.  Countless state penal institutions are operated without such a policy.  An 
				<em>
					amici
				</em>
				 brief filed by six former state corrections officials with an aggregate of over 120 years of experience managing prison systems in Wisconsin, Georgia, Oklahoma, Kansas, Alaska, and Washington makes clear that a blanket policy of even temporary segregation runs counter to the great weight of professional opinion on sound prison management.

				19.  Tellingly, the CDC can only point to two other States, Texas and Oklahoma, that use racial status in assigning inmates in prison reception areas.  It is doubtful from the record that these States policies have the same broad and inflexible sweep as Californias, and this is ultimately beside the point.  What is important is that the Federal Government and the vast majority of States address the threat of interracial violence in prisons without resorting to the expedient of segregation.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In support of its policy, the CDC offers poignant evidence that its prisons are infested with violent race-based gangs.  The most striking of this evidence involves a series of riots that took place between 1998 and 2001 at Pelican Bay State Prison.  That prison houses some of the States most violent criminal offenders, including validated gang members who have been transferred from other prisons.  The riots involved both interracial and intraracial violence.  In the most serious incident, involving 250300 inmates, Southern Hispanic gang members, joined by some white inmates, attacked a number of black inmates.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Our judicial role, however, requires that we scratch below the surface of this evidence, lest the sheer gravity of a threat be allowed to authorize any policy justified in its name.  Upon inspection, the CDCs 
				<em>
					post hoc
				</em>
				, generalized evidence of gang violence is only tenuously related to its segregation policy.  Significantly, the CDC has not cited a single specific incident of interracial violence between cellmatesmuch less a 
				<em>
					pattern 
				</em>
				of such violencethat prompted the adoption of its unique policy years ago.  Nor is there any indication that antagonism between cellmates played any role in the more recent riots the CDC mentions.  And despite the CDCs focus on prison gangs and its suggestion that such gangs will recruit new inmates into committing racial violence during their 60-day stays in the reception centers, the CDC has cited no evidence of such recruitment, nor has it identified any instances in which new inmates committed racial violence against other new inmates in the common areas, such as the yard or the cafeteria.  Perhaps the CDCs evidence might provide a basis for arguing that at Pelican Bay and other facilities that have experienced similar riots, some race-conscious measures are justified if properly tailored.  See
				<em>
					 Lee

				<em>
					 Washington

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">334</a> (1968)
 (Black, J., concurring).  But even if the incidents cited by the CDC, which occurred in the general prison population, were relevant to the conditions in the reception centers, they provide no support for the CDCs decision to apply its segregation policy to 
				<em>
					all 
				</em>
				of its reception centers, without regard for each centers security level or history of racial violence.  Nor do the incidents provide any support for a policy applicable only to cellmates, while the common areas of the prison in which the disturbances occurred remain fully integrated.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Given the inherent indignity of segregation and its shameful historical connotations, one might assume that the CDC came to its policy only as a last resort.  Distressingly, this is not so: There is no evidence that the CDC has ever experimented with, or even carefully considered, race-neutral methods of achieving its goals.  That the policy is unwritten reflects, I think, the evident lack of deliberation that preceded its creation.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Specifically, the CDC has failed to explain why it could not, as an alternative to automatic segregation, rely on an individualized assessment of each inmates risk of violence when assigning him to a cell in a reception center.  The Federal Bureau of Prisons and other state systems do so without any apparent difficulty.  For inmates who are being transferred from one facility to anotherwho represent approximately 85% of those subject to the segregation policythe CDC can simply examine their prison records to determine if they have any known gang affiliations or if they have ever engaged in or threatened racial violence.  For example, the CDC has had an opportunity to observe the petitioner for almost 20 years; surely the CDC could have determined his placement without subjecting him to a period of segregation.

            </a>
				  For new inmates, assignments can be based on their presentence reports, which contain information about offense conduct, criminal record, and personal historyincluding any available information about gang affiliations.  In fact, state law requires the county probation officer to transmit a presentence report to the CDC along with an inmates commitment papers.  See Cal. Penal Code Ann. §1203c (West 2004); Cal. Rule of Court 4.411(d) (Criminal Cases) (West Supp. 2004).

				Despite the rich information available in these records, the CDC considers these records only rarely in assigning inmates to cells in the reception centers.  The CDCs primary explanation for this is administrative inefficiencythe records, it says, simply do not arrive in time.  The CDCs counsel conceded at oral argument that presentence reports have a fair amount of information, but she stated that, in California, the presentence report does not always accompany the inmate and frequently does not.  It follows some period of time later from the county.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 33.  Despite the state-law requirement to the contrary, counsel informed the Court that the counties are not preparing the presentence reports in a timely fashion.

				In fact, the CDCs failure to demand timely presentence reports and prison records undercuts the sincerity of its concern for inmate security during the reception process.  Race is an unreliable and necessarily underinclusive predictor of violence.  Without the inmate-specific information found in the records, there is a risk that corrections officials will, for example, house together inmates of the same race who are nevertheless members of rival gangs, such as the Bloods and Crips.

						 The CDC operates 32 prisons, 7 of which house reception centers.  All new inmates and all inmates transferring between prisons are funneled through one of these reception centers before they are permanently placed.  At the centers, inmates are housed either in dormitories, double cells, or single cells (of which there are few).  Under the CDCs segregation policy, race is a determinative factor in placing inmates in double cells, regardless of the other factors considered in such decisions.  While a corrections official with 24 years of experience testified that an exception to this policy was once granted to a Hispanic inmate who had been raised with Crips, App. 184a, the CDCs suggestion that its policy is therefore flexible, see Brief for Respondents 9, strains credulity.  There is no evidence that the CDC routinely allows inmates to opt-out of segregation, much less evidence that the CDC informs inmates of their supposed right to do so.

The riots involved both interracial and intraracial violence.  In the most serious incident, involving 250300 inmates, Southern Hispanic gang members, joined by some white inmates, attacked a number of black inmates.

Nor is there any indication that antagonism between cellmates played any role in the more recent riots the CDC mentions.

				Given the inherent indignity of segregation and its shameful historical connotations, one might assume that the CDC came to its policy only as a last resort.

				Specifically, the CDC has failed to explain why it could not, as an alternative to automatic segregation, rely on an individualized assessment of each inmates risk of violence when assigning him to a cell in a reception center.  The Federal Bureau of Prisons and other state systems do so without any apparent difficulty.  For inmates who are being transferred from one facility to anotherwho represent approximately 85% of those subject to the segregation policythe CDC can simply examine their prison records to determine if they have any known gang affiliations or if they have ever engaged in or threatened racial violence.  For example, the CDC has had an opportunity to observe the petitioner for almost 20 years; surely the CDC could have determined his placement without subjecting him to a period of segregation.

						 The CDC operates 32 prisons, 7 of which house reception centers.  All new inmates and all inmates transferring between prisons are funneled through one of these reception centers before they are permanently placed.

Under the CDCs segregation policy, race is a determinative factor in placing inmates in double cells, regardless of the other factors considered in such decisions.

While integrated cells encourage inmates to gain valuable cross-racial experiences, segregated cells may well facilitate the formation of race-based gangs.

				In my judgment a state policy of segregating prisoners by race during the first 60 days of their incarceration, as well as the first 60 days after their transfer from one facility to another, violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>.  The California Department of Corrections (CDC) has had an ample opportunity to justify its policy during the course of this litigation, but has utterly failed to do so whether judged under strict scrutiny or the more deferential standard set out in

.  The CDC had no incentive in the proceedings below to withhold evidence supporting its policy; nor has the CDC made any offer of proof to suggest that a remand for further factual development would serve any purpose other than to postpone the inevitable.  I therefore agree with the submission of the United States as 
				<em>

				 that the Court should hold the policy unconstitutional on the current record.

            </a>
				 is based on a conclusive presumption that housing inmates of different races together creates an unacceptable risk of racial violence.  Under the policys logic, an inmates race is a proxy for gang membership, and gang membership is a proxy for violence.  The CDC, however, has offered scant empirical evidence or expert opinion to justify this use of race under even a minimal level of constitutional scrutiny.  The presumption underlying the policy is undoubtedly overbroad.  The CDC has made no effort to prove what fraction of new or transferred inmates are members of race-based gangs, nor has it shown more generally that interracial violence is disproportionately greater than intraracial violence in its prisons.  Proclivity toward racial violence unquestionably varies from inmate to inmate, yet the CDC applies its blunderbuss policy to 
				<em>
					all 
				</em>
				new and transferred inmates housed in double cells regardless of their criminal histories or records of previous incarceration.  Under the CDCs policy, for example, two car thieves of different racesneither of whom has any history of gang involvement, or of violence, for that matterwould be barred from being housed together during their first two months of prison.  This result derives from the CDCs inflexible judgment that such integrated living conditions are simply too dangerous.  This Court has never countenanced such racial prophylaxis.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				To establish a link between integrated cells and violence, the CDC relies on the views of two state corrections officials.  They attested to their belief that double-celling members of different races would lead to violence and that this violence would spill out into the prison yards.  One of these officials, an associate warden, testified as follows: 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				[W]ith the Asian population, the control sergeants have to be more careful than they do with Blacks, Whites, and Hispanics because, for example, you cannot house a Japanese inmate with a Chinese inmate.  You cannot.  They will kill each other.  They wont even tell you about it.  They will just do it.  The same with Laotians, Vietnamese, Cambodians, Filipinos.  You have to be very careful about housing other Asians with other Asians.  Its very culturally heavy.  App. 189a.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
Such musings inspire little confidence.  Indeed, this comment supports the suspicion that the policy is based on racial stereotypes and outmoded fears about the dangers of racial integration.  This Court should give no credence to such cynical, reflexive conclusions about race.  See,

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The very real risk that prejudice (whether conscious or not) partly underlies the CDCs policy counsels in favor of relaxing the usual deference we pay to corrections officials in these matters.  We should instead insist on hard evidence, especially given that Californias policy is an outlier when compared to nationwide practice.  The Federal Bureau of Prisons administers 104 institutions; no similar policy is applied in any of them.  Countless state penal institutions are operated without such a policy.  An 
				<em>
					amici
				</em>
				 brief filed by six former state corrections officials with an aggregate of over 120 years of experience managing prison systems in Wisconsin, Georgia, Oklahoma, Kansas, Alaska, and Washington makes clear that a blanket policy of even temporary segregation runs counter to the great weight of professional opinion on sound prison management.  See Brief for Former State Corrections Officials as 
				<em>
					Amici Curiae 
				</em>
				19.  Tellingly, the CDC can only point to two other States, Texas and Oklahoma, that use racial status in assigning inmates in prison reception areas.  It is doubtful from the record that these States policies have the same broad and inflexible sweep as Californias, and this is ultimately beside the point.  What is important is that the Federal Government and the vast majority of States address the threat of interracial violence in prisons without resorting to the expedient of segregation.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In support of its policy, the CDC offers poignant evidence that its prisons are infested with violent race-based gangs.

				 is based on a conclusive presumption that housing inmates of different races together creates an unacceptable risk of racial violence.  Under the policys logic, an inmates race is a proxy for gang membership, and gang membership is a proxy for violence.  The CDC, however, has offered scant empirical evidence or expert opinion to justify this use of race under even a minimal level of constitutional scrutiny.  The presumption underlying the policy is undoubtedly overbroad.  The CDC has made no effort to prove what fraction of new or transferred inmates are members of race-based gangs, nor has it shown more generally that interracial violence is disproportionately greater than intraracial violence in its prisons.  Proclivity toward racial violence unquestionably varies from inmate to inmate, yet the CDC applies its blunderbuss policy to

				new and transferred inmates housed in double cells regardless of their criminal histories or records of previous incarceration.  Under the CDCs policy, for example, two car thieves of different racesneither of whom has any history of gang involvement, or of violence, for that matterwould be barred from being housed together during their first two months of prison.  This result derives from the CDCs inflexible judgment that such integrated living conditions are simply too dangerous.  This Court has never countenanced such racial prophylaxis.

				The very real risk that prejudice (whether conscious or not) partly underlies the CDCs policy counsels in favor of relaxing the usual deference we pay to corrections officials in these matters.  We should instead insist on hard evidence, especially given that Californias policy is an outlier when compared to nationwide practice.  The Federal Bureau of Prisons administers 104 institutions; no similar policy is applied in any of them.  Countless state penal institutions are operated without such a policy.  An 
				<em>
					amici
				</em>
				 brief filed by six former state corrections officials with an aggregate of over 120 years of experience managing prison systems in Wisconsin, Georgia, Oklahoma, Kansas, Alaska, and Washington makes clear that a blanket policy of even temporary segregation runs counter to the great weight of professional opinion on sound prison management.  See Brief for Former State Corrections Officials as 
				<em>
					Amici Curiae 
				</em>
				19.  Tellingly, the CDC can only point to two other States, Texas and Oklahoma, that use racial status in assigning inmates in prison reception areas.  It is doubtful from the record that these States policies have the same broad and inflexible sweep as Californias, and this is ultimately beside the point.  What is important is that the Federal Government and the vast majority of States address the threat of interracial violence in prisons without resorting to the expedient of segregation.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In support of its policy, the CDC offers poignant evidence that its prisons are infested with violent race-based gangs.  The most striking of this evidence involves a series of riots that took place between 1998 and 2001 at Pelican Bay State Prison.  That prison houses some of the States most violent criminal offenders, including validated gang members who have been transferred from other prisons.  The riots involved both interracial and intraracial violence.  In the most serious incident, involving 250300 inmates, Southern Hispanic gang members, joined by some white inmates, attacked a number of black inmates.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Our judicial role, however, requires that we scratch below the surface of this evidence, lest the sheer gravity of a threat be allowed to authorize any policy justified in its name.  Upon inspection, the CDCs 
				<em>
					post hoc
				</em>
				, generalized evidence of gang violence is only tenuously related to its segregation policy.  Significantly, the CDC has not cited a single specific incident of interracial violence between cellmatesmuch less a 
				<em>
					pattern 
				</em>
				of such violencethat prompted the adoption of its unique policy years ago.  Nor is there any indication that antagonism between cellmates played any role in the more recent riots the CDC mentions.  And despite the CDCs focus on prison gangs and its suggestion that such gangs will recruit new inmates into committing racial violence during their 60-day stays in the reception centers, the CDC has cited no evidence of such recruitment, nor has it identified any instances in which new inmates committed racial violence against other new inmates in the common areas, such as the yard or the cafeteria.  Perhaps the CDCs evidence might provide a basis for arguing that at Pelican Bay and other facilities that have experienced similar riots, some race-conscious measures are justified if properly tailored.  See
				<em>
					 Lee 
				</em>
				v.
				<em>
					 Washington

				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/390/333" class="subref" title="subref">390 U. S. 333</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">334</a> (1968)
 (Black, J., concurring).  But even if the incidents cited by the CDC, which occurred in the general prison population, were relevant to the conditions in the reception centers, they provide no support for the CDCs decision to apply its segregation policy to 
				<em>
					all 
				</em>
				of its reception centers, without regard for each centers security level or history of racial violence.  Nor do the incidents provide any support for a policy applicable only to cellmates, while the common areas of the prison in which the disturbances occurred remain fully integrated.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Given the inherent indignity of segregation and its shameful historical connotations, one might assume that the CDC came to its policy only as a last resort.  Distressingly, this is not so: There is no evidence that the CDC has ever experimented with, or even carefully considered, race-neutral methods of achieving its goals.  That the policy is unwritten reflects, I think, the evident lack of deliberation that preceded its creation.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Specifically, the CDC has failed to explain why it could not, as an alternative to automatic segregation, rely on an individualized assessment of each inmates risk of violence when assigning him to a cell in a reception center.  The Federal Bureau of Prisons and other state systems do so without any apparent difficulty.  For inmates who are being transferred from one facility to anotherwho represent approximately 85% of those subject to the segregation policythe CDC can simply examine their prison records to determine if they have any known gang affiliations or if they have ever engaged in or threatened racial violence.  For example, the CDC has had an opportunity to observe the petitioner for almost 20 years; surely the CDC could have determined his placement without subjecting him to a period of segregation.

            </a>
				  For new inmates, assignments can be based on their presentence reports, which contain information about offense conduct, criminal record, and personal historyincluding any available information about gang affiliations.  In fact, state law requires the county probation officer to transmit a presentence report to the CDC along with an inmates commitment papers.  See Cal. Penal Code Ann. §1203c (West 2004); Cal. Rule of Court 4.411(d) (Criminal Cases) (West Supp. 2004).

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Despite the rich information available in these records, the CDC considers these records only rarely in assigning inmates to cells in the reception centers.  The CDCs primary explanation for this is administrative inefficiencythe records, it says, simply do not arrive in time.  The CDCs counsel conceded at oral argument that presentence reports have a fair amount of information, but she stated that, in California, the presentence report does not always accompany the inmate and frequently does not.  It follows some period of time later from the county.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 33.  Despite the state-law requirement to the contrary, counsel informed the Court that the counties are not preparing the presentence reports in a timely fashion.

				In fact, the CDCs failure to demand timely presentence reports and prison records undercuts the sincerity of its concern for inmate security during the reception process.  Race is an unreliable and necessarily underinclusive predictor of violence.  Without the inmate-specific information found in the records, there is a risk that corrections officials will, for example, house together inmates of the same race who are nevertheless members of rival gangs, such as the Bloods and Crips.

						 The CDC operates 32 prisons, 7 of which house reception centers.  All new inmates and all inmates transferring between prisons are funneled through one of these reception centers before they are permanently placed.  At the centers, inmates are housed either in dormitories, double cells, or single cells (of which there are few).  Under the CDCs segregation policy, race is a determinative factor in placing inmates in double cells, regardless of the other factors considered in such decisions.  While a corrections official with 24 years of experience testified that an exception to this policy was once granted to a Hispanic inmate who had been raised with Crips, App. 184a, the CDCs suggestion that its policy is therefore flexible, see Brief for Respondents 9, strains credulity.  There is no evidence that the CDC routinely allows inmates to opt-out of segregation, much less evidence that the CDC informs inmates of their supposed right to do so.

				19.  Tellingly, the CDC can only point to two other States, Texas and Oklahoma, that use racial status in assigning inmates in prison reception areas.  It is doubtful from the record that these States policies have the same broad and inflexible sweep as Californias, and this is ultimately beside the point.  What is important is that the Federal Government and the vast majority of States address the threat of interracial violence in prisons without resorting to the expedient of segregation.

				In support of its policy, the CDC offers poignant evidence that its prisons are infested with violent race-based gangs.  The most striking of this evidence involves a series of riots that took place between 1998 and 2001 at Pelican Bay State Prison.  That prison houses some of the States most violent criminal offenders, including validated gang members who have been transferred from other prisons.  The riots involved both interracial and intraracial violence.  In the most serious incident, involving 250300 inmates, Southern Hispanic gang members, joined by some white inmates, attacked a number of black inmates.

				Our judicial role, however, requires that we scratch below the surface of this evidence, lest the sheer gravity of a threat be allowed to authorize any policy justified in its name.  Upon inspection, the CDCs 
				<em>

				</em>
				, generalized evidence of gang violence is only tenuously related to its segregation policy.  Significantly, the CDC has not cited a single specific incident of interracial violence between cellmatesmuch less a 
				<em>
					pattern 
				</em>
				of such violencethat prompted the adoption of its unique policy years ago.  Nor is there any indication that antagonism between cellmates played any role in the more recent riots the CDC mentions.  And despite the CDCs focus on prison gangs and its suggestion that such gangs will recruit new inmates into committing racial violence during their 60-day stays in the reception centers, the CDC has cited no evidence of such recruitment, nor has it identified any instances in which new inmates committed racial violence against other new inmates in the common areas, such as the yard or the cafeteria.  Perhaps the CDCs evidence might provide a basis for arguing that at Pelican Bay and other facilities that have experienced similar riots, some race-conscious measures are justified if properly tailored.

				<em>

				</em>
				of its reception centers, without regard for each centers security level or history of racial violence.  Nor do the incidents provide any support for a policy applicable only to cellmates, while the common areas of the prison in which the disturbances occurred remain fully integrated.

				Given the inherent indignity of segregation and its shameful historical connotations, one might assume that the CDC came to its policy only as a last resort.

				Specifically, the CDC has failed to explain why it could not, as an alternative to automatic segregation, rely on an individualized assessment of each inmates risk of violence when assigning him to a cell in a reception center.  The Federal Bureau of Prisons and other state systems do so without any apparent difficulty.  For inmates who are being transferred from one facility to anotherwho represent approximately 85% of those subject to the segregation policythe CDC can simply examine their prison records to determine if they have any known gang affiliations or if they have ever engaged in or threatened racial violence.  For example, the CDC has had an opportunity to observe the petitioner for almost 20 years; surely the CDC could have determined his placement without subjecting him to a period of segregation.

				In fact, the CDCs failure to demand timely presentence reports and prison records undercuts the sincerity of its concern for inmate security during the reception process.

						 The CDC operates 32 prisons, 7 of which house reception centers.  All new inmates and all inmates transferring between prisons are funneled through one of these reception centers before they are permanently placed.  At the centers, inmates are housed either in dormitories, double cells, or single cells (of which there are few).  Under the CDCs segregation policy, race is a determinative factor in placing inmates in double cells, regardless of the other factors considered in such decisions.  While a corrections official with 24 years of experience testified that an exception to this policy was once granted to a Hispanic inmate who had been raised with Crips, App. 184a, the CDCs suggestion that its policy is therefore flexible, see Brief for Respondents 9, strains credulity.  There is no evidence that the CDC routinely allows inmates to opt-out of segregation, much less evidence that the CDC informs inmates of their supposed right to do so.

						 In explaining why it cannot prescreen new inmates, the CDCs brief all but concedes that segregating transferred inmates is unnecessary.  See Brief for Respondents 42 (If the officials had all of the necessary information to assess the inmates violence potential when the inmates arrived, perhaps a different practice could be used.  But unlike the federal system, where the inmates are generally in federal custody from the moment they are arrested, state inmates are in county custody until they are convicted and later transferred to the custody of the CDC).

Indeed, this case demonstrates once again that [h]ow a court describes its standard of review when a prison regulation infringes fundamental constitutional rights often has far less consequences for the inmates than the actual showing that the court demands of the State in order to uphold the regulation.  Id., at 100 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)

						 The CDCs policy may be counterproductive in other ways.  For example, an official policy of segregation may initiate new arrivals into a corrosive culture of prison racial segregation, lending credence to the view that members of other races are to be feared and that racial alliances are necessary.  While integrated cells encourage inmates to gain valuable cross-racial experiences, segregated cells may well facilitate the formation of race-based gangs.  See Brief for Former State Corrections Officials as Amici Curiae 19 (citing evidence and experience suggesting that the racial integration of cells on balance decreases interracial violence).

				In my judgment a state policy of segregating prisoners by race during the first 60 days of their incarceration, as well as the first 60 days after their transfer from one facility to another, violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>.  The California Department of Corrections (CDC) has had an ample opportunity to justify its policy during the course of this litigation, but has utterly failed to do so whether judged under strict scrutiny or the more deferential standard set out in

.  The CDC had no incentive in the proceedings below to withhold evidence supporting its policy; nor has the CDC made any offer of proof to suggest that a remand for further factual development would serve any purpose other than to postpone the inevitable.  I therefore agree with the submission of the United States as 
				<em>

				 that the Court should hold the policy unconstitutional on the current record.

            </a>
				 is based on a conclusive presumption that housing inmates of different races together creates an unacceptable risk of racial violence.  Under the policys logic, an inmates race is a proxy for gang membership, and gang membership is a proxy for violence.  The CDC, however, has offered scant empirical evidence or expert opinion to justify this use of race under even a minimal level of constitutional scrutiny.  The presumption underlying the policy is undoubtedly overbroad.  The CDC has made no effort to prove what fraction of new or transferred inmates are members of race-based gangs, nor has it shown more generally that interracial violence is disproportionately greater than intraracial violence in its prisons.  Proclivity toward racial violence unquestionably varies from inmate to inmate, yet the CDC applies its blunderbuss policy to 
				<em>
					all 
				</em>
				new and transferred inmates housed in double cells regardless of their criminal histories or records of previous incarceration.  Under the CDCs policy, for example, two car thieves of different racesneither of whom has any history of gang involvement, or of violence, for that matterwould be barred from being housed together during their first two months of prison.  This result derives from the CDCs inflexible judgment that such integrated living conditions are simply too dangerous.  This Court has never countenanced such racial prophylaxis.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				To establish a link between integrated cells and violence, the CDC relies on the views of two state corrections officials.  They attested to their belief that double-celling members of different races would lead to violence and that this violence would spill out into the prison yards.  One of these officials, an associate warden, testified as follows: 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				[W]ith the Asian population, the control sergeants have to be more careful than they do with Blacks, Whites, and Hispanics because, for example, you cannot house a Japanese inmate with a Chinese inmate.  You cannot.  They will kill each other.  They wont even tell you about it.  They will just do it.  The same with Laotians, Vietnamese, Cambodians, Filipinos.  You have to be very careful about housing other Asians with other Asians.  Its very culturally heavy.  App. 189a.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
Such musings inspire little confidence.  Indeed, this comment supports the suspicion that the policy is based on racial stereotypes and outmoded fears about the dangers of racial integration.  This Court should give no credence to such cynical, reflexive conclusions about race.  See,

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The very real risk that prejudice (whether conscious or not) partly underlies the CDCs policy counsels in favor of relaxing the usual deference we pay to corrections officials in these matters.  We should instead insist on hard evidence, especially given that Californias policy is an outlier when compared to nationwide practice.  The Federal Bureau of Prisons administers 104 institutions; no similar policy is applied in any of them.  Countless state penal institutions are operated without such a policy.  An 
				<em>

Under the CDCs segregation policy, race is a determinative factor in placing inmates in double cells, regardless of the other factors considered in such decisions.  While a corrections official with 24 years of experience testified that an exception to this policy was once granted to a Hispanic inmate who had been raised with Crips, App. 184a, the CDCs suggestion that its policy is therefore flexible, see Brief for Respondents 9, strains credulity.  There is no evidence that the CDC routinely allows inmates to opt-out of segregation, much less evidence that the CDC informs inmates of their supposed right to do so.

				In my judgment a state policy of segregating prisoners by race during the first 60 days of their incarceration, as well as the first 60 days after their transfer from one facility to another, violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>.  The California Department of Corrections (CDC) has had an ample opportunity to justify its policy during the course of this litigation, but has utterly failed to do so whether judged under strict scrutiny or the more deferential standard set out in 
				<em>

				 v.

.  The CDC had no incentive in the proceedings below to withhold evidence supporting its policy; nor has the CDC made any offer of proof to suggest that a remand for further factual development would serve any purpose other than to postpone the inevitable.  I therefore agree with the submission of the United States as 
				<em>

				 that the Court should hold the policy unconstitutional on the current record.

				The CDCs segregation policy

            </a>
				 is based on a conclusive presumption that housing inmates of different races together creates an unacceptable risk of racial violence.  Under the policys logic, an inmates race is a proxy for gang membership, and gang membership is a proxy for violence.  The CDC, however, has offered scant empirical evidence or expert opinion to justify this use of race under even a minimal level of constitutional scrutiny.  The presumption underlying the policy is undoubtedly overbroad.  The CDC has made no effort to prove what fraction of new or transferred inmates are members of race-based gangs, nor has it shown more generally that interracial violence is disproportionately greater than intraracial violence in its prisons.  Proclivity toward racial violence unquestionably varies from inmate to inmate, yet the CDC applies its blunderbuss policy to 
				<em>
					all 
				</em>
				new and transferred inmates housed in double cells regardless of their criminal histories or records of previous incarceration.  Under the CDCs policy, for example, two car thieves of different racesneither of whom has any history of gang involvement, or of violence, for that matterwould be barred from being housed together during their first two months of prison.  This result derives from the CDCs inflexible judgment that such integrated living conditions are simply too dangerous.  This Court has never countenanced such racial prophylaxis.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				To establish a link between integrated cells and violence, the CDC relies on the views of two state corrections officials.  They attested to their belief that double-celling members of different races would lead to violence and that this violence would spill out into the prison yards.  One of these officials, an associate warden, testified as follows: 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				[W]ith the Asian population, the control sergeants have to be more careful than they do with Blacks, Whites, and Hispanics because, for example, you cannot house a Japanese inmate with a Chinese inmate.  You cannot.  They will kill each other.  They wont even tell you about it.  They will just do it.  The same with Laotians, Vietnamese, Cambodians, Filipinos.  You have to be very careful about housing other Asians with other Asians.  Its very culturally heavy.  App. 189a.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
Such musings inspire little confidence.  Indeed, this comment supports the suspicion that the policy is based on racial stereotypes and outmoded fears about the dangers of racial integration.  This Court should give no credence to such cynical, reflexive conclusions about race.  See,

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The very real risk that prejudice (whether conscious or not) partly underlies the CDCs policy counsels in favor of relaxing the usual deference we pay to corrections officials in these matters.  We should instead insist on hard evidence, especially given that Californias policy is an outlier when compared to nationwide practice.  The Federal Bureau of Prisons administers 104 institutions; no similar policy is applied in any of them.  Countless state penal institutions are operated without such a policy.  An 
				<em>
					amici
				</em>
				 brief filed by six former state corrections officials with an aggregate of over 120 years of experience managing prison systems in Wisconsin, Georgia, Oklahoma, Kansas, Alaska, and Washington makes clear that a blanket policy of even temporary segregation runs counter to the great weight of professional opinion on sound prison management.  See Brief for Former State Corrections Officials as 
				<em>
					Amici Curiae 
				</em>
				19.  Tellingly, the CDC can only point to two other States, Texas and Oklahoma, that use racial status in assigning inmates in prison reception areas.  It is doubtful from the record that these States policies have the same broad and inflexible sweep as Californias, and this is ultimately beside the point.  What is important is that the Federal Government and the vast majority of States address the threat of interracial violence in prisons without resorting to the expedient of segregation.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In support of its policy, the CDC offers poignant evidence that its prisons are infested with violent race-based gangs.  The most striking of this evidence involves a series of riots that took place between 1998 and 2001 at Pelican Bay State Prison.  That prison houses some of the States most violent criminal offenders, including validated gang members who have been transferred from other prisons.  The riots involved both interracial and intraracial violence.  In the most serious incident, involving 250300 inmates, Southern Hispanic gang members, joined by some white inmates, attacked a number of black inmates.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Our judicial role, however, requires that we scratch below the surface of this evidence, lest the sheer gravity of a threat be allowed to authorize any policy justified in its name.  Upon inspection, the CDCs 
				<em>
					post hoc
				</em>
				, generalized evidence of gang violence is only tenuously related to its segregation policy.  Significantly, the CDC has not cited a single specific incident of interracial violence between cellmatesmuch less a 
				<em>
					pattern 
				</em>
				of such violencethat prompted the adoption of its unique policy years ago.  Nor is there any indication that antagonism between cellmates played any role in the more recent riots the CDC mentions.  And despite the CDCs focus on prison gangs and its suggestion that such gangs will recruit new inmates into committing racial violence during their 60-day stays in the reception centers, the CDC has cited no evidence of such recruitment, nor has it identified any instances in which new inmates committed racial violence against other new inmates in the common areas, such as the yard or the cafeteria.  Perhaps the CDCs evidence might provide a basis for arguing that at Pelican Bay and other facilities that have experienced similar riots, some race-conscious measures are justified if properly tailored.  See
				<em>
					 Lee 
				</em>
				v.
				<em>
					 Washington
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/390/333" class="subref" title="subref">390 U. S. 333</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">334</a> (1968)
 (Black, J., concurring).  But even if the incidents cited by the CDC, which occurred in the general prison population, were relevant to the conditions in the reception centers, they provide no support for the CDCs decision to apply its segregation policy to 
				<em>
					all 
				</em>
				of its reception centers, without regard for each centers security level or history of racial violence.  Nor do the incidents provide any support for a policy applicable only to cellmates, while the common areas of the prison in which the disturbances occurred remain fully integrated.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Given the inherent indignity of segregation and its shameful historical connotations, one might assume that the CDC came to its policy only as a last resort.  Distressingly, this is not so: There is no evidence that the CDC has ever experimented with, or even carefully considered, race-neutral methods of achieving its goals.  That the policy is unwritten reflects, I think, the evident lack of deliberation that preceded its creation.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Specifically, the CDC has failed to explain why it could not, as an alternative to automatic segregation, rely on an individualized assessment of each inmates risk of violence when assigning him to a cell in a reception center.  The Federal Bureau of Prisons and other state systems do so without any apparent difficulty.  For inmates who are being transferred from one facility to anotherwho represent approximately 85% of those subject to the segregation policythe CDC can simply examine their prison records to determine if they have any known gang affiliations or if they have ever engaged in or threatened racial violence.  For example, the CDC has had an opportunity to observe the petitioner for almost 20 years; surely the CDC could have determined his placement without subjecting him to a period of segregation.

            </a>
				  For new inmates, assignments can be based on their presentence reports, which contain information about offense conduct, criminal record, and personal historyincluding any available information about gang affiliations.  In fact, state law requires the county probation officer to transmit a presentence report to the CDC along with an inmates commitment papers.  See Cal. Penal Code Ann. §1203c (West 2004); Cal. Rule of Court 4.411(d) (Criminal Cases) (West Supp. 2004).

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Despite the rich information available in these records, the CDC considers these records only rarely in assigning inmates to cells in the reception centers.  The CDCs primary explanation for this is administrative inefficiencythe records, it says, simply do not arrive in time.  The CDCs counsel conceded at oral argument that presentence reports have a fair amount of information, but she stated that, in California, the presentence report does not always accompany the inmate and frequently does not.  It follows some period of time later from the county.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 33.  Despite the state-law requirement to the contrary, counsel informed the Court that the counties are not preparing the presentence reports in a timely fashion.

				In fact, the CDCs failure to demand timely presentence reports and prison records undercuts the sincerity of its concern for inmate security during the reception process.  Race is an unreliable and necessarily underinclusive predictor of violence.  Without the inmate-specific information found in the records, there is a risk that corrections officials will, for example, house together inmates of the same race who are nevertheless members of rival gangs, such as the Bloods and Crips.

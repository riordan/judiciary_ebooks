				No. 96568.  Argued December 3, 1997Decided March 4, 1998
			</div>
        <hr>
        <p class="bodytext">
				Petitioner Oncale filed a complaint against his employer, respondent Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., claiming that sexual harassment directed against him by respondent coworkers in their workplace constituted discriminat[ion] … because of … sex prohibited by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/2000e-2.html#a_1" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §2000e2(a)(1)</a>.  Relying on Fifth Circuit precedent, the District Court held that Oncale, a male, had no Title VII cause of action for harassment by male coworkers.  The Fifth Circuit affirmed.

				Sex discrimination consisting of same-sex sexual harassment is actionable under Title VII.  Title VIIs prohibition of discrimination because of … sex protects men as well as women,

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/462/669" class="subref" title="subref">462 U. S. 669</a>, and in the related context of racial discrimination in the workplace this Court has rejected any conclusive presumption that an employer will not discriminate against members of his own race,

				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/430/482" class="subref" title="subref">430 U. S. 482</a>.  There is no justification in Title VIIs language or the Courts precedents for a categorical rule barring a claim of discrimination because of … sex merely because the plaintiff and the defendant (or the person charged with acting on behalf of the defendant) are of the same sex.  Recognizing liability for same-sex harassment will not transform Title VII into a general civility code for the American workplace, since Title VII is directed at discrimination because of sex, not merely conduct tinged with offensive sexual connotations; since the statute does not reach genuine but innocuous differences in the ways men and women routinely interact with members of the same, and the opposite, sex; and since the objective severity of harassment should be judged from the perspective of a reasonable person in the plaintiffs position, considering all the circumstances.

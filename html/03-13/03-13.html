				Upon evidence that certain of her uncles valuable art works had either been seized by the Nazis or expropriated by Austria after World War II, respondent filed this action in Federal District Court to recover six of the paintings from petitioners, Austria and its instrumentality, the Austrian Gallery.  She asserts jurisdiction under §2 of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA or Act), 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1330.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1330(a)</a>, which authorizes federal civil suits against foreign states as to any claim for relief in personam with respect to which the foreign state is not entitled to immunity under another section of the FSIA or under any applicable international agreement.  She further asserts that petitioners are not entitled to immunity under the FSIAs expropriation exception, §1605(a)(3), which expressly exempts from immunity certain cases involving rights in property taken in violation of international law.  Petitioners moved to dismiss based on, 
				<em>
					inter alia
				</em>
				, the two-part claim that (1) as of 1948, when much of their alleged wrongdoing took place, they would have enjoyed absolute sovereign immunity from suit in United States courts, and that (2) nothing in the FSIA retroactively divests them of that immunity.  Rejecting this argument, the District Court concluded, among other things, that the FSIA applies retroactively to pre-1976 actions.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed.  
			</p>
        <p class="SYLCTE">
            <em>
					Held: 
				</em>
				The FSIA applies to conduct, like petitioners alleged wrongdoing, that occurred prior to the Acts 1976 enactment and even prior to the United States 1952 adoption of the so-called restrictive theory of sovereign immunity.  Pp. 924.
			</p>
        <p class="SYLCTF">
				
				    
				(a) This Court has long deferred to Executive Branch sovereign immunity decisions.  Until 1952, Executive policy was to request immunity in all actions against friendly sovereigns.  In that year, the State Department began to apply the restrictive theory, whereby immunity is recognized with regard to a foreign states sovereign or public acts, but not its private acts.  Although this change had little impact on federal courts, which continued to abide by the Departments immunity suggestions, 
				<em>
					Verlinden B. V.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Central Bank of Nigeria,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/461/480" class="subref" title="subref">461 U. S. 480</a>, the change threw immunity decisions into some disarray: Foreign nations diplomatic pressure sometimes prompted the Department to file suggestions of immunity in cases in which immunity would not have been available under the restrictive theory; and when foreign nations failed to ask the Department for immunity, the courts had to determine whether immunity existed, so responsibility for such determinations lay with two different branches, 
				<em>
					ibid.
				</em>
				  To remedy these problems, the FSIA codified the restrictive principle and transferred primary responsibility for immunity determinations to the Judicial Branch.  The Act grants federal courts jurisdiction over civil actions against foreign states and carves out the expropriation and other exceptions to its general grant of immunity.  In any such action, the district courts subject-matter jurisdiction depends on the applicability of one of those exceptions.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 493494.  Pp. 913.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				(b) This case is not controlled by 
				<em>
					Landgraf
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					USI Film Products,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/511/244" class="subref" title="subref">511 U. S. 244</a>.  In describing the general presumption against retroactive application of a statute, the Court there declared, 
				<em>
					inter alia
				</em>
				, that, if a federal law enacted after the events in suit does not expressly prescribe its own proper reach but does operate retroactively
				<em>
					i.e.,
				</em>
				 would impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase his liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completedit does not govern absent clear congressional intent favoring that result
				<em>
					.  Id.,
				</em>
				 at 280.  Though seemingly comprehensive, this inquiry does not provide a clear answer here.  None of the three examples of retroactivity mentioned above fits the FSIAs clarification of sovereign immunity law.  However, the preliminary conclusion that the FSIA does not appear to operate retroactively within the meaning of 
				<em>
					Landgraf
				</em>
				s default rule creates some tension with the Courts observation in 
				<em>
					Verlinden
				</em>
				 that the FSIA is not simply a jurisdictional statute, but a codification of the standards governing foreign sovereign immunity as an aspect of 
				<em>
					substantive
				</em>
				 federal law.  461 U. S., at 496497 (emphasis added).  And while the FSIAs preamble suggests that it applies to preenactment conduct, that statement by itself falls short of the requisite express prescription.  Thus 
				<em>
					Landgraf
				</em>
				s default rule does not definitively resolve this case.  While 
				<em>
					Landgraf
				</em>
				s antiretroactivity presumption aims to avoid unnecessary 
				<em>
					post hoc
				</em>
				 changes to legal rules on which private parties relied in shaping their primary conduct, however, foreign sovereign immunitys principal purpose is to give foreign states and their instrumentalities some 
				<em>
					present
				</em>
				 protection from the inconvenience of suit, 
				<em>
					Dole Food Co.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Patrickson, 
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/538/468" class="subref" title="subref">538 U. S. 468</a>.  In this 
				<em>
					sui generis
				</em>
				 context, it is more appropriate, absent contraindications, to defer to the most recent decision of the political branches on whether to take jurisdiction, the FSIA, than to presume that decision 
				<em>
					inapplicable
				</em>
				 merely because it postdates the conduct in question.  Pp. 1318.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				(c) Nothing in the FSIA or the circumstances surrounding its enactment suggests that it should not be applied to petitioners 1948 actions.  Indeed, clear evidence that Congress intended it to apply to preenactment conduct lies in its preambles statement that foreign states immunity 
				<em>
					[c]laims
				</em>
				 … should 
				<em>
					henceforth
				</em>
				 be decided by [American] courts … in conformity with the principles set forth in this chapter, §1602 (emphasis added).  Though perhaps not sufficient to satisfy 
				<em>
					Landgraf
				</em>
				s express command requirement, 511 U. S., at 280, this language is unambiguous: Immunity claimsnot actions protected by immunity, but assertions of immunity to suits arising from those actionsare the relevant conduct regulated by the Act and are henceforth to be decided by the courts.  Thus, Congress intended courts to resolve 
				<em>
					all
				</em>
				 such claims in conformity with [FSIA] principles regardless of when the underlying conduct occurred.  The FSIAs overall structure strongly supports this conclusion: Many of its provisions unquestionably apply to cases arising out of conduct that occurred before 1976, see, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Dole Food Co.,
				</em>
            <em>
					supra,
				</em>
				 and its procedural provisions undoubtedly apply to all pending cases.  In this context, it would be anomalous to presume that an isolated provision (such as the expropriation exception on which respondent relies) is of purely prospective application absent any statutory language to that effect.  Finally, applying the FSIA to all pending cases regardless of when the underlying conduct occurred is most consistent with two of the Acts principal purposes: clarifying the rules judges should apply in resolving sovereign immunity claims and eliminating political participation in the resolution of such claims.  Pp. 1822.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				(d) This holding is extremely narrow.  The Court does not review the lower courts determination that §1605(a)(3) applies here, comment on the application of the so-called act of state doctrine to petitioners alleged wrongdoing, prevent the State Department from filing statements of interest suggesting that courts decline to exercise jurisdiction in particular cases implicating foreign sovereign immunity, or express an opinion on whether deference should be granted such filings in cases covered by the FSIA.  The issue here concerns only the interpretation of the FSIAs reacha pure question of statutory construction … well within the province of the Judiciary.

				In 1998 an Austrian journalist, granted access to the Austrian Gallerys archives, discovered evidence that certain valuable works in the Gallerys collection had not been donated by their rightful owners but had been seized by the Nazis or expropriated by the Austrian Republic after World War II.  The journalist provided some of that evidence to respondent, who in turn filed this action to recover possession of six Gustav Klimt paintings.  Prior to the Nazi invasion of Austria, the paintings had hung in the palatial Vienna home of respondents uncle, Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer, a Czechoslovakian Jew and patron of the arts.  Respondent claims ownership of the paintings under a will executed by her uncle after he fled Austria in 1938.  She alleges that the Gallery obtained possession of the paintings through wrongful conduct in the years during and after World War II.

				The defendants (petitioners here)the Republic of Austria and the Austrian Gallery (Gallery), an instrumentality of the Republicfiled a motion to dismiss the complaint asserting, among other defenses, a claim of sovereign immunity.  The District Court denied the motion, 142 F. Supp. 2d 1187 (CD Cal. 2001), and the Court of Appeals affirmed, 317 F. 3d 954 (CA9 2002), as amended, 327 F. 3d 1246 (2003).  We granted certiorari limited to the question whether the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA or Act),

				</em>
				., which grants foreign states immunity from the jurisdiction of federal and state courts but expressly exempts certain cases, including cases … in which rights in property taken in violation of international law are in issue, §1605(a)(3), applies to claims that, like respondents, are based on conduct that occurred before the Acts enactment, and even before the United States adopted the so-called restrictive theory of sovereign immunity in 1952.

				Because this case comes to us from the denial of a motion to dismiss on the pleadings, we assume the truth of the following facts alleged in respondents complaint.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Born in Austria in 1916, respondent Maria V. Altmann escaped the country after it was annexed by Nazi Germany in 1938.  She settled in California in 1942 and became an American citizen in 1945.  She is a niece, and the sole surviving named heir, of Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer, who died in Zurich, Switzerland, on November 13, 1945.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Prior to 1938 Ferdinand, then a wealthy sugar magnate, maintained his principal residence in Vienna, Austria, where the six Klimt paintings and other valuable works of art were housed.  His wife, Adele, was the subject of two of the paintings.  She died in 1925, leaving a will in which she ask[ed] her husband after his death to bequeath the paintings to the Gallery.

                </sup>
            </a>
				  App. 187a, ¶81.  The attorney for her estate advised the Gallery that Ferdinand intended to comply with his wifes request, but that he was not legally obligated to do so because he, not Adele, owned the paintings.  Ferdinand never executed any document transferring ownership of any of the paintings at issue to the Gallery.  He remained their sole legitimate owner until his death.  His will bequeathed his entire estate to respondent, another niece, and a nephew.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				On March 12, 1938, in what became known as the Anschluss, the Nazis invaded and claimed to annex Austria.  Ferdinand, who was Jewish and had supported efforts to resist annexation, fled the country ahead of the Nazis, ultimately settling in Zurich.  In his absence, according to the complaint, the Nazis Aryanized the sugar company he had directed, took over his Vienna home, and divided up his artworks, which included the Klimts at issue here, many other valuable paintings, and a 400-piece porcelain collection.  A Nazi lawyer, Dr. Erich Fhrer, took possession of the six Klimts.  He sold two to the Gallery in 1941

				 and a third in 1943, kept one for himself, and sold another to the Museum of the City of Vienna.  The immediate fate of the sixth is not known.  142 F. Supp. 2d, at 1193.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In 1946 Austria enacted a law declaring all transactions motivated by Nazi ideology null and void.  This did not result in the immediate return of looted artwork to exiled Austrians, however, because a different provision of Austrian law proscribed export of artworks … deemed to be important to [the countrys] cultural heritage and required anyone wishing to export art to obtain the permission of the Austrian Federal Monument Agency.  App. 168a, ¶32.  Seeking to profit from this requirement, the Gallery and the Federal Monument Agency allegedly adopted a practice of forc[ing] Jews to donate or trade valuable artworks to the [Gallery] in exchange for export permits for other works.  
				<em>

				, at 168a, ¶33.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The next year Robert Bentley, respondents brother and fellow heir, retained a Viennese lawyer, Dr. Gustav Rinesch, to locate and recover property stolen from Ferdinand during the war.  In January 1948 Dr. Rinesch wrote to the Gallery requesting return of the three Klimts purchased from Dr. Fhrer.  A Gallery representative responded, assertingfalsely, according to the complaint
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				 that Adele had bequeathed the paintings to the Gallery, and the Gallery had merely permitted Ferdinand to retain them during his lifetime.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Later the same year Dr. Rinesch enlisted the support of Gallery officials to obtain export permits for many of Ferdinands remaining works of art.  In exchange, Dr. Rinesch, purporting to represent respondent and her fellow heirs, signed a document acknowledg[ing] and accept[ing] Ferdinands declaration that in the event of his death he wished to follow the wishes of his deceased wife to donate the Klimt paintings to the Gallery.

            </a>
				  At no time during these transactions, however, did Dr. Rinesch have respondents permission either to negotiate on her behalf or to allow the [Gallery] to obtain the Klimt paintings.

				In 1998 a journalist examining the Gallerys files discovered documents revealing that at all relevant times Gallery officials knew that neither Adele nor Ferdinand had, in fact, donated the six Klimts to the Gallery.  The journalist published a series of articles reporting his findings, and specifically noting that Klimts first portrait of Adele, which all the [Gallery] publications represented as having been donated to the museum in 1936, had actually been received in 1941, accompanied by a letter from Dr. Fhrer signed  Heil Hitler. 

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In response to these revelations, Austria enacted a new restitution law under which individuals who had been coerced into donating artworks to state museums in exchange for export permits could reclaim their property.  Respondentwho had believed, prior to the journalists investigation, that Adele and Ferdinand had freely donated the Klimt paintings to the Gallery before the war
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				immediately sought recovery of the paintings and other artworks under the new law.

After what the complaint terms a sham proceeding, however, the committee declined to return the six paintings, concluding, based on an allegedly purposeful misreading of Adeles will, that her precatory request had created a binding legal obligation that required her husband to donate the paintings to the Gallery on his death.

				Respondent then announced that she would file a lawsuit in Austria to recover the paintings.  Because Austrian court costs are proportional to the value of the recovery sought (and in this case would total several million dollars, an amount far beyond respondents means), she requested a waiver.

The court rested that conclusion on an analysis of American courts then-prevalent practice of deferring to case-by-case immunity determinations by the State Department, and on that Departments expressed policy, as of 1949, of  reliev[ing] American courts from any restraint upon the exercise of their jurisdiction to pass upon the validity of the acts of Nazi officials.   317 F. 3d, at 965 (quoting Press Release No. 296, Jurisdiction of United States Courts Re Suits for Identifiable Property Involved in Nazi Forced Transfers (emphasis deleted)).

				A study of the law of sovereign immunity reveals the existence of two conflicting concepts of sovereign immunity, each widely held and firmly established.  According to the classical or absolute theory of sovereign immunity, a sovereign cannot, without his consent, be made a respondent in the courts of another sovereign.  According to the newer or restrictive theory of sovereign immunity, the immunity of the sovereign is recognized with regard to sovereign or public acts 
				<em>

				</em>
				 of a state, but not with respect to private acts

				As we explained in our unanimous opinion in

				, the change in State Department policy wrought by the Tate Letter had little, if any, impact on federal courts approach to immunity analyses: As in the past, initial responsibility for deciding questions of sovereign immunity fell primarily upon the Executive acting through the State Department, and courts continued to abid[e] by that Departments  suggestions of immunity.   461 U. S., at 487.  The change did, however, throw immunity determinations into some disarray, as foreign nations often placed diplomatic pressure on the State Department, and political considerations sometimes led the Department to file suggestions of immunity in cases where immunity would not have been available under the restrictive theory.  
				<em>
					Id.

				Department:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				[T]he responsibility fell to the courts to determine whether sovereign immunity existed, generally by reference to prior State Department decisions. . . .

				<em>
					i.e.,
				</em>
				 whether it would impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a partys liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed.

				Though seemingly comprehensive, this inquiry does not provide a clear answer in this case.  Although the FSIAs preamble suggests that it applies to preenactment conduct, see
				<em>
					 infra,
				</em>
				 at 18, that statement by itself falls short of an expres[s] prescri[ption of] the statutes proper reach.  Under 
				<em>
					Landgraf
				</em>
				, therefore, it is appropriate to ask whether the Act affects substantive rights (and thus would be impermissibly retroactive if applied to preenactment conduct) or addresses only matters of procedure (and thus may be applied to all pending cases regardless of when the underlying conduct occurred).  But the FSIA defies such categorization.  To begin with, none of the three examples of retroactivity mentioned in the above quotation fits the FSIAs clarification of the law of sovereign immunity.  Prior to 1976 foreign states had a justifiable expectation that, as a matter of comity, United States courts would grant them immunity for their public acts (provided the State Department did not recommend otherwise), but they had no right to such immunity.  Moreover, the FSIA merely opens United States courts to plaintiffs with pre-existing claims against foreign states; the Act neither increase[s those states] liability for past conduct nor impose[s] new duties with respect to transactions already completed.  511 U. S., at 280.  Thus, the Act does not at first appear to operate retroactively within the meaning of the 
				<em>
					Landgraf
				</em>
				 default rule.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				That preliminary conclusion, however, creates some tension with our observation in 
				<em>
					Verlinden
				</em>
				 that the FSIA is not simply a jurisdictional statute concern[ing] access to the federal courts but a codification of the standards governing foreign sovereign immunity as an aspect of 
				<em>
					substantive
				</em>
				 federal law.  461 U. S., at 496497 (emphasis added).  Moreover, we noted in 
				<em>
					Verlinden
				</em>
				 that in any suit against a foreign sovereign, the plaintiff will be barred from raising his claim in 
				<em>
					any
				</em>
				 court in the United States unless one of the FSIAs exceptions applies, 
				<em>

				, at 497 (emphasis added), and we have stated elsewhere that statutes that 

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">951</a> (1997)

				Thus, 
				<em>
					Landgraf
				</em>
				s default rule does not definitively resolve this case.  In our view, however, 
				<em>
					Landgraf
				</em>
				s antiretroactivity presumption, while not strictly confined to cases involving private rights, is most helpful in that context.  Cf. 511 U. S., at 271, n. 25 ([T]he great majority of our decisions relying upon the antiretroactivity presumption have involved intervening statutes burdening private parties).  The aim of the presumption is to avoid unnecessary 
				<em>
					post hoc
				</em>

But the principal purpose of foreign sovereign immunity has never been to permit foreign states and their instrumentalities to shape their conduct in reliance on the promise of future immunity from suit in United States courts.

Though perhaps not sufficient to satisfy 
				<em>

				s express command requirement, 511 U. S., at 280, this language is unambiguous: Immunity claimsnot actions protected by immunity, but assertions of immunity to suits arising from those actionsare the relevant conduct regulated by the Act;

				The FSIAs overall structure strongly supports this conclusion.  Many of the Acts provisions unquestionably apply to cases arising out of conduct that occurred before 1976.  In 
				<em>
					Dole Food Co.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Patrickson, 
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/538/468" class="subref" title="subref">538 U. S. 468</a> (2003)
, for example, we held that whether an entity qualifies as an instrumentality of a foreign state for purposes of the FSIAs grant of immunity depends on the relationship between the entity and the state at the time suit is brought rather than when the conduct occurred.  In addition, 
				<em>
					Verlinden
				</em>
				, which upheld against constitutional challenge 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1330.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1330</a>s grant of subject-matter jurisdiction, involved a dispute over a contract that predated the Act.  461 U. S., at 482483, 497.  And there has never been any doubt that the Acts procedural provisions relating to venue, removal, execution, and attachment apply to all pending cases.  Thus, the FSIAs preamble indicates that it applies henceforth, and its body includes numerous provisions that unquestionably apply to claims based on pre-1976 conduct.  In this context, it would be anomalous to presume that an isolated provision (such as the expropriation exception on which respondent relies) is of purely prospective application absent any statutory language to that effect.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Finally, applying the FSIA to all pending cases regardless of when the underlying conduct occurred is most consistent with two of the Acts principal purposes: clarifying the rules that judges should apply in resolving sovereign immunity claims and eliminating political participation in the resolution of such claims.  We have recognized that, to accomplish these purposes, Congress established a comprehensive framework for resolving any claim of sovereign immunity:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				We think that the text and structure of the FSIA demonstrate Congress intention that the FSIA be the sole basis for obtaining jurisdiction over a foreign state in our courts.  Sections 1604 and 1330(a) work in tandem: §1604 bars federal and state courts from exercising jurisdiction when a foreign state 
				<em>
					is
				</em>
				 entitled to immunity, and §1330(a) confers jurisdiction on district courts to hear suits brought by United States citizens and by aliens when a foreign state is 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 entitled to immunity.  As we said in 
				<em>

        <p class="bodytext">
				
The

				 respondents claims concerned conduct that postdated the FSIA, so we had no occasion to consider the Acts retroactivity.  Nevertheless, our observations about the FSIAs inclusiveness are relevant in this case: Quite obviously, Congress purposes in enacting such a comprehensive jurisdictional scheme would be frustrated if, in postenactment cases concerning preenactment conduct, courts were to continue to follow the same ambiguous and politically charged  standards  that the FSIA replaced.

				We do not endorse the reasoning of the Court of Appeals.  Indeed, we think it engaged in precisely the kind of detailed historical inquiry that the FSIAs clear guidelines were intended to obviate.  Nevertheless, we affirm the panels judgment because the Act, freed from 
				<em>

				<em>

				, at 2, 89, and n. 8.  Nor do we have occasion to comment on the application of the so-called act of state doctrine to petitioners alleged wrongdoing.  Unlike a claim of sovereign immunity, which merely raises a jurisdictional defense, the act of state doctrine provides foreign states with a substantive defense on the merits.  Under that doctrine, the courts of one state will not question the validity of public acts (acts 
				<em>
					jure imperii)
				</em>
				 performed by other sovereigns within their own borders, even when such courts have jurisdiction over a controversy in which one of the litigants has standing to challenge those acts.

 (The act of state doctrine in its traditional formulation precludes the courts of this country from inquiring into the validity of the public acts a recognized foreign sovereign power committed within its own territory).  Petitioners principally rely on the act of state doctrine to support their assertion that foreign expropriations are public acts for which, prior to the enactment of the FSIA, sovereigns expected immunity.

						 Of course, the FSIA differs from the statutory amendment at issue in Hughes Aircraft.  That amendment was attached to the statute that created the cause of action, see former

When a jurisdictional limitation adheres to the cause of action in this fashionwhen it applies by its terms regardless of where the claim is broughtthe limitation is essentially substantive.  In contrast, the FSIA simply limits the jurisdiction of federal and state courts to entertain claims against foreign sovereigns.  The Act does not create or modify any causes of action, nor does it purport to limit foreign countries decisions about what claims against which defendants their courts will entertain.


Even if the dissent is right that, like the provision at issue in Hughes Aircraft, the FSIA create[s] jurisdiction where there was none before, post, at 10 (opinion of Kennedy, J.) (punctuation omitted), however, that characteristic is in some tension with other, less substantive aspects of the Act.  This tension, in turn, renders the Landgrafapproach inconclusive and requires us to examine the entire statutein light of the underlying principles governing our retroactivityjurisprudence.

						 Our approach to retroactivity in this case thus parallels that advocated by Justice Scalia in his concurrence in Landgraf:


The critical issue, I think, is not whether the rule affects vested rights, or governs substance or procedure, but rather what is the relevant activity that the rule regulates.  Absent clear statement otherwise, only such relevant activity which occurs after the effective date of the statute is covered.  Most statutes are meant to regulate primary conduct, and hence will not be applied in trials involving conduct that occurred before their effective date.  But other statutes have a different purpose and therefore a different relevant retroactivity event.  511 U. S., at 291 (opinion concurring in judgment).

						 The dissent is quite right that  [a] statement that a statute will become effective on a certain date does not even arguably suggest that it has any application to conduct that occurred at an earlier date.   Post, at 6.  The provision of the FSIA to which this observation applies, however, is not the preamble but section 8, which states that the Act shall take effect ninety days after the date of its enactment. 

						 Petitioners suggest that the latter date is important because it marked the first shift in foreign states expectations concerning the scope of their immunity.  Whether or not the date would be significant to a Landgraf-type analysis of foreign states settled expectations at various times prior to the FSIAs enactment, it is of no relevance in this case given our rationale for finding the Act applicable to preenactment conduct.

						 Mislabeling this observation a constitutional conclusion, the dissent suggests that permitting the Executive to comment on a partys assertion of sovereign immunity will result in [u]ncertain prospective application of our foreign sovereign immunity law.  Post, at 21, 24.  We do not hold, however, that executive intervention could or would trump considered application of the FSIAs more neutral principles; we merely note that the Executives views on questions within its area of expertise merit greater deference than its opinions regarding the scope of a congressional enactment.  Furthermore, we fail to understand how our holding, which requires that courts apply the FSIAs sovereign immunity rules in all cases, somehow injects greater uncertainty into sovereign immunity law than the dissents approach, which would require, for cases concerning pre-1976 conduct, case-by-case analysis of the status of that law at the time of the offending conductincluding analysis of the existence or nonexistence of any State Department statements on the subject.

				In 1998 an Austrian journalist, granted access to the Austrian Gallerys archives, discovered evidence that certain valuable works in the Gallerys collection had not been donated by their rightful owners but had been seized by the Nazis or expropriated by the Austrian Republic after World War II.  The journalist provided some of that evidence to respondent, who in turn filed this action to recover possession of six Gustav Klimt paintings.  Prior to the Nazi invasion of Austria, the paintings had hung in the palatial Vienna home of respondents uncle, Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer, a Czechoslovakian Jew and patron of the arts.  Respondent claims ownership of the paintings under a will executed by her uncle after he fled Austria in 1938.  She alleges that the Gallery obtained possession of the paintings through wrongful conduct in the years during and after World War II.

				The defendants (petitioners here)the Republic of Austria and the Austrian Gallery (Gallery), an instrumentality of the Republicfiled a motion to dismiss the complaint asserting, among other defenses, a claim of sovereign immunity.  The District Court denied the motion, 142 F. Supp. 2d 1187 (CD Cal. 2001), and the Court of Appeals affirmed, 317 F. 3d 954 (CA9 2002), as amended, 327 F. 3d 1246 (2003).  We granted certiorari limited to the question whether the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA or Act),

				Because this case comes to us from the denial of a motion to dismiss on the pleadings, we assume the truth of the following facts alleged in respondents complaint.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Born in Austria in 1916, respondent Maria V. Altmann escaped the country after it was annexed by Nazi Germany in 1938.  She settled in California in 1942 and became an American citizen in 1945.  She is a niece, and the sole surviving named heir, of Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer, who died in Zurich, Switzerland, on November 13, 1945.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Prior to 1938 Ferdinand, then a wealthy sugar magnate, maintained his principal residence in Vienna, Austria, where the six Klimt paintings and other valuable works of art were housed.  His wife, Adele, was the subject of two of the paintings.  She died in 1925, leaving a will in which she ask[ed] her husband after his death to bequeath the paintings to the Gallery.

            </a>
				  App. 187a, ¶81.  The attorney for her estate advised the Gallery that Ferdinand intended to comply with his wifes request, but that he was not legally obligated to do so because he, not Adele, owned the paintings.  Ferdinand never executed any document transferring ownership of any of the paintings at issue to the Gallery.  He remained their sole legitimate owner until his death.  His will bequeathed his entire estate to respondent, another niece, and a nephew.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				On March 12, 1938, in what became known as the Anschluss, the Nazis invaded and claimed to annex Austria.  Ferdinand, who was Jewish and had supported efforts to resist annexation, fled the country ahead of the Nazis, ultimately settling in Zurich.  In his absence, according to the complaint, the Nazis Aryanized the sugar company he had directed, took over his Vienna home, and divided up his artworks, which included the Klimts at issue here, many other valuable paintings, and a 400-piece porcelain collection.  A Nazi lawyer, Dr. Erich Fhrer, took possession of the six Klimts.  He sold two to the Gallery in 1941

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In 1946 Austria enacted a law declaring all transactions motivated by Nazi ideology null and void.  This did not result in the immediate return of looted artwork to exiled Austrians, however, because a different provision of Austrian law proscribed export of artworks … deemed to be important to [the countrys] cultural heritage and required anyone wishing to export art to obtain the permission of the Austrian Federal Monument Agency.  App. 168a, ¶32.  Seeking to profit from this requirement, the Gallery and the Federal Monument Agency allegedly adopted a practice of forc[ing] Jews to donate or trade valuable artworks to the [Gallery] in exchange for export permits for other works.

				The next year Robert Bentley, respondents brother and fellow heir, retained a Viennese lawyer, Dr. Gustav Rinesch, to locate and recover property stolen from Ferdinand during the war.  In January 1948 Dr. Rinesch wrote to the Gallery requesting return of the three Klimts purchased from Dr. Fhrer.  A Gallery representative responded, assertingfalsely, according to the complaint
				<span class="softbreak"></span>

				Later the same year Dr. Rinesch enlisted the support of Gallery officials to obtain export permits for many of Ferdinands remaining works of art.  In exchange, Dr. Rinesch, purporting to represent respondent and her fellow heirs, signed a document acknowledg[ing] and accept[ing] Ferdinands declaration that in the event of his death he wished to follow the wishes of his deceased wife to donate the Klimt paintings to the Gallery.

				In 1998 a journalist examining the Gallerys files discovered documents revealing that at all relevant times Gallery officials knew that neither Adele nor Ferdinand had, in fact, donated the six Klimts to the Gallery.  The journalist published a series of articles reporting his findings, and specifically noting that Klimts first portrait of Adele, which all the [Gallery] publications represented as having been donated to the museum in 1936, had actually been received in 1941, accompanied by a letter from Dr. Fhrer signed  Heil Hitler. 

				In response to these revelations, Austria enacted a new restitution law under which individuals who had been coerced into donating artworks to state museums in exchange for export permits could reclaim their property.  Respondentwho had believed, prior to the journalists investigation, that Adele and Ferdinand had freely donated the Klimt paintings to the Gallery before the war
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				immediately sought recovery of the paintings and other artworks under the new law.

After what the complaint terms a sham proceeding, however, the committee declined to return the six paintings, concluding, based on an allegedly purposeful misreading of Adeles will, that her precatory request had created a binding legal obligation that required her husband to donate the paintings to the Gallery on his death.  
				<em>

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Respondent then announced that she would file a lawsuit in Austria to recover the paintings.  Because Austrian court costs are proportional to the value of the recovery sought (and in this case would total several million dollars, an amount far beyond respondents means), she requested a waiver.

The court rested that conclusion on an analysis of American courts then-prevalent practice of deferring to case-by-case immunity determinations by the State Department, and on that Departments expressed policy, as of 1949, of  reliev[ing] American courts from any restraint upon the exercise of their jurisdiction to pass upon the validity of the acts of Nazi officials.   317 F. 3d, at 965 (quoting Press Release No. 296, Jurisdiction of United States Courts Re Suits for Identifiable Property Involved in Nazi Forced Transfers (emphasis deleted)).

        <p class="bodytext">
				A study of the law of sovereign immunity reveals the existence of two conflicting concepts of sovereign immunity, each widely held and firmly established.  According to the classical or absolute theory of sovereign immunity, a sovereign cannot, without his consent, be made a respondent in the courts of another sovereign.  According to the newer or restrictive theory of sovereign immunity, the immunity of the sovereign is recognized with regard to sovereign or public acts 
				<em>

				</em>
				 of a state, but not with respect to private acts 
				<em>

				As we explained in our unanimous opinion in 
				<em>
					Verlinden
				</em>
				, the change in State Department policy wrought by the Tate Letter had little, if any, impact on federal courts approach to immunity analyses: As in the past, initial responsibility for deciding questions of sovereign immunity fell primarily upon the Executive acting through the State Department, and courts continued to abid[e] by that Departments  suggestions of immunity.   461 U. S., at 487.  The change did, however, throw immunity determinations into some disarray, as foreign nations often placed diplomatic pressure on the State Department, and political considerations sometimes led the Department to file suggestions of immunity in cases where immunity would not have been available under the restrictive theory.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 487488.  Complicating matters further, when foreign nations failed to request immunity from the State
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				Department:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				[T]he responsibility fell to the courts to determine whether sovereign immunity existed, generally by reference to prior State Department decisions. . . . Thus, sovereign immunity determinations were made in two different branches, subject to a variety of factors, sometimes including diplomatic considerations.

				In 1976 Congress sought to remedy these problems by enacting the FSIA, a comprehensive statute containing a set of legal standards governing claims of immunity in every civil action against a foreign state or its political subdivisions, agencies, or instrumentalities.  
				<em>

				<em>
					i.e.,
				</em>
				 whether it would impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a partys liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed.  If the statute would operate retroactively, our traditional presumption teaches that it does not govern absent clear congressional intent favoring such a result.

				Though seemingly comprehensive, this inquiry does not provide a clear answer in this case.  Although the FSIAs preamble suggests that it applies to preenactment conduct, see
				<em>
					 infra,
				</em>
				 at 18, that statement by itself falls short of an expres[s] prescri[ption of] the statutes proper reach.  Under 
				<em>
					Landgraf
				</em>
				, therefore, it is appropriate to ask whether the Act affects substantive rights (and thus would be impermissibly retroactive if applied to preenactment conduct) or addresses only matters of procedure (and thus may be applied to all pending cases regardless of when the underlying conduct occurred).  But the FSIA defies such categorization.  To begin with, none of the three examples of retroactivity mentioned in the above quotation fits the FSIAs clarification of the law of sovereign immunity.  Prior to 1976 foreign states had a justifiable expectation that, as a matter of comity, United States courts would grant them immunity for their public acts (provided the State Department did not recommend otherwise), but they had no right to such immunity.  Moreover, the FSIA merely opens United States courts to plaintiffs with pre-existing claims against foreign states; the Act neither increase[s those states] liability for past conduct nor impose[s] new duties with respect to transactions already completed.  511 U. S., at 280.  Thus, the Act does not at first appear to operate retroactively within the meaning of the 
				<em>
					Landgraf
				</em>
				 default rule.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				That preliminary conclusion, however, creates some tension with our observation in 
				<em>
					Verlinden
				</em>
				 that the FSIA is not simply a jurisdictional statute concern[ing] access to the federal courts but a codification of the standards governing foreign sovereign immunity as an aspect of 
				<em>
					substantive
				</em>
				 federal law.  461 U. S., at 496497 (emphasis added).  Moreover, we noted in 
				<em>
					Verlinden
				</em>
				 that in any suit against a foreign sovereign, the plaintiff will be barred from raising his claim in 
				<em>
					any
				</em>
				 court in the United States unless one of the FSIAs exceptions applies, 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 497 (emphasis added), and we have stated elsewhere that statutes that 

					creat[e]

				 jurisdiction where none otherwise exists spea[k] not just to the power of a particular court but to the substantive rights of the parties as well,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">951</a> (1997)

				Thus, 
				<em>
					Landgraf
				</em>
				s default rule does not definitively resolve this case.  In our view, however, 
				<em>
					Landgraf
				</em>
				s antiretroactivity presumption, while not strictly confined to cases involving private rights, is most helpful in that context.  Cf. 511 U. S., at 271, n. 25 ([T]he great majority of our decisions relying upon the antiretroactivity presumption have involved intervening statutes burdening private parties).  The aim of the presumption is to avoid unnecessary 
				<em>
					post hoc
				</em>
				 changes to legal rules on which parties relied in shaping their primary conduct.  But the principal purpose of foreign sovereign immunity has never been to permit foreign states and their instrumentalities to shape their conduct in reliance on the promise of future immunity from suit in United States courts.  Rather, such immunity reflects current political realities and relationships, and aims to give foreign states and their instrumentalities some 
				<em>
					present

				<em>
					Verlinden,
				</em>
				 461 U. S., at 486.  In this 
				<em>
					sui generis

				<em>
					inapplicable

				 merely because it postdates the conduct in question.

				This leaves only the question whether anything in the FSIA or the circumstances surrounding its enactment suggests that we should not apply it to petitioners 1948 actions.  Not only do we answer this question in the negative, but we find clear evidence that Congress intended the Act to apply to preenactment conduct.

        <p class="bodytext">

Though perhaps not sufficient to satisfy 
				<em>
					Landgraf

				s express command requirement, 511 U. S., at 280, this language is unambiguous: Immunity claimsnot actions protected by immunity, but assertions of immunity to suits arising from those actionsare the relevant conduct regulated by the Act;

				The FSIAs overall structure strongly supports this conclusion.  Many of the Acts provisions unquestionably apply to cases arising out of conduct that occurred before 1976.  In 
				<em>
					Dole Food Co.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Patrickson, 
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/538/468" class="subref" title="subref">538 U. S. 468</a> (2003)
, for example, we held that whether an entity qualifies as an instrumentality of a foreign state for purposes of the FSIAs grant of immunity depends on the relationship between the entity and the state at the time suit is brought rather than when the conduct occurred.  In addition, 
				<em>
					Verlinden
				</em>
				, which upheld against constitutional challenge 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1330.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1330</a>s grant of subject-matter jurisdiction, involved a dispute over a contract that predated the Act.  461 U. S., at 482483, 497.  And there has never been any doubt that the Acts procedural provisions relating to venue, removal, execution, and attachment apply to all pending cases.  Thus, the FSIAs preamble indicates that it applies henceforth, and its body includes numerous provisions that unquestionably apply to claims based on pre-1976 conduct.  In this context, it would be anomalous to presume that an isolated provision (such as the expropriation exception on which respondent relies) is of purely prospective application absent any statutory language to that effect.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Finally, applying the FSIA to all pending cases regardless of when the underlying conduct occurred is most consistent with two of the Acts principal purposes: clarifying the rules that judges should apply in resolving sovereign immunity claims and eliminating political participation in the resolution of such claims.  We have recognized that, to accomplish these purposes, Congress established a comprehensive framework for resolving any claim of sovereign immunity:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				We think that the text and structure of the FSIA demonstrate Congress intention that the FSIA be the sole basis for obtaining jurisdiction over a foreign state in our courts.  Sections 1604 and 1330(a) work in tandem: §1604 bars federal and state courts from exercising jurisdiction when a foreign state 
				<em>
					is
				</em>
				 entitled to immunity, and §1330(a) confers jurisdiction on district courts to hear suits brought by United States citizens and by aliens when a foreign state is 
				<em>
					not
				</em>

				<em>

The

				<em>

Under that doctrine, the courts of one state will not question the validity of public acts (acts

 (The act of state doctrine in its traditional formulation precludes the courts of this country from inquiring into the validity of the public acts a recognized foreign sovereign power committed within its own territory).  Petitioners principally rely on the act of state doctrine to support their assertion that foreign expropriations are public acts for which, prior to the enactment of the FSIA, sovereigns expected immunity.

						 Adeles will mentions six Klimt paintings, Adele Bloch-Bauer I, Adele Bloch-Bauer II, Apple Tree I, Beechwood, Houses in Unterach am Attersee, and Schloss Kammer am Attersee III.  The last of these, Schloss Kammer am Attersee III, is not at issue in this case because Ferdinand donated it to the Gallery in 1936.  The sixth painting in this case, Amalie Zuckerkandl, is not mentioned in Adeles will.  For further details, see 142 F. Supp. 2d 1187, 11921193 (CD Cal. 2001).

						 As the District Court noted, id., at 1201, n. 16, and the above summary of the complaint makes clear, supra, at 56, respondent alleges that petitioners wrongdoing continued well past 1948 in the form of concealment of the paintings true provenance and deliberate misinterpretation of Adeles will.  Because we conclude that the FSIA maybe applied to petitioners 1948 actions, we need not address the Dis-trict Courts alternative suggestion that petitioners subsequent al-leged wrongdoing would be sufficient, in and of itself, to establish jurisdiction.

						 Chief Justice Marshall noted, however, that the outcome might well be different if the case involved a sovereigns private property:


Without indicating any opinion on this question, it may safely be affirmed, that there is a manifest distinction between the private property of the person who happens to be a prince, and that military force which supports the sovereign power, and maintains the dignity and the independence of a nation.  A prince, by acquiring private property in a foreign country, may possibly be considered as subjecting that property to the territorial jurisdiction; he may be considered as so far laying down the prince, and assuming the character of a private individual; but this he cannot be presumed to do with respect to any portion of that armed force, which upholds his crown, and the nation he is entrusted to govern.  Id., at 145.

						 Of course, the FSIA differs from the statutory amendment at issue in Hughes Aircraft.  That amendment was attached to the statute that created the cause of action, see former 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/31/3730.html#b_1" class="subref" title="subref">31 U. S. C. §3730(b)(1)</a> (1982 ed.),

978; 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/31/3730.html#b_1" class="subref" title="subref">31 U. S. C. §3730(b)(1)</a> Stat. 3154, and it prescribed a limitation that any court entertaining the cause of action was bound to apply, see §3730(e)(4)(A), 100 Stat., at 3157.  When a jurisdictional limitation adheres to the cause of action in this fashionwhen it applies by its terms regardless of where the claim is broughtthe limitation is essentially substantive.  In contrast, the FSIA simply limits the jurisdiction of federal and state courts to entertain claims against foreign sovereigns.  The Act does not create or modify any causes of action, nor does it purport to limit foreign countries decisions about what claims against which defendants their courts will entertain.


Even if the dissent is right that, like the provision at issue in Hughes Aircraft, the FSIA create[s] jurisdiction where there was none before, post, at 10 (opinion of Kennedy, J.) (punctuation omitted), however, that characteristic is in some tension with other, less substantive aspects of the Act.  This tension, in turn, renders the Landgrafapproach inconclusive and requires us to examine the entire statutein light of the underlying principles governing our retroactivityjurisprudence.

						 Between 1952 and 1976 courts and the State Department similarly presumed that the Tate Letter was applicable even in disputes concerning conduct that predated the letter.  See, e.g., National City Bank of N. Y. v. Republic of China,

						 Our approach to retroactivity in this case thus parallels that advocated by Justice Scalia in his concurrence in Landgraf:


The critical issue, I think, is not whether the rule affects vested rights, or governs substance or procedure, but rather what is the relevant activity that the rule regulates.  Absent clear statement otherwise, only such relevant activity which occurs after the effective date of the statute is covered.  Most statutes are meant to regulate primary conduct, and hence will not be applied in trials involving conduct that occurred before their effective date.  But other statutes have a different purpose and therefore a different relevant retroactivity event.  511 U. S., at 291 (opinion concurring in judgment).

						 The dissent is quite right that  [a] statement that a statute will become effective on a certain date does not even arguably suggest that it has any application to conduct that occurred at an earlier date.   Post, at 6.  The provision of the FSIA to which this observation applies, however, is not the preamble but section 8, which states that the Act shall take effect ninety days after the date of its enactment. 

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1602.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1602</a>.  The office of the word henceforth is to make the statute effective with respect to claims to immunity thereafter asserted.  Notably, any such claim asserted immediately after the statute became effective would necessarily have related to conduct that took place at an earlier date.

						 Petitioners suggest that the latter date is important because it marked the first shift in foreign states expectations concerning the scope of their immunity.  Whether or not the date would be significant to a Landgraf-type analysis of foreign states settled expectations at various times prior to the FSIAs enactment, it is of no relevance in this case given our rationale for finding the Act applicable to preenactment conduct.

						 Mislabeling this observation a constitutional conclusion, the dissent suggests that permitting the Executive to comment on a partys assertion of sovereign immunity will result in [u]ncertain prospective application of our foreign sovereign immunity law.  Post, at 21, 24.  We do not hold, however, that executive intervention could or would trump considered application of the FSIAs more neutral principles; we merely note that the Executives views on questions within its area of expertise merit greater deference than its opinions regarding the scope of a congressional enactment.  Furthermore, we fail to understand how our holding, which requires that courts apply the FSIAs sovereign immunity rules in all cases, somehow injects greater uncertainty into sovereign immunity law than the dissents approach, which would require, for cases concerning pre-1976 conduct, case-by-case analysis of the status of that law at the time of the offending conductincluding analysis of the existence or nonexistence of any State Department statements on the subject.

				In 1998 an Austrian journalist, granted access to the Austrian Gallerys archives, discovered evidence that certain valuable works in the Gallerys collection had not been donated by their rightful owners but had been seized by the Nazis or expropriated by the Austrian Republic after World War II.  The journalist provided some of that evidence to respondent, who in turn filed this action to recover possession of six Gustav Klimt paintings.  Prior to the Nazi invasion of Austria, the paintings had hung in the palatial Vienna home of respondents uncle, Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer, a Czechoslovakian Jew and patron of the arts.  Respondent claims ownership of the paintings under a will executed by her uncle after he fled Austria in 1938.  She alleges that the Gallery obtained possession of the paintings through wrongful conduct in the years during and after World War II.

				The defendants (petitioners here)the Republic of Austria and the Austrian Gallery (Gallery), an instrumentality of the Republicfiled a motion to dismiss the complaint asserting, among other defenses, a claim of sovereign immunity.  The District Court denied the motion, 142 F. Supp. 2d 1187 (CD Cal. 2001), and the Court of Appeals affirmed, 317 F. 3d 954 (CA9 2002), as amended, 327 F. 3d 1246 (2003).

				Prior to 1938 Ferdinand, then a wealthy sugar magnate, maintained his principal residence in Vienna, Austria, where the six Klimt paintings and other valuable works of art were housed.  His wife, Adele, was the subject of two of the paintings.  She died in 1925, leaving a will in which she ask[ed] her husband after his death to bequeath the paintings to the Gallery.

The attorney for her estate advised the Gallery that Ferdinand intended to comply with his wifes request, but that he was not legally obligated to do so because he, not Adele, owned the paintings.  Ferdinand never executed any document transferring ownership of any of the paintings at issue to the Gallery.  He remained their sole legitimate owner until his death.

				On March 12, 1938, in what became known as the Anschluss, the Nazis invaded and claimed to annex Austria.  Ferdinand, who was Jewish and had supported efforts to resist annexation, fled the country ahead of the Nazis, ultimately settling in Zurich.  In his absence, according to the complaint, the Nazis Aryanized the sugar company he had directed, took over his Vienna home, and divided up his artworks, which included the Klimts at issue here, many other valuable paintings, and a 400-piece porcelain collection.  A Nazi lawyer, Dr. Erich Fhrer, took possession of the six Klimts.  He sold two to the Gallery in 1941

				In 1946 Austria enacted a law declaring all transactions motivated by Nazi ideology null and void.  This did not result in the immediate return of looted artwork to exiled Austrians, however, because a different provision of Austrian law proscribed export of artworks … deemed to be important to [the countrys] cultural heritage and required anyone wishing to export art to obtain the permission of the Austrian Federal Monument Agency.  App. 168a, ¶32.  Seeking to profit from this requirement, the Gallery and the Federal Monument Agency allegedly adopted a practice of forc[ing] Jews to donate or trade valuable artworks to the [Gallery] in exchange for export permits for other works.

In January 1948 Dr. Rinesch wrote to the Gallery requesting return of the three Klimts purchased from Dr. Fhrer.  A Gallery representative responded, assertingfalsely, according to the complaint

				In 1998 a journalist examining the Gallerys files discovered documents revealing that at all relevant times Gallery officials knew that neither Adele nor Ferdinand had, in fact, donated the six Klimts to the Gallery.  The journalist published a series of articles reporting his findings, and specifically noting that Klimts first portrait of Adele, which all the [Gallery] publications represented as having been donated to the museum in 1936, had actually been received in 1941, accompanied by a letter from Dr. Fhrer signed  Heil Hitler. 

The court rested that conclusion on an analysis of American courts then-prevalent practice of deferring to case-by-case immunity determinations by the State Department, and on that Departments expressed policy, as of 1949, of  reliev[ing] American courts from any restraint upon the exercise of their jurisdiction to pass upon the validity of the acts of Nazi officials.   317 F. 3d, at 965 (quoting Press Release No. 296, Jurisdiction of United States Courts Re Suits for Identifiable Property Involved in Nazi Forced Transfers (emphasis deleted)).

				A study of the law of sovereign immunity reveals the existence of two conflicting concepts of sovereign immunity, each widely held and firmly established.  According to the classical or absolute theory of sovereign immunity, a sovereign cannot, without his consent, be made a respondent in the courts of another sovereign.  According to the newer or restrictive theory of sovereign immunity, the immunity of the sovereign is recognized with regard to sovereign or public acts

				 of a state, but not with respect to private acts

S., at 487.  The change did, however, throw immunity determinations into some disarray, as foreign nations often placed diplomatic pressure on the State Department, and political considerations sometimes led the Department to file suggestions of immunity in cases where immunity would not have been available under the restrictive theory.  
				<em>

				Department:

        <p class="bodytext">
				[T]he responsibility fell to the courts to determine whether sovereign immunity existed, generally by reference to prior State Department decisions. . . .

				<em>
					i.e.,
				</em>
				 whether it would impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a partys liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed.

				Though seemingly comprehensive, this inquiry does not provide a clear answer in this case.  Although the FSIAs preamble suggests that it applies to preenactment conduct, see
				<em>
					 infra,
				</em>
				 at 18, that statement by itself falls short of an expres[s] prescri[ption of] the statutes proper reach.  Under 
				<em>
					Landgraf
				</em>
				, therefore, it is appropriate to ask whether the Act affects substantive rights (and thus would be impermissibly retroactive if applied to preenactment conduct) or addresses only matters of procedure (and thus may be applied to all pending cases regardless of when the underlying conduct occurred).  But the FSIA defies such categorization.  To begin with, none of the three examples of retroactivity mentioned in the above quotation fits the FSIAs clarification of the law of sovereign immunity.  Prior to 1976 foreign states had a justifiable expectation that, as a matter of comity, United States courts would grant them immunity for their public acts (provided the State Department did not recommend otherwise), but they had no right to such immunity.  Moreover, the FSIA merely opens United States courts to plaintiffs with pre-existing claims against foreign states; the Act neither increase[s those states] liability for past conduct nor impose[s] new duties with respect to transactions already completed.  511 U. S., at 280.  Thus, the Act does not at first appear to operate retroactively within the meaning of the 
				<em>
					Landgraf
				</em>
				 default rule.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				That preliminary conclusion, however, creates some tension with our observation in 
				<em>
					Verlinden
				</em>
				 that the FSIA is not simply a jurisdictional statute concern[ing] access to the federal courts but a codification of the standards governing foreign sovereign immunity as an aspect of 
				<em>
					substantive
				</em>
				 federal law.  461 U. S., at 496497 (emphasis added).  Moreover, we noted in 
				<em>
					Verlinden
				</em>
				 that in any suit against a foreign sovereign, the plaintiff will be barred from raising his claim in 
				<em>
					any
				</em>
				 court in the United States unless one of the FSIAs exceptions applies, 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 497 (emphasis added), and we have stated elsewhere that statutes that 
				<em>
					creat[e]

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">951</a> (1997)

				Thus, 
				<em>
					Landgraf
				</em>
				s default rule does not definitively resolve this case.  In our view, however, 
				<em>
					Landgraf
				</em>
				s antiretroactivity presumption, while not strictly confined to cases involving private rights, is most helpful in that context.  Cf. 511 U. S., at 271, n. 25 ([T]he great majority of our decisions relying upon the antiretroactivity presumption have involved intervening statutes burdening private parties).  The aim of the presumption is to avoid unnecessary 
				<em>
					post hoc
				</em>
				 changes to legal rules on which parties relied in shaping their primary conduct.  But the principal purpose of foreign sovereign immunity has never been to permit foreign states and their instrumentalities to shape their conduct in reliance on the promise of future immunity from suit in United States courts.  Rather, such immunity reflects current political realities and relationships, and aims to give foreign states and their instrumentalities some 
				<em>

				This leaves only the question whether anything in the FSIA or the circumstances surrounding its enactment suggests that we should not apply it to petitioners 1948 actions.

Though perhaps not sufficient to satisfy 
				<em>
					Landgraf

				s express command requirement, 511 U. S., at 280, this language is unambiguous: Immunity claimsnot actions protected by immunity, but assertions of immunity to suits arising from those actionsare the relevant conduct regulated by the Act;

				The FSIAs overall structure strongly supports this conclusion.  Many of the Acts provisions unquestionably apply to cases arising out of conduct that occurred before 1976.  In 
				<em>
					Dole Food Co.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Patrickson, 
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/538/468" class="subref" title="subref">538 U. S. 468</a> (2003)
, for example, we held that whether an entity qualifies as an instrumentality of a foreign state for purposes of the FSIAs grant of immunity depends on the relationship between the entity and the state at the time suit is brought rather than when the conduct occurred.  In addition, 
				<em>
					Verlinden
				</em>
				, which upheld against constitutional challenge 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1330.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1330</a>s grant of subject-matter jurisdiction, involved a dispute over a contract that predated the Act.  461 U. S., at 482483, 497.  And there has never been any doubt that the Acts procedural provisions relating to venue, removal, execution, and attachment apply to all pending cases.  Thus, the FSIAs preamble indicates that it applies henceforth, and its body includes numerous provisions that unquestionably apply to claims based on pre-1976 conduct.  In this context, it would be anomalous to presume that an isolated provision (such as the expropriation exception on which respondent relies) is of purely prospective application absent any statutory language to that effect.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Finally, applying the FSIA to all pending cases regardless of when the underlying conduct occurred is most consistent with two of the Acts principal purposes: clarifying the rules that judges should apply in resolving sovereign immunity claims and eliminating political participation in the resolution of such claims.  We have recognized that, to accomplish these purposes, Congress established a comprehensive framework for resolving any claim of sovereign immunity:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				We think that the text and structure of the FSIA demonstrate Congress intention that the FSIA be the sole basis for obtaining jurisdiction over a foreign state in our courts.  Sections 1604 and 1330(a) work in tandem: §1604 bars federal and state courts from exercising jurisdiction when a foreign state 
				<em>
					is
				</em>
				 entitled to immunity, and §1330(a) confers jurisdiction on district courts to hear suits brought by United States citizens and by aliens when a foreign state is 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 entitled to immunity.  As we said in 
				<em>
					Verlinden

				, the FSIA must be applied by the district courts in every action against a foreign sovereign, since subject-matter jurisdiction in any such action depends on the existence of one of the specified exceptions to foreign sovereign immunity. 

The

				 respondents claims concerned conduct that postdated the FSIA, so we had no occasion to consider the Acts retroactivity.  Nevertheless, our observations about the FSIAs inclusiveness are relevant in this case: Quite obviously, Congress purposes in enacting such a comprehensive jurisdictional scheme would be frustrated if, in postenactment cases concerning preenactment conduct, courts were to continue to follow the same ambiguous and politically charged  standards  that the FSIA replaced.

				We do not endorse the reasoning of the Court of Appeals.  Indeed, we think it engaged in precisely the kind of detailed historical inquiry that the FSIAs clear guidelines were intended to obviate.  Nevertheless, we affirm the panels judgment because the Act, freed from 
				<em>
					Landgraf
				</em>
				s antiretroactivity presumption, clearly applies to conduct, like petitioners alleged wrongdoing, that occurred prior to 1976 and, for that matter, prior to 1952 when the State Department adopted the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity.

				We conclude by emphasizing the narrowness of this holding.  To begin with, although the District Court and Court of Appeals determined that §1605(a)(3) covers this case, we declined to review that determination.  See 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 2, 89, and n. 8.  Nor do we have occasion to comment on the application of the so-called act of state doctrine to petitioners alleged wrongdoing.  Unlike a claim of sovereign immunity, which merely raises a jurisdictional defense, the act of state doctrine provides foreign states with a substantive defense on the merits.  Under that doctrine, the courts of one state will not question the validity of public acts (acts 
				<em>
					jure imperii)
				</em>
				 performed by other sovereigns within their own borders, even when such courts have jurisdiction over a controversy in which one of the litigants has standing to challenge those acts.

Petitioners principally rely on the act of state doctrine to support their assertion that foreign expropriations are public acts for which, prior to the enactment of the FSIA, sovereigns expected immunity.

Because we conclude that the FSIA maybe applied to petitioners 1948 actions, we need not address the Dis-trict Courts alternative suggestion that petitioners subsequent al-leged wrongdoing would be sufficient, in and of itself, to establish jurisdiction.

						 Chief Justice Marshall noted, however, that the outcome might well be different if the case involved a sovereigns private property:


Without indicating any opinion on this question, it may safely be affirmed, that there is a manifest distinction between the private property of the person who happens to be a prince, and that military force which supports the sovereign power, and maintains the dignity and the independence of a nation.  A prince, by acquiring private property in a foreign country, may possibly be considered as subjecting that property to the territorial jurisdiction; he may be considered as so far laying down the prince, and assuming the character of a private individual; but this he cannot be presumed to do with respect to any portion of that armed force, which upholds his crown, and the nation he is entrusted to govern.  Id., at 145.

C. §3730(b)(1)</a> Stat. 3154, and it prescribed a limitation that any court entertaining the cause of action was bound to apply, see §3730(e)(4)(A), 100 Stat., at 3157.  When a jurisdictional limitation adheres to the cause of action in this fashionwhen it applies by its terms regardless of where the claim is broughtthe limitation is essentially substantive.  In contrast, the FSIA simply limits the jurisdiction of federal and state courts to entertain claims against foreign sovereigns.  The Act does not create or modify any causes of action, nor does it purport to limit foreign countries decisions about what claims against which defendants their courts will entertain.


Even if the dissent is right that, like the provision at issue in Hughes Aircraft, the FSIA create[s] jurisdiction where there was none before, post, at 10 (opinion of Kennedy, J.) (punctuation omitted), however, that characteristic is in some tension with other, less substantive aspects of the Act.  This tension, in turn, renders the Landgrafapproach inconclusive and requires us to examine the entire statutein light of the underlying principles governing our retroactivityjurisprudence.

						 Our approach to retroactivity in this case thus parallels that advocated by Justice Scalia in his concurrence in Landgraf:


The critical issue, I think, is not whether the rule affects vested rights, or governs substance or procedure, but rather what is the relevant activity that the rule regulates.  Absent clear statement otherwise, only such relevant activity which occurs after the effective date of the statute is covered.  Most statutes are meant to regulate primary conduct, and hence will not be applied in trials involving conduct that occurred before their effective date.  But other statutes have a different purpose and therefore a different relevant retroactivity event.  511 U. S., at 291 (opinion concurring in judgment).

						 The dissent is quite right that  [a] statement that a statute will become effective on a certain date does not even arguably suggest that it has any application to conduct that occurred at an earlier date.   Post, at 6.

						 Petitioners suggest that the latter date is important because it marked the first shift in foreign states expectations concerning the scope of their immunity.  Whether or not the date would be significant to a Landgraf-type analysis of foreign states settled expectations at various times prior to the FSIAs enactment, it is of no relevance in this case given our rationale for finding the Act applicable to preenactment conduct.

						 Mislabeling this observation a constitutional conclusion, the dissent suggests that permitting the Executive to comment on a partys assertion of sovereign immunity will result in [u]ncertain prospective application of our foreign sovereign immunity law.  Post, at 21, 24.  We do not hold, however, that executive intervention could or would trump considered application of the FSIAs more neutral principles; we merely note that the Executives views on questions within its area of expertise merit greater deference than its opinions regarding the scope of a congressional enactment.  Furthermore, we fail to understand how our holding, which requires that courts apply the FSIAs sovereign immunity rules in all cases, somehow injects greater uncertainty into sovereign immunity law than the dissents approach, which would require, for cases concerning pre-1976 conduct, case-by-case analysis of the status of that law at the time of the offending conductincluding analysis of the existence or nonexistence of any State Department statements on the subject.

				In 1998 an Austrian journalist, granted access to the Austrian Gallerys archives, discovered evidence that certain valuable works in the Gallerys collection had not been donated by their rightful owners but had been seized by the Nazis or expropriated by the Austrian Republic after World War II.  The journalist provided some of that evidence to respondent, who in turn filed this action to recover possession of six Gustav Klimt paintings.  Prior to the Nazi invasion of Austria, the paintings had hung in the palatial Vienna home of respondents uncle, Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer, a Czechoslovakian Jew and patron of the arts.  Respondent claims ownership of the paintings under a will executed by her uncle after he fled Austria in 1938.  She alleges that the Gallery obtained possession of the paintings through wrongful conduct in the years during and after World War II.

				The defendants (petitioners here)the Republic of Austria and the Austrian Gallery (Gallery), an instrumentality of the Republicfiled a motion to dismiss the complaint asserting, among other defenses, a claim of sovereign immunity.  The District Court denied the motion, 142 F. Supp. 2d 1187 (CD Cal. 2001), and the Court of Appeals affirmed, 317 F. 3d 954 (CA9 2002), as amended, 327 F. 3d 1246 (2003).  We granted certiorari limited to the question whether the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA or Act),

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Born in Austria in 1916, respondent Maria V. Altmann escaped the country after it was annexed by Nazi Germany in 1938.  She settled in California in 1942 and became an American citizen in 1945.  She is a niece, and the sole surviving named heir, of Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer, who died in Zurich, Switzerland, on November 13, 1945.

				Prior to 1938 Ferdinand, then a wealthy sugar magnate, maintained his principal residence in Vienna, Austria, where the six Klimt paintings and other valuable works of art were housed.  His wife, Adele, was the subject of two of the paintings.  She died in 1925, leaving a will in which she ask[ed] her husband after his death to bequeath the paintings to the Gallery.

				  App. 187a, ¶81.  The attorney for her estate advised the Gallery that Ferdinand intended to comply with his wifes request, but that he was not legally obligated to do so because he, not Adele, owned the paintings.  Ferdinand never executed any document transferring ownership of any of the paintings at issue to the Gallery.  He remained their sole legitimate owner until his death.  His will bequeathed his entire estate to respondent, another niece, and a nephew.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				On March 12, 1938, in what became known as the Anschluss, the Nazis invaded and claimed to annex Austria.  Ferdinand, who was Jewish and had supported efforts to resist annexation, fled the country ahead of the Nazis, ultimately settling in Zurich.  In his absence, according to the complaint, the Nazis Aryanized the sugar company he had directed, took over his Vienna home, and divided up his artworks, which included the Klimts at issue here, many other valuable paintings, and a 400-piece porcelain collection.  A Nazi lawyer, Dr. Erich Fhrer, took possession of the six Klimts.  He sold two to the Gallery in 1941

				In 1946 Austria enacted a law declaring all transactions motivated by Nazi ideology null and void.  This did not result in the immediate return of looted artwork to exiled Austrians, however, because a different provision of Austrian law proscribed export of artworks … deemed to be important to [the countrys] cultural heritage and required anyone wishing to export art to obtain the permission of the Austrian Federal Monument Agency.  App. 168a, ¶32.  Seeking to profit from this requirement, the Gallery and the Federal Monument Agency allegedly adopted a practice of forc[ing] Jews to donate or trade valuable artworks to the [Gallery] in exchange for export permits for other works.

				The next year Robert Bentley, respondents brother and fellow heir, retained a Viennese lawyer, Dr. Gustav Rinesch, to locate and recover property stolen from Ferdinand during the war.  In January 1948 Dr. Rinesch wrote to the Gallery requesting return of the three Klimts purchased from Dr. Fhrer.  A Gallery representative responded, assertingfalsely, according to the complaint

In exchange, Dr. Rinesch, purporting to represent respondent and her fellow heirs, signed a document acknowledg[ing] and accept[ing] Ferdinands declaration that in the event of his death he wished to follow the wishes of his deceased wife to donate the Klimt paintings to the Gallery.

				In 1998 a journalist examining the Gallerys files discovered documents revealing that at all relevant times Gallery officials knew that neither Adele nor Ferdinand had, in fact, donated the six Klimts to the Gallery.  The journalist published a series of articles reporting his findings, and specifically noting that Klimts first portrait of Adele, which all the [Gallery] publications represented as having been donated to the museum in 1936, had actually been received in 1941, accompanied by a letter from Dr. Fhrer signed  Heil Hitler. 

				In response to these revelations, Austria enacted a new restitution law under which individuals who had been coerced into donating artworks to state museums in exchange for export permits could reclaim their property.  Respondentwho had believed, prior to the journalists investigation, that Adele and Ferdinand had freely donated the Klimt paintings to the Gallery before the war

The court rested that conclusion on an analysis of American courts then-prevalent practice of deferring to case-by-case immunity determinations by the State Department, and on that Departments expressed policy, as of 1949, of  reliev[ing] American courts from any restraint upon the exercise of their jurisdiction to pass upon the validity of the acts of Nazi officials.   317 F. 3d, at 965 (quoting Press Release No. 296, Jurisdiction of United States Courts Re Suits for Identifiable Property Involved in Nazi Forced Transfers (emphasis deleted)).

        <p class="bodytext">
				A study of the law of sovereign immunity reveals the existence of two conflicting concepts of sovereign immunity, each widely held and firmly established.  According to the classical or absolute theory of sovereign immunity, a sovereign cannot, without his consent, be made a respondent in the courts of another sovereign.  According to the newer or restrictive theory of sovereign immunity, the immunity of the sovereign is recognized with regard to sovereign or public acts 
				<em>
					(jure imperii)
				</em>
				 of a state, but not with respect to private acts 
				<em>
					(jure gestionis)

				As we explained in our unanimous opinion in 
				<em>
					Verlinden
				</em>
				, the change in State Department policy wrought by the Tate Letter had little, if any, impact on federal courts approach to immunity analyses: As in the past, initial responsibility for deciding questions of sovereign immunity fell primarily upon the Executive acting through the State Department, and courts continued to abid[e] by that Departments  suggestions of immunity.   461 U. S., at 487.  The change did, however, throw immunity determinations into some disarray, as foreign nations often placed diplomatic pressure on the State Department, and political considerations sometimes led the Department to file suggestions of immunity in cases where immunity would not have been available under the restrictive theory.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 487488.  Complicating matters further, when foreign nations failed to request immunity from the State
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				Department:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				[T]he responsibility fell to the courts to determine whether sovereign immunity existed, generally by reference to prior State Department decisions. . . . Thus, sovereign immunity determinations were made in two different branches, subject to a variety of factors, sometimes including diplomatic considerations.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				In 1976 Congress sought to remedy these problems by enacting the FSIA, a comprehensive statute containing a set of legal standards governing claims of immunity in every civil action against a foreign state or its political subdivisions, agencies, or instrumentalities.  
				<em>
					Id

				., at 488.  The Act codifies, as a matter of federal law, the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity,

				<em>
					Landgraf,
				</em>
				 511 U.

				<em>
					i.e.,
				</em>
				 whether it would impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a partys liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed.  If the statute would operate retroactively, our traditional presumption teaches that it does not govern absent clear congressional intent favoring such a result.

				Though seemingly comprehensive, this inquiry does not provide a clear answer in this case.  Although the FSIAs preamble suggests that it applies to preenactment conduct, see
				<em>
					 infra,
				</em>
				 at 18, that statement by itself falls short of an expres[s] prescri[ption of] the statutes proper reach.  Under 
				<em>
					Landgraf
				</em>
				, therefore, it is appropriate to ask whether the Act affects substantive rights (and thus would be impermissibly retroactive if applied to preenactment conduct) or addresses only matters of procedure (and thus may be applied to all pending cases regardless of when the underlying conduct occurred).  But the FSIA defies such categorization.  To begin with, none of the three examples of retroactivity mentioned in the above quotation fits the FSIAs clarification of the law of sovereign immunity.  Prior to 1976 foreign states had a justifiable expectation that, as a matter of comity, United States courts would grant them immunity for their public acts (provided the State Department did not recommend otherwise), but they had no right to such immunity.  Moreover, the FSIA merely opens United States courts to plaintiffs with pre-existing claims against foreign states; the Act neither increase[s those states] liability for past conduct nor impose[s] new duties with respect to transactions already completed.  511 U. S., at 280.  Thus, the Act does not at first appear to operate retroactively within the meaning of the 
				<em>
					Landgraf
				</em>
				 default rule.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				That preliminary conclusion, however, creates some tension with our observation in 
				<em>
					Verlinden
				</em>
				 that the FSIA is not simply a jurisdictional statute concern[ing] access to the federal courts but a codification of the standards governing foreign sovereign immunity as an aspect of 
				<em>
					substantive
				</em>
				 federal law.  461 U. S., at 496497 (emphasis added).  Moreover, we noted in 
				<em>
					Verlinden
				</em>
				 that in any suit against a foreign sovereign, the plaintiff will be barred from raising his claim in 
				<em>
					any
				</em>
				 court in the United States unless one of the FSIAs exceptions applies, 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 497 (emphasis added), and we have stated elsewhere that statutes that 
				<em>
					creat[e]
				</em>
				 jurisdiction where none otherwise exists spea[k] not just to the power of a particular court but to the substantive rights of the parties as well,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">951</a> (1997)

				Thus, 
				<em>
					Landgraf
				</em>
				s default rule does not definitively resolve this case.  In our view, however, 
				<em>
					Landgraf
				</em>
				s antiretroactivity presumption, while not strictly confined to cases involving private rights, is most helpful in that context.  Cf. 511 U. S., at 271, n. 25 ([T]he great majority of our decisions relying upon the antiretroactivity presumption have involved intervening statutes burdening private parties).  The aim of the presumption is to avoid unnecessary 
				<em>
					post hoc
				</em>
				 changes to legal rules on which parties relied in shaping their primary conduct.  But the principal purpose of foreign sovereign immunity has never been to permit foreign states and their instrumentalities to shape their conduct in reliance on the promise of future immunity from suit in United States courts.  Rather, such immunity reflects current political realities and relationships, and aims to give foreign states and their instrumentalities some

				<em>
					Verlinden,

				 461 U. S., at 486.  In this

				The FSIAs overall structure strongly supports this conclusion.  Many of the Acts provisions unquestionably apply to cases arising out of conduct that occurred before 1976.  In 
				<em>
					Dole Food Co.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Patrickson,

            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/538/468" class="subref" title="subref">538 U. S. 468</a> (2003)
, for example, we held that whether an entity qualifies as an instrumentality of a foreign state for purposes of the FSIAs grant of immunity depends on the relationship between the entity and the state at the time suit is brought rather than when the conduct occurred.  In addition, 
				<em>
					Verlinden
				</em>
				, which upheld against constitutional challenge 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1330.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1330</a>s grant of subject-matter jurisdiction, involved a dispute over a contract that predated the Act.  461 U. S., at 482483, 497.  And there has never been any doubt that the Acts procedural provisions relating to venue, removal, execution, and attachment apply to all pending cases.  Thus, the FSIAs preamble indicates that it applies henceforth, and its body includes numerous provisions that unquestionably apply to claims based on pre-1976 conduct.  In this context, it would be anomalous to presume that an isolated provision (such as the expropriation exception on which respondent relies) is of purely prospective application absent any statutory language to that effect.

				Finally, applying the FSIA to all pending cases regardless of when the underlying conduct occurred is most consistent with two of the Acts principal purposes: clarifying the rules that judges should apply in resolving sovereign immunity claims and eliminating political participation in the resolution of such claims.  We have recognized that, to accomplish these purposes, Congress established a comprehensive framework for resolving any claim of sovereign immunity:

        <p class="bodytext">
				We think that the text and structure of the FSIA demonstrate Congress intention that the FSIA be the sole basis for obtaining jurisdiction over a foreign state in our courts.  Sections 1604 and 1330(a) work in tandem: §1604 bars federal and state courts from exercising jurisdiction when a foreign state 
				<em>
					is
				</em>
				 entitled to immunity, and §1330(a) confers jurisdiction on district courts to hear suits brought by United States citizens and by aliens when a foreign state is 
				<em>

				</em>

				<em>
					Verlinden

The

				 respondents claims concerned conduct that postdated the FSIA, so we had no occasion to consider the Acts retroactivity.  Nevertheless, our observations about the FSIAs inclusiveness are relevant in this case: Quite obviously, Congress purposes in enacting such a comprehensive jurisdictional scheme would be frustrated if, in postenactment cases concerning preenactment conduct, courts were to continue to follow the same ambiguous and politically charged  standards  that the FSIA replaced.

				We do not endorse the reasoning of the Court of Appeals.  Indeed, we think it engaged in precisely the kind of detailed historical inquiry that the FSIAs clear guidelines were intended to obviate.  Nevertheless, we affirm the panels judgment because the Act, freed from 
				<em>

				<em>
					supra

				, at 2, 89, and n. 8.  Nor do we have occasion to comment on the application of the so-called act of state doctrine to petitioners alleged wrongdoing.  Unlike a claim of sovereign immunity, which merely raises a jurisdictional defense, the act of state doctrine provides foreign states with a substantive defense on the merits.  Under that doctrine, the courts of one state will not question the validity of public acts (acts 
				<em>
					jure imperii)
				</em>
				 performed by other sovereigns within their own borders, even when such courts have jurisdiction over a controversy in which one of the litigants has standing to challenge those acts.

 (The act of state doctrine in its traditional formulation precludes the courts of this country from inquiring into the validity of the public acts a recognized foreign sovereign power committed within its own territory).  Petitioners principally rely on the act of state doctrine to support their assertion that foreign expropriations are public acts for which, prior to the enactment of the FSIA, sovereigns expected immunity.

						 As the District Court noted, id., at 1201, n. 16, and the above summary of the complaint makes clear, supra, at 56, respondent alleges that petitioners wrongdoing continued well past 1948 in the form of concealment of the paintings true provenance and deliberate misinterpretation of Adeles will.  Because we conclude that the FSIA maybe applied to petitioners 1948 actions, we need not address the Dis-trict Courts alternative suggestion that petitioners subsequent al-leged wrongdoing would be sufficient, in and of itself, to establish jurisdiction.

						 Chief Justice Marshall noted, however, that the outcome might well be different if the case involved a sovereigns private property:


Without indicating any opinion on this question, it may safely be affirmed, that there is a manifest distinction between the private property of the person who happens to be a prince, and that military force which supports the sovereign power, and maintains the dignity and the independence of a nation.  A prince, by acquiring private property in a foreign country, may possibly be considered as subjecting that property to the territorial jurisdiction; he may be considered as so far laying down the prince, and assuming the character of a private individual; but this he cannot be presumed to do with respect to any portion of that armed force, which upholds his crown, and the nation he is entrusted to govern.  Id., at 145.

						 Of course, the FSIA differs from the statutory amendment at issue in Hughes Aircraft.  That amendment was attached to the statute that created the cause of action, see former 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/31/3730.html#b_1" class="subref" title="subref">31 U. S. C. §3730(b)(1)</a> (1982 ed.),

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/31/3730.html#b_1" class="subref" title="subref">31 U. S. C. §3730(b)(1)</a> Stat. 3154, and it prescribed a limitation that any court entertaining the cause of action was bound to apply, see §3730(e)(4)(A), 100 Stat., at 3157.  When a jurisdictional limitation adheres to the cause of action in this fashionwhen it applies by its terms regardless of where the claim is broughtthe limitation is essentially substantive.  In contrast, the FSIA simply limits the jurisdiction of federal and state courts to entertain claims against foreign sovereigns.  The Act does not create or modify any causes of action, nor does it purport to limit foreign countries decisions about what claims against which defendants their courts will entertain.


Even if the dissent is right that, like the provision at issue in Hughes Aircraft, the FSIA create[s] jurisdiction where there was none before, post, at 10 (opinion of Kennedy, J.) (punctuation omitted), however, that characteristic is in some tension with other, less substantive aspects of the Act.  This tension, in turn, renders the Landgrafapproach inconclusive and requires us to examine the entire statutein light of the underlying principles governing our retroactivityjurisprudence.

						 Our approach to retroactivity in this case thus parallels that advocated by Justice Scalia in his concurrence in Landgraf:


The critical issue, I think, is not whether the rule affects vested rights, or governs substance or procedure, but rather what is the relevant activity that the rule regulates.  Absent clear statement otherwise, only such relevant activity which occurs after the effective date of the statute is covered.  Most statutes are meant to regulate primary conduct, and hence will not be applied in trials involving conduct that occurred before their effective date.  But other statutes have a different purpose and therefore a different relevant retroactivity event.  511 U. S., at 291 (opinion concurring in judgment).

						 The dissent is quite right that  [a] statement that a statute will become effective on a certain date does not even arguably suggest that it has any application to conduct that occurred at an earlier date.   Post, at 6.  The provision of the FSIA to which this observation applies, however, is not the preamble but section 8, which states that the Act shall take effect ninety days after the date of its enactment. 

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1602.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1602</a>.  The office of the word henceforth is to make the statute effective with respect to claims to immunity thereafter asserted.  Notably, any such claim asserted immediately after the statute became effective would necessarily have related to conduct that took place at an earlier date.

						 Petitioners suggest that the latter date is important because it marked the first shift in foreign states expectations concerning the scope of their immunity.  Whether or not the date would be significant to a Landgraf-type analysis of foreign states settled expectations at various times prior to the FSIAs enactment, it is of no relevance in this case given our rationale for finding the Act applicable to preenactment conduct.

						 Mislabeling this observation a constitutional conclusion, the dissent suggests that permitting the Executive to comment on a partys assertion of sovereign immunity will result in [u]ncertain prospective application of our foreign sovereign immunity law.  Post, at 21, 24.  We do not hold, however, that executive intervention could or would trump considered application of the FSIAs more neutral principles; we merely note that the Executives views on questions within its area of expertise merit greater deference than its opinions regarding the scope of a congressional enactment.  Furthermore, we fail to understand how our holding, which requires that courts apply the FSIAs sovereign immunity rules in all cases, somehow injects greater uncertainty into sovereign immunity law than the dissents approach, which would require, for cases concerning pre-1976 conduct, case-by-case analysis of the status of that law at the time of the offending conductincluding analysis of the existence or nonexistence of any State Department statements on the subject.

				In 1998 an Austrian journalist, granted access to the Austrian Gallerys archives, discovered evidence that certain valuable works in the Gallerys collection had not been donated by their rightful owners but had been seized by the Nazis or expropriated by the Austrian Republic after World War II.  The journalist provided some of that evidence to respondent, who in turn filed this action to recover possession of six Gustav Klimt paintings.  Prior to the Nazi invasion of Austria, the paintings had hung in the palatial Vienna home of respondents uncle, Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer, a Czechoslovakian Jew and patron of the arts.  Respondent claims ownership of the paintings under a will executed by her uncle after he fled Austria in 1938.  She alleges that the Gallery obtained possession of the paintings through wrongful conduct in the years during and after World War II.

				The defendants (petitioners here)the Republic of Austria and the Austrian Gallery (Gallery), an instrumentality of the Republicfiled a motion to dismiss the complaint asserting, among other defenses, a claim of sovereign immunity.  The District Court denied the motion, 142 F. Supp. 2d 1187 (CD Cal. 2001), and the Court of Appeals affirmed, 317 F. 3d 954 (CA9 2002), as amended, 327 F. 3d 1246 (2003).  We granted certiorari limited to the question whether the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA or Act),

				Because this case comes to us from the denial of a motion to dismiss on the pleadings, we assume the truth of the following facts alleged in respondents complaint.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Born in Austria in 1916, respondent Maria V. Altmann escaped the country after it was annexed by Nazi Germany in 1938.  She settled in California in 1942 and became an American citizen in 1945.  She is a niece, and the sole surviving named heir, of Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer, who died in Zurich, Switzerland, on November 13, 1945.

				Prior to 1938 Ferdinand, then a wealthy sugar magnate, maintained his principal residence in Vienna, Austria, where the six Klimt paintings and other valuable works of art were housed.  His wife, Adele, was the subject of two of the paintings.  She died in 1925, leaving a will in which she ask[ed] her husband after his death to bequeath the paintings to the Gallery.

            </a>
				  App. 187a, ¶81.  The attorney for her estate advised the Gallery that Ferdinand intended to comply with his wifes request, but that he was not legally obligated to do so because he, not Adele, owned the paintings.  Ferdinand never executed any document transferring ownership of any of the paintings at issue to the Gallery.  He remained their sole legitimate owner until his death.  His will bequeathed his entire estate to respondent, another niece, and a nephew.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				On March 12, 1938, in what became known as the Anschluss, the Nazis invaded and claimed to annex Austria.  Ferdinand, who was Jewish and had supported efforts to resist annexation, fled the country ahead of the Nazis, ultimately settling in Zurich.  In his absence, according to the complaint, the Nazis Aryanized the sugar company he had directed, took over his Vienna home, and divided up his artworks, which included the Klimts at issue here, many other valuable paintings, and a 400-piece porcelain collection.  A Nazi lawyer, Dr. Erich Fhrer, took possession of the six Klimts.  He sold two to the Gallery in 1941

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In 1946 Austria enacted a law declaring all transactions motivated by Nazi ideology null and void.  This did not result in the immediate return of looted artwork to exiled Austrians, however, because a different provision of Austrian law proscribed export of artworks … deemed to be important to [the countrys] cultural heritage and required anyone wishing to export art to obtain the permission of the Austrian Federal Monument Agency.  App. 168a, ¶32.  Seeking to profit from this requirement, the Gallery and the Federal Monument Agency allegedly adopted a practice of forc[ing] Jews to donate or trade valuable artworks to the [Gallery] in exchange for export permits for other works.

				The next year Robert Bentley, respondents brother and fellow heir, retained a Viennese lawyer, Dr. Gustav Rinesch, to locate and recover property stolen from Ferdinand during the war.  In January 1948 Dr. Rinesch wrote to the Gallery requesting return of the three Klimts purchased from Dr. Fhrer.  A Gallery representative responded, assertingfalsely, according to the complaint
				<span class="softbreak"></span>

				Later the same year Dr. Rinesch enlisted the support of Gallery officials to obtain export permits for many of Ferdinands remaining works of art.  In exchange, Dr. Rinesch, purporting to represent respondent and her fellow heirs, signed a document acknowledg[ing] and accept[ing] Ferdinands declaration that in the event of his death he wished to follow the wishes of his deceased wife to donate the Klimt paintings to the Gallery.

				In 1998 a journalist examining the Gallerys files discovered documents revealing that at all relevant times Gallery officials knew that neither Adele nor Ferdinand had, in fact, donated the six Klimts to the Gallery.  The journalist published a series of articles reporting his findings, and specifically noting that Klimts first portrait of Adele, which all the [Gallery] publications represented as having been donated to the museum in 1936, had actually been received in 1941, accompanied by a letter from Dr. Fhrer signed  Heil Hitler. 

				In response to these revelations, Austria enacted a new restitution law under which individuals who had been coerced into donating artworks to state museums in exchange for export permits could reclaim their property.  Respondentwho had believed, prior to the journalists investigation, that Adele and Ferdinand had freely donated the Klimt paintings to the Gallery before the war
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				immediately sought recovery of the paintings and other artworks under the new law.

				., at 178a179a, ¶61, 182a.  A committee of Austrian government officials and art historians agreed to return certain Klimt drawings and porcelain settings that the family had donated in 1948.  After what the complaint terms a sham proceeding, however, the committee declined to return the six paintings, concluding, based on an allegedly purposeful misreading of Adeles will, that her precatory request had created a binding legal obligation that required her husband to donate the paintings to the Gallery on his death.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 185a.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Respondent then announced that she would file a lawsuit in Austria to recover the paintings.  Because Austrian court costs are proportional to the value of the recovery sought (and in this case would total several million dollars, an amount far beyond respondents means), she requested a waiver.

Finding no such statement, the court then asked whether application of the Act to petitioners 1948 actions would impair rights [petitioners] possessed when [they] acted, impose new duties on [them], or increase [their] liability for past conduct.

				, at 1201.  As further support for this finding, the court noted that the FSIA itself provides that  [c]laims of foreign states to immunity should

				  Rather than endorsing the District Courts reliance on the Acts jurisdictional nature, however, the panel reasoned that applying the FSIA to Austrias alleged wrongdoing was not impermissibly retroactive because Austria could not legitimately have expected to receive immunity for that wrongdoing even in 1948 when it occurred.  The court rested that conclusion on an analysis of American courts then-prevalent practice of deferring to case-by-case immunity determinations by the State Department, and on that Departments expressed policy, as of 1949, of  reliev[ing] American courts from any restraint upon the exercise of their jurisdiction to pass upon the validity of the acts of Nazi officials.   317 F. 3d, at 965 (quoting Press Release No. 296, Jurisdiction of United States Courts Re Suits for Identifiable Property Involved in Nazi Forced Transfers (emphasis deleted)).

S., at 487.  The change did, however, throw immunity determinations into some disarray, as foreign nations often placed diplomatic pressure on the State Department, and political considerations sometimes led the Department to file suggestions of immunity in cases where immunity would not have been available under the restrictive theory.  
				<em>

				Department:

        <p class="bodytext">
				[T]he responsibility fell to the courts to determine whether sovereign immunity existed, generally by reference to prior State Department decisions. . . .

				<em>
					i.e.,
				</em>
				 whether it would impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a partys liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed.

				Though seemingly comprehensive, this inquiry does not provide a clear answer in this case.  Although the FSIAs preamble suggests that it applies to preenactment conduct, see
				<em>
					 infra,
				</em>
				 at 18, that statement by itself falls short of an expres[s] prescri[ption of] the statutes proper reach.  Under 
				<em>
					Landgraf
				</em>
				, therefore, it is appropriate to ask whether the Act affects substantive rights (and thus would be impermissibly retroactive if applied to preenactment conduct) or addresses only matters of procedure (and thus may be applied to all pending cases regardless of when the underlying conduct occurred).  But the FSIA defies such categorization.  To begin with, none of the three examples of retroactivity mentioned in the above quotation fits the FSIAs clarification of the law of sovereign immunity.  Prior to 1976 foreign states had a justifiable expectation that, as a matter of comity, United States courts would grant them immunity for their public acts (provided the State Department did not recommend otherwise), but they had no right to such immunity.  Moreover, the FSIA merely opens United States courts to plaintiffs with pre-existing claims against foreign states; the Act neither increase[s those states] liability for past conduct nor impose[s] new duties with respect to transactions already completed.  511 U. S., at 280.  Thus, the Act does not at first appear to operate retroactively within the meaning of the 
				<em>
					Landgraf
				</em>
				 default rule.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				That preliminary conclusion, however, creates some tension with our observation in 
				<em>
					Verlinden
				</em>
				 that the FSIA is not simply a jurisdictional statute concern[ing] access to the federal courts but a codification of the standards governing foreign sovereign immunity as an aspect of 
				<em>
					substantive
				</em>
				 federal law.  461 U. S., at 496497 (emphasis added).  Moreover, we noted in 
				<em>
					Verlinden
				</em>
				 that in any suit against a foreign sovereign, the plaintiff will be barred from raising his claim in 
				<em>
					any
				</em>
				 court in the United States unless one of the FSIAs exceptions applies, 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 497 (emphasis added), and we have stated elsewhere that statutes that 

					creat[e]

				 jurisdiction where none otherwise exists spea[k] not just to the power of a particular court but to the substantive rights of the parties as well,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">951</a> (1997)

				Thus, 
				<em>
					Landgraf
				</em>
				s default rule does not definitively resolve this case.  In our view, however, 
				<em>
					Landgraf
				</em>
				s antiretroactivity presumption, while not strictly confined to cases involving private rights, is most helpful in that context.  Cf. 511 U. S., at 271, n. 25 ([T]he great majority of our decisions relying upon the antiretroactivity presumption have involved intervening statutes burdening private parties).  The aim of the presumption is to avoid unnecessary 
				<em>
					post hoc
				</em>
				 changes to legal rules on which parties relied in shaping their primary conduct.  But the principal purpose of foreign sovereign immunity has never been to permit foreign states and their instrumentalities to shape their conduct in reliance on the promise of future immunity from suit in United States courts.  Rather, such immunity reflects current political realities and relationships, and aims to give foreign states and their instrumentalities some 
				<em>
					present

				<em>

				 461 U. S., at 486.  In this 
				<em>

				<em>
					inapplicable

				This leaves only the question whether anything in the FSIA or the circumstances surrounding its enactment suggests that we should not apply it to petitioners 1948 actions.

Though perhaps not sufficient to satisfy 
				<em>
					Landgraf
				</em>
				s express command requirement, 511 U. S., at 280, this language is unambiguous: Immunity claimsnot actions protected by immunity, but assertions of immunity to suits arising from those actionsare the relevant conduct regulated by the Act;

				The FSIAs overall structure strongly supports this conclusion.  Many of the Acts provisions unquestionably apply to cases arising out of conduct that occurred before 1976.  In 
				<em>
					Dole Food Co.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Patrickson, 
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/538/468" class="subref" title="subref">538 U. S. 468</a> (2003)
, for example, we held that whether an entity qualifies as an instrumentality of a foreign state for purposes of the FSIAs grant of immunity depends on the relationship between the entity and the state at the time suit is brought rather than when the conduct occurred.  In addition, 
				<em>
					Verlinden
				</em>
				, which upheld against constitutional challenge 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1330.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1330</a>s grant of subject-matter jurisdiction, involved a dispute over a contract that predated the Act.  461 U. S., at 482483, 497.  And there has never been any doubt that the Acts procedural provisions relating to venue, removal, execution, and attachment apply to all pending cases.  Thus, the FSIAs preamble indicates that it applies henceforth, and its body includes numerous provisions that unquestionably apply to claims based on pre-1976 conduct.  In this context, it would be anomalous to presume that an isolated provision (such as the expropriation exception on which respondent relies) is of purely prospective application absent any statutory language to that effect.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Finally, applying the FSIA to all pending cases regardless of when the underlying conduct occurred is most consistent with two of the Acts principal purposes: clarifying the rules that judges should apply in resolving sovereign immunity claims and eliminating political participation in the resolution of such claims.  We have recognized that, to accomplish these purposes, Congress established a comprehensive framework for resolving any claim of sovereign immunity:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				We think that the text and structure of the FSIA demonstrate Congress intention that the FSIA be the sole basis for obtaining jurisdiction over a foreign state in our courts.  Sections 1604 and 1330(a) work in tandem: §1604 bars federal and state courts from exercising jurisdiction when a foreign state 
				<em>
					is
				</em>
				 entitled to immunity, and §1330(a) confers jurisdiction on district courts to hear suits brought by United States citizens and by aliens when a foreign state is 
				<em>
					not

				<em>

The

Unlike a claim of sovereign immunity, which merely raises a jurisdictional defense, the act of state doctrine provides foreign states with a substantive defense on the merits.  Under that doctrine, the courts of one state will not question the validity of public acts (acts

				 performed by other sovereigns within their own borders, even when such courts have jurisdiction over a controversy in which one of the litigants has standing to challenge those acts.

						 Adeles will mentions six Klimt paintings, Adele Bloch-Bauer I, Adele Bloch-Bauer II, Apple Tree I, Beechwood, Houses in Unterach am Attersee, and Schloss Kammer am Attersee III.  The last of these, Schloss Kammer am Attersee III, is not at issue in this case because Ferdinand donated it to the Gallery in 1936.  The sixth painting in this case, Amalie Zuckerkandl, is not mentioned in Adeles will.  For further details, see 142 F. Supp. 2d 1187, 11921193 (CD Cal. 2001).

[Her] second cause of action is for replevin, presumably under California law; [she] seeks return of the paintings.  [Her] third cause of action seeks rescission of any agreements by the Austrian lawyer with the Gallery or the Federal Monument Agency due to mistake, duress, and/or lack of authorization.  [Her] fourth cause of action seeks damages for expropriation and conversion, and her fifth cause of action seeks damages for violation of international law.  [Her] sixth cause of action seeks imposition of a constructive trust, and her seventh cause of action seeks restitution based on unjust enrichment.  Finally, [her] eighth cause of action seeks disgorgement of profits under the California Unfair Business Practices law.  Id., at 1197.

						 As the District Court noted, id., at 1201, n. 16, and the above summary of the complaint makes clear, supra, at 56, respondent alleges that petitioners wrongdoing continued well past 1948 in the form of concealment of the paintings true provenance and deliberate misinterpretation of Adeles will.  Because we conclude that the FSIA maybe applied to petitioners 1948 actions, we need not address the Dis-trict Courts alternative suggestion that petitioners subsequent al-leged wrongdoing would be sufficient, in and of itself, to establish jurisdiction.

						 Chief Justice Marshall noted, however, that the outcome might well be different if the case involved a sovereigns private property:


Without indicating any opinion on this question, it may safely be affirmed, that there is a manifest distinction between the private property of the person who happens to be a prince, and that military force which supports the sovereign power, and maintains the dignity and the independence of a nation.  A prince, by acquiring private property in a foreign country, may possibly be considered as subjecting that property to the territorial jurisdiction; he may be considered as so far laying down the prince, and assuming the character of a private individual; but this he cannot be presumed to do with respect to any portion of that armed force, which upholds his crown, and the nation he is entrusted to govern.  Id., at 145.

						 Of course, the FSIA differs from the statutory amendment at issue in Hughes Aircraft.  That amendment was attached to the statute that created the cause of action, see former 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/31/3730.html#b_1" class="subref" title="subref">31 U. S. C. §3730(b)(1)</a> (1982 ed.),

978; 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/31/3730.html#b_1" class="subref" title="subref">31 U. S. C. §3730(b)(1)</a> Stat. 3154, and it prescribed a limitation that any court entertaining the cause of action was bound to apply, see §3730(e)(4)(A), 100 Stat., at 3157.  When a jurisdictional limitation adheres to the cause of action in this fashionwhen it applies by its terms regardless of where the claim is broughtthe limitation is essentially substantive.  In contrast, the FSIA simply limits the jurisdiction of federal and state courts to entertain claims against foreign sovereigns.  The Act does not create or modify any causes of action, nor does it purport to limit foreign countries decisions about what claims against which defendants their courts will entertain.


Even if the dissent is right that, like the provision at issue in Hughes Aircraft, the FSIA create[s] jurisdiction where there was none before, post, at 10 (opinion of Kennedy, J.) (punctuation omitted), however, that characteristic is in some tension with other, less substantive aspects of the Act.  This tension, in turn, renders the Landgrafapproach inconclusive and requires us to examine the entire statutein light of the underlying principles governing our retroactivityjurisprudence.

						 Between 1952 and 1976 courts and the State Department similarly presumed that the Tate Letter was applicable even in disputes concerning conduct that predated the letter.  See, e.g., National City Bank of N. Y. v. Republic of China,

						 Our approach to retroactivity in this case thus parallels that advocated by Justice Scalia in his concurrence in Landgraf:


The critical issue, I think, is not whether the rule affects vested rights, or governs substance or procedure, but rather what is the relevant activity that the rule regulates.  Absent clear statement otherwise, only such relevant activity which occurs after the effective date of the statute is covered.  Most statutes are meant to regulate primary conduct, and hence will not be applied in trials involving conduct that occurred before their effective date.  But other statutes have a different purpose and therefore a different relevant retroactivity event.  511 U. S., at 291 (opinion concurring in judgment).

						 The dissent is quite right that  [a] statement that a statute will become effective on a certain date does not even arguably suggest that it has any application to conduct that occurred at an earlier date.   Post, at 6.  The provision of the FSIA to which this observation applies, however, is not the preamble but section 8, which states that the Act shall take effect ninety days after the date of its enactment. 

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1602.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1602</a>.  The office of the word henceforth is to make the statute effective with respect to claims to immunity thereafter asserted.  Notably, any such claim asserted immediately after the statute became effective would necessarily have related to conduct that took place at an earlier date.

						 Petitioners suggest that the latter date is important because it marked the first shift in foreign states expectations concerning the scope of their immunity.  Whether or not the date would be significant to a Landgraf-type analysis of foreign states settled expectations at various times prior to the FSIAs enactment, it is of no relevance in this case given our rationale for finding the Act applicable to preenactment conduct.

						 Mislabeling this observation a constitutional conclusion, the dissent suggests that permitting the Executive to comment on a partys assertion of sovereign immunity will result in [u]ncertain prospective application of our foreign sovereign immunity law.  Post, at 21, 24.  We do not hold, however, that executive intervention could or would trump considered application of the FSIAs more neutral principles; we merely note that the Executives views on questions within its area of expertise merit greater deference than its opinions regarding the scope of a congressional enactment.  Furthermore, we fail to understand how our holding, which requires that courts apply the FSIAs sovereign immunity rules in all cases, somehow injects greater uncertainty into sovereign immunity law than the dissents approach, which would require, for cases concerning pre-1976 conduct, case-by-case analysis of the status of that law at the time of the offending conductincluding analysis of the existence or nonexistence of any State Department statements on the subject.

				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 17, n. 15, I think reliance on that case is mistaken.  The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, and the regime that it replaced, do not by their own force create or modify substantive rights; respondents substantive claims are based primarily on California law, see 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 6, n. 4.  Federal sovereign-immunity law limits the jurisdiction of federal and state courts to entertain those claims, see

It is true enough that, as to a claim that no foreign court would entertain, the FSIA can have the accidental effect of rendering enforceable what was previously unenforceable.  But unlike a 
				<em>
					Hughes Aircraft
				</em>
				-type statute, which confers or limits jurisdiction in every court where the claim might be brought, the FSIA affects substantive rights only accidentally, and not as a necessary and intended consequence of the law.  Statutes like the FSIA do not 

				, at 6, n. 4.  Federal sovereign-immunity law limits the jurisdiction of federal and state courts to entertain those claims, see

It is true enough that, as to a claim that no foreign court would entertain, the FSIA can have the accidental effect of rendering enforceable what was previously unenforceable.  But unlike a 
				<em>
					Hughes Aircraft
				</em>
				-type statute, which confers or limits jurisdiction in every court where the claim might be brought, the FSIA affects substantive rights only accidentally, and not as a necessary and intended consequence of the law.  Statutes like the FSIA do not 

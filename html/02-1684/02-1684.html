				The law in this case asks judges to apply, not arcane or complex legal directives, but ordinary common sense. Would a reasonable person in Alvarados position have felt free simply to get up and walk out of the small room in the station house at will during his 2-hour police interrogation?  I ask the reader to put himself, or herself, in Alvarados circumstances and then answer that question:  Alvarado hears from his parents that he is needed for police questioning.  His parents take him to the station.  On arrival, a police officer separates him from his parents.  His parents ask to come along, but the officer says they may not.  App. 185186.  Another officer says,  What do we have here; we are going to question a suspect. 

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The police take Alvarado to a small interrogation room, away from the stations public area.  A single officer begins to question him, making clear in the process that the police have evidence that he participated in an attempted carjacking connected with a murder.  When he says that he never saw any shooting, the officer suggests that he is lying, while adding that she is giving [him] the opportunity to tell the truth and tak[e] care of [him]self.

				, at 102, 105.  Toward the end of the questioning, the officer gives him permission to take a bathroom or water break.  After two hours, by which time he has admitted he was involved in the attempted theft, knew about the gun, and helped to hide it, the questioning ends.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				What reasonable person in the circumstancesbrought to a police station by his parents at police request, put in a small interrogation room, questioned for a solid two hours, and confronted with claims that there is strong evidence that he participated in a serious crime, could have thought to himself, Well, anytime I want to leave I can just get up and walk out?  If the person harbored any doubts, would he still think he might be free to leave once he recalls that the police officer has just refused to let his parents remain with him during questioning?  Would he still think that he, rather than the officer, controls the situation?
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				There is only one possible answer to these questions.  A reasonable person would 
				<em>
					not 
				</em>
				have thought he was free simply to pick up and leave in the middle of the interrogation.  I believe the California courts were clearly wrong to hold the contrary, and the Ninth Circuit was right in concluding that those state courts unreasonably applied clearly established federal law.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2254.html#d_1" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1)</a>.

				What about Alvarados youth?  The fact that Alvarado was 17 helps to show that he was unlikely to have felt free to ignore his parents request to come to the station.  See 
				<em>
					Schall

				v.

					 Martin,

 (juveniles assumed to be subject to the control of their parents).  And a 17-year-old is more likely than, say, a 35-year-old, to take a police officers assertion of authority to keep parents outside the room as an assertion of authority to keep their child inside as well.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The majority suggests that the law might 
				<em>
					prevent
				</em>
				 a judge from taking account of the fact that Alvarado was 17.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1314.  I can find nothing in the law that  supports that conclusion.  Our cases do instruct lower courts to apply a reasonable person standard.  But the reasonable person standard does not require a court to pretend that Alvarado was a 35-year-old with aging parents whose middle-aged children do what their parents ask only out of respect.  Nor does it say that a court should pretend that Alvarado was the statistically determined average persona working, married, 35-year-old white female with a high school degree.  See U. S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census, Statistical Abstract of the United States: 2003 (123d ed.).

				Rather, the precise legal definition of reasonable person may, depending on legal context, appropriately account for certain personal characteristics.  In negligence suits, for example, the question is what would a reasonable person do  under the same or similar circumstances.   In answering that question, courts enjoy latitude and may make allowance not only for external facts, but sometimes for certain characteristics of the actor himself, including physical disability, youth, or advanced age.  W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, &amp; D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts §32, pp. 174179 (5th ed. 1984); see 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 179181; see also Restatement (Third) of Torts §10, Comment b, pp. 128130 (Tent. Draft No. 1, Mar. 28, 2001) (all American jurisdictions count a persons childhood as a relevant circumstance in negligence determinations).  This allowance makes sense in light of the tort standards recognized purpose: deterrence.  Given that purpose, why pretend that a child is an adult or that a blind man can see?  See O. Holmes, The Common Law 8589 (M. Howe ed. 1963).

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In the present context, that of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s in custody inquiry, the law has introduced the concept of a reasonable person to avoid judicial inquiry into subjective states of mind, and to focus the inquiry instead upon objective circumstances that are known to both the officer and the suspect and that are likely relevant to the way a person would understand his situation.  See 
				<em>
					Stansbury
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 323325; 
				<em>
					Berkemer
				</em>
				, 468 U. S., at 442, and n. 35.  This focus helps to keep 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 a workable rule.  See 
				<em>

				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 430431.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In this case, Alvarados youth is an objective circumstance that was known to the police.  It is not a special quality, but rather a widely shared characteristic that generates commonsense conclusions about behavior and perception.  To focus on the circumstance of age in a case like this does not complicate the in custody inquiry.  And to say that courts should
				 
				ignore widely shared, objective characteristics, like age, on the ground that only a (large) 
				<em>
					minority 
				</em>
				of the population possesses them would produce absurd results, the present instance being a case in point.  I am not surprised that the majority points to no case suggesting any such limitation.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Alvarado
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Hickman
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				316 F. 3d 841, 848, 851, n. 5 (CA9 2002) (case below) (listing 12 cases from 12 different jurisdictions suggesting the contrary).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Nor am I surprised that the majority makes no real argument at all explaining 
				<em>
					why
				</em>
				 any court would believe that the objective fact of a suspects age could 
				<em>
					never
				</em>
				 be relevant.  But see 
				<em>
					ante

				, at 1 (

				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 15a bright red herring in the present context where Alvarados youth (an objective fact) simply helps to show (with the help of a legal presumption) that his appearance at the police station was not voluntary.  See

				As I have said, the law in this case is clear.  This Courts cases establish that, even if the police do not tell a suspect he is under arrest, do not handcuff him, do not lock him in a cell, and do not threaten him, he may nonetheless reasonably believe he is not free to leave the place of questioningand thus be in custody for

But the reasonable person standard does not require a court to pretend that Alvarado was a 35-year-old with aging parents whose middle-aged children do what their parents ask only out of respect.  Nor does it say that a court should pretend that Alvarado was the statistically determined average persona working, married, 35-year-old white female with a high school degree.  See U. S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census, Statistical Abstract of the United States: 2003 (123d ed.).

				Rather, the precise legal definition of reasonable person may, depending on legal context, appropriately account for certain personal characteristics.  In negligence suits, for example, the question is what would a reasonable person do  under the same or similar circumstances.   In answering that question, courts enjoy latitude and may make allowance not only for external facts, but sometimes for certain characteristics of the actor himself, including physical disability, youth, or advanced age.

This allowance makes sense in light of the tort standards recognized purpose: deterrence.  Given that purpose, why pretend that a child is an adult or that a blind man can see?  See O. Holmes, The Common Law 8589 (M. Howe ed. 1963).

				In the present context, that of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s in custody inquiry, the law has introduced the concept of a reasonable person to avoid judicial inquiry into subjective states of mind, and to focus the inquiry instead upon objective circumstances that are known to both the officer and the suspect and that are likely relevant to the way a person would understand his situation.  See

				In this case, Alvarados youth is an objective circumstance that was known to the police.  It is not a special quality, but rather a widely shared characteristic that generates commonsense conclusions about behavior and perception.  To focus on the circumstance of age in a case like this does not complicate the in custody inquiry.  And to say that courts should
				 
				ignore widely shared, objective characteristics, like age, on the ground that only a (large) 
				<em>
					minority

				The law in this case asks judges to apply, not arcane or complex legal directives, but ordinary common sense. Would a reasonable person in Alvarados position have felt free simply to get up and walk out of the small room in the station house at will during his 2-hour police interrogation?  I ask the reader to put himself, or herself, in Alvarados circumstances and then answer that question:  Alvarado hears from his parents that he is needed for police questioning.  His parents take him to the station.  On arrival, a police officer separates him from his parents.  His parents ask to come along, but the officer says they may not.  App. 185186.

				The police take Alvarado to a small interrogation room, away from the stations public area.  A single officer begins to question him, making clear in the process that the police have evidence that he participated in an attempted carjacking connected with a murder.

				What reasonable person in the circumstancesbrought to a police station by his parents at police request, put in a small interrogation room, questioned for a solid two hours, and confronted with claims that there is strong evidence that he participated in a serious crime, could have thought to himself, Well, anytime I want to leave I can just get up and walk out?

Nor does it say that a court should pretend that Alvarado was the statistically determined average persona working, married, 35-year-old white female with a high school degree.  See U. S.

				Rather, the precise legal definition of reasonable person may, depending on legal context, appropriately account for certain personal characteristics.  In negligence suits, for example, the question is what would a reasonable person do  under the same or similar circumstances.   In answering that question, courts enjoy latitude and may make allowance not only for external facts, but sometimes for certain characteristics of the actor himself, including physical disability, youth, or advanced age.

This allowance makes sense in light of the tort standards recognized purpose: deterrence.  Given that purpose, why pretend that a child is an adult or that a blind man can see?  See O.

				In the present context, that of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s in custody inquiry, the law has introduced the concept of a reasonable person to avoid judicial inquiry into subjective states of mind, and to focus the inquiry instead upon objective circumstances that are known to both the officer and the suspect and that are likely relevant to the way a person would understand his situation.

				In this case, Alvarados youth is an objective circumstance that was known to the police.  It is not a special quality, but rather a widely shared characteristic that generates commonsense conclusions about behavior and perception.  To focus on the circumstance of age in a case like this does not complicate the in custody inquiry.  And to say that courts should
				 
				ignore widely shared, objective characteristics, like age, on the ground that only a (large) 
				<em>

				The law in this case asks judges to apply, not arcane or complex legal directives, but ordinary common sense. Would a reasonable person in Alvarados position have felt free simply to get up and walk out of the small room in the station house at will during his 2-hour police interrogation?  I ask the reader to put himself, or herself, in Alvarados circumstances and then answer that question:  Alvarado hears from his parents that he is needed for police questioning.  His parents take him to the station.  On arrival, a police officer separates him from his parents.  His parents ask to come along, but the officer says they may not.  App. 185186.  Another officer says,  What do we have here; we are going to question a suspect. 

				The police take Alvarado to a small interrogation room, away from the stations public area.  A single officer begins to question him, making clear in the process that the police have evidence that he participated in an attempted carjacking connected with a murder.  When he says that he never saw any shooting, the officer suggests that he is lying, while adding that she is giving [him] the opportunity to tell the truth and tak[e] care of [him]self.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 102, 105.  Toward the end of the questioning, the officer gives him permission to take a bathroom or water break.  After two hours, by which time he has admitted he was involved in the attempted theft, knew about the gun, and helped to hide it, the questioning ends.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				What reasonable person in the circumstancesbrought to a police station by his parents at police request, put in a small interrogation room, questioned for a solid two hours, and confronted with claims that there is strong evidence that he participated in a serious crime, could have thought to himself, Well, anytime I want to leave I can just get up and walk out?  If the person harbored any doubts, would he still think he might be free to leave once he recalls that the police officer has just refused to let his parents remain with him during questioning?  Would he still think that he, rather than the officer, controls the situation?

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				There is only one possible answer to these questions.  A reasonable person would 
				<em>
					not 
				</em>
				have thought he was free simply to pick up and leave in the middle of the interrogation.  I believe the California courts were clearly wrong to hold the contrary, and the Ninth Circuit was right in concluding that those state courts unreasonably applied clearly established federal law.  See

				In this case, Alvarados youth is an objective circumstance that was known to the police.

				The law in this case asks judges to apply, not arcane or complex legal directives, but ordinary common sense. Would a reasonable person in Alvarados position have felt free simply to get up and walk out of the small room in the station house at will during his 2-hour police interrogation?  I ask the reader to put himself, or herself, in Alvarados circumstances and then answer that question:  Alvarado hears from his parents that he is needed for police questioning.  His parents take him to the station.  On arrival, a police officer separates him from his parents.  His parents ask to come along, but the officer says they may not.  App. 185186.  Another officer says,  What do we have here; we are going to question a suspect. 

				The police take Alvarado to a small interrogation room, away from the stations public area.  A single officer begins to question him, making clear in the process that the police have evidence that he participated in an attempted carjacking connected with a murder.  When he says that he never saw any shooting, the officer suggests that he is lying, while adding that she is giving [him] the opportunity to tell the truth and tak[e] care of [him]self.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 102, 105.  Toward the end of the questioning, the officer gives him permission to take a bathroom or water break.  After two hours, by which time he has admitted he was involved in the attempted theft, knew about the gun, and helped to hide it, the questioning ends.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				What reasonable person in the circumstancesbrought to a police station by his parents at police request, put in a small interrogation room, questioned for a solid two hours, and confronted with claims that there is strong evidence that he participated in a serious crime, could have thought to himself, Well, anytime I want to leave I can just get up and walk out?  If the person harbored any doubts, would he still think he might be free to leave once he recalls that the police officer has just refused to let his parents remain with him during questioning?  Would he still think that he, rather than the officer, controls the situation?

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				There is only one possible answer to these questions.  A reasonable person would 
				<em>
					not 
				</em>
				have thought he was free simply to pick up and leave in the middle of the interrogation.  I believe the California courts were clearly wrong to hold the contrary, and the Ninth Circuit was right in concluding that those state courts unreasonably applied clearly established federal law.  See

But the reasonable person standard does not require a court to pretend that Alvarado was a 35-year-old with aging parents whose middle-aged children do what their parents ask only out of respect.  Nor does it say that a court should pretend that Alvarado was the statistically determined average persona working, married, 35-year-old white female with a high school degree.  See U. S.

				Rather, the precise legal definition of reasonable person may, depending on legal context, appropriately account for certain personal characteristics.  In negligence suits, for example, the question is what would a reasonable person do  under the same or similar circumstances.   In answering that question, courts enjoy latitude and may make allowance not only for external facts, but sometimes for certain characteristics of the actor himself, including physical disability, youth, or advanced age.

				The law in this case asks judges to apply, not arcane or complex legal directives, but ordinary common sense. Would a reasonable person in Alvarados position have felt free simply to get up and walk out of the small room in the station house at will during his 2-hour police interrogation?  I ask the reader to put himself, or herself, in Alvarados circumstances and then answer that question:  Alvarado hears from his parents that he is needed for police questioning.  His parents take him to the station.  On arrival, a police officer separates him from his parents.  His parents ask to come along, but the officer says they may not.  App. 185186.  Another officer says,  What do we have here; we are going to question a suspect. 

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The police take Alvarado to a small interrogation room, away from the stations public area.  A single officer begins to question him, making clear in the process that the police have evidence that he participated in an attempted carjacking connected with a murder.  When he says that he never saw any shooting, the officer suggests that he is lying, while adding that she is giving [him] the opportunity to tell the truth and tak[e] care of [him]self.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 102, 105.  Toward the end of the questioning, the officer gives him permission to take a bathroom or water break.  After two hours, by which time he has admitted he was involved in the attempted theft, knew about the gun, and helped to hide it, the questioning ends.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				What reasonable person in the circumstancesbrought to a police station by his parents at police request, put in a small interrogation room, questioned for a solid two hours, and confronted with claims that there is strong evidence that he participated in a serious crime, could have thought to himself, Well, anytime I want to leave I can just get up and walk out?  If the person harbored any doubts, would he still think he might be free to leave once he recalls that the police officer has just refused to let his parents remain with him during questioning?  Would he still think that he, rather than the officer, controls the situation?
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				There is only one possible answer to these questions.  A reasonable person would 
				<em>
					not 
				</em>
				have thought he was free simply to pick up and leave in the middle of the interrogation.  I believe the California courts were clearly wrong to hold the contrary, and the Ninth Circuit was right in concluding that those state courts unreasonably applied clearly established federal law.  See

				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1314.  I can find nothing in the law that  supports that conclusion.  Our cases do instruct lower courts to apply a reasonable person standard.  But the reasonable person standard does not require a court to pretend that Alvarado was a 35-year-old with aging parents whose middle-aged children do what their parents ask only out of respect.  Nor does it say that a court should pretend that Alvarado was the statistically determined average persona working, married, 35-year-old white female with a high school degree.  See U. S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census, Statistical Abstract of the United States: 2003 (123d ed.).

				Rather, the precise legal definition of reasonable person may, depending on legal context, appropriately account for certain personal characteristics.  In negligence suits, for example, the question is what would a reasonable person do  under the same or similar circumstances.   In answering that question, courts enjoy latitude and may make allowance not only for external facts, but sometimes for certain characteristics of the actor himself, including physical disability, youth, or advanced age.  W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, &amp; D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts §32, pp. 174179 (5th ed. 1984); see

Draft No. 1, Mar. 28, 2001) (all American jurisdictions count a persons childhood as a relevant circumstance in negligence determinations).  This allowance makes sense in light of the tort standards recognized purpose: deterrence.  Given that purpose, why pretend that a child is an adult or that a blind man can see?  See O. Holmes, The Common Law 8589 (M. Howe ed. 1963).

				In the present context, that of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s in custody inquiry, the law has introduced the concept of a reasonable person to avoid judicial inquiry into subjective states of mind, and to focus the inquiry instead upon objective circumstances that are known to both the officer and the suspect and that are likely relevant to the way a person would understand his situation.  See 
				<em>

				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 323325; 
				<em>
					Berkemer

				In this case, Alvarados youth is an objective circumstance that was known to the police.  It is not a special quality, but rather a widely shared characteristic that generates commonsense conclusions about behavior and perception.  To focus on the circumstance of age in a case like this does not complicate the in custody inquiry.  And to say that courts should
				 
				ignore widely shared, objective characteristics, like age, on the ground that only a (large) 
				<em>
					minority 
				</em>
				of the population possesses them would produce absurd results, the present instance being a case in point.  I am not surprised that the majority points to no case suggesting any such limitation.  Cf. 
				<em>

His parents take him to the station.  On arrival, a police officer separates him from his parents.  His parents ask to come along, but the officer says they may not.  App. 185186.  Another officer says,  What do we have here; we are going to question a suspect. 

				The police take Alvarado to a small interrogation room, away from the stations public area.  A single officer begins to question him, making clear in the process that the police have evidence that he participated in an attempted carjacking connected with a murder.  When he says that he never saw any shooting, the officer suggests that he is lying, while adding that she is giving [him] the opportunity to tell the truth and tak[e] care of [him]self.

				What reasonable person in the circumstancesbrought to a police station by his parents at police request, put in a small interrogation room, questioned for a solid two hours, and confronted with claims that there is strong evidence that he participated in a serious crime, could have thought to himself, Well, anytime I want to leave I can just get up and walk out?  If the person harbored any doubts, would he still think he might be free to leave once he recalls that the police officer has just refused to let his parents remain with him during questioning?  Would he still think that he, rather than the officer, controls the situation?

				There is only one possible answer to these questions.  A reasonable person would

				, at 1314.  I can find nothing in the law that  supports that conclusion.  Our cases do instruct lower courts to apply a reasonable person standard.  But the reasonable person standard does not require a court to pretend that Alvarado was a 35-year-old with aging parents whose middle-aged children do what their parents ask only out of respect.  Nor does it say that a court should pretend that Alvarado was the statistically determined average persona working, married, 35-year-old white female with a high school degree.  See U. S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census, Statistical Abstract of the United States: 2003 (123d ed.).

				Rather, the precise legal definition of reasonable person may, depending on legal context, appropriately account for certain personal characteristics.  In negligence suits, for example, the question is what would a reasonable person do  under the same or similar circumstances.   In answering that question, courts enjoy latitude and may make allowance not only for external facts, but sometimes for certain characteristics of the actor himself, including physical disability, youth, or advanced age.

Draft No. 1, Mar. 28, 2001) (all American jurisdictions count a persons childhood as a relevant circumstance in negligence determinations).  This allowance makes sense in light of the tort standards recognized purpose: deterrence.  Given that purpose, why pretend that a child is an adult or that a blind man can see?  See O. Holmes, The Common Law 8589 (M. Howe ed. 1963).

				In the present context, that of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s in custody inquiry, the law has introduced the concept of a reasonable person to avoid judicial inquiry into subjective states of mind, and to focus the inquiry instead upon objective circumstances that are known to both the officer and the suspect and that are likely relevant to the way a person would understand his situation.  See

				In this case, Alvarados youth is an objective circumstance that was known to the police.  It is not a special quality, but rather a widely shared characteristic that generates commonsense conclusions about behavior and perception.  To focus on the circumstance of age in a case like this does not complicate the in custody inquiry.  And to say that courts should
				 
				ignore widely shared, objective characteristics, like age, on the ground that only a (large) 
				<em>
					minority

				, at 1314.  I can find nothing in the law that  supports that conclusion.  Our cases do instruct lower courts to apply a reasonable person standard.  But the reasonable person standard does not require a court to pretend that Alvarado was a 35-year-old with aging parents whose middle-aged children do what their parents ask only out of respect.  Nor does it say that a court should pretend that Alvarado was the statistically determined average persona working, married, 35-year-old white female with a high school degree.  See U. S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census, Statistical Abstract of the United States: 2003 (123d ed.).

				Rather, the precise legal definition of reasonable person may, depending on legal context, appropriately account for certain personal characteristics.  In negligence suits, for example, the question is what would a reasonable person do  under the same or similar circumstances.   In answering that question, courts enjoy latitude and may make allowance not only for external facts, but sometimes for certain characteristics of the actor himself, including physical disability, youth, or advanced age.

Draft No. 1, Mar. 28, 2001) (all American jurisdictions count a persons childhood as a relevant circumstance in negligence determinations).  This allowance makes sense in light of the tort standards recognized purpose: deterrence.  Given that purpose, why pretend that a child is an adult or that a blind man can see?  See O. Holmes, The Common Law 8589 (M. Howe ed. 1963).

				In the present context, that of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s in custody inquiry, the law has introduced the concept of a reasonable person to avoid judicial inquiry into subjective states of mind, and to focus the inquiry instead upon objective circumstances that are known to both the officer and the suspect and that are likely relevant to the way a person would understand his situation.  See

				In this case, Alvarados youth is an objective circumstance that was known to the police.  It is not a special quality, but rather a widely shared characteristic that generates commonsense conclusions about behavior and perception.  To focus on the circumstance of age in a case like this does not complicate the in custody inquiry.  And to say that courts should
				 
				ignore widely shared, objective characteristics, like age, on the ground that only a (large) 
				<em>
					minority

				The law in this case asks judges to apply, not arcane or complex legal directives, but ordinary common sense. Would a reasonable person in Alvarados position have felt free simply to get up and walk out of the small room in the station house at will during his 2-hour police interrogation?  I ask the reader to put himself, or herself, in Alvarados circumstances and then answer that question:  Alvarado hears from his parents that he is needed for police questioning.  His parents take him to the station.  On arrival, a police officer separates him from his parents.  His parents ask to come along, but the officer says they may not.  App. 185186.  Another officer says,  What do we have here; we are going to question a suspect. 

				The police take Alvarado to a small interrogation room, away from the stations public area.  A single officer begins to question him, making clear in the process that the police have evidence that he participated in an attempted carjacking connected with a murder.  When he says that he never saw any shooting, the officer suggests that he is lying, while adding that she is giving [him] the opportunity to tell the truth and tak[e] care of [him]self.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 102, 105.  Toward the end of the questioning, the officer gives him permission to take a bathroom or water break.  After two hours, by which time he has admitted he was involved in the attempted theft, knew about the gun, and helped to hide it, the questioning ends.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				What reasonable person in the circumstancesbrought to a police station by his parents at police request, put in a small interrogation room, questioned for a solid two hours, and confronted with claims that there is strong evidence that he participated in a serious crime, could have thought to himself, Well, anytime I want to leave I can just get up and walk out?  If the person harbored any doubts, would he still think he might be free to leave once he recalls that the police officer has just refused to let his parents remain with him during questioning?  Would he still think that he, rather than the officer, controls the situation?

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				There is only one possible answer to these questions.  A reasonable person would

				have thought he was free simply to pick up and leave in the middle of the interrogation.  I believe the California courts were clearly wrong to hold the contrary, and the Ninth Circuit was right in concluding that those state courts unreasonably applied clearly established federal law.  See

But the reasonable person standard does not require a court to pretend that Alvarado was a 35-year-old with aging parents whose middle-aged children do what their parents ask only out of respect.  Nor does it say that a court should pretend that Alvarado was the statistically determined average persona working, married, 35-year-old white female with a high school degree.  See U. S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census, Statistical Abstract of the United States: 2003 (123d ed.).

				Rather, the precise legal definition of reasonable person may, depending on legal context, appropriately account for certain personal characteristics.  In negligence suits, for example, the question is what would a reasonable person do  under the same or similar circumstances.   In answering that question, courts enjoy latitude and may make allowance not only for external facts, but sometimes for certain characteristics of the actor himself, including physical disability, youth, or advanced age.

This allowance makes sense in light of the tort standards recognized purpose: deterrence.  Given that purpose, why pretend that a child is an adult or that a blind man can see?  See O.

				In this case, Alvarados youth is an objective circumstance that was known to the police.

				The law in this case asks judges to apply, not arcane or complex legal directives, but ordinary common sense. Would a reasonable person in Alvarados position have felt free simply to get up and walk out of the small room in the station house at will during his 2-hour police interrogation?  I ask the reader to put himself, or herself, in Alvarados circumstances and then answer that question:  Alvarado hears from his parents that he is needed for police questioning.  His parents take him to the station.  On arrival, a police officer separates him from his parents.  His parents ask to come along, but the officer says they may not.  App. 185186.  Another officer says,  What do we have here; we are going to question a suspect. 

				The police take Alvarado to a small interrogation room, away from the stations public area.  A single officer begins to question him, making clear in the process that the police have evidence that he participated in an attempted carjacking connected with a murder.  When he says that he never saw any shooting, the officer suggests that he is lying, while adding that she is giving [him] the opportunity to tell the truth and tak[e] care of [him]self.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 102, 105.  Toward the end of the questioning, the officer gives him permission to take a bathroom or water break.  After two hours, by which time he has admitted he was involved in the attempted theft, knew about the gun, and helped to hide it, the questioning ends.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				What reasonable person in the circumstancesbrought to a police station by his parents at police request, put in a small interrogation room, questioned for a solid two hours, and confronted with claims that there is strong evidence that he participated in a serious crime, could have thought to himself, Well, anytime I want to leave I can just get up and walk out?  If the person harbored any doubts, would he still think he might be free to leave once he recalls that the police officer has just refused to let his parents remain with him during questioning?  Would he still think that he, rather than the officer, controls the situation?

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				There is only one possible answer to these questions.  A reasonable person would 
				<em>
					not 
				</em>
				have thought he was free simply to pick up and leave in the middle of the interrogation.  I believe the California courts were clearly wrong to hold the contrary, and the Ninth Circuit was right in concluding that those state courts unreasonably applied clearly established federal law.  See

This Courts cases establish that, even if the police do not tell a suspect he is under arrest, do not handcuff him, do not lock him in a cell, and do not threaten him, he may nonetheless reasonably believe he is not free to leave the place of questioningand thus be in custody for

				The law in this case asks judges to apply, not arcane or complex legal directives, but ordinary common sense. Would a reasonable person in Alvarados position have felt free simply to get up and walk out of the small room in the station house at will during his 2-hour police interrogation?  I ask the reader to put himself, or herself, in Alvarados circumstances and then answer that question:  Alvarado hears from his parents that he is needed for police questioning.  His parents take him to the station.  On arrival, a police officer separates him from his parents.  His parents ask to come along, but the officer says they may not.  App. 185186.  Another officer says,  What do we have here; we are going to question a suspect. 

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The police take Alvarado to a small interrogation room, away from the stations public area.  A single officer begins to question him, making clear in the process that the police have evidence that he participated in an attempted carjacking connected with a murder.  When he says that he never saw any shooting, the officer suggests that he is lying, while adding that she is giving [him] the opportunity to tell the truth and tak[e] care of [him]self.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 102, 105.  Toward the end of the questioning, the officer gives him permission to take a bathroom or water break.  After two hours, by which time he has admitted he was involved in the attempted theft, knew about the gun, and helped to hide it, the questioning ends.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				What reasonable person in the circumstancesbrought to a police station by his parents at police request, put in a small interrogation room, questioned for a solid two hours, and confronted with claims that there is strong evidence that he participated in a serious crime, could have thought to himself, Well, anytime I want to leave I can just get up and walk out?  If the person harbored any doubts, would he still think he might be free to leave once he recalls that the police officer has just refused to let his parents remain with him during questioning?  Would he still think that he, rather than the officer, controls the situation?
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				There is only one possible answer to these questions.  A reasonable person would 
				<em>
					not 
				</em>
				have thought he was free simply to pick up and leave in the middle of the interrogation.  I believe the California courts were clearly wrong to hold the contrary, and the Ninth Circuit was right in concluding that those state courts unreasonably applied clearly established federal law.  See

 (juveniles assumed to be subject to the control of their parents).  And a 17-year-old is more likely than, say, a 35-year-old, to take a police officers assertion of authority to keep parents outside the room as an assertion of authority to keep their child inside as well.

				The majority suggests that the law might

				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1314.  I can find nothing in the law that  supports that conclusion.  Our cases do instruct lower courts to apply a reasonable person standard.  But the reasonable person standard does not require a court to pretend that Alvarado was a 35-year-old with aging parents whose middle-aged children do what their parents ask only out of respect.  Nor does it say that a court should pretend that Alvarado was the statistically determined average persona working, married, 35-year-old white female with a high school degree.  See U. S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census, Statistical Abstract of the United States: 2003 (123d ed.).

				Rather, the precise legal definition of reasonable person may, depending on legal context, appropriately account for certain personal characteristics.  In negligence suits, for example, the question is what would a reasonable person do  under the same or similar circumstances.   In answering that question, courts enjoy latitude and may make allowance not only for external facts, but sometimes for certain characteristics of the actor himself, including physical disability, youth, or advanced age.

Draft No. 1, Mar. 28, 2001) (all American jurisdictions count a persons childhood as a relevant circumstance in negligence determinations).  This allowance makes sense in light of the tort standards recognized purpose: deterrence.  Given that purpose, why pretend that a child is an adult or that a blind man can see?  See O. Holmes, The Common Law 8589 (M. Howe ed. 1963).

				In the present context, that of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s in custody inquiry, the law has introduced the concept of a reasonable person to avoid judicial inquiry into subjective states of mind, and to focus the inquiry instead upon objective circumstances that are known to both the officer and the suspect and that are likely relevant to the way a person would understand his situation.  See 
				<em>

				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 323325; 
				<em>
					Berkemer

				In this case, Alvarados youth is an objective circumstance that was known to the police.  It is not a special quality, but rather a widely shared characteristic that generates commonsense conclusions about behavior and perception.  To focus on the circumstance of age in a case like this does not complicate the in custody inquiry.  And to say that courts should
				 
				ignore widely shared, objective characteristics, like age, on the ground that only a (large) 
				<em>
					minority 
				</em>
				of the population possesses them would produce absurd results, the present instance being a case in point.  I am not surprised that the majority points to no case suggesting any such limitation.  Cf.

				The law in this case asks judges to apply, not arcane or complex legal directives, but ordinary common sense. Would a reasonable person in Alvarados position have felt free simply to get up and walk out of the small room in the station house at will during his 2-hour police interrogation?  I ask the reader to put himself, or herself, in Alvarados circumstances and then answer that question:  Alvarado hears from his parents that he is needed for police questioning.  His parents take him to the station.  On arrival, a police officer separates him from his parents.  His parents ask to come along, but the officer says they may not.  App. 185186.  Another officer says,  What do we have here; we are going to question a suspect. 

				The police take Alvarado to a small interrogation room, away from the stations public area.  A single officer begins to question him, making clear in the process that the police have evidence that he participated in an attempted carjacking connected with a murder.  When he says that he never saw any shooting, the officer suggests that he is lying, while adding that she is giving [him] the opportunity to tell the truth and tak[e] care of [him]self.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 102, 105.  Toward the end of the questioning, the officer gives him permission to take a bathroom or water break.  After two hours, by which time he has admitted he was involved in the attempted theft, knew about the gun, and helped to hide it, the questioning ends.

				What reasonable person in the circumstancesbrought to a police station by his parents at police request, put in a small interrogation room, questioned for a solid two hours, and confronted with claims that there is strong evidence that he participated in a serious crime, could have thought to himself, Well, anytime I want to leave I can just get up and walk out?  If the person harbored any doubts, would he still think he might be free to leave once he recalls that the police officer has just refused to let his parents remain with him during questioning?  Would he still think that he, rather than the officer, controls the situation?

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				There is only one possible answer to these questions.  A reasonable person would 
				<em>
					not 
				</em>
				have thought he was free simply to pick up and leave in the middle of the interrogation.  I believe the California courts were clearly wrong to hold the contrary, and the Ninth Circuit was right in concluding that those state courts unreasonably applied clearly established federal law.  See

				What about Alvarados youth?  The fact that Alvarado was 17 helps to show that he was unlikely to have felt free to ignore his parents request to come to the station.  See

 (juveniles assumed to be subject to the control of their parents).  And a 17-year-old is more likely than, say, a 35-year-old, to take a police officers assertion of authority to keep parents outside the room as an assertion of authority to keep their child inside as well.

				The majority suggests that the law might

				 a judge from taking account of the fact that Alvarado was 17.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1314.  I can find nothing in the law that  supports that conclusion.  Our cases do instruct lower courts to apply a reasonable person standard.  But the reasonable person standard does not require a court to pretend that Alvarado was a 35-year-old with aging parents whose middle-aged children do what their parents ask only out of respect.  Nor does it say that a court should pretend that Alvarado was the statistically determined average persona working, married, 35-year-old white female with a high school degree.  See U. S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census, Statistical Abstract of the United States: 2003 (123d ed.).

				Rather, the precise legal definition of reasonable person may, depending on legal context, appropriately account for certain personal characteristics.  In negligence suits, for example, the question is what would a reasonable person do  under the same or similar circumstances.   In answering that question, courts enjoy latitude and may make allowance not only for external facts, but sometimes for certain characteristics of the actor himself, including physical disability, youth, or advanced age.  W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, &amp; D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts §32, pp. 174179 (5th ed. 1984); see

Draft No. 1, Mar. 28, 2001) (all American jurisdictions count a persons childhood as a relevant circumstance in negligence determinations).  This allowance makes sense in light of the tort standards recognized purpose: deterrence.  Given that purpose, why pretend that a child is an adult or that a blind man can see?  See O. Holmes, The Common Law 8589 (M. Howe ed. 1963).

				In the present context, that of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s in custody inquiry, the law has introduced the concept of a reasonable person to avoid judicial inquiry into subjective states of mind, and to focus the inquiry instead upon objective circumstances that are known to both the officer and the suspect and that are likely relevant to the way a person would understand his situation.  See 
				<em>
					Stansbury
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 323325; 
				<em>
					Berkemer
				</em>

				<em>
					Miranda

				 a workable rule.  See

				In this case, Alvarados youth is an objective circumstance that was known to the police.  It is not a special quality, but rather a widely shared characteristic that generates commonsense conclusions about behavior and perception.  To focus on the circumstance of age in a case like this does not complicate the in custody inquiry.  And to say that courts should
				 
				ignore widely shared, objective characteristics, like age, on the ground that only a (large) 
				<em>
					minority 
				</em>
				of the population possesses them would produce absurd results, the present instance being a case in point.  I am not surprised that the majority points to no case suggesting any such limitation.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Alvarado
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Hickman
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				316 F. 3d 841, 848, 851, n. 5 (CA9 2002) (case below) (listing 12 cases from 12 different jurisdictions suggesting the contrary).

				Nor am I surprised that the majority makes no real argument at all explaining 
				<em>
					why
				</em>
				 any court would believe that the objective fact of a suspects age could 
				<em>
					never
				</em>
				 be relevant.  But see 
				<em>

				<em>
					ante

				As I have said, the law in this case is clear.  This Courts cases establish that, even if the police do not tell a suspect he is under arrest, do not handcuff him, do not lock him in a cell, and do not threaten him, he may nonetheless reasonably believe he is not free to leave the place of questioningand thus be in custody for 
				<em>
					Miranda

				purposes.  See

				Common sense, and an understanding of the laws basic purpose in this area, are enough to make clear that Alvarados agean objective, widely shared characteristic about which the police plainly knewis also relevant to the inquiry.  Cf.

				.  Unless one is prepared to pretend that Alvarado is someone he is not, a middle-aged gentleman, well-versed in police practices, it seems to me clear that the California courts made a serious mistake.  I agree with the Ninth Circuits similar conclusions.  Consequently, I dissent.

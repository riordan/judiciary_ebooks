				The meaning of a subparagraph in a section of the Truth in Lending Act (TILA or Act), 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/15/1601.html" class="subref" title="subref">15 U. S. C. §1601</a>

				, is at issue in this case.  As originally enacted in 1968, the provision in question bracketed statutory damages for violations of TILA prescriptions governing consumer loans: $100 was made the minimum recovery and $1,000, the maximum award.  In 1995, Congress added a new clause increasing recovery for TILA violations relating to closed-end loans secured by real property or a dwelling.  §1640(a)(2)(A)(iii).  In lieu of the $100/$1,000 minimum and maximum recoveries, Congress substituted $200/
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				$2,000 as the floor and ceiling.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Less-than-meticulous drafting of the 1995 amendment created an ambiguity.  A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that the 1995 amendment not only raised the statutory damages recoverable for TILA violations involving real-property-secured loans, it also removed the $1,000 cap on recoveries involving loans secured by personal property.  We reverse that determination and hold that the 1995 amendment left unaltered the $100/$1,000 limits prescribed from the start for TILA violations involving personal-property loans.  The purpose of the 1995 amendment is not in doubt: Congress meant to raise the minimum and maximum recoveries for closed-end loans secured by real property.  There is scant indication that Congress simultaneously sought to remove the $1,000 cap on loans secured by personal property.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/15/1601.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">15 U. S. C. §1601(a)</a>.  The Act requires a creditor to disclose information relating to such things as finance charges, annual percentage rates of interest, and borrowers rights, see §§16311632, 1635, 16371639, and it prescribes civil liability for any creditor who fails to do so, see §1640.  As originally enacted in 1968, the Act provided for statutory damages of twice the finance charge in connection with the transaction, except that recovery could not be less than $100 or greater than $1,000.

				In 1974, Congress amended TILAs civil-liability provision, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/15/1640.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">15 U. S. C. §1640(a)</a>, to allow for the recovery of actual damages in addition to statutory damages and to provide separate statutory damages for class actions.  Pub. L. 93495, §408(a), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">88</a>Stat.
1518.  Congress reworded the original statutory damages provision to limit it to individual actions, moved the provision from §1640(a)(1) to §1640(a)(2)(A), and retained the $100/$1,000 brackets on recovery.  In order to account for the restructuring of the statute, Congress changed the phrase under this paragraph to under this subparagraph.  The amended statute provided for damages in individual actions as follows: 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				(a) [A]ny creditor who fails to comply with any requirement imposed under this chapter … is liable to such person in an amount equal to the sum of

257.  Congress inserted a clause into §1640(a)(2)(A) setting statutory damages for individual actions relating to consumer leases at 25% of the total amount of monthly payments under the lease.

				In 1995, Congress amended TILAs statutory damages provision once more.  The 1995 amendment, which gave rise to the dispute in this case, added a new clause (iii) at the end of §1640(a)(2)(A), setting a $200 floor and $2,000 ceiling for statutory damages in an individual action relating to a closed-end credit transaction secured by real property or a dwelling.  Truth in Lending Act Amendments of 1995, Pub. L. 10429, §6,

				Shortly after the passage of the 1995 TILA amendments, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued an official policy announcement describing the changes.  With respect to changes in TILAs civil-liability provisions, the announcement stated only that [p]unitive damages have been increased for transactions secured by real property or a dwelling from a maximum of $1,000 to a maximum of $2,000 (

				In 1997, the Seventh Circuit, in 
				<em>
					Strange
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Monogram Credit Card Bank of Ga.
				</em>
				, 129 F. 3d 943, held that the meaning of clauses (i) and (ii) remained untouched by the addition of clause (iii).  The Seventh Circuit observed that prior to the addition of clause (iii) in 1995, [c]ourts uniformly interpreted the final clause, which established the $100 minimum and the $1,000 maximum, as applying to both (A)(i) and (A)(ii).  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 947.  The 1995 amendment, the Seventh Circuit reasoned, was designed simply to establish a more generous minimum and maximum for certain secured transactions, without changing the general rule on minimum and maximum damage awards for the other two parts of §1640(a)(2)(A).  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  As 
				<em>
					Strange
				</em>
				 illustrates, TILA violations may involve finance charges that, when doubled, are less than $100.  There, double-the-finance-charge liability was $54.27, entitling the plaintiff to the $100 minimum.

				On February 4, 2000, respondent Bradley Nigh attempted to purchase a used 1997 Chevrolet Blazer truck from petitioner Koons Buick Pontiac GMC.  Nigh traded in his old vehicle and signed a buyers order and a retail installment sales contract reflecting financing to be provided by Koons Buick.  319 F. 3d 119, 121122 (CA4 2003).  Koons Buick could not find a lender to purchase an assignment of the payments owed under the sales contract and consequently restructured the deal to require a larger downpayment.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 122.  On February 25, after Koons Buick falsely told Nigh that his trade-in vehicle had been sold, Nigh signed a new retail installment sales contract.

				  Once again, however, Koons Buick was unable to find a willing lender.

				  Nigh ultimately signed, under protest, a third retail installment sales contract.  Ibid.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Nigh later discovered one reason why Koons Buick had been unable to find an assignee for the installment payments due under the second contract: That contract contained an improperly documented charge of $965 for a Silencer car alarm Nigh never requested, agreed to accept, or received.

				On October 3, 2000, Nigh filed suit against Koons Buick alleging, among other things, a violation of TILA.  Nigh sought uncapped recovery of twice the finance charge, an amount equal to $24,192.80.  Koons Buick urged a $1,000 limitation on statutory damages under §1640(a)(2)(A)(i).  The District Court held that damages were not capped at $1,000, and the jury awarded Nigh $24,192.80 (twice the amount of the finance charge).

				A divided panel of the Fourth Circuit affirmed.  319 F. 3d, at 126129.  The Court of Appeals acknowledged that it had previously interpreted the $1,000 cap to apply to clauses (i) and (ii).

				 at 126; see 
				<em>
					Mars
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>

				, 713 F. 2d, at 67.  But the majority held that by striking the or preceding (ii), and inserting (iii) after the under this subparagraph phrase, Congress had rendered 
				<em>
					Mars
				</em>
				 interpretation defunct.  319 F. 3d, at 126.  According to the majority: The inclusion of the new maximum and minimum in (iii) shows that the clause previously interpreted to apply to all of (A), can no longer apply to (A), but must now apply solely to (ii), so as not to render meaningless the maximum and minimum articulated in (iii).

				  The Court of Appeals therefore allowed Nigh to recover the full uncapped amount of $24,192.80 under clause (i).

				Judge Gregory dissented.  The new clause (iii), he stated, operates as a specific carve-out for real estate transactions from the general rule establishing the $100/$1,000 liability limitation.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 130, 132.  Both parties acknowledged, and it was Fourth Circuit law under 
				<em>
					Mars
				</em>
				, 713 F. 2d 65, that, before 1995, the $100/$1,000 brackets applied to the entire subparagraph.  319 F. 3d, at 130
				<em>
					.
				</em>
				  Judge Gregory found no evidence that Congress intended to override the Fourth Circuits longstanding application of the $1,000 cap to both (2)(A)(i) and (2)(A)(ii).  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 131.  If the $1,000 cap applied only to clause (ii), the dissent reasoned, the phrase under this subparagraph in clause (ii) would be superfluous, because the meaning of (ii) would be unchanged by its deletion.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 132.  Moreover, Judge Gregory added, limiting the $1,000 cap to recoveries for consumer leases under clause (ii) would create an inconsistency within the statute: The damage cap in clause (ii) would include the under this subparagraph modifier, but the cap in clause (iii) would not.

				  Congress applied this hierarchy in §1640(a)(2)(B), which covers statutory damages in TILA class actions and states: [T]he total recovery 
				<em>
					under this subparagraph
				</em>
				 … shall not be more than the lesser of $500,000 or 1 per centum of the net worth of the creditor … .  (Emphasis added.)  In 1995, Congress plainly meant to establish a more generous minimum and maximum for closed-end mortgages.

				, 129 F. 3d, at 947.  On that point, there is no disagreement.  Had Congress simultaneously meant to repeal the longstanding $100/$1,000 limitation on §1640(a)(2)(A)(i), thereby confining the $100/$1,000 limitation solely to clause (ii), Congress likely would have flagged that substantial change.  At the very least, a Congress so minded might have stated in clause (ii): liability under this clause.

						 The dissents reading, we note, hinges on an assumed alteration in Congress design, assertedly effected by the bare addition of (iii) and the transposition of or.  See post, at 23, 4, n. 1.  If Congress had not added (iii) when it raised the cap on recovery for closed-end mortgages, the meaning of the amended text would be beyond debate.  The limitations provision would read: except that the liability under this subparagraph shall not be less than $100 nor greater than $1,000, or in the case of an individual action relating to a credit transaction not under an open end credit plan that is secured by real property or a dwelling, not less than $200 or greater than $2,000.

						 This reading would lead to the anomalous result of double-the-finance-charge liability, uncapped by the fixed dollar limit, under clause (i) for an open-end loan secured by real property, while liability would be capped by clause (iii) at $2,000 for a closed-end loan secured by the same real property.  TILA does not in general apply to credit transactions in which the total amount financed exceeds $25,000, but this limit does not apply to loans secured by real property or a dwelling.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/15/1603.html" class="subref" title="subref">15 U. S. C. §1603</a>.  Double-the-finance-charge liability under clause (i) for a TILA violation in connection with an open-end, real-property-secured loan (e.g., a home equity line of credit), could far exceed the $2,000 liability cap under clause (iii) for a TILA violation in connection with a standard closed-end home mortgage.


The dissent states that fixed mortgages are more prevalent than home equity lines of credit and that the mean home equity line of credit balance is considerably smaller than the mean first mortgage balance.  Post, at 67.   But even under the dissents reading, a borrower stands to collect greater statutory damages if a TILA violation occurs in connection with a home equity line of credit than if it occurs in connection with a home mortgage acquisition loan.  According to figures compiled by the Consumer Bankers Association and the Federal Reserve Board, in 2004 the average new home equity line of credit was $77,526, see Consumer Bankers Assn., Home Equity Lines Adjust on Prime Rate Change, PR Newswire, Nov. 10, 2004, available at http://www.cbanet.org/news/press releases/home_equity/prime_rate_adjust.htm (as visited Nov. 15, 2004, and available in the Clerk of the Courts case file), and about a third of extended credit lines are mostly or fully in use, see G. Canner, T. Durkin, &amp; C. Luckett, Recent Developments in Home Equity Lending, 84 Fed. Res. Bull. 241, 247 (Apr. 1998) (30% of home equity lines of credit 75100% in use in 1997).  Assuming, as the dissent does, a 10% annual interest rate, the annual finance charge could easily surpass $7,000, and double-the-finance-charge liability would substantially exceed the $2,000 cap prescribed for home mortgage loans.  Additionally, the dissents observation does not address the anomaly, illustrated by the facts of this case, of providing full double-the-finance charge liability for recoveries under clause (i), while capping recoveries under clause (iii).  Nigh was awarded over $24,000 in damages for a violation involving a car loan.   Had similar misconduct occurred in connection with a home mortgage, he would have received no more than $2,000 in statutory damages.

				, is at issue in this case.  As originally enacted in 1968, the provision in question bracketed statutory damages for violations of TILA prescriptions governing consumer loans: $100 was made the minimum recovery and $1,000, the maximum award.  In 1995, Congress added a new clause increasing recovery for TILA violations relating to closed-end loans secured by real property or a dwelling.  §1640(a)(2)(A)(iii).  In lieu of the $100/$1,000 minimum and maximum recoveries, Congress substituted $200/

				$2,000 as the floor and ceiling.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Less-than-meticulous drafting of the 1995 amendment created an ambiguity.  A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that the 1995 amendment not only raised the statutory damages recoverable for TILA violations involving real-property-secured loans, it also removed the $1,000 cap on recoveries involving loans secured by personal property.  We reverse that determination and hold that the 1995 amendment left unaltered the $100/$1,000 limits prescribed from the start for TILA violations involving personal-property loans.  The purpose of the 1995 amendment is not in doubt: Congress meant to raise the minimum and maximum recoveries for closed-end loans secured by real property.  There is scant indication that Congress simultaneously sought to remove the $1,000 cap on loans secured by personal property.

				<em>

				 v. 
				<em>

				, 129 F. 3d 943, held that the meaning of clauses (i) and (ii) remained untouched by the addition of clause (iii).  The Seventh Circuit observed that prior to the addition of clause (iii) in 1995, [c]ourts uniformly interpreted the final clause, which established the $100 minimum and the $1,000 maximum, as applying to both (A)(i) and (A)(ii).

				On February 4, 2000, respondent Bradley Nigh attempted to purchase a used 1997 Chevrolet Blazer truck from petitioner Koons Buick Pontiac GMC.  Nigh traded in his old vehicle and signed a buyers order and a retail installment sales contract reflecting financing to be provided by Koons Buick.  319 F. 3d 119, 121122 (CA4 2003).  Koons Buick could not find a lender to purchase an assignment of the payments owed under the sales contract and consequently restructured the deal to require a larger downpayment.

According to the majority: The inclusion of the new maximum and minimum in (iii) shows that the clause previously interpreted to apply to all of (A), can no longer apply to (A), but must now apply solely to (ii), so as not to render meaningless the maximum and minimum articulated in (iii).

				  Congress applied this hierarchy in §1640(a)(2)(B), which covers statutory damages in TILA class actions and states: [T]he total recovery 
				<em>
					under this subparagraph
				</em>
				 … shall not be more than the lesser of $500,000 or 1 per centum of the net worth of the creditor … .  (Emphasis added.)  In 1995, Congress plainly meant to establish a more generous minimum and maximum for closed-end mortgages.

Had Congress simultaneously meant to repeal the longstanding $100/$1,000 limitation on §1640(a)(2)(A)(i), thereby confining the $100/$1,000 limitation solely to clause (ii), Congress likely would have flagged that substantial change.  At the very least, a Congress so minded might have stated in clause (ii): liability under this clause.

				  Before 1995, clauses (i) and (ii) set statutory damages for the entire realm of TILA-regulated consumer credit transactions.  Closed-end mortgages were encompassed by clause (i).  See,

The specification of statutory damages in clause (i) of twice the finance charge continues to apply to loans secured by real property as it does to loans secured by personal property.

						 The dissents reading, we note, hinges on an assumed alteration in Congress design, assertedly effected by the bare addition of (iii) and the transposition of or.  See post, at 23, 4, n. 1.  If Congress had not added (iii) when it raised the cap on recovery for closed-end mortgages, the meaning of the amended text would be beyond debate.  The limitations provision would read: except that the liability under this subparagraph shall not be less than $100 nor greater than $1,000, or in the case of an individual action relating to a credit transaction not under an open end credit plan that is secured by real property or a dwelling, not less than $200 or greater than $2,000.

						 This reading would lead to the anomalous result of double-the-finance-charge liability, uncapped by the fixed dollar limit, under clause (i) for an open-end loan secured by real property, while liability would be capped by clause (iii) at $2,000 for a closed-end loan secured by the same real property.  TILA does not in general apply to credit transactions in which the total amount financed exceeds $25,000, but this limit does not apply to loans secured by real property or a dwelling.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/15/1603.html" class="subref" title="subref">15 U. S. C. §1603</a>.  Double-the-finance-charge liability under clause (i) for a TILA violation in connection with an open-end, real-property-secured loan (e.g., a home equity line of credit), could far exceed the $2,000 liability cap under clause (iii) for a TILA violation in connection with a standard closed-end home mortgage.


The dissent states that fixed mortgages are more prevalent than home equity lines of credit and that the mean home equity line of credit balance is considerably smaller than the mean first mortgage balance.  Post, at 67.   But even under the dissents reading, a borrower stands to collect greater statutory damages if a TILA violation occurs in connection with a home equity line of credit than if it occurs in connection with a home mortgage acquisition loan.  According to figures compiled by the Consumer Bankers Association and the Federal Reserve Board, in 2004 the average new home equity line of credit was $77,526, see Consumer Bankers Assn., Home Equity Lines Adjust on Prime Rate Change, PR Newswire, Nov. 10, 2004, available at http://www.cbanet.org/news/press releases/home_equity/prime_rate_adjust.htm (as visited Nov. 15, 2004, and available in the Clerk of the Courts case file), and about a third of extended credit lines are mostly or fully in use, see G. Canner, T. Durkin, &amp; C. Luckett, Recent Developments in Home Equity Lending, 84 Fed. Res. Bull. 241, 247 (Apr. 1998) (30% of home equity lines of credit 75100% in use in 1997).  Assuming, as the dissent does, a 10% annual interest rate, the annual finance charge could easily surpass $7,000, and double-the-finance-charge liability would substantially exceed the $2,000 cap prescribed for home mortgage loans.  Additionally, the dissents observation does not address the anomaly, illustrated by the facts of this case, of providing full double-the-finance charge liability for recoveries under clause (i), while capping recoveries under clause (iii).  Nigh was awarded over $24,000 in damages for a violation involving a car loan.   Had similar misconduct occurred in connection with a home mortgage, he would have received no more than $2,000 in statutory damages.

				The meaning of a subparagraph in a section of the Truth in Lending Act (TILA or Act),

				, is at issue in this case.  As originally enacted in 1968, the provision in question bracketed statutory damages for violations of TILA prescriptions governing consumer loans: $100 was made the minimum recovery and $1,000, the maximum award.  In 1995, Congress added a new clause increasing recovery for TILA violations relating to closed-end loans secured by real property or a dwelling.  §1640(a)(2)(A)(iii).  In lieu of the $100/$1,000 minimum and maximum recoveries, Congress substituted $200/

				$2,000 as the floor and ceiling.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Less-than-meticulous drafting of the 1995 amendment created an ambiguity.  A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that the 1995 amendment not only raised the statutory damages recoverable for TILA violations involving real-property-secured loans, it also removed the $1,000 cap on recoveries involving loans secured by personal property.  We reverse that determination and hold that the 1995 amendment left unaltered the $100/$1,000 limits prescribed from the start for TILA violations involving personal-property loans.  The purpose of the 1995 amendment is not in doubt: Congress meant to raise the minimum and maximum recoveries for closed-end loans secured by real property.  There is scant indication that Congress simultaneously sought to remove the $1,000 cap on loans secured by personal property.

Congress reworded the original statutory damages provision to limit it to individual actions, moved the provision from §1640(a)(1) to §1640(a)(2)(A), and retained the $100/$1,000 brackets on recovery.  In order to account for the restructuring of the statute, Congress changed the phrase under this paragraph to under this subparagraph.  The amended statute provided for damages in individual actions as follows:

				In 1995, Congress amended TILAs statutory damages provision once more.  The 1995 amendment, which gave rise to the dispute in this case, added a new clause (iii) at the end of §1640(a)(2)(A), setting a $200 floor and $2,000 ceiling for statutory damages in an individual action relating to a closed-end credit transaction secured by real property or a dwelling.  Truth in Lending Act Amendments of 1995, Pub. L. 10429, §6,

				<em>

				 v. 
				<em>
					Monogram Credit Card Bank of Ga.

				, 129 F. 3d 943, held that the meaning of clauses (i) and (ii) remained untouched by the addition of clause (iii).  The Seventh Circuit observed that prior to the addition of clause (iii) in 1995, [c]ourts uniformly interpreted the final clause, which established the $100 minimum and the $1,000 maximum, as applying to both (A)(i) and (A)(ii).

				On February 4, 2000, respondent Bradley Nigh attempted to purchase a used 1997 Chevrolet Blazer truck from petitioner Koons Buick Pontiac GMC.  Nigh traded in his old vehicle and signed a buyers order and a retail installment sales contract reflecting financing to be provided by Koons Buick.  319 F. 3d 119, 121122 (CA4 2003).

The District Court held that damages were not capped at $1,000, and the jury awarded Nigh $24,192.80 (twice the amount of the finance charge).

				, at 131.  If the $1,000 cap applied only to clause (ii), the dissent reasoned, the phrase under this subparagraph in clause (ii) would be superfluous, because the meaning of (ii) would be unchanged by its deletion.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 132.  Moreover, Judge Gregory added, limiting the $1,000 cap to recoveries for consumer leases under clause (ii) would create an inconsistency within the statute: The damage cap in clause (ii) would include the under this subparagraph modifier, but the cap in clause (iii) would not.

				Congress followed this hierarchical scheme in drafting TILA.  The word subparagraph is generally used to refer to a subdivision preceded by a capital letter,
				<a name="ZO-5ref" href="#ZO-5" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>

            </a>
				 and the word clause is generally used to refer to a subdivision preceded by a lower case Roman numeral.
				<a name="ZO-6ref" href="#ZO-6" class="">

                </sup>
            </a>
				  Congress applied this hierarchy in §1640(a)(2)(B), which covers statutory damages in TILA class actions and states: [T]he total recovery 
				<em>
					under this subparagraph
				</em>
				 … shall not be more than the lesser of $500,000 or 1 per centum of the net worth of the creditor … .  (Emphasis added.)  In 1995, Congress plainly meant to establish a more generous minimum and maximum for closed-end mortgages.  
				<em>
					Strange
				</em>
				, 129 F. 3d, at 947.  On that point, there is no disagreement.  Had Congress simultaneously meant to repeal the longstanding $100/$1,000 limitation on §1640(a)(2)(A)(i), thereby confining the $100/$1,000 limitation solely to clause (ii), Congress likely would have flagged that substantial change.  At the very least, a Congress so minded might have stated in clause (ii): liability under this clause.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The statutory history resolves any ambiguity whether the $100/$1,000 brackets apply to recoveries under clause (i).

				  Before 1995, clauses (i) and (ii) set statutory damages for the entire realm of TILA-regulated consumer credit transactions.  Closed-end mortgages were encompassed by clause (i).  See, 
				<em>

					Mayfield 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					Vanguard Sav. &amp; Loan Assn.
				</em>
				, 710 F. Supp., at 146.  As a result of the addition of clause (iii), closed-end mortgages are subject to a higher floor and ceiling.  But clause (iii) contains no other measure of damages.  The specification of statutory damages in clause (i) of twice the finance charge continues to apply to loans secured by real property as it does to loans secured by personal property.

						 The dissents reading, we note, hinges on an assumed alteration in Congress design, assertedly effected by the bare addition of (iii) and the transposition of or.  See post, at 23, 4, n. 1.  If Congress had not added (iii) when it raised the cap on recovery for closed-end mortgages, the meaning of the amended text would be beyond debate.  The limitations provision would read: except that the liability under this subparagraph shall not be less than $100 nor greater than $1,000, or in the case of an individual action relating to a credit transaction not under an open end credit plan that is secured by real property or a dwelling, not less than $200 or greater than $2,000.

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-10" href="#ZO-10ref">

						 This reading would lead to the anomalous result of double-the-finance-charge liability, uncapped by the fixed dollar limit, under clause (i) for an open-end loan secured by real property, while liability would be capped by clause (iii) at $2,000 for a closed-end loan secured by the same real property.  TILA does not in general apply to credit transactions in which the total amount financed exceeds $25,000, but this limit does not apply to loans secured by real property or a dwelling.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/15/1603.html" class="subref" title="subref">15 U. S. C. §1603</a>.  Double-the-finance-charge liability under clause (i) for a TILA violation in connection with an open-end, real-property-secured loan (e.g., a home equity line of credit), could far exceed the $2,000 liability cap under clause (iii) for a TILA violation in connection with a standard closed-end home mortgage.


The dissent states that fixed mortgages are more prevalent than home equity lines of credit and that the mean home equity line of credit balance is considerably smaller than the mean first mortgage balance.  Post, at 67.   But even under the dissents reading, a borrower stands to collect greater statutory damages if a TILA violation occurs in connection with a home equity line of credit than if it occurs in connection with a home mortgage acquisition loan.  According to figures compiled by the Consumer Bankers Association and the Federal Reserve Board, in 2004 the average new home equity line of credit was $77,526, see Consumer Bankers Assn., Home Equity Lines Adjust on Prime Rate Change, PR Newswire, Nov. 10, 2004, available at http://www.cbanet.org/news/press releases/home_equity/prime_rate_adjust.htm (as visited Nov. 15, 2004, and available in the Clerk of the Courts case file), and about a third of extended credit lines are mostly or fully in use, see G. Canner, T. Durkin, &amp; C. Luckett, Recent Developments in Home Equity Lending, 84 Fed. Res. Bull. 241, 247 (Apr. 1998) (30% of home equity lines of credit 75100% in use in 1997).  Assuming, as the dissent does, a 10% annual interest rate, the annual finance charge could easily surpass $7,000, and double-the-finance-charge liability would substantially exceed the $2,000 cap prescribed for home mortgage loans.  Additionally, the dissents observation does not address the anomaly, illustrated by the facts of this case, of providing full double-the-finance charge liability for recoveries under clause (i), while capping recoveries under clause (iii).  Nigh was awarded over $24,000 in damages for a violation involving a car loan.   Had similar misconduct occurred in connection with a home mortgage, he would have received no more than $2,000 in statutory damages.

				, is at issue in this case.  As originally enacted in 1968, the provision in question bracketed statutory damages for violations of TILA prescriptions governing consumer loans: $100 was made the minimum recovery and $1,000, the maximum award.  In 1995, Congress added a new clause increasing recovery for TILA violations relating to closed-end loans secured by real property or a dwelling.  §1640(a)(2)(A)(iii).  In lieu of the $100/$1,000 minimum and maximum recoveries, Congress substituted $200/

				$2,000 as the floor and ceiling.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Less-than-meticulous drafting of the 1995 amendment created an ambiguity.  A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that the 1995 amendment not only raised the statutory damages recoverable for TILA violations involving real-property-secured loans, it also removed the $1,000 cap on recoveries involving loans secured by personal property.  We reverse that determination and hold that the 1995 amendment left unaltered the $100/$1,000 limits prescribed from the start for TILA violations involving personal-property loans.  The purpose of the 1995 amendment is not in doubt: Congress meant to raise the minimum and maximum recoveries for closed-end loans secured by real property.  There is scant indication that Congress simultaneously sought to remove the $1,000 cap on loans secured by personal property.

				In 1995, Congress amended TILAs statutory damages provision once more.  The 1995 amendment, which gave rise to the dispute in this case, added a new clause (iii) at the end of §1640(a)(2)(A), setting a $200 floor and $2,000 ceiling for statutory damages in an individual action relating to a closed-end credit transaction secured by real property or a dwelling.  Truth in Lending Act Amendments of 1995, Pub.

				On February 4, 2000, respondent Bradley Nigh attempted to purchase a used 1997 Chevrolet Blazer truck from petitioner Koons Buick Pontiac GMC.  Nigh traded in his old vehicle and signed a buyers order and a retail installment sales contract reflecting financing to be provided by Koons Buick.  319 F. 3d 119, 121122 (CA4 2003).

				  Congress applied this hierarchy in §1640(a)(2)(B), which covers statutory damages in TILA class actions and states: [T]he total recovery 
				<em>
					under this subparagraph
				</em>
				 … shall not be more than the lesser of $500,000 or 1 per centum of the net worth of the creditor … .  (Emphasis added.)  In 1995, Congress plainly meant to establish a more generous minimum and maximum for closed-end mortgages.

Had Congress simultaneously meant to repeal the longstanding $100/$1,000 limitation on §1640(a)(2)(A)(i), thereby confining the $100/$1,000 limitation solely to clause (ii), Congress likely would have flagged that substantial change.  At the very least, a Congress so minded might have stated in clause (ii): liability under this clause.

						 The dissents reading, we note, hinges on an assumed alteration in Congress design, assertedly effected by the bare addition of (iii) and the transposition of or.  See post, at 23, 4, n. 1.  If Congress had not added (iii) when it raised the cap on recovery for closed-end mortgages, the meaning of the amended text would be beyond debate.  The limitations provision would read: except that the liability under this subparagraph shall not be less than $100 nor greater than $1,000, or in the case of an individual action relating to a credit transaction not under an open end credit plan that is secured by real property or a dwelling, not less than $200 or greater than $2,000.

						 This reading would lead to the anomalous result of double-the-finance-charge liability, uncapped by the fixed dollar limit, under clause (i) for an open-end loan secured by real property, while liability would be capped by clause (iii) at $2,000 for a closed-end loan secured by the same real property.  TILA does not in general apply to credit transactions in which the total amount financed exceeds $25,000, but this limit does not apply to loans secured by real property or a dwelling.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/15/1603.html" class="subref" title="subref">15 U. S. C. §1603</a>.  Double-the-finance-charge liability under clause (i) for a TILA violation in connection with an open-end, real-property-secured loan (e.g., a home equity line of credit), could far exceed the $2,000 liability cap under clause (iii) for a TILA violation in connection with a standard closed-end home mortgage.


The dissent states that fixed mortgages are more prevalent than home equity lines of credit and that the mean home equity line of credit balance is considerably smaller than the mean first mortgage balance.  Post, at 67.   But even under the dissents reading, a borrower stands to collect greater statutory damages if a TILA violation occurs in connection with a home equity line of credit than if it occurs in connection with a home mortgage acquisition loan.  According to figures compiled by the Consumer Bankers Association and the Federal Reserve Board, in 2004 the average new home equity line of credit was $77,526, see Consumer Bankers Assn., Home Equity Lines Adjust on Prime Rate Change, PR Newswire, Nov. 10, 2004, available at http://www.cbanet.org/news/press releases/home_equity/prime_rate_adjust.htm (as visited Nov. 15, 2004, and available in the Clerk of the Courts case file), and about a third of extended credit lines are mostly or fully in use, see G. Canner, T. Durkin, &amp; C. Luckett, Recent Developments in Home Equity Lending, 84 Fed. Res. Bull. 241, 247 (Apr. 1998) (30% of home equity lines of credit 75100% in use in 1997).  Assuming, as the dissent does, a 10% annual interest rate, the annual finance charge could easily surpass $7,000, and double-the-finance-charge liability would substantially exceed the $2,000 cap prescribed for home mortgage loans.  Additionally, the dissents observation does not address the anomaly, illustrated by the facts of this case, of providing full double-the-finance charge liability for recoveries under clause (i), while capping recoveries under clause (iii).  Nigh was awarded over $24,000 in damages for a violation involving a car loan.   Had similar misconduct occurred in connection with a home mortgage, he would have received no more than $2,000 in statutory damages.

				The meaning of a subparagraph in a section of the Truth in Lending Act (TILA or Act),

				, is at issue in this case.  As originally enacted in 1968, the provision in question bracketed statutory damages for violations of TILA prescriptions governing consumer loans: $100 was made the minimum recovery and $1,000, the maximum award.  In 1995, Congress added a new clause increasing recovery for TILA violations relating to closed-end loans secured by real property or a dwelling.  §1640(a)(2)(A)(iii).  In lieu of the $100/$1,000 minimum and maximum recoveries, Congress substituted $200/
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				$2,000 as the floor and ceiling.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Less-than-meticulous drafting of the 1995 amendment created an ambiguity.  A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that the 1995 amendment not only raised the statutory damages recoverable for TILA violations involving real-property-secured loans, it also removed the $1,000 cap on recoveries involving loans secured by personal property.  We reverse that determination and hold that the 1995 amendment left unaltered the $100/$1,000 limits prescribed from the start for TILA violations involving personal-property loans.  The purpose of the 1995 amendment is not in doubt: Congress meant to raise the minimum and maximum recoveries for closed-end loans secured by real property.  There is scant indication that Congress simultaneously sought to remove the $1,000 cap on loans secured by personal property.

Congress reworded the original statutory damages provision to limit it to individual actions, moved the provision from §1640(a)(1) to §1640(a)(2)(A), and retained the $100/$1,000 brackets on recovery.  In order to account for the restructuring of the statute, Congress changed the phrase under this paragraph to under this subparagraph.  The amended statute provided for damages in individual actions as follows:

				In 1995, Congress amended TILAs statutory damages provision once more.  The 1995 amendment, which gave rise to the dispute in this case, added a new clause (iii) at the end of §1640(a)(2)(A), setting a $200 floor and $2,000 ceiling for statutory damages in an individual action relating to a closed-end credit transaction secured by real property or a dwelling.  Truth in Lending Act Amendments of 1995, Pub.

				 v.

				  Congress applied this hierarchy in §1640(a)(2)(B), which covers statutory damages in TILA class actions and states: [T]he total recovery 
				<em>
					under this subparagraph
				</em>
				 … shall not be more than the lesser of $500,000 or 1 per centum of the net worth of the creditor … .  (Emphasis added.)  In 1995, Congress plainly meant to establish a more generous minimum and maximum for closed-end mortgages.

					Strange

				, 129 F. 3d, at 947.  On that point, there is no disagreement.  Had Congress simultaneously meant to repeal the longstanding $100/$1,000 limitation on §1640(a)(2)(A)(i), thereby confining the $100/$1,000 limitation solely to clause (ii), Congress likely would have flagged that substantial change.  At the very least, a Congress so minded might have stated in clause (ii): liability under this clause.

				  Before 1995, clauses (i) and (ii) set statutory damages for the entire realm of TILA-regulated consumer credit transactions.  Closed-end mortgages were encompassed by clause (i).  See,

				<em>

				, 710 F. Supp., at 146.  As a result of the addition of clause (iii), closed-end mortgages are subject to a higher floor and ceiling.  But clause (iii) contains no other measure of damages.  The specification of statutory damages in clause (i) of twice the finance charge continues to apply to loans secured by real property as it does to loans secured by personal property.

						 The dissents reading, we note, hinges on an assumed alteration in Congress design, assertedly effected by the bare addition of (iii) and the transposition of or.  See post, at 23, 4, n. 1.  If Congress had not added (iii) when it raised the cap on recovery for closed-end mortgages, the meaning of the amended text would be beyond debate.  The limitations provision would read: except that the liability under this subparagraph shall not be less than $100 nor greater than $1,000, or in the case of an individual action relating to a credit transaction not under an open end credit plan that is secured by real property or a dwelling, not less than $200 or greater than $2,000.

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-10" href="#ZO-10ref">

						 This reading would lead to the anomalous result of double-the-finance-charge liability, uncapped by the fixed dollar limit, under clause (i) for an open-end loan secured by real property, while liability would be capped by clause (iii) at $2,000 for a closed-end loan secured by the same real property.  TILA does not in general apply to credit transactions in which the total amount financed exceeds $25,000, but this limit does not apply to loans secured by real property or a dwelling.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/15/1603.html" class="subref" title="subref">15 U. S. C. §1603</a>.  Double-the-finance-charge liability under clause (i) for a TILA violation in connection with an open-end, real-property-secured loan (e.g., a home equity line of credit), could far exceed the $2,000 liability cap under clause (iii) for a TILA violation in connection with a standard closed-end home mortgage.


The dissent states that fixed mortgages are more prevalent than home equity lines of credit and that the mean home equity line of credit balance is considerably smaller than the mean first mortgage balance.  Post, at 67.   But even under the dissents reading, a borrower stands to collect greater statutory damages if a TILA violation occurs in connection with a home equity line of credit than if it occurs in connection with a home mortgage acquisition loan.  According to figures compiled by the Consumer Bankers Association and the Federal Reserve Board, in 2004 the average new home equity line of credit was $77,526, see Consumer Bankers Assn., Home Equity Lines Adjust on Prime Rate Change, PR Newswire, Nov. 10, 2004, available at http://www.cbanet.org/news/press releases/home_equity/prime_rate_adjust.htm (as visited Nov. 15, 2004, and available in the Clerk of the Courts case file), and about a third of extended credit lines are mostly or fully in use, see G. Canner, T. Durkin, &amp; C. Luckett, Recent Developments in Home Equity Lending, 84 Fed. Res. Bull. 241, 247 (Apr. 1998) (30% of home equity lines of credit 75100% in use in 1997).  Assuming, as the dissent does, a 10% annual interest rate, the annual finance charge could easily surpass $7,000, and double-the-finance-charge liability would substantially exceed the $2,000 cap prescribed for home mortgage loans.  Additionally, the dissents observation does not address the anomaly, illustrated by the facts of this case, of providing full double-the-finance charge liability for recoveries under clause (i), while capping recoveries under clause (iii).  Nigh was awarded over $24,000 in damages for a violation involving a car loan.   Had similar misconduct occurred in connection with a home mortgage, he would have received no more than $2,000 in statutory damages.

				If an unambiguous text describing a plausible policy decision were a sufficient basis for determining the meaning of a statute, we would have to affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.  The ordinary reader would think that §1640(a)(2)(A) is a paragraph including three subparagraphs identified as (i), (ii), and (iii).  There is nothing implausible about a scheme that uses a formula to measure the maximum recovery under (i) without designating a ceiling or floor.  Thus we cannot escape this unambiguous statutory command by proclaiming that it would produce an absurd result. 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We can, however, escape by using common sense.  The history of the provision makes it perfectly clear that Congress did not intend its 1995 amendment adding (iii) to repeal the pre-existing interpretation of (i) as being limited by the ceiling contained in (ii).  Thus, the Court unquestionably decides this case correctly.  It has demonstrated that a busy Congress is fully capable of enacting a scriveners error into law.  
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In recent years the Court has suggested that we should only look at legislative history for the purpose of resolving textual ambiguities or to avoid absurdities. It would be wiser to acknowledge that it is always appropriate to consider all available evidence of Congress true intent when interpreting its work product.

				If an unambiguous text describing a plausible policy decision were a sufficient basis for determining the meaning of a statute, we would have to affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.  The ordinary reader would think that §1640(a)(2)(A) is a paragraph including three subparagraphs identified as (i), (ii), and (iii).  There is nothing implausible about a scheme that uses a formula to measure the maximum recovery under (i) without designating a ceiling or floor.  Thus we cannot escape this unambiguous statutory command by proclaiming that it would produce an absurd result.

				We can, however, escape by using common sense.

Thus, the Court unquestionably decides this case correctly.  It has demonstrated that a busy Congress is fully capable of enacting a scriveners error into law.

				If an unambiguous text describing a plausible policy decision were a sufficient basis for determining the meaning of a statute, we would have to affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.  The ordinary reader would think that §1640(a)(2)(A) is a paragraph including three subparagraphs identified as (i), (ii), and (iii).  There is nothing implausible about a scheme that uses a formula to measure the maximum recovery under (i) without designating a ceiling or floor.  Thus we cannot escape this unambiguous statutory command by proclaiming that it would produce an absurd result.

				We can, however, escape by using common sense.  The history of the provision makes it perfectly clear that Congress did not intend its 1995 amendment adding (iii) to repeal the pre-existing interpretation of (i) as being limited by the ceiling contained in (ii).  Thus, the Court unquestionably decides this case correctly.  It has demonstrated that a busy Congress is fully capable of enacting a scriveners error into law.

				If an unambiguous text describing a plausible policy decision were a sufficient basis for determining the meaning of a statute, we would have to affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.  The ordinary reader would think that §1640(a)(2)(A) is a paragraph including three subparagraphs identified as (i), (ii), and (iii).  There is nothing implausible about a scheme that uses a formula to measure the maximum recovery under (i) without designating a ceiling or floor.

        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				The Court views this case as a dispute about the meaning of subparagraph in 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/15/1640.html#a_2_A" class="subref" title="subref">15 U. S. C. §1640(a)(2)(A)</a>.  I think it involves more than that.  For while I agree with the construction of that word adopted by the Court, see 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 810, by 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Kennedy
				</span>
				, see 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 12 (concurring opinion), and by 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Thomas
				</span>
				, see 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 12 (opinion concurring in judgment), I disagree with the conclusion that the Court believes follows.  The ultimate question here is not the meaning of subparagraph, but the scope of the exception which contains that term.  When is liability under this subparagraph limited by the $100/$1,000 brackets?  In answering that question, I would give dispositive weight to the structure of §1640(a)(2)(A), which indicates that the exception is part of clause (ii) and thus does not apply to clause (i).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				After establishing the fact that subparagraph refers to a third-level subdivision within a section, denominated by a capital letter (here subparagraph (A)), see 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 810, the Courts analysis proceeds in five steps.  First, the Court presumes that this fact determines the scope of the exception.  See 
				<em>

				In its second step, the Court notes that, before 1995, the exception was generally read as applying to both clauses (i) and (ii).  See

				 at 1011.  But the prior meaning is insufficient to reveal the meaning of the current version.  As

				The Courts third step addresses clause (iii), which is not directly implicated by the facts of this case.  The Court concludes that the underlying measure of damages in clause (i) (twice the finance charge) continues to apply to actions governed by the newly created clause (iii).

				  I have often criticized the Courts use of legislative history because it lends itself to a kind of ventriloquism.  The Congressional Record or committee reports are used to make words appear to come from Congresss mouth which were spoken or written by others (individual Members of Congress, congressional aides, or even enterprising lobbyists).  The Canon of Canine Silence that the Court invokes today introduces a reverseand at least equally dangerousphenomenon, under which courts may refuse to believe Congresss

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In its fifth and final step, the Court asserts that it would be anomalous for liability to be uncapped by the [$1,000] limit when real property secures an open-end loan but capped by the $2,000 limit when it secures a closed-end loan, and that it would be passing strange for damages to be 
				<em>
					substantially lower
				</em>
				 under clause (iii) than under clause (i).  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 12, and n. 10.  The lack of a $1,000 limit does not, of course, make liability under clause (i) limitless.  In all cases under clause (i), the damages are twice the finance charge, and the 1-year statute of limitations, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/15/1640.html#e" class="subref" title="subref">15 U. S. C. §1640(e)</a>, naturally limits the amount of damages that can be sought.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				More importantly, Congress would have expected the amounts financed (and thus the finance charges) under clause (i) to be generally much lower than those under clause (iii).  In cases (like this one) where loans are not secured by real property, the amount financed can be no greater than $25,000.  §1603(3).  Where loans are secured by real property, clause (iii) includes both first mortgages and second mortgages (or home equity loans), which are far more common and significantly larger than the open-end home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) that are still covered by clause (i).  In 1994, 64% of home-owning households had first or second mortgages, but only 7% had HELOCs with outstanding balances.  Survey Research Center, Univ. of Michigan, National Survey of Home Equity Loans 25 (Oct. 1998) (Table 1) (hereinafter National Survey).  The mean first mortgage balance was $66,884; the mean second mortgage balance was $16,199; and the mean HELOC outstanding balance was $18,459.  
				<em>
					Ibid.&lt;footcall num="3"&gt;
				</em>
				  Assuming a 10% interest rate (which would have been higher than a typical HELOC in 1994, see Canner and Luckett, Home Equity Lending: Evidence from Recent Surveys, 80 Fed. Res. Bull. 571, 582 (1994)), a year of finance charges on the mean HELOC would still have been less than $2,000which, when doubled, would still be less than two times the maximum damages under clause (iii), a disproportion no greater than what Congress has explicitly prescribed between clauses (ii) and (iii).  In addition, very large outstanding balances on HELOCs are comparatively rare.  In 2001, roughly 94% of them were less than the 
				<em>
					median
				</em>
				 outstanding mortgage principal of $69,227.  See U. S. Census Bureau, American Housing Survey for the United States: 2001, pp. 150, 152 (Oct. 2002) (Table 315) (hereinafter American Housing Survey).

            </a>
				  Approximately 2% of HELOC balances were $100,000 or more (compared with approximately 32% of mortgages).  See 
				<em>
					ibid.
				</em>
				  Because closed-end loans are many times more common, and typically much larger, than open-end ones, the finance charges would generally be much higher under clause (iii) than under clause (i), providing a reason for Congress to focus more intently on limiting damages in clause (iii).  As for the difference between clause (i) and the $1,000 cap in clause (ii): Consumer leases (principally car leases) are obviously a distinctive category and a special damages cap (which differs from clause (iii) as well as from clause (i)) no more demands an explanation than does the fact that damages for those leases are tied to monthly payments rather than to finance charges.  As 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Stevens

				 acknowledges, applying the $1,000 cap to clause (ii) but not clause (i) is a plausible policy decision.  
				<em>
					Ante,

				As the Court noted earlier this year: If Congress enacted into law something different from what it intended, then it should amend the statute to conform it to its intent.

						 In footnote 7, the Court asserts that its new reading merely requires one to pretend that Congress had not added (iii) when it raised the cap on recovery.  That is not sonot, at least, if the Court adheres to the sound drafting principles that supposedly form the basis for its opinion.  See supra, at 23.  To adhere to those and also to apply both the limitation of clause (ii) and the limitation of clause (iii) to clause (i), one must pretend that Congress not only had not added (iii) but also had eliminated (i) and (ii).  Otherwise, those limits which are recited in clause (ii) would apply only to that clause.

						 The things that were said about the 1995 amendment are characteristically unhelpful.  Rep. McCollum said: [T]he bill raises the statutory damages for individual actions from $1,000 to $2,000.  141 Cong. Rec. 26576 (1995); see also id., at 26898 (remarks of Sen. Mack) (same).  Two weeks later, he clarif[ied] his remarks by specifying that the amendments apply solely to loans secured by real estate.  Id., at 27703 (statement of Reps. McCollum and Gonzalez).  Taken literally, these floor statements could mean that the new $2,000 limit applies either to all individual actions under subparagraph (A), or to all loans secured by real estate under clauses (i) and (iii).  Neither option is consistent with the Courts conclusion that there is a $1,000 limit under clause (i).

				The Court views this case as a dispute about the meaning of subparagraph in 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/15/1640.html#a_2_A" class="subref" title="subref">15 U. S. C. §1640(a)(2)(A)</a>.  I think it involves more than that.  For while I agree with the construction of that word adopted by the Court, see

				<span class="smallcaps">

				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Thomas
				</span>
				, see 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 12 (opinion concurring in judgment), I disagree with the conclusion that the Court believes follows.  The ultimate question here is not the meaning of subparagraph, but the scope of the exception which contains that term.  When is liability under this subparagraph limited by the $100/$1,000 brackets?  In answering that question, I would give dispositive weight to the structure of §1640(a)(2)(A), which indicates that the exception is part of clause (ii) and thus does not apply to clause (i).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				After establishing the fact that subparagraph refers to a third-level subdivision within a section, denominated by a capital letter (here subparagraph (A)), see 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 810, the Courts analysis proceeds in five steps.  First, the Court presumes that this fact determines the scope of the exception.  See 
				<em>

				More importantly, Congress would have expected the amounts financed (and thus the finance charges) under clause (i) to be generally much lower than those under clause (iii).  In cases (like this one) where loans are not secured by real property, the amount financed can be no greater than $25,000.  §1603(3).  Where loans are secured by real property, clause (iii) includes both first mortgages and second mortgages (or home equity loans), which are far more common and significantly larger than the open-end home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) that are still covered by clause (i).  In 1994, 64% of home-owning households had first or second mortgages, but only 7% had HELOCs with outstanding balances.  Survey Research Center, Univ. of Michigan, National Survey of Home Equity Loans 25 (Oct. 1998) (Table 1) (hereinafter National Survey).  The mean first mortgage balance was $66,884; the mean second mortgage balance was $16,199; and the mean HELOC outstanding balance was $18,459.

Bull. 571, 582 (1994)), a year of finance charges on the mean HELOC would still have been less than $2,000which, when doubled, would still be less than two times the maximum damages under clause (iii), a disproportion no greater than what Congress has explicitly prescribed between clauses (ii) and (iii).  In addition, very large outstanding balances on HELOCs are comparatively rare.  In 2001, roughly 94% of them were less than the 
				<em>
					median
				</em>
				 outstanding mortgage principal of $69,227.  See U. S. Census Bureau, American Housing Survey for the United States: 2001, pp. 150, 152 (Oct. 2002) (Table 315) (hereinafter American Housing Survey).

				The Court views this case as a dispute about the meaning of subparagraph in 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/15/1640.html#a_2_A" class="subref" title="subref">15 U. S. C. §1640(a)(2)(A)</a>.  I think it involves more than that.  For while I agree with the construction of that word adopted by the Court, see 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 810, by 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Kennedy
				</span>
				, see 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 12 (concurring opinion), and by 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Thomas
				</span>
				, see 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 12 (opinion concurring in judgment), I disagree with the conclusion that the Court believes follows.  The ultimate question here is not the meaning of subparagraph, but the scope of the exception which contains that term.  When is liability under this subparagraph limited by the $100/$1,000 brackets?  In answering that question, I would give dispositive weight to the structure of §1640(a)(2)(A), which indicates that the exception is part of clause (ii) and thus does not apply to clause (i).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				After establishing the fact that subparagraph refers to a third-level subdivision within a section, denominated by a capital letter (here subparagraph (A)), see 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 810, the Courts analysis proceeds in five steps.  First, the Court presumes that this fact determines the scope of the exception.  See 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 10.  It does not.  In context, the reference to liability under this subparagraph is indeterminate.  Since it is not a freestanding limitation, but an exception to the liability imposed by clause (ii), it is quite possible to read it as saying that, 
				<em>
					in the consumer-lease cases covered by clause (ii)
				</em>
				, the liability under this subparagraph would be subject to the $100/$1,000 brackets.  Using subparagraph in that way would hardly be nonsensical, since the 
				<em>
					only
				</em>
				 liability under subparagraph (A) that applies to consumer-lease cases is the amount of damages specified by clause (ii).  In other words, if the exception is part of clause (ii), then liability under this subparagraph is actually synonymous with liability under this clause, cf. 
				<em>
					ibid.,
				</em>
				 in the sense that either phrase would have the same effect were it to appear in clause (ii).  As a result, the term subparagraph cannot end our inquiry.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The structure of subparagraph (A) provides the best indication of whether the exception is part of clause (ii).  In simplified form, the subparagraph reads: (i) … , (ii) … , or (iii) … .  Clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) are separated by commas, and an or appears before clause (iii).  It is reasonable to conclude that the exceptionwhich appears between (ii) and the comma that precedes or (iii)is part of clause (ii).  In fact, the Court admits in passing that the exception appears 
				<em>
					in
				</em>
				 clause (ii).  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				 (emphasis added); see also 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 1 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Stevens
				</span>
				, J., concurring) (referring to the ceiling contained 
				<em>
					in
				</em>
				 (ii) (emphasis added)).  Yet the Courts holding necessarily assumes that the exception somehow stands outside of clause (ii)someplace where its reference to subparagraph can have a different effect than clause would.  The Court effectively requires the exception to be either part of clauses (i) and (ii) simultaneously, or a part of subparagraph (A) that is not within any of the individual clauses.  The legislative drafting manuals cited by the Court, see 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 9, and n. 4, reveal how unnatural such an unanchored subdivision would be.  See L. Filson, The Legislative Drafters Desk Reference 223 (1992) (If a section or other statutory unit contains subdivisions of any kind, it should never contain subdivisions of any other kind 
				<em>
					unless they are parts of one of those subdivisions
				</em>
				 (emphasis added)); House Legislative Counsels Manual on Drafting Style, HLC No. 1041, p. 24 (1995) (If there is a subdivision of the text of a unit, there should not be a different kind of subdivision of that unit 
				<em>
					unless the latter is part of the 1st subdivision
				</em>
				 (emphasis added)); Senate Office of the Legislative Counsel, Legislative Drafting Manual 1011 (1997) (explaining how to avoid using a cut-in followed by flush language, that is, inserting a clause that is supposed to apply to (a)(1) and (a)(2) after (2) rather than between (a) and (a)(1)). 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In its second step, the Court notes that, before 1995, the exception was generally read as applying to both clauses (i) and (ii).  See 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 1011.  But the prior meaning is insufficient to reveal the meaning of the current version.  As 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Thomas
				</span>
				 points out, the placement of the exception at the end of (A) used to indicat[e] that it was meant to refer to the whole of (A).  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 3 (opinion concurring in judgment).  That inference, however, is no longer available, since Congress eliminated the or between clauses (i) and (ii) and added clause (iii).  If the or were still there, it might just be possible to conceive of clauses (i) and (ii) as a sub-list to which the exception attached as a whole.  But one simply does not find a purportedly universal exception at the end of the second item in a three-item list.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Courts third step addresses clause (iii), which is not directly implicated by the facts of this case.  The Court concludes that the underlying measure of damages in clause (i) (twice the finance charge) continues to apply to actions governed by the newly created clause (iii).  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 11.  That conclusion does not follow from merely reading the exception in clause (ii) to apply to clause (i), but it is necessary because, by reading subparagraph in the exception to have the effect of extending the exception to all of subparagraph (A), the Court has caused 
				<em>
					that
				</em>
				 exception to conflict with the higher limit in clause (iii).  To remedy this, the Court proceeds (see 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 11, n. 9) to do further violence to §1640(a)(2)(A), simply reading out its division into clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) entirely.

                </sup>
            </a>
				  It is not sound statutory construction to create a conflict by ignoring one feature of a statute and then to solve the problem by ignoring yet another.  My construction of the exception in clause (ii) avoids the conflict altogether.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In its fourth step, the Court returns to the application of the $100/$1,000 brackets to clause (i).  The Court finds scant indication that Congress meant to alter the meaning of clause (i) in 1995 and compares this to  Sir Arthur Conan Doyles dog that didnt bark.  

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">17</a>18 (1987)
).  I hardly think it scant indication of intent to alter that Congress 
				<em>
					amended the text of the statute
				</em>
				 by moving the exception from the end of the list to the middle, making it impossible, without doing violence to the text, to read the exception as applying to the entire list.  Needless to say, I also disagree with the Courts reliance on things that the sponsors and floor managers of the 1995 amendment 
				<em>
					failed
				</em>
				 to say.

				  I have often criticized the Courts use of legislative history because it lends itself to a kind of ventriloquism.  The Congressional Record or committee reports are used to make words appear to come from Congresss mouth which were spoken or written by others (individual Members of Congress, congressional aides, or even enterprising lobbyists).  The Canon of Canine Silence that the Court invokes today introduces a reverseand at least equally dangerousphenomenon, under which courts may refuse to believe Congresss 
				<em>

				In its fifth and final step, the Court asserts that it would be anomalous for liability to be uncapped by the [$1,000] limit when real property secures an open-end loan but capped by the $2,000 limit when it secures a closed-end loan, and that it would be passing strange for damages to be 

Neither option is consistent with the Courts conclusion that there is a $1,000 limit under clause (i).

				The Court views this case as a dispute about the meaning of subparagraph in 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/15/1640.html#a_2_A" class="subref" title="subref">15 U. S. C. §1640(a)(2)(A)</a>.  I think it involves more than that.  For while I agree with the construction of that word adopted by the Court, see

				<span class="smallcaps">

				, see 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 12 (opinion concurring in judgment), I disagree with the conclusion that the Court believes follows.  The ultimate question here is not the meaning of subparagraph, but the scope of the exception which contains that term.  When is liability under this subparagraph limited by the $100/$1,000 brackets?  In answering that question, I would give dispositive weight to the structure of §1640(a)(2)(A), which indicates that the exception is part of clause (ii) and thus does not apply to clause (i).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				After establishing the fact that subparagraph refers to a third-level subdivision within a section, denominated by a capital letter (here subparagraph (A)), see 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 810, the Courts analysis proceeds in five steps.  First, the Court presumes that this fact determines the scope of the exception.  See 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 10.  It does not.  In context, the reference to liability under this subparagraph is indeterminate.  Since it is not a freestanding limitation, but an exception to the liability imposed by clause (ii), it is quite possible to read it as saying that, 
				<em>
					in the consumer-lease cases covered by clause (ii)
				</em>
				, the liability under this subparagraph would be subject to the $100/$1,000 brackets.  Using subparagraph in that way would hardly be nonsensical, since the 
				<em>
					only
				</em>
				 liability under subparagraph (A) that applies to consumer-lease cases is the amount of damages specified by clause (ii).  In other words, if the exception is part of clause (ii), then liability under this subparagraph is actually synonymous with liability under this clause, cf. 
				<em>
					ibid.,
				</em>
				 in the sense that either phrase would have the same effect were it to appear in clause (ii).  As a result, the term subparagraph cannot end our inquiry.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The structure of subparagraph (A) provides the best indication of whether the exception is part of clause (ii).  In simplified form, the subparagraph reads: (i) … , (ii) … , or (iii) … .  Clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) are separated by commas, and an or appears before clause (iii).  It is reasonable to conclude that the exceptionwhich appears between (ii) and the comma that precedes or (iii)is part of clause (ii).  In fact, the Court admits in passing that the exception appears 
				<em>
					in
				</em>
				 clause (ii).  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				 (emphasis added); see also 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 1 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Stevens
				</span>
				, J., concurring) (referring to the ceiling contained 
				<em>
					in
				</em>
				 (ii) (emphasis added)).  Yet the Courts holding necessarily assumes that the exception somehow stands outside of clause (ii)someplace where its reference to subparagraph can have a different effect than clause would.  The Court effectively requires the exception to be either part of clauses (i) and (ii) simultaneously, or a part of subparagraph (A) that is not within any of the individual clauses.  The legislative drafting manuals cited by the Court, see 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 9, and n. 4, reveal how unnatural such an unanchored subdivision would be.  See L. Filson, The Legislative Drafters Desk Reference 223 (1992) (If a section or other statutory unit contains subdivisions of any kind, it should never contain subdivisions of any other kind 
				<em>
					unless they are parts of one of those subdivisions
				</em>
				 (emphasis added)); House Legislative Counsels Manual on Drafting Style, HLC No. 1041, p. 24 (1995) (If there is a subdivision of the text of a unit, there should not be a different kind of subdivision of that unit 
				<em>
					unless the latter is part of the 1st subdivision
				</em>
				 (emphasis added)); Senate Office of the Legislative Counsel, Legislative Drafting Manual 1011 (1997) (explaining how to avoid using a cut-in followed by flush language, that is, inserting a clause that is supposed to apply to (a)(1) and (a)(2) after (2) rather than between (a) and (a)(1)). 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In its second step, the Court notes that, before 1995, the exception was generally read as applying to both clauses (i) and (ii).  See 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 1011.  But the prior meaning is insufficient to reveal the meaning of the current version.  As 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Thomas
				</span>
				 points out, the placement of the exception at the end of (A) used to indicat[e] that it was meant to refer to the whole of (A).  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 3 (opinion concurring in judgment).  That inference, however, is no longer available, since Congress eliminated the or between clauses (i) and (ii) and added clause (iii).  If the or were still there, it might just be possible to conceive of clauses (i) and (ii) as a sub-list to which the exception attached as a whole.  But one simply does not find a purportedly universal exception at the end of the second item in a three-item list.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Courts third step addresses clause (iii), which is not directly implicated by the facts of this case.  The Court concludes that the underlying measure of damages in clause (i) (twice the finance charge) continues to apply to actions governed by the newly created clause (iii).  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 11.  That conclusion does not follow from merely reading the exception in clause (ii) to apply to clause (i), but it is necessary because, by reading subparagraph in the exception to have the effect of extending the exception to all of subparagraph (A), the Court has caused 
				<em>
					that
				</em>
				 exception to conflict with the higher limit in clause (iii).  To remedy this, the Court proceeds (see 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 11, n. 9) to do further violence to §1640(a)(2)(A), simply reading out its division into clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) entirely.

            </a>
				  It is not sound statutory construction to create a conflict by ignoring one feature of a statute and then to solve the problem by ignoring yet another.  My construction of the exception in clause (ii) avoids the conflict altogether.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In its fourth step, the Court returns to the application of the $100/$1,000 brackets to clause (i).  The Court finds scant indication that Congress meant to alter the meaning of clause (i) in 1995 and compares this to  Sir Arthur Conan Doyles dog that didnt bark.  

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">17</a>18 (1987)
).  I hardly think it scant indication of intent to alter that Congress 
				<em>
					amended the text of the statute
				</em>
				 by moving the exception from the end of the list to the middle, making it impossible, without doing violence to the text, to read the exception as applying to the entire list.  Needless to say, I also disagree with the Courts reliance on things that the sponsors and floor managers of the 1995 amendment 
				<em>
					failed
				</em>
				 to say.

				  I have often criticized the Courts use of legislative history because it lends itself to a kind of ventriloquism.  The Congressional Record or committee reports are used to make words appear to come from Congresss mouth which were spoken or written by others (individual Members of Congress, congressional aides, or even enterprising lobbyists).  The Canon of Canine Silence that the Court invokes today introduces a reverseand at least equally dangerousphenomenon, under which courts may refuse to believe Congresss 
				<em>
					own
				</em>
				 words unless they can see the lips of others moving in unison.  See 
				<em>

				 v.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In its fifth and final step, the Court asserts that it would be anomalous for liability to be uncapped by the [$1,000] limit when real property secures an open-end loan but capped by the $2,000 limit when it secures a closed-end loan, and that it would be passing strange for damages to be 
				<em>
					substantially lower
				</em>
				 under clause (iii) than under clause (i).  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 12, and n. 10.  The lack of a $1,000 limit does not, of course, make liability under clause (i) limitless.  In all cases under clause (i), the damages are twice the finance charge, and the 1-year statute of limitations, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/15/1640.html#e" class="subref" title="subref">15 U. S. C. §1640(e)</a>, naturally limits the amount of damages that can be sought.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				More importantly, Congress would have expected the amounts financed (and thus the finance charges) under clause (i) to be generally much lower than those under clause (iii).  In cases (like this one) where loans are not secured by real property, the amount financed can be no greater than $25,000.  §1603(3).  Where loans are secured by real property, clause (iii) includes both first mortgages and second mortgages (or home equity loans), which are far more common and significantly larger than the open-end home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) that are still covered by clause (i).  In 1994, 64% of home-owning households had first or second mortgages, but only 7% had HELOCs with outstanding balances.  Survey Research Center, Univ. of Michigan, National Survey of Home Equity Loans 25 (Oct. 1998) (Table 1) (hereinafter National Survey).  The mean first mortgage balance was $66,884; the mean second mortgage balance was $16,199; and the mean HELOC outstanding balance was $18,459.  
				<em>
					Ibid.&lt;footcall num="3"&gt;
				</em>
				  Assuming a 10% interest rate (which would have been higher than a typical HELOC in 1994, see Canner and Luckett, Home Equity Lending: Evidence from Recent Surveys, 80 Fed. Res. Bull. 571, 582 (1994)), a year of finance charges on the mean HELOC would still have been less than $2,000which, when doubled, would still be less than two times the maximum damages under clause (iii), a disproportion no greater than what Congress has explicitly prescribed between clauses (ii) and (iii).  In addition, very large outstanding balances on HELOCs are comparatively rare.  In 2001, roughly 94% of them were less than the 
				<em>
					median
				</em>
				 outstanding mortgage principal of $69,227.  See U. S. Census Bureau, American Housing Survey for the United States: 2001, pp. 150, 152 (Oct. 2002) (Table 315) (hereinafter American Housing Survey).
				<a name="ZD-4ref" href="#ZD-4" class="">

                </sup>
            </a>
				  Approximately 2% of HELOC balances were $100,000 or more (compared with approximately 32% of mortgages).  See 
				<em>
					ibid.
				</em>
				  Because closed-end loans are many times more common, and typically much larger, than open-end ones, the finance charges would generally be much higher under clause (iii) than under clause (i), providing a reason for Congress to focus more intently on limiting damages in clause (iii).  As for the difference between clause (i) and the $1,000 cap in clause (ii): Consumer leases (principally car leases) are obviously a distinctive category and a special damages cap (which differs from clause (iii) as well as from clause (i)) no more demands an explanation than does the fact that damages for those leases are tied to monthly payments rather than to finance charges.  As 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Stevens
				</span>
				 acknowledges, applying the $1,000 cap to clause (ii) but not clause (i) is a plausible policy decision.  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 1 (concurring opinion).  The Court should not fight the current structure of the statute merely to vindicate the suspicion that Congress actually madebut neglected to explain clearlya different policy decision.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				As the Court noted earlier this year: If Congress enacted into law something different from what it intended, then it should amend the statute to conform it to its intent.

						 In footnote 7, the Court asserts that its new reading merely requires one to pretend that Congress had not added (iii) when it raised the cap on recovery.  That is not sonot, at least, if the Court adheres to the sound drafting principles that supposedly form the basis for its opinion.  See supra, at 23.  To adhere to those and also to apply both the limitation of clause (ii) and the limitation of clause (iii) to clause (i), one must pretend that Congress not only had not added (iii) but also had eliminated (i) and (ii).  Otherwise, those limits which are recited in clause (ii) would apply only to that clause.

				In its fifth and final step, the Court asserts that it would be anomalous for liability to be uncapped by the [$1,000] limit when real property secures an open-end loan but capped by the $2,000 limit when it secures a closed-end loan, and that it would be passing strange for damages to be 

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				More importantly, Congress would have expected the amounts financed (and thus the finance charges) under clause (i) to be generally much lower than those under clause (iii).  In cases (like this one) where loans are not secured by real property, the amount financed can be no greater than $25,000.  §1603(3).  Where loans are secured by real property, clause (iii) includes both first mortgages and second mortgages (or home equity loans), which are far more common and significantly larger than the open-end home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) that are still covered by clause (i).  In 1994, 64% of home-owning households had first or second mortgages, but only 7% had HELOCs with outstanding balances.  Survey Research Center, Univ. of Michigan, National Survey of Home Equity Loans 25 (Oct. 1998) (Table 1) (hereinafter National Survey).  The mean first mortgage balance was $66,884; the mean second mortgage balance was $16,199; and the mean HELOC outstanding balance was $18,459.  
				<em>
					Ibid.&lt;footcall num="3"&gt;

				  Assuming a 10% interest rate (which would have been higher than a typical HELOC in 1994, see Canner and Luckett, Home Equity Lending: Evidence from Recent Surveys, 80 Fed. Res. Bull. 571, 582 (1994)), a year of finance charges on the mean HELOC would still have been less than $2,000which, when doubled, would still be less than two times the maximum damages under clause (iii), a disproportion no greater than what Congress has explicitly prescribed between clauses (ii) and (iii).  In addition, very large outstanding balances on HELOCs are comparatively rare.  In 2001, roughly 94% of them were less than the 
				<em>
					median
				</em>
				 outstanding mortgage principal of $69,227.  See U. S. Census Bureau, American Housing Survey for the United States: 2001, pp. 150, 152 (Oct. 2002) (Table 315) (hereinafter American Housing Survey).

				  Approximately 2% of HELOC balances were $100,000 or more (compared with approximately 32% of mortgages).  See 
				<em>
					ibid.
				</em>
				  Because closed-end loans are many times more common, and typically much larger, than open-end ones, the finance charges would generally be much higher under clause (iii) than under clause (i), providing a reason for Congress to focus more intently on limiting damages in clause (iii).  As for the difference between clause (i) and the $1,000 cap in clause (ii): Consumer leases (principally car leases) are obviously a distinctive category and a special damages cap (which differs from clause (iii) as well as from clause (i)) no more demands an explanation than does the fact that damages for those leases are tied to monthly payments rather than to finance charges.  As

						 In footnote 7, the Court asserts that its new reading merely requires one to pretend that Congress had not added (iii) when it raised the cap on recovery.  That is not sonot, at least, if the Court adheres to the sound drafting principles that supposedly form the basis for its opinion.  See supra, at 23.  To adhere to those and also to apply both the limitation of clause (ii) and the limitation of clause (iii) to clause (i), one must pretend that Congress not only had not added (iii) but also had eliminated (i) and (ii).  Otherwise, those limits which are recited in clause (ii) would apply only to that clause.

						 The things that were said about the 1995 amendment are characteristically unhelpful.  Rep. McCollum said: [T]he bill raises the statutory damages for individual actions from $1,000 to $2,000.  141 Cong. Rec. 26576 (1995); see also id., at 26898 (remarks of Sen. Mack) (same).  Two weeks later, he clarif[ied] his remarks by specifying that the amendments apply solely to loans secured by real estate.  Id., at 27703 (statement of Reps. McCollum and Gonzalez).  Taken literally, these floor statements could mean that the new $2,000 limit applies either to all individual actions under subparagraph (A), or to all loans secured by real estate under clauses (i) and (iii).  Neither option is consistent with the Courts conclusion that there is a $1,000 limit under clause (i).

				The Court views this case as a dispute about the meaning of subparagraph in 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/15/1640.html#a_2_A" class="subref" title="subref">15 U. S. C. §1640(a)(2)(A)</a>.  I think it involves more than that.  For while I agree with the construction of that word adopted by the Court, see 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 810, by 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Kennedy
				</span>
				, see 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 12 (concurring opinion), and by 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Thomas
				</span>
				, see 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 12 (opinion concurring in judgment), I disagree with the conclusion that the Court believes follows.  The ultimate question here is not the meaning of subparagraph, but the scope of the exception which contains that term.  When is liability under this subparagraph limited by the $100/$1,000 brackets?  In answering that question, I would give dispositive weight to the structure of §1640(a)(2)(A), which indicates that the exception is part of clause (ii) and thus does not apply to clause (i).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				After establishing the fact that subparagraph refers to a third-level subdivision within a section, denominated by a capital letter (here subparagraph (A)), see 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 810, the Courts analysis proceeds in five steps.  First, the Court presumes that this fact determines the scope of the exception.  See 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 10.  It does not.  In context, the reference to liability under this subparagraph is indeterminate.  Since it is not a freestanding limitation, but an exception to the liability imposed by clause (ii), it is quite possible to read it as saying that, 
				<em>
					in the consumer-lease cases covered by clause (ii)
				</em>
				, the liability under this subparagraph would be subject to the $100/$1,000 brackets.  Using subparagraph in that way would hardly be nonsensical, since the 
				<em>
					only
				</em>
				 liability under subparagraph (A) that applies to consumer-lease cases is the amount of damages specified by clause (ii).  In other words, if the exception is part of clause (ii), then liability under this subparagraph is actually synonymous with liability under this clause, cf. 
				<em>
					ibid.,
				</em>
				 in the sense that either phrase would have the same effect were it to appear in clause (ii).  As a result, the term subparagraph cannot end our inquiry.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The structure of subparagraph (A) provides the best indication of whether the exception is part of clause (ii).  In simplified form, the subparagraph reads: (i) … , (ii) … , or (iii) … .  Clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) are separated by commas, and an or appears before clause (iii).  It is reasonable to conclude that the exceptionwhich appears between (ii) and the comma that precedes or (iii)is part of clause (ii).  In fact, the Court admits in passing that the exception appears 
				<em>
					in
				</em>
				 clause (ii).  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				 (emphasis added); see also 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 1 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Stevens
				</span>
				, J., concurring) (referring to the ceiling contained 
				<em>
					in
				</em>
				 (ii) (emphasis added)).  Yet the Courts holding necessarily assumes that the exception somehow stands outside of clause (ii)someplace where its reference to subparagraph can have a different effect than clause would.  The Court effectively requires the exception to be either part of clauses (i) and (ii) simultaneously, or a part of subparagraph (A) that is not within any of the individual clauses.  The legislative drafting manuals cited by the Court, see 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 9, and n. 4, reveal how unnatural such an unanchored subdivision would be.  See L. Filson, The Legislative Drafters Desk Reference 223 (1992) (If a section or other statutory unit contains subdivisions of any kind, it should never contain subdivisions of any other kind 
				<em>
					unless they are parts of one of those subdivisions
				</em>
				 (emphasis added)); House Legislative Counsels Manual on Drafting Style, HLC No. 1041, p. 24 (1995) (If there is a subdivision of the text of a unit, there should not be a different kind of subdivision of that unit 
				<em>
					unless the latter is part of the 1st subdivision
				</em>
				 (emphasis added)); Senate Office of the Legislative Counsel, Legislative Drafting Manual 1011 (1997) (explaining how to avoid using a cut-in followed by flush language, that is, inserting a clause that is supposed to apply to (a)(1) and (a)(2) after (2) rather than between (a) and (a)(1)).

				The Court views this case as a dispute about the meaning of subparagraph in 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/15/1640.html#a_2_A" class="subref" title="subref">15 U. S. C. §1640(a)(2)(A)</a>.  I think it involves more than that.  For while I agree with the construction of that word adopted by the Court, see 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 810, by 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Kennedy
				</span>
				, see 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 12 (concurring opinion), and by 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Thomas
				</span>
				, see 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 12 (opinion concurring in judgment), I disagree with the conclusion that the Court believes follows.  The ultimate question here is not the meaning of subparagraph, but the scope of the exception which contains that term.  When is liability under this subparagraph limited by the $100/$1,000 brackets?  In answering that question, I would give dispositive weight to the structure of §1640(a)(2)(A), which indicates that the exception is part of clause (ii) and thus does not apply to clause (i).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				After establishing the fact that subparagraph refers to a third-level subdivision within a section, denominated by a capital letter (here subparagraph (A)), see 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 810, the Courts analysis proceeds in five steps.  First, the Court presumes that this fact determines the scope of the exception.  See 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 10.  It does not.  In context, the reference to liability under this subparagraph is indeterminate.  Since it is not a freestanding limitation, but an exception to the liability imposed by clause (ii), it is quite possible to read it as saying that, 
				<em>
					in the consumer-lease cases covered by clause (ii)
				</em>
				, the liability under this subparagraph would be subject to the $100/$1,000 brackets.  Using subparagraph in that way would hardly be nonsensical, since the 
				<em>
					only
				</em>
				 liability under subparagraph (A) that applies to consumer-lease cases is the amount of damages specified by clause (ii).  In other words, if the exception is part of clause (ii), then liability under this subparagraph is actually synonymous with liability under this clause, cf. 
				<em>
					ibid.,
				</em>
				 in the sense that either phrase would have the same effect were it to appear in clause (ii).  As a result, the term subparagraph cannot end our inquiry.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The structure of subparagraph (A) provides the best indication of whether the exception is part of clause (ii).  In simplified form, the subparagraph reads: (i) … , (ii) … , or (iii) … .  Clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) are separated by commas, and an or appears before clause (iii).  It is reasonable to conclude that the exceptionwhich appears between (ii) and the comma that precedes or (iii)is part of clause (ii).  In fact, the Court admits in passing that the exception appears 
				<em>
					in
				</em>
				 clause (ii).  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				 (emphasis added); see also 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 1 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Stevens
				</span>
				, J., concurring) (referring to the ceiling contained 
				<em>
					in
				</em>
				 (ii) (emphasis added)).  Yet the Courts holding necessarily assumes that the exception somehow stands outside of clause (ii)someplace where its reference to subparagraph can have a different effect than clause would.  The Court effectively requires the exception to be either part of clauses (i) and (ii) simultaneously, or a part of subparagraph (A) that is not within any of the individual clauses.  The legislative drafting manuals cited by the Court, see 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 9, and n. 4, reveal how unnatural such an unanchored subdivision would be.  See L. Filson, The Legislative Drafters Desk Reference 223 (1992) (If a section or other statutory unit contains subdivisions of any kind, it should never contain subdivisions of any other kind 
				<em>
					unless they are parts of one of those subdivisions
				</em>
				 (emphasis added)); House Legislative Counsels Manual on Drafting Style, HLC No. 1041, p. 24 (1995) (If there is a subdivision of the text of a unit, there should not be a different kind of subdivision of that unit 
				<em>
					unless the latter is part of the 1st subdivision
				</em>
				 (emphasis added)); Senate Office of the Legislative Counsel, Legislative Drafting Manual 1011 (1997) (explaining how to avoid using a cut-in followed by flush language, that is, inserting a clause that is supposed to apply to (a)(1) and (a)(2) after (2) rather than between (a) and (a)(1)). 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In its second step, the Court notes that, before 1995, the exception was generally read as applying to both clauses (i) and (ii).  See 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 1011.  But the prior meaning is insufficient to reveal the meaning of the current version.  As 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Thomas
				</span>
				 points out, the placement of the exception at the end of (A) used to indicat[e] that it was meant to refer to the whole of (A).  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 3 (opinion concurring in judgment).  That inference, however, is no longer available, since Congress eliminated the or between clauses (i) and (ii) and added clause (iii).  If the or were still there, it might just be possible to conceive of clauses (i) and (ii) as a sub-list to which the exception attached as a whole.  But one simply does not find a purportedly universal exception at the end of the second item in a three-item list.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Courts third step addresses clause (iii), which is not directly implicated by the facts of this case.  The Court concludes that the underlying measure of damages in clause (i) (twice the finance charge) continues to apply to actions governed by the newly created clause (iii).  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 11.  That conclusion does not follow from merely reading the exception in clause (ii) to apply to clause (i), but it is necessary because, by reading subparagraph in the exception to have the effect of extending the exception to all of subparagraph (A), the Court has caused 
				<em>
					that
				</em>
				 exception to conflict with the higher limit in clause (iii).  To remedy this, the Court proceeds (see 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 11, n. 9) to do further violence to §1640(a)(2)(A), simply reading out its division into clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) entirely.

				</b>
                </sup>
            </a>
				  It is not sound statutory construction to create a conflict by ignoring one feature of a statute and then to solve the problem by ignoring yet another.  My construction of the exception in clause (ii) avoids the conflict altogether.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In its fourth step, the Court returns to the application of the $100/$1,000 brackets to clause (i).  The Court finds scant indication that Congress meant to alter the meaning of clause (i) in 1995 and compares this to  Sir Arthur Conan Doyles dog that didnt bark.    
				<em>
					Ante,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">17</a>18 (1987)
).  I hardly think it scant indication of intent to alter that Congress 
				<em>
					amended the text of the statute
				</em>
				 by moving the exception from the end of the list to the middle, making it impossible, without doing violence to the text, to read the exception as applying to the entire list.  Needless to say, I also disagree with the Courts reliance on things that the sponsors and floor managers of the 1995 amendment 
				<em>
					failed
				</em>
				 to say.

                </sup>
            </a>
				  I have often criticized the Courts use of legislative history because it lends itself to a kind of ventriloquism.  The Congressional Record or committee reports are used to make words appear to come from Congresss mouth which were spoken or written by others (individual Members of Congress, congressional aides, or even enterprising lobbyists).  The Canon of Canine Silence that the Court invokes today introduces a reverseand at least equally dangerousphenomenon, under which courts may refuse to believe Congresss 
				<em>
					own
				</em>
				 words unless they can see the lips of others moving in unison.  See 
				<em>
					Morales
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Trans World Airlines, Inc.,

            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/504/374" class="subref" title="subref">504 U. S. 374</a>, n. 2 (1992) ([L]egislative history need not confirm the details of changes in the law effected by statutory language before we will interpret that language according to its natural meaning).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In its fifth and final step, the Court asserts that it would be anomalous for liability to be uncapped by the [$1,000] limit when real property secures an open-end loan but capped by the $2,000 limit when it secures a closed-end loan, and that it would be passing strange for damages to be 
				<em>
					substantially lower
				</em>
				 under clause (iii) than under clause (i).  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 12, and n. 10.  The lack of a $1,000 limit does not, of course, make liability under clause (i) limitless.  In all cases under clause (i), the damages are twice the finance charge, and the 1-year statute of limitations, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/15/1640.html#e" class="subref" title="subref">15 U. S. C. §1640(e)</a>, naturally limits the amount of damages that can be sought.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				More importantly, Congress would have expected the amounts financed (and thus the finance charges) under clause (i) to be generally much lower than those under clause (iii).  In cases (like this one) where loans are not secured by real property, the amount financed can be no greater than $25,000.  §1603(3).  Where loans are secured by real property, clause (iii) includes both first mortgages and second mortgages (or home equity loans), which are far more common and significantly larger than the open-end home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) that are still covered by clause (i).  In 1994, 64% of home-owning households had first or second mortgages, but only 7% had HELOCs with outstanding balances.  Survey Research Center, Univ. of Michigan, National Survey of Home Equity Loans 25 (Oct. 1998) (Table 1) (hereinafter National Survey).  The mean first mortgage balance was $66,884; the mean second mortgage balance was $16,199; and the mean HELOC outstanding balance was $18,459.  
				<em>
					Ibid.&lt;footcall num="3"&gt;
				</em>
				  Assuming a 10% interest rate (which would have been higher than a typical HELOC in 1994, see Canner and Luckett, Home Equity Lending: Evidence from Recent Surveys, 80 Fed. Res. Bull. 571, 582 (1994)), a year of finance charges on the mean HELOC would still have been less than $2,000which, when doubled, would still be less than two times the maximum damages under clause (iii), a disproportion no greater than what Congress has explicitly prescribed between clauses (ii) and (iii).

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/15/1640.html#a_2_A" class="subref" title="subref">15 U. S. C. §1640(a)(2)(A)</a>.  I think it involves more than that.  For while I agree with the construction of that word adopted by the Court, see

				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Thomas
				</span>
				, see 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 12 (opinion concurring in judgment), I disagree with the conclusion that the Court believes follows.  The ultimate question here is not the meaning of subparagraph, but the scope of the exception which contains that term.  When is liability under this subparagraph limited by the $100/$1,000 brackets?  In answering that question, I would give dispositive weight to the structure of §1640(a)(2)(A), which indicates that the exception is part of clause (ii) and thus does not apply to clause (i).

				After establishing the fact that subparagraph refers to a third-level subdivision within a section, denominated by a capital letter (here subparagraph (A)), see 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 810, the Courts analysis proceeds in five steps.  First, the Court presumes that this fact determines the scope of the exception.  See 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 10.  It does not.  In context, the reference to liability under this subparagraph is indeterminate.  Since it is not a freestanding limitation, but an exception to the liability imposed by clause (ii), it is quite possible to read it as saying that, 
				<em>
					in the consumer-lease cases covered by clause (ii)
				</em>
				, the liability under this subparagraph would be subject to the $100/$1,000 brackets.  Using subparagraph in that way would hardly be nonsensical, since the 
				<em>
					only
				</em>
				 liability under subparagraph (A) that applies to consumer-lease cases is the amount of damages specified by clause (ii).  In other words, if the exception is part of clause (ii), then liability under this subparagraph is actually synonymous with liability under this clause, cf. 
				<em>
					ibid.,
				</em>
				 in the sense that either phrase would have the same effect were it to appear in clause (ii).  As a result, the term subparagraph cannot end our inquiry.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The structure of subparagraph (A) provides the best indication of whether the exception is part of clause (ii).  In simplified form, the subparagraph reads: (i) … , (ii) … , or (iii) … .  Clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) are separated by commas, and an or appears before clause (iii).  It is reasonable to conclude that the exceptionwhich appears between (ii) and the comma that precedes or (iii)is part of clause (ii).  In fact, the Court admits in passing that the exception appears 
				<em>
					in
				</em>
				 clause (ii).  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				 (emphasis added); see also 
				<em>

				<span class="smallcaps">
					Stevens
				</span>
				, J., concurring) (referring to the ceiling contained 
				<em>
					in
				</em>
				 (ii) (emphasis added)).  Yet the Courts holding necessarily assumes that the exception somehow stands outside of clause (ii)someplace where its reference to subparagraph can have a different effect than clause would.  The Court effectively requires the exception to be either part of clauses (i) and (ii) simultaneously, or a part of subparagraph (A) that is not within any of the individual clauses.  The legislative drafting manuals cited by the Court, see 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 9, and n. 4, reveal how unnatural such an unanchored subdivision would be.  See L. Filson, The Legislative Drafters Desk Reference 223 (1992) (If a section or other statutory unit contains subdivisions of any kind, it should never contain subdivisions of any other kind 
				<em>
					unless they are parts of one of those subdivisions
				</em>
				 (emphasis added)); House Legislative Counsels Manual on Drafting Style, HLC No. 1041, p. 24 (1995) (If there is a subdivision of the text of a unit, there should not be a different kind of subdivision of that unit 
				<em>
					unless the latter is part of the 1st subdivision
				</em>
				 (emphasis added)); Senate Office of the Legislative Counsel, Legislative Drafting Manual 1011 (1997) (explaining how to avoid using a cut-in followed by flush language, that is, inserting a clause that is supposed to apply to (a)(1) and (a)(2) after (2) rather than between (a) and (a)(1)). 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In its second step, the Court notes that, before 1995, the exception was generally read as applying to both clauses (i) and (ii).  See 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 1011.  But the prior meaning is insufficient to reveal the meaning of the current version.  As 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Thomas
				</span>
				 points out, the placement of the exception at the end of (A) used to indicat[e] that it was meant to refer to the whole of (A).  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 3 (opinion concurring in judgment).  That inference, however, is no longer available, since Congress eliminated the or between clauses (i) and (ii) and added clause (iii).  If the or were still there, it might just be possible to conceive of clauses (i) and (ii) as a sub-list to which the exception attached as a whole.  But one simply does not find a purportedly universal exception at the end of the second item in a three-item list.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Courts third step addresses clause (iii), which is not directly implicated by the facts of this case.  The Court concludes that the underlying measure of damages in clause (i) (twice the finance charge) continues to apply to actions governed by the newly created clause (iii).  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 11.  That conclusion does not follow from merely reading the exception in clause (ii) to apply to clause (i), but it is necessary because, by reading subparagraph in the exception to have the effect of extending the exception to all of subparagraph (A), the Court has caused 
				<em>
					that
				</em>
				 exception to conflict with the higher limit in clause (iii).  To remedy this, the Court proceeds (see 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 11, n. 9) to do further violence to §1640(a)(2)(A), simply reading out its division into clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) entirely.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In its fourth step, the Court returns to the application of the $100/$1,000 brackets to clause (i).  The Court finds scant indication that Congress meant to alter the meaning of clause (i) in 1995 and compares this to  Sir Arthur Conan Doyles dog that didnt bark.  

).  I hardly think it scant indication of intent to alter that Congress 
				<em>
					amended the text of the statute
				</em>
				 by moving the exception from the end of the list to the middle, making it impossible, without doing violence to the text, to read the exception as applying to the entire list.  Needless to say, I also disagree with the Courts reliance on things that the sponsors and floor managers of the 1995 amendment 
				<em>
					failed
				</em>
				 to say.

				  I have often criticized the Courts use of legislative history because it lends itself to a kind of ventriloquism.  The Congressional Record or committee reports are used to make words appear to come from Congresss mouth which were spoken or written by others (individual Members of Congress, congressional aides, or even enterprising lobbyists).  The Canon of Canine Silence that the Court invokes today introduces a reverseand at least equally dangerousphenomenon, under which courts may refuse to believe Congresss 
				<em>
					own
				</em>
				 words unless they can see the lips of others moving in unison.  See 
				<em>

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In its fifth and final step, the Court asserts that it would be anomalous for liability to be uncapped by the [$1,000] limit when real property secures an open-end loan but capped by the $2,000 limit when it secures a closed-end loan, and that it would be passing strange for damages to be 
				<em>
					substantially lower
				</em>
				 under clause (iii) than under clause (i).  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 12, and n. 10.  The lack of a $1,000 limit does not, of course, make liability under clause (i) limitless.  In all cases under clause (i), the damages are twice the finance charge, and the 1-year statute of limitations, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/15/1640.html#e" class="subref" title="subref">15 U. S. C. §1640(e)</a>, naturally limits the amount of damages that can be sought.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				More importantly, Congress would have expected the amounts financed (and thus the finance charges) under clause (i) to be generally much lower than those under clause (iii).  In cases (like this one) where loans are not secured by real property, the amount financed can be no greater than $25,000.  §1603(3).  Where loans are secured by real property, clause (iii) includes both first mortgages and second mortgages (or home equity loans), which are far more common and significantly larger than the open-end home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) that are still covered by clause (i).  In 1994, 64% of home-owning households had first or second mortgages, but only 7% had HELOCs with outstanding balances.  Survey Research Center, Univ. of Michigan, National Survey of Home Equity Loans 25 (Oct. 1998) (Table 1) (hereinafter National Survey).  The mean first mortgage balance was $66,884; the mean second mortgage balance was $16,199; and the mean HELOC outstanding balance was $18,459.  
				<em>
					Ibid.&lt;footcall num="3"&gt;
				</em>
				  Assuming a 10% interest rate (which would have been higher than a typical HELOC in 1994, see Canner and Luckett, Home Equity Lending: Evidence from Recent Surveys, 80 Fed. Res. Bull. 571, 582 (1994)), a year of finance charges on the mean HELOC would still have been less than $2,000which, when doubled, would still be less than two times the maximum damages under clause (iii), a disproportion no greater than what Congress has explicitly prescribed between clauses (ii) and (iii).  In addition, very large outstanding balances on HELOCs are comparatively rare.  In 2001, roughly 94% of them were less than the 
				<em>
					median
				</em>
				 outstanding mortgage principal of $69,227.  See U. S. Census Bureau, American Housing Survey for the United States: 2001, pp. 150, 152 (Oct. 2002) (Table 315) (hereinafter American Housing Survey).
				<a name="ZD-4ref" href="#ZD-4" class="">

					4
				</b>
                </sup>
            </a>
				  Approximately 2% of HELOC balances were $100,000 or more (compared with approximately 32% of mortgages).  See 
				<em>
					ibid.
				</em>
				  Because closed-end loans are many times more common, and typically much larger, than open-end ones, the finance charges would generally be much higher under clause (iii) than under clause (i), providing a reason for Congress to focus more intently on limiting damages in clause (iii).  As for the difference between clause (i) and the $1,000 cap in clause (ii): Consumer leases (principally car leases) are obviously a distinctive category and a special damages cap (which differs from clause (iii) as well as from clause (i)) no more demands an explanation than does the fact that damages for those leases are tied to monthly payments rather than to finance charges.  As 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Stevens
				</span>
				 acknowledges, applying the $1,000 cap to clause (ii) but not clause (i) is a plausible policy decision.  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 1 (concurring opinion).  The Court should not fight the current structure of the statute merely to vindicate the suspicion that Congress actually madebut neglected to explain clearlya different policy decision.

				As the Court noted earlier this year: If Congress enacted into law something different from what it intended, then it should amend the statute to conform it to its intent.

						 In footnote 7, the Court asserts that its new reading merely requires one to pretend that Congress had not added (iii) when it raised the cap on recovery.  That is not sonot, at least, if the Court adheres to the sound drafting principles that supposedly form the basis for its opinion.  See supra, at 23.  To adhere to those and also to apply both the limitation of clause (ii) and the limitation of clause (iii) to clause (i), one must pretend that Congress not only had not added (iii) but also had eliminated (i) and (ii).  Otherwise, those limits which are recited in clause (ii) would apply only to that clause.

						 The things that were said about the 1995 amendment are characteristically unhelpful.  Rep. McCollum said: [T]he bill raises the statutory damages for individual actions from $1,000 to $2,000.  141 Cong. Rec. 26576 (1995); see also id., at 26898 (remarks of Sen. Mack) (same).  Two weeks later, he clarif[ied] his remarks by specifying that the amendments apply solely to loans secured by real estate.  Id., at 27703 (statement of Reps. McCollum and Gonzalez).  Taken literally, these floor statements could mean that the new $2,000 limit applies either to all individual actions under subparagraph (A), or to all loans secured by real estate under clauses (i) and (iii).  Neither option is consistent with the Courts conclusion that there is a $1,000 limit under clause (i).

						 The medians were, of course, lower than the means: $49,000 for first mortgages, $11,000 for second mortgages, and $15,000 for HELOCs.  National Survey 25 (Table 1).

						 The 1994 survey did not report on the range of amounts owed on HELOCs.  In 2001, however, the Census Bureaus Housing Survey began reporting detailed data about HELOCsin figures presumably comparable to the 1994 data recited above, since the median outstanding balance and median interest rate for HELOCs had not dramatically changed.  (The 2001 medians were $17,517 and 8%.  See American Housing Survey 152, 154 (Table 315).)

In cases (like this one) where loans are not secured by real property, the amount financed can be no greater than $25,000.  §1603(3).  Where loans are secured by real property, clause (iii) includes both first mortgages and second mortgages (or home equity loans), which are far more common and significantly larger than the open-end home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) that are still covered by clause (i).  In 1994, 64% of home-owning households had first or second mortgages, but only 7% had HELOCs with outstanding balances.

In addition, very large outstanding balances on HELOCs are comparatively rare.  In 2001, roughly 94% of them were less than the

						 In footnote 7, the Court asserts that its new reading merely requires one to pretend that Congress had not added (iii) when it raised the cap on recovery.  That is not sonot, at least, if the Court adheres to the sound drafting principles that supposedly form the basis for its opinion.  See supra, at 23.  To adhere to those and also to apply both the limitation of clause (ii) and the limitation of clause (iii) to clause (i), one must pretend that Congress not only had not added (iii) but also had eliminated (i) and (ii).  Otherwise, those limits which are recited in clause (ii) would apply only to that clause.

						 The things that were said about the 1995 amendment are characteristically unhelpful.  Rep. McCollum said: [T]he bill raises the statutory damages for individual actions from $1,000 to $2,000.  141 Cong. Rec. 26576 (1995); see also id., at 26898 (remarks of Sen. Mack) (same).  Two weeks later, he clarif[ied] his remarks by specifying that the amendments apply solely to loans secured by real estate.  Id., at 27703 (statement of Reps. McCollum and Gonzalez).  Taken literally, these floor statements could mean that the new $2,000 limit applies either to all individual actions under subparagraph (A), or to all loans secured by real estate under clauses (i) and (iii).  Neither option is consistent with the Courts conclusion that there is a $1,000 limit under clause (i).

				The Court views this case as a dispute about the meaning of subparagraph in 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/15/1640.html#a_2_A" class="subref" title="subref">15 U. S. C. §1640(a)(2)(A)</a>.  I think it involves more than that.  For while I agree with the construction of that word adopted by the Court, see 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 810, by 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Kennedy
				</span>
				, see 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 12 (concurring opinion), and by 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Thomas
				</span>
				, see 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 12 (opinion concurring in judgment), I disagree with the conclusion that the Court believes follows.  The ultimate question here is not the meaning of subparagraph, but the scope of the exception which contains that term.  When is liability under this subparagraph limited by the $100/$1,000 brackets?  In answering that question, I would give dispositive weight to the structure of §1640(a)(2)(A), which indicates that the exception is part of clause (ii) and thus does not apply to clause (i).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				After establishing the fact that subparagraph refers to a third-level subdivision within a section, denominated by a capital letter (here subparagraph (A)), see 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 810, the Courts analysis proceeds in five steps.  First, the Court presumes that this fact determines the scope of the exception.  See 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 10.  It does not.  In context, the reference to liability under this subparagraph is indeterminate.  Since it is not a freestanding limitation, but an exception to the liability imposed by clause (ii), it is quite possible to read it as saying that, 
				<em>
					in the consumer-lease cases covered by clause (ii)
				</em>
				, the liability under this subparagraph would be subject to the $100/$1,000 brackets.  Using subparagraph in that way would hardly be nonsensical, since the 
				<em>
					only
				</em>
				 liability under subparagraph (A) that applies to consumer-lease cases is the amount of damages specified by clause (ii).  In other words, if the exception is part of clause (ii), then liability under this subparagraph is actually synonymous with liability under this clause, cf. 
				<em>
					ibid.,
				</em>
				 in the sense that either phrase would have the same effect were it to appear in clause (ii).  As a result, the term subparagraph cannot end our inquiry.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The structure of subparagraph (A) provides the best indication of whether the exception is part of clause (ii).  In simplified form, the subparagraph reads: (i) … , (ii) … , or (iii) … .  Clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) are separated by commas, and an or appears before clause (iii).  It is reasonable to conclude that the exceptionwhich appears between (ii) and the comma that precedes or (iii)is part of clause (ii).  In fact, the Court admits in passing that the exception appears 
				<em>
					in
				</em>
				 clause (ii).  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				 (emphasis added); see also 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 1 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Stevens
				</span>
				, J., concurring) (referring to the ceiling contained 
				<em>
					in
				</em>
				 (ii) (emphasis added)).  Yet the Courts holding necessarily assumes that the exception somehow stands outside of clause (ii)someplace where its reference to subparagraph can have a different effect than clause would.  The Court effectively requires the exception to be either part of clauses (i) and (ii) simultaneously, or a part of subparagraph (A) that is not within any of the individual clauses.  The legislative drafting manuals cited by the Court, see 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 9, and n. 4, reveal how unnatural such an unanchored subdivision would be.  See L. Filson, The Legislative Drafters Desk Reference 223 (1992) (If a section or other statutory unit contains subdivisions of any kind, it should never contain subdivisions of any other kind 
				<em>
					unless they are parts of one of those subdivisions
				</em>
				 (emphasis added)); House Legislative Counsels Manual on Drafting Style, HLC No. 1041, p. 24 (1995) (If there is a subdivision of the text of a unit, there should not be a different kind of subdivision of that unit 
				<em>
					unless the latter is part of the 1st subdivision
				</em>
				 (emphasis added)); Senate Office of the Legislative Counsel, Legislative Drafting Manual 1011 (1997) (explaining how to avoid using a cut-in followed by flush language, that is, inserting a clause that is supposed to apply to (a)(1) and (a)(2) after (2) rather than between (a) and (a)(1)). 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In its second step, the Court notes that, before 1995, the exception was generally read as applying to both clauses (i) and (ii).  See 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 1011.  But the prior meaning is insufficient to reveal the meaning of the current version.  As 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Thomas
				</span>
				 points out, the placement of the exception at the end of (A) used to indicat[e] that it was meant to refer to the whole of (A).  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 3 (opinion concurring in judgment).  That inference, however, is no longer available, since Congress eliminated the or between clauses (i) and (ii) and added clause (iii).  If the or were still there, it might just be possible to conceive of clauses (i) and (ii) as a sub-list to which the exception attached as a whole.  But one simply does not find a purportedly universal exception at the end of the second item in a three-item list.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Courts third step addresses clause (iii), which is not directly implicated by the facts of this case.  The Court concludes that the underlying measure of damages in clause (i) (twice the finance charge) continues to apply to actions governed by the newly created clause (iii).  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 11.  That conclusion does not follow from merely reading the exception in clause (ii) to apply to clause (i), but it is necessary because, by reading subparagraph in the exception to have the effect of extending the exception to all of subparagraph (A), the Court has caused 
				<em>
					that
				</em>
				 exception to conflict with the higher limit in clause (iii).  To remedy this, the Court proceeds (see 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 11, n. 9) to do further violence to §1640(a)(2)(A), simply reading out its division into clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) entirely.

            </a>
				  It is not sound statutory construction to create a conflict by ignoring one feature of a statute and then to solve the problem by ignoring yet another.  My construction of the exception in clause (ii) avoids the conflict altogether.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In its fourth step, the Court returns to the application of the $100/$1,000 brackets to clause (i).  The Court finds scant indication that Congress meant to alter the meaning of clause (i) in 1995 and compares this to  Sir Arthur Conan Doyles dog that didnt bark.  

				The Court views this case as a dispute about the meaning of subparagraph in 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/15/1640.html#a_2_A" class="subref" title="subref">15 U. S. C. §1640(a)(2)(A)</a>.  I think it involves more than that.  For while I agree with the construction of that word adopted by the Court, see 
				<em>

				</em>
				 at 810, by 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Kennedy

				, see 
				<em>

				</em>
				 at 12 (concurring opinion), and by 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Thomas
				</span>
				, see 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 12 (opinion concurring in judgment), I disagree with the conclusion that the Court believes follows.  The ultimate question here is not the meaning of subparagraph, but the scope of the exception which contains that term.  When is liability under this subparagraph limited by the $100/$1,000 brackets?  In answering that question, I would give dispositive weight to the structure of §1640(a)(2)(A), which indicates that the exception is part of clause (ii) and thus does not apply to clause (i).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				After establishing the fact that subparagraph refers to a third-level subdivision within a section, denominated by a capital letter (here subparagraph (A)), see 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 810, the Courts analysis proceeds in five steps.  First, the Court presumes that this fact determines the scope of the exception.  See 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 10.  It does not.  In context, the reference to liability under this subparagraph is indeterminate.  Since it is not a freestanding limitation, but an exception to the liability imposed by clause (ii), it is quite possible to read it as saying that, 
				<em>
					in the consumer-lease cases covered by clause (ii)
				</em>
				, the liability under this subparagraph would be subject to the $100/$1,000 brackets.  Using subparagraph in that way would hardly be nonsensical, since the 
				<em>
					only
				</em>
				 liability under subparagraph (A) that applies to consumer-lease cases is the amount of damages specified by clause (ii).  In other words, if the exception is part of clause (ii), then liability under this subparagraph is actually synonymous with liability under this clause, cf. 
				<em>
					ibid.,
				</em>
				 in the sense that either phrase would have the same effect were it to appear in clause (ii).  As a result, the term subparagraph cannot end our inquiry.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The structure of subparagraph (A) provides the best indication of whether the exception is part of clause (ii).  In simplified form, the subparagraph reads: (i) … , (ii) … , or (iii) … .  Clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) are separated by commas, and an or appears before clause (iii).  It is reasonable to conclude that the exceptionwhich appears between (ii) and the comma that precedes or (iii)is part of clause (ii).  In fact, the Court admits in passing that the exception appears 
				<em>
					in
				</em>
				 clause (ii).  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				 (emphasis added); see also 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 1 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Stevens
				</span>
				, J., concurring) (referring to the ceiling contained 
				<em>
					in
				</em>
				 (ii) (emphasis added)).  Yet the Courts holding necessarily assumes that the exception somehow stands outside of clause (ii)someplace where its reference to subparagraph can have a different effect than clause would.  The Court effectively requires the exception to be either part of clauses (i) and (ii) simultaneously, or a part of subparagraph (A) that is not within any of the individual clauses.  The legislative drafting manuals cited by the Court, see 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 9, and n. 4, reveal how unnatural such an unanchored subdivision would be.  See L. Filson, The Legislative Drafters Desk Reference 223 (1992) (If a section or other statutory unit contains subdivisions of any kind, it should never contain subdivisions of any other kind 
				<em>
					unless they are parts of one of those subdivisions
				</em>
				 (emphasis added)); House Legislative Counsels Manual on Drafting Style, HLC No. 1041, p. 24 (1995) (If there is a subdivision of the text of a unit, there should not be a different kind of subdivision of that unit 
				<em>
					unless the latter is part of the 1st subdivision
				</em>
				 (emphasis added)); Senate Office of the Legislative Counsel, Legislative Drafting Manual 1011 (1997) (explaining how to avoid using a cut-in followed by flush language, that is, inserting a clause that is supposed to apply to (a)(1) and (a)(2) after (2) rather than between (a) and (a)(1)). 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In its second step, the Court notes that, before 1995, the exception was generally read as applying to both clauses (i) and (ii).  See 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 1011.  But the prior meaning is insufficient to reveal the meaning of the current version.  As 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Thomas
				</span>
				 points out, the placement of the exception at the end of (A) used to indicat[e] that it was meant to refer to the whole of (A).  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 3 (opinion concurring in judgment).  That inference, however, is no longer available, since Congress eliminated the or between clauses (i) and (ii) and added clause (iii).  If the or were still there, it might just be possible to conceive of clauses (i) and (ii) as a sub-list to which the exception attached as a whole.  But one simply does not find a purportedly universal exception at the end of the second item in a three-item list.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Courts third step addresses clause (iii), which is not directly implicated by the facts of this case.  The Court concludes that the underlying measure of damages in clause (i) (twice the finance charge) continues to apply to actions governed by the newly created clause (iii).  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 11.  That conclusion does not follow from merely reading the exception in clause (ii) to apply to clause (i), but it is necessary because, by reading subparagraph in the exception to have the effect of extending the exception to all of subparagraph (A), the Court has caused 
				<em>
					that
				</em>
				 exception to conflict with the higher limit in clause (iii).  To remedy this, the Court proceeds (see 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 11, n. 9) to do further violence to §1640(a)(2)(A), simply reading out its division into clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) entirely.

                </sup>
            </a>
				  It is not sound statutory construction to create a conflict by ignoring one feature of a statute and then to solve the problem by ignoring yet another.  My construction of the exception in clause (ii) avoids the conflict altogether.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In its fourth step, the Court returns to the application of the $100/$1,000 brackets to clause (i).  The Court finds scant indication that Congress meant to alter the meaning of clause (i) in 1995 and compares this to  Sir Arthur Conan Doyles dog that didnt bark.    
				<em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">17</a>18 (1987)
).  I hardly think it scant indication of intent to alter that Congress 
				<em>
					amended the text of the statute
				</em>
				 by moving the exception from the end of the list to the middle, making it impossible, without doing violence to the text, to read the exception as applying to the entire list.  Needless to say, I also disagree with the Courts reliance on things that the sponsors and floor managers of the 1995 amendment 
				<em>
					failed
				</em>
				 to say.

            </a>
				  I have often criticized the Courts use of legislative history because it lends itself to a kind of ventriloquism.  The Congressional Record or committee reports are used to make words appear to come from Congresss mouth which were spoken or written by others (individual Members of Congress, congressional aides, or even enterprising lobbyists).  The Canon of Canine Silence that the Court invokes today introduces a reverseand at least equally dangerousphenomenon, under which courts may refuse to believe Congresss 
				<em>
					own
				</em>
				 words unless they can see the lips of others moving in unison.  See 
				<em>
					Morales
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>

S. 374</a>, n. 2 (1992) ([L]egislative history need not confirm the details of changes in the law effected by statutory language before we will interpret that language according to its natural meaning).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In its fifth and final step, the Court asserts that it would be anomalous for liability to be uncapped by the [$1,000] limit when real property secures an open-end loan but capped by the $2,000 limit when it secures a closed-end loan, and that it would be passing strange for damages to be 
				<em>
					substantially lower
				</em>
				 under clause (iii) than under clause (i).  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 12, and n. 10.  The lack of a $1,000 limit does not, of course, make liability under clause (i) limitless.  In all cases under clause (i), the damages are twice the finance charge, and the 1-year statute of limitations, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/15/1640.html#e" class="subref" title="subref">15 U. S. C. §1640(e)</a>, naturally limits the amount of damages that can be sought.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				More importantly, Congress would have expected the amounts financed (and thus the finance charges) under clause (i) to be generally much lower than those under clause (iii).  In cases (like this one) where loans are not secured by real property, the amount financed can be no greater than $25,000.  §1603(3).  Where loans are secured by real property, clause (iii) includes both first mortgages and second mortgages (or home equity loans), which are far more common and significantly larger than the open-end home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) that are still covered by clause (i).  In 1994, 64% of home-owning households had first or second mortgages, but only 7% had HELOCs with outstanding balances.  Survey Research Center, Univ. of Michigan, National Survey of Home Equity Loans 25 (Oct. 1998) (Table 1) (hereinafter National Survey).  The mean first mortgage balance was $66,884; the mean second mortgage balance was $16,199; and the mean HELOC outstanding balance was $18,459.  
				<em>
					Ibid.&lt;footcall num="3"&gt;
				</em>
				  Assuming a 10% interest rate (which would have been higher than a typical HELOC in 1994, see Canner and Luckett, Home Equity Lending: Evidence from Recent Surveys, 80 Fed. Res. Bull. 571, 582 (1994)), a year of finance charges on the mean HELOC would still have been less than $2,000which, when doubled, would still be less than two times the maximum damages under clause (iii), a disproportion no greater than what Congress has explicitly prescribed between clauses (ii) and (iii).  In addition, very large outstanding balances on HELOCs are comparatively rare.  In 2001, roughly 94% of them were less than the 
				<em>
					median
				</em>
				 outstanding mortgage principal of $69,227.  See U. S. Census Bureau, American Housing Survey for the United States: 2001, pp. 150, 152 (Oct. 2002) (Table 315) (hereinafter American Housing Survey).
				<a name="ZD-4ref" href="#ZD-4" class="">

					4
				</b>
                </sup>
            </a>
				  Approximately 2% of HELOC balances were $100,000 or more (compared with approximately 32% of mortgages).  See 
				<em>
					ibid.
				</em>
				  Because closed-end loans are many times more common, and typically much larger, than open-end ones, the finance charges would generally be much higher under clause (iii) than under clause (i), providing a reason for Congress to focus more intently on limiting damages in clause (iii).  As for the difference between clause (i) and the $1,000 cap in clause (ii): Consumer leases (principally car leases) are obviously a distinctive category and a special damages cap (which differs from clause (iii) as well as from clause (i)) no more demands an explanation than does the fact that damages for those leases are tied to monthly payments rather than to finance charges.  As 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Stevens
				</span>
				 acknowledges, applying the $1,000 cap to clause (ii) but not clause (i) is a plausible policy decision.  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 1 (concurring opinion).  The Court should not fight the current structure of the statute merely to vindicate the suspicion that Congress actually madebut neglected to explain clearlya different policy decision.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				As the Court noted earlier this year: If Congress enacted into law something different from what it intended, then it should amend the statute to conform it to its intent.

It is reasonable to conclude that the exceptionwhich appears between (ii) and the comma that precedes or (iii)is part of clause (ii).  In fact, the Court admits in passing that the exception appears 
				<em>
					in
				</em>
				 clause (ii).  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				 (emphasis added); see also 
				<em>
					ante,

				 at 1 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Stevens
				</span>
				, J., concurring) (referring to the ceiling contained 
				<em>
					in
				</em>
				 (ii) (emphasis added)).  Yet the Courts holding necessarily assumes that the exception somehow stands outside of clause (ii)someplace where its reference to subparagraph can have a different effect than clause would.  The Court effectively requires the exception to be either part of clauses (i) and (ii) simultaneously, or a part of subparagraph (A) that is not within any of the individual clauses.  The legislative drafting manuals cited by the Court, see 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 9, and n. 4, reveal how unnatural such an unanchored subdivision would be.  See L. Filson, The Legislative Drafters Desk Reference 223 (1992) (If a section or other statutory unit contains subdivisions of any kind, it should never contain subdivisions of any other kind 
				<em>
					unless they are parts of one of those subdivisions
				</em>
				 (emphasis added)); House Legislative Counsels Manual on Drafting Style, HLC No. 1041, p. 24 (1995) (If there is a subdivision of the text of a unit, there should not be a different kind of subdivision of that unit 
				<em>
					unless the latter is part of the 1st subdivision
				</em>
				 (emphasis added)); Senate Office of the Legislative Counsel, Legislative Drafting Manual 1011 (1997) (explaining how to avoid using a cut-in followed by flush language, that is, inserting a clause that is supposed to apply to (a)(1) and (a)(2) after (2) rather than between (a) and (a)(1)).

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In its second step, the Court notes that, before 1995, the exception was generally read as applying to both clauses (i) and (ii).  See 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 1011.  But the prior meaning is insufficient to reveal the meaning of the current version.  As 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Thomas
				</span>
				 points out, the placement of the exception at the end of (A) used to indicat[e] that it was meant to refer to the whole of (A).  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 3 (opinion concurring in judgment).  That inference, however, is no longer available, since Congress eliminated the or between clauses (i) and (ii) and added clause (iii).  If the or were still there, it might just be possible to conceive of clauses (i) and (ii) as a sub-list to which the exception attached as a whole.  But one simply does not find a purportedly universal exception at the end of the second item in a three-item list.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Courts third step addresses clause (iii), which is not directly implicated by the facts of this case.  The Court concludes that the underlying measure of damages in clause (i) (twice the finance charge) continues to apply to actions governed by the newly created clause (iii).  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 11.  That conclusion does not follow from merely reading the exception in clause (ii) to apply to clause (i), but it is necessary because, by reading subparagraph in the exception to have the effect of extending the exception to all of subparagraph (A), the Court has caused 
				<em>
					that
				</em>
				 exception to conflict with the higher limit in clause (iii).  To remedy this, the Court proceeds (see 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 11, n. 9) to do further violence to §1640(a)(2)(A), simply reading out its division into clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) entirely.

            </a>
				  It is not sound statutory construction to create a conflict by ignoring one feature of a statute and then to solve the problem by ignoring yet another.  My construction of the exception in clause (ii) avoids the conflict altogether.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In its fourth step, the Court returns to the application of the $100/$1,000 brackets to clause (i).  The Court finds scant indication that Congress meant to alter the meaning of clause (i) in 1995 and compares this to  Sir Arthur Conan Doyles dog that didnt bark.  

).  I hardly think it scant indication of intent to alter that Congress 
				<em>
					amended the text of the statute
				</em>
				 by moving the exception from the end of the list to the middle, making it impossible, without doing violence to the text, to read the exception as applying to the entire list.  Needless to say, I also disagree with the Courts reliance on things that the sponsors and floor managers of the 1995 amendment 
				<em>
					failed

				 to say.

				  I have often criticized the Courts use of legislative history because it lends itself to a kind of ventriloquism.  The Congressional Record or committee reports are used to make words appear to come from Congresss mouth which were spoken or written by others (individual Members of Congress, congressional aides, or even enterprising lobbyists).  The Canon of Canine Silence that the Court invokes today introduces a reverseand at least equally dangerousphenomenon, under which courts may refuse to believe Congresss 
				<em>
					own
				</em>
				 words unless they can see the lips of others moving in unison.  See

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In its fifth and final step, the Court asserts that it would be anomalous for liability to be uncapped by the [$1,000] limit when real property secures an open-end loan but capped by the $2,000 limit when it secures a closed-end loan, and that it would be passing strange for damages to be 
				<em>
					substantially lower
				</em>
				 under clause (iii) than under clause (i).  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 12, and n. 10.  The lack of a $1,000 limit does not, of course, make liability under clause (i) limitless.  In all cases under clause (i), the damages are twice the finance charge, and the 1-year statute of limitations, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/15/1640.html#e" class="subref" title="subref">15 U. S. C. §1640(e)</a>, naturally limits the amount of damages that can be sought.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				More importantly, Congress would have expected the amounts financed (and thus the finance charges) under clause (i) to be generally much lower than those under clause (iii).  In cases (like this one) where loans are not secured by real property, the amount financed can be no greater than $25,000.  §1603(3).  Where loans are secured by real property, clause (iii) includes both first mortgages and second mortgages (or home equity loans), which are far more common and significantly larger than the open-end home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) that are still covered by clause (i).  In 1994, 64% of home-owning households had first or second mortgages, but only 7% had HELOCs with outstanding balances.  Survey Research Center, Univ. of Michigan, National Survey of Home Equity Loans 25 (Oct. 1998) (Table 1) (hereinafter National Survey).  The mean first mortgage balance was $66,884; the mean second mortgage balance was $16,199; and the mean HELOC outstanding balance was $18,459.  
				<em>
					Ibid.&lt;footcall num="3"&gt;
				</em>
				  Assuming a 10% interest rate (which would have been higher than a typical HELOC in 1994, see Canner and Luckett, Home Equity Lending: Evidence from Recent Surveys, 80 Fed. Res. Bull. 571, 582 (1994)), a year of finance charges on the mean HELOC would still have been less than $2,000which, when doubled, would still be less than two times the maximum damages under clause (iii), a disproportion no greater than what Congress has explicitly prescribed between clauses (ii) and (iii).  In addition, very large outstanding balances on HELOCs are comparatively rare.  In 2001, roughly 94% of them were less than the 
				<em>
					median
				</em>
				 outstanding mortgage principal of $69,227.  See U. S. Census Bureau, American Housing Survey for the United States: 2001, pp. 150, 152 (Oct. 2002) (Table 315) (hereinafter American Housing Survey).

                </sup>
            </a>
				  Approximately 2% of HELOC balances were $100,000 or more (compared with approximately 32% of mortgages).  See 
				<em>
					ibid.
				</em>
				  Because closed-end loans are many times more common, and typically much larger, than open-end ones, the finance charges would generally be much higher under clause (iii) than under clause (i), providing a reason for Congress to focus more intently on limiting damages in clause (iii).  As for the difference between clause (i) and the $1,000 cap in clause (ii): Consumer leases (principally car leases) are obviously a distinctive category and a special damages cap (which differs from clause (iii) as well as from clause (i)) no more demands an explanation than does the fact that damages for those leases are tied to monthly payments rather than to finance charges.  As 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Stevens
				</span>
				 acknowledges, applying the $1,000 cap to clause (ii) but not clause (i) is a plausible policy decision.  
				<em>
					Ante,

				 at 1 (concurring opinion).  The Court should not fight the current structure of the statute merely to vindicate the suspicion that Congress actually madebut neglected to explain clearlya different policy decision.

				As the Court noted earlier this year: If Congress enacted into law something different from what it intended, then it should amend the statute to conform it to its intent.

						 In footnote 7, the Court asserts that its new reading merely requires one to pretend that Congress had not added (iii) when it raised the cap on recovery.  That is not sonot, at least, if the Court adheres to the sound drafting principles that supposedly form the basis for its opinion.  See supra, at 23.  To adhere to those and also to apply both the limitation of clause (ii) and the limitation of clause (iii) to clause (i), one must pretend that Congress not only had not added (iii) but also had eliminated (i) and (ii).  Otherwise, those limits which are recited in clause (ii) would apply only to that clause.

						 The things that were said about the 1995 amendment are characteristically unhelpful.  Rep. McCollum said: [T]he bill raises the statutory damages for individual actions from $1,000 to $2,000.  141 Cong. Rec. 26576 (1995); see also id., at 26898 (remarks of Sen. Mack) (same).  Two weeks later, he clarif[ied] his remarks by specifying that the amendments apply solely to loans secured by real estate.  Id., at 27703 (statement of Reps. McCollum and Gonzalez).  Taken literally, these floor statements could mean that the new $2,000 limit applies either to all individual actions under subparagraph (A), or to all loans secured by real estate under clauses (i) and (iii).  Neither option is consistent with the Courts conclusion that there is a $1,000 limit under clause (i).

						 The medians were, of course, lower than the means: $49,000 for first mortgages, $11,000 for second mortgages, and $15,000 for HELOCs.  National Survey 25 (Table 1).

						 The 1994 survey did not report on the range of amounts owed on HELOCs.  In 2001, however, the Census Bureaus Housing Survey began reporting detailed data about HELOCsin figures presumably comparable to the 1994 data recited above, since the median outstanding balance and median interest rate for HELOCs had not dramatically changed.  (The 2001 medians were $17,517 and 8%.  See American Housing Survey 152, 154 (Table 315).)

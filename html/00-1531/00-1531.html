				The Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Act) requires that incumbent local-exchange carriers (LECs) provide … interconnection with their existing networks when a new entrant seeks access to a market, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/47/251.html#c_2" class="subref" title="subref">47 U. S. C. §251(c)(2)</a>; that the carriers then establish reciprocal compensation arrangements for transporting and terminating the calls of each others customers,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				§251(b)(5); and that their interconnection agreements be submitted to a state utility commission for approval,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				§252(e)(1).  Petitioner Verizon Maryland Inc., the incumbent LEC in Maryland, negotiated an interconnection agreement with a competitor later acquired by respondent MCI WorldCom, Inc.  After the Maryland Public Service Commission (Commission) approved the agreement, Verizon informed WorldCom that it would no longer pay reciprocal compensation for calls made by Verizons customers to the local access numbers of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) because ISP traffic was not local traffic subject to the reciprocal compensation agreement.  WorldCom filed a complaint with the Commission, which ordered Verizon to make the payments for past and future ISP-bound calls.  Verizon then filed an action in federal district court, citing §252(e)(6) and 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1331.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1331</a> as the basis for jurisdiction, and naming as defendants the Commission, its individual members in their official capacities, WorldCom, and other competing LECs.  Verizon sought a declaratory judgment that the order was unlawful and an injunction prohibiting its enforcement, alleging that the determination that Verizon must pay reciprocal compensation for ISP traffic violated the 1996 Act and a Federal Communications Commission ruling.  The District Court dismissed the action.  The Fourth Circuit affirmed, holding that the Commission had not waived its 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxi" class="subref" title="subref">Eleventh Amendment</a> immunity from suit; that the doctrine of 
				<em>
					Ex parte Young,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/209/123" class="subref" title="subref">209 U. S. 123</a>, does not permit suit against the individual commissioners in their official capacities; and that neither §252(e)(6) nor §1331 provides a basis for jurisdiction over Verizons claims against the private defendants.
			</p>
        <p class="SYLCTE">
				Held:
			</p>
        <p class="SYLCTF">
				
				    
				1. Section 1331 provides a basis for jurisdiction over Verizons claim that the Commissions order requiring reciprocal compensation for ISP-bound calls is pre-empted by federal law.  Federal courts have jurisdiction under §1331 where the petitioners right to recover will be sustained if federal law is given one construction and will be defeated if it is given another, unless the claim clearly appears to be immaterial and made solely to obtain jurisdiction, or is wholly insubstantial and frivolous.  
				<em>
					Steel Co
				</em>
				. v. 
				<em>
					Citizens for Better Environment,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/523/83" class="subref" title="subref">523 U. S. 83</a>.  Here, resolution of Verizons claim turns on whether the Act, or an FCC ruling, precludes the Commission from ordering payment of reciprocal compensation, and there is no suggestion that the claim is immaterial or insubstantial and frivolous.  Even if §252(e)(6) (which provides that a party aggrieved by a State commissions determination under section 252 may bring a federal action to determine whether an interconnection agreement meets the requirements of §§251 and 252) does not confer jurisdiction, it does not divest the district courts of their authority under §1331.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Abbott Laboratories
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Gardner
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/387/136" class="subref" title="subref">387 U. S. 136</a>.  Section 252 does not establish a distinctive review mechanism for the commission actions that it covers, and it does not distinctively limit the substantive relief available.  Finally, none of the Acts other provisions evince any intent to preclude federal review of a commission determination.  Pp. 48.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				2. The doctrine of 
				<em>
					Ex parte Young
				</em>
				 permits Verizons suit to go forward against the state commissioners in their official capacities.  The Court thus need not decide whether the Commission waived its immunity from suit by voluntarily participating in the regulatory regime established by the Act.  In determining whether the 
				<em>
					Ex parte Young 
				</em>
				doctrine avoids an 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxi" class="subref" title="subref">Eleventh Amendment</a> bar to suit, a court need only conduct a straightforward inquiry into whether the complaint alleges an ongoing violation of federal law and seeks relief properly characterized as prospective.  
				<em>
					Idaho
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Coeur dAlene Tribe of Idaho
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/521/261" class="subref" title="subref">521 U. S. 261</a>.  Here, Verizons prayer for injunctive reliefthat state officials be restrained from enforcing an order in contravention of controlling federal lawclearly satisfies our straightforward inquiry.  As for Verizons prayer for declaratory relief, even though Verizon seeks a declaration of the past, as well as the future, ineffectiveness of the Commissions action, so that the private parties past financial liability may be affected, no past liability of the State, or of any of its commissioners, is at issue, see 
				<em>
					Edelman
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Jordan
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/415/651" class="subref" title="subref">415 U. S. 651</a>.  The Fourth Circuits suggestion that the doctrine of 
				<em>
					Ex parte Young
				</em>
				 is inapplicable because the Commissions order was probably not inconsistent with federal law is unavailing: The inquiry into whether suit lies under 
				<em>
					Ex parte Young
				</em>
				 does not include an analysis of the merits of the claim, see 
				<em>
					Coeur dAlene, supra
				</em>
				, at 281.  Nor is there any merit to the Commissions argument that §252(e)(6) constitutes a detailed and exclusive remedial scheme like the one held in 
				<em>
					Seminole Tribe of Fla
				</em>
				. v.

				The Telecommunications Act of 1996 (1996 Act or Act), Pub. L. 104104, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">110</a>Stat.
56, created a new telecommunications regime designed to foster competition in local telephone markets.  Toward that end, the Act imposed various obligations on incumbent local-exchange carriers (LECs), including a duty to share their networks with competitors.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/47/251.html#c" class="subref" title="subref">47 U. S. C. §251(c)</a> (1994 ed., Supp. V).  When a new entrant seeks access to a market, the incumbent LEC must provide … interconnection with the incumbents existing network, §251(c)(2), and the carriers must then establish reciprocal compensation arrangements for transporting and terminating the calls placed by each others customers,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				§251(b)(5).  As we have previously described, see 
				<em>
					AT&amp;T Corp.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Iowa Utilities Bd., 
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/525/366" class="subref" title="subref">525 U. S. 366</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">371</a>373 (1999)
, an incumbent LEC may negotiate and enter into a binding agreement with the new entrant to fulfill the duties imposed by §§251(b) and (c), but without regard to the standards set forth in those provisions.  §§252(a)(1), 251(c)(1).  That agreement must be submitted to the state commission for approval,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				§252(e)(1), which may reject it if it discriminates against a carrier not a party or is not consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity, §252(e)(2)(A).

				As required by the Act, the incumbent LEC in Maryland, petitioner Verizon Maryland Inc., formerly known as Bell Atlantic Maryland, Inc., negotiated an interconnection agreement with competitors, including MFS Intelenet of Maryland, later acquired by respondent MCI WorldCom, Inc.  The Maryland Public Service Commission (Commission) approved the agreement.  Six months later, Verizon informed WorldCom that it would no longer pay reciprocal compensation for telephone calls made by Verizons customers to the local access numbers of Internet Service Providers (ISPs), claiming that ISP traffic was not local traffic
				<a name="ZO-1ref" href="#ZO-1" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>
					1
				</b>
                </sup>
            </a>
				 subject to the reciprocal compensation agreement because ISPs connect customers to distant Web sites.  WorldCom disputed Verizons claim and filed a complaint with the Commission.  The Commission found in favor of WorldCom, ordering Verizon to timely forward all future interconnection payments owed [WorldCom] for telephone calls placed to an ISP and to pay WorldCom any reciprocal compensation that it had withheld pending resolution of the dispute.  Verizon appealed to a Maryland state court, which affirmed the order.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Subsequently, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued a rulinglater vacated by the Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit, see 
				<em>
					Bell Atlantic Tel. Cos. 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					FCC
				</em>
				, 206 F. 3d 1 (2000)which categorized ISP-bound calls as nonlocal for purposes of reciprocal compensation but concluded that, absent a federal compensation mechanism for those calls, state commissions could construe interconnection agreements as requiring reciprocal compensation.  Verizon filed a new complaint with the Commission, arguing that the FCC ruling established that Verizon was no longer required to provide reciprocal compensation for ISP traffic.  In a 3-to-2 decision, the Commission rejected this contention, concluding that, as a matter of state contract law, WorldCom and Verizon had agreed to treat ISP-bound calls as local traffic subject to reciprocal compensation.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Verizon filed an action in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, citing 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/47/252.html#e_6" class="subref" title="subref">47 U. S. C. §252(e)(6)</a> and 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1331.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1331</a> as the basis for jurisdiction, and naming as defendants the Commission, its individual members in their official capacities, WorldCom, and other competing LECs.  In its complaint, Verizon sought declaratory and injunctive relief from the Commissions order, alleging that the determination that Verizon must pay reciprocal compensation to WorldCom for ISP traffic violated the 1996 Act and the FCC ruling.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				
				The District Court dismissed the action, and a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed.  240 F. 3d 279 (2001).  The Fourth Circuit held that the Commission had not waived its immunity from suit by voluntarily participating in the regulatory scheme set up under the 1996 Act, and that the doctrine of 
				<em>

            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/209/123" class="subref" title="subref">209 U. S. 123</a> (1908)
, does not permit suit against the individual commissioners in their official capacities.  It then held that neither

				WorldCom, Verizon, and the United States contend that 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/47/252.html#e_6" class="subref" title="subref">47 U. S. C. §252(e)(6)</a> and 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1331.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1331</a> independently grant federal courts subject-matter jurisdiction to determine whether the Commissions order requiring that Verizon pay WorldCom reciprocal compensation for ISP-bound calls violates the 1996 Act.  Section 252 sets forth procedures relating to formation and commission approval of interconnection agreements, and commission approval and continuing review of interconnection terms and conditions (called [s]tatements of generally available terms, §252(f)) filed by LECs.  Section 252(e)(6) provides, in relevant part: In any case in which a State commission makes a determination under this section, any party aggrieved by such determination may bring an action in an appropriate Federal district court to determine whether the agreement or statement meets the requirements of section 251 of this title and this section.  The determination at issue here is neither the approval or disapproval of a negotiated agreement nor the approval or disapproval of a statement of generally available terms.  WorldCom, Verizon, and the United States argue, however, that a state commissions authority under §252 implicitly encompasses the authority to interpret and enforce an interconnection agreement that the commission has approved,
				<a name="ZO-2ref" href="#ZO-2" class="">

            </a>
				 and that an interpretation or enforcement decision is therefore a determination under [§252] subject to federal review.  Whether the text of §252(e)(6) can be so construed is a question we need not decide.  For we agree with the parties alternative contention, that even if §252(e)(6) does not 
				<em>
					confer
				</em>
				 jurisdiction, it at least does not 
				<em>
					divest
				</em>
				 the district courts of their authority under 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1331.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1331</a> to review the Commissions order for compliance with federal law.

				Verizon alleged in its complaint that the Commission violated the Act and the FCC ruling when it ordered payment of reciprocal compensation for ISP-bound calls.  Verizon sought a declaratory judgment that the Commissions order was unlawful, and an injunction prohibiting its enforcement.  We have no doubt that federal courts have jurisdiction under §1331 to entertain such a suit.  Verizon seeks relief from the Commissions order on the ground that such regulation is pre-empted by a federal statute which, by virtue of the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, must prevail, and its claim thus presents a federal question which the federal courts have jurisdiction under

				The Commission contends that since the Act does not create a private cause of action to challenge the Commissions order, there is no jurisdiction to entertain such a suit.  We need express no opinion on the premise of this argument.  It is firmly established in our cases that the absence of a valid (as opposed to arguable) cause of action does not implicate subject-matter jurisdiction,

.  As we have said, the district court has jurisdiction if the right of the petitioners to recover under their complaint will be sustained if the Constitution and laws of the United States are given one construction and will be defeated if they are given another, unless the claim clearly appears to be immaterial and made solely for the purpose of obtaining jurisdiction or where such a claim is wholly insubstantial and frivolous. 

				(citation omitted).  Here, resolution of Verizons claim turns on whether the Act, or an FCC ruling issued thereunder, precludes the Commission from ordering payment of reciprocal compensation, and there is no suggestion that Verizons claim is  immaterial  or  wholly insubstantial and frivolous.   Ibid.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				Verizons claim thus falls within 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1331.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1331</a>s general grant of jurisdiction, and contrary to the Fourth Circuits conclusion, nothing in 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/47/252.html#e_6" class="subref" title="subref">47 U. S. C. §252(e)(6)</a> purports to strip this jurisdiction.  Section 252(e)(6) provides for federal review of an agreement when a state commission makes a determination under [§252].  If this does not include (as WorldCom, Verizon, and the United States claim it does) the interpretation or enforcement of an interconnection agreement, then §252(e)(6) merely makes some other 
				actions by state commissions reviewable in federal court.  This is not enough to eliminate jurisdiction under §1331.  Although the situation is not precisely  parallel (in that here the elimination of federal district-court review would not amount to the elimination of all review), we think what we said in 
				<em>
					Abbott Laboratories
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Gardner,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/387/136" class="subref" title="subref">387 U. S. 136</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">141</a> (1967)
, is nonetheless apt: The mere fact that some acts are made reviewable should not suffice to support an implication of exclusion as to others.  (Internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  And here there is nothing more than that mere fact.  Section 252 does not establish a distinctive review mechanism for the commission actions that it covers (the mechanism is the same as §1331: district-court review), and it does not distinctively limit the substantive relief available.  Cf. 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Fausto,
				</em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">448</a>449 (1988)
.  Indeed, it does not even mention subject-matter jurisdiction, but reads like the conferral of a private right of action ([A]ny party aggrieved by such determination may bring an action in an appropriate Federal district court, §252(e)(6)).  Cf. 
				<em>
					Steel Co.
				</em>
				,
				<em>

				</em>
				 at 9091 (even a statutory provision that uses the word jurisdiction may not relate to subject-matter jurisdiction); see also

				And finally, none of the other provisions of the Act evince any intent to preclude federal review of a commission determination.  If anything, they reinforce the conclusion that §252(e)(6)s silence on the subject leaves the jurisdictional grant of §1331 untouched.  For where otherwise applicable jurisdiction was meant to be excluded, it was excluded expressly.  Section 252(e)(4) provides: No State court shall have jurisdiction to review the action of a State commission in approving or rejecting an agreement under this section.  In sum, nothing in the Act displays any intent to withdraw federal jurisdiction under §1331; we will not presume that the statute means what it neither says nor fairly implies.

				The Fourth Circuit suggested that Verizons claim could not be brought under 
				<em>
					Ex parte Young
				</em>
				, because the Commissions order was probably 
				<em>
					not 
				</em>
				inconsistent with federal law after all.  240 F. 3d, at 295297.  The court noted that the FCC ruling relied upon by Verizon does not seem to require compensation for ISP traffic; that the Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit has vacated the ruling; and that the Commission interpreted the interconnection agreement under state contract-law principles.  It may (or may not) be true that the FCCs since-vacated ruling does not support Verizons claim; it may (or may not) also be true that state contract law, and not federal law as Verizon contends, applies to disputes regarding the interpretation of Verizons agreement.  But the inquiry into whether suit lies under 
				<em>
					Ex parte Young 
				</em>
				does not include an analysis of the merits of the claim.  See 
				<em>
					Coeur dAlene,
				</em>
            <em>

				</em>
				 at 281 (An

				Nor does the 1996 Act display any intent to foreclose jurisdiction under

				as we concluded the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act did in

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/25/2710.html#d_3" class="subref" title="subref">25 U. S. C. §2710(d)(3)</a>.  Congress had specified the means to enforce that duty in §2710(d)(7), a provision intended … not only to define, but also to limit significantly, the duty imposed by §2710(d)(3).  517 U. S., at 74.  The intricate procedures set forth in that provision prescribed that a court could issue an order directing the State to negotiate, that it could require the State to submit to mediation, and that it could order that the Secretary of the Interior be notified.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 7475.  We concluded that this quite modest set of sanctions displayed an intent not to provide the more complete and more immediate relief that would otherwise be available under 
				<em>
					Ex parte Young
				</em>
				.  517 U. S., at 75.  Permitting suit under 
				<em>
					Ex parte Young
				</em>
				 was thus inconsistent with the detailed remedial scheme, 517 U. S., at 74and the limited onethat Congress had prescribed to enforce the States statutory duty to negotiate.  The Commissions argument that §252(e)(6) constitutes a detailed and exclusive remedial scheme like the one in 
				<em>
					Seminole Tribe
				</em>
				, implicitly excluding 
				<em>
					Ex parte Young
				</em>
				 actions, is without merit.  That section provides only that when state commissions make certain determinations, an aggrieved party may bring suit in federal court to establish compliance with the requirements of §§251 and 252.  Even with regard to the determinations that it covers, it places no restriction on the relief a court can award.  And it does not even say whom the suit is to be brought againstthe state commission, the individual commissioners, or the carriers benefiting from the state commissions order.  The mere fact that Congress has authorized federal courts to review whether the Commissions action complies with §§251 and 252 does not without more impose upon the State a liability that is significantly more limited than would be the liability imposed upon the state officer under

						 Section 1.61 of the interconnection agreement provides:  Reciprocal Compensation is As Described in the Act, and refers to the payment arrangements that recover costs incurred for the transport and termination of Local Traffic originating on one Partys network and terminating on the other Partys network.  In turn, §1.44 defines  Local Traffic  as traffic that is originated by a Customer of one Party on that Partys network and terminates to a Customer of the other Party on that other Partys network, within a given local calling area, or expanded area service (EAS) area, as defined in [Bell Atlantics] effective Customer tariffs.

				The Telecommunications Act of 1996 (1996 Act or Act), Pub. L. 104104, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">110</a>Stat.
56, created a new telecommunications regime designed to foster competition in local telephone markets.  Toward that end, the Act imposed various obligations on incumbent local-exchange carriers (LECs), including a duty to share their networks with competitors.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/47/251.html#c" class="subref" title="subref">47 U. S. C. §251(c)</a> (1994 ed., Supp. V).  When a new entrant seeks access to a market, the incumbent LEC must provide … interconnection with the incumbents existing network, §251(c)(2), and the carriers must then establish reciprocal compensation arrangements for transporting and terminating the calls placed by each others customers,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				§251(b)(5).  As we have previously described, see 
				<em>
					AT&amp;T Corp.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">371</a>373 (1999)
, an incumbent LEC may negotiate and enter into a binding agreement with the new entrant to fulfill the duties imposed by §§251(b) and (c), but without regard to the standards set forth in those provisions.  §§252(a)(1), 251(c)(1).  That agreement must be submitted to the state commission for approval,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				§252(e)(1), which may reject it if it discriminates against a carrier not a party or is not consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity, §252(e)(2)(A).

				As required by the Act, the incumbent LEC in Maryland, petitioner Verizon Maryland Inc., formerly known as Bell Atlantic Maryland, Inc., negotiated an interconnection agreement with competitors, including MFS Intelenet of Maryland, later acquired by respondent MCI WorldCom, Inc.  The Maryland Public Service Commission (Commission) approved the agreement.  Six months later, Verizon informed WorldCom that it would no longer pay reciprocal compensation for telephone calls made by Verizons customers to the local access numbers of Internet Service Providers (ISPs), claiming that ISP traffic was not local traffic
				<a name="ZO-1ref" href="#ZO-1" class="">

				</b>
                </sup>
            </a>
				 subject to the reciprocal compensation agreement because ISPs connect customers to distant Web sites.  WorldCom disputed Verizons claim and filed a complaint with the Commission.  The Commission found in favor of WorldCom, ordering Verizon to timely forward all future interconnection payments owed [WorldCom] for telephone calls placed to an ISP and to pay WorldCom any reciprocal compensation that it had withheld pending resolution of the dispute.  Verizon appealed to a Maryland state court, which affirmed the order.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Subsequently, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued a rulinglater vacated by the Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit, see 
				<em>
					Bell Atlantic Tel. Cos. 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					FCC
				</em>
				, 206 F. 3d 1 (2000)which categorized ISP-bound calls as nonlocal for purposes of reciprocal compensation but concluded that, absent a federal compensation mechanism for those calls, state commissions could construe interconnection agreements as requiring reciprocal compensation.  Verizon filed a new complaint with the Commission, arguing that the FCC ruling established that Verizon was no longer required to provide reciprocal compensation for ISP traffic.  In a 3-to-2 decision, the Commission rejected this contention, concluding that, as a matter of state contract law, WorldCom and Verizon had agreed to treat ISP-bound calls as local traffic subject to reciprocal compensation.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Verizon filed an action in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, citing 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/47/252.html#e_6" class="subref" title="subref">47 U. S. C. §252(e)(6)</a> and

C. §1331</a> as the basis for jurisdiction, and naming as defendants the Commission, its individual members in their official capacities, WorldCom, and other competing LECs.  In its complaint, Verizon sought declaratory and injunctive relief from the Commissions order, alleging that the determination that Verizon must pay reciprocal compensation to WorldCom for ISP traffic violated the 1996 Act and the FCC ruling.

				The District Court dismissed the action, and a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed.  240 F. 3d 279 (2001).  The Fourth Circuit held that the Commission had not waived its immunity from suit by voluntarily participating in the regulatory scheme set up under the 1996 Act, and that the doctrine of

C. §1331</a> independently grant federal courts subject-matter jurisdiction to determine whether the Commissions order requiring that Verizon pay WorldCom reciprocal compensation for ISP-bound calls violates the 1996 Act.  Section 252 sets forth procedures relating to formation and commission approval of interconnection agreements, and commission approval and continuing review of interconnection terms and conditions (called [s]tatements of generally available terms, §252(f)) filed by LECs.  Section 252(e)(6) provides, in relevant part: In any case in which a State commission makes a determination under this section, any party aggrieved by such determination may bring an action in an appropriate Federal district court to determine whether the agreement or statement meets the requirements of section 251 of this title and this section.  The determination at issue here is neither the approval or disapproval of a negotiated agreement nor the approval or disapproval of a statement of generally available terms.  WorldCom, Verizon, and the United States argue, however, that a state commissions authority under §252 implicitly encompasses the authority to interpret and enforce an interconnection agreement that the commission has approved,

            </a>
				 and that an interpretation or enforcement decision is therefore a determination under [§252] subject to federal review.  Whether the text of §252(e)(6) can be so construed is a question we need not decide.  For we agree with the parties alternative contention, that even if §252(e)(6) does not 
				<em>
					confer
				</em>
				 jurisdiction, it at least does not 
				<em>
					divest

				 the district courts of their authority under

				Verizon alleged in its complaint that the Commission violated the Act and the FCC ruling when it ordered payment of reciprocal compensation for ISP-bound calls.  Verizon sought a declaratory judgment that the Commissions order was unlawful, and an injunction prohibiting its enforcement.  We have no doubt that federal courts have jurisdiction under §1331 to entertain such a suit.  Verizon seeks relief from the Commissions order on the ground that such regulation is pre-empted by a federal statute which, by virtue of the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, must prevail, and its claim thus presents a federal question which the federal courts have jurisdiction under

				The Commission contends that since the Act does not create a private cause of action to challenge the Commissions order, there is no jurisdiction to entertain such a suit.  We need express no opinion on the premise of this argument.  It is firmly established in our cases that the absence of a valid (as opposed to arguable) cause of action does not implicate subject-matter jurisdiction, 
				<em>
					i.e.,
				</em>
				 the courts statutory or constitutional 
				<em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">89</a> (1998)
.  As we have said, the district court has jurisdiction if the right of the petitioners to recover under their complaint will be sustained if the Constitution and laws of the United States are given one construction and will be defeated if they are given another, unless the claim clearly appears to be immaterial and made solely for the purpose of obtaining jurisdiction or where such a claim is wholly insubstantial and frivolous.   
				<em>
					Ibid. 
				</em>
				(citation omitted).  Here, resolution of Verizons claim turns on whether the Act, or an FCC ruling issued thereunder, precludes the Commission from ordering payment of reciprocal compensation, and there is no suggestion that Verizons claim is  immaterial  or  wholly insubstantial and frivolous.   Ibid.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				Verizons claim thus falls within 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1331.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1331</a>s general grant of jurisdiction, and contrary to the Fourth Circuits conclusion, nothing in 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/47/252.html#e_6" class="subref" title="subref">47 U. S. C. §252(e)(6)</a> purports to strip this jurisdiction.  Section 252(e)(6) provides for federal review of an agreement when a state commission makes a determination under [§252].  If this does not include (as WorldCom, Verizon, and the United States claim it does) the interpretation or enforcement of an interconnection agreement, then §252(e)(6) merely makes some other 
				actions by state commissions reviewable in federal court.  This is not enough to eliminate jurisdiction under §1331.  Although the situation is not precisely  parallel (in that here the elimination of federal district-court review would not amount to the elimination of all review), we think what we said in 
				<em>
					Abbott Laboratories
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Gardner,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/387/136" class="subref" title="subref">387 U. S. 136</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">141</a> (1967)
, is nonetheless apt: The mere fact that some acts are made reviewable should not suffice to support an implication of exclusion as to others.  (Internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  And here there is nothing more than that mere fact.  Section 252 does not establish a distinctive review mechanism for the commission actions that it covers (the mechanism is the same as §1331: district-court review), and it does not distinctively limit the substantive relief available.  Cf. 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Fausto,
				</em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">448</a>449 (1988)
.  Indeed, it does not even mention subject-matter jurisdiction, but reads like the conferral of a private right of action ([A]ny party aggrieved by such determination may bring an action in an appropriate Federal district court, §252(e)(6)).  Cf. 
				<em>
					Steel Co.
				</em>
				,
				<em>

				</em>
				 at 9091 (even a statutory provision that uses the word jurisdiction may not relate to subject-matter jurisdiction); see also

				And finally, none of the other provisions of the Act evince any intent to preclude federal review of a commission determination.  If anything, they reinforce the conclusion that §252(e)(6)s silence on the subject leaves the jurisdictional grant of §1331 untouched.  For where otherwise applicable jurisdiction was meant to be excluded, it was excluded expressly.  Section 252(e)(4) provides: No State court shall have jurisdiction to review the action of a State commission in approving or rejecting an agreement under this section.  In sum, nothing in the Act displays any intent to withdraw federal jurisdiction under §1331; we will not presume that the statute means what it neither says nor fairly implies.

				The Fourth Circuit suggested that Verizons claim could not be brought under 
				<em>
					Ex parte Young
				</em>
				, because the Commissions order was probably 
				<em>
					not 
				</em>
				inconsistent with federal law after all.  240 F. 3d, at 295297.  The court noted that the FCC ruling relied upon by Verizon does not seem to require compensation for ISP traffic; that the Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit has vacated the ruling; and that the Commission interpreted the interconnection agreement under state contract-law principles.  It may (or may not) be true that the FCCs since-vacated ruling does not support Verizons claim; it may (or may not) also be true that state contract law, and not federal law as Verizon contends, applies to disputes regarding the interpretation of Verizons agreement.  But the inquiry into whether suit lies under 
				<em>
					Ex parte Young 
				</em>
				does not include an analysis of the merits of the claim.  See 
				<em>
					Coeur dAlene,
				</em>
            <em>

				Nor does the 1996 Act display any intent to foreclose jurisdiction under

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/25/2710.html#d_3" class="subref" title="subref">25 U. S. C. §2710(d)(3)</a>.  Congress had specified the means to enforce that duty in §2710(d)(7), a provision intended … not only to define, but also to limit significantly, the duty imposed by §2710(d)(3).  517 U. S., at 74.  The intricate procedures set forth in that provision prescribed that a court could issue an order directing the State to negotiate, that it could require the State to submit to mediation, and that it could order that the Secretary of the Interior be notified.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 7475.  We concluded that this quite modest set of sanctions displayed an intent not to provide the more complete and more immediate relief that would otherwise be available under

				</em>
				.  517 U. S., at 75.  Permitting suit under 
				<em>
					Ex parte Young
				</em>
				 was thus inconsistent with the detailed remedial scheme, 517 U. S., at 74and the limited onethat Congress had prescribed to enforce the States statutory duty to negotiate.  The Commissions argument that §252(e)(6) constitutes a detailed and exclusive remedial scheme like the one in 
				<em>
					Seminole Tribe
				</em>
				, implicitly excluding 
				<em>
					Ex parte Young
				</em>
				 actions, is without merit.  That section provides only that when state commissions make certain determinations, an aggrieved party may bring suit in federal court to establish compliance with the requirements of §§251 and 252.  Even with regard to the determinations that it covers, it places no restriction on the relief a court can award.  And it does not even say whom the suit is to be brought againstthe state commission, the individual commissioners, or the carriers benefiting from the state commissions order.  The mere fact that Congress has authorized federal courts to review whether the Commissions action complies with §§251 and 252 does not without more impose upon the State a liability that is significantly more limited than would be the liability imposed upon the state officer under

				These cases present the question whether federal district courts have jurisdiction over a telecommunication carriers claim that the order of a state utility commission requiring reciprocal compensation for telephone calls to Internet Service Providers violates federal law.

				The Telecommunications Act of 1996 (1996 Act or Act), Pub. L. 104104, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">110</a>Stat.
56, created a new telecommunications regime designed to foster competition in local telephone markets.  Toward that end, the Act imposed various obligations on incumbent local-exchange carriers (LECs), including a duty to share their networks with competitors.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/47/251.html#c" class="subref" title="subref">47 U. S. C. §251(c)</a> (1994 ed., Supp. V).  When a new entrant seeks access to a market, the incumbent LEC must provide … interconnection with the incumbents existing network, §251(c)(2), and the carriers must then establish reciprocal compensation arrangements for transporting and terminating the calls placed by each others customers,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				§251(b)(5).  As we have previously described, see 
				<em>
					AT&amp;T Corp.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Iowa Utilities Bd., 
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/525/366" class="subref" title="subref">525 U. S. 366</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">371</a>373 (1999)
, an incumbent LEC may negotiate and enter into a binding agreement with the new entrant to fulfill the duties imposed by §§251(b) and (c), but without regard to the standards set forth in those provisions.  §§252(a)(1), 251(c)(1).  That agreement must be submitted to the state commission for approval,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				§252(e)(1), which may reject it if it discriminates against a carrier not a party or is not consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity, §252(e)(2)(A).

				As required by the Act, the incumbent LEC in Maryland, petitioner Verizon Maryland Inc., formerly known as Bell Atlantic Maryland, Inc., negotiated an interconnection agreement with competitors, including MFS Intelenet of Maryland, later acquired by respondent MCI WorldCom, Inc.  The Maryland Public Service Commission (Commission) approved the agreement.  Six months later, Verizon informed WorldCom that it would no longer pay reciprocal compensation for telephone calls made by Verizons customers to the local access numbers of Internet Service Providers (ISPs), claiming that ISP traffic was not local traffic
				<a name="ZO-1ref" href="#ZO-1" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>

				</b>
                </sup>
            </a>
				 subject to the reciprocal compensation agreement because ISPs connect customers to distant Web sites.  WorldCom disputed Verizons claim and filed a complaint with the Commission.  The Commission found in favor of WorldCom, ordering Verizon to timely forward all future interconnection payments owed [WorldCom] for telephone calls placed to an ISP and to pay WorldCom any reciprocal compensation that it had withheld pending resolution of the dispute.  Verizon appealed to a Maryland state court, which affirmed the order.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Subsequently, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued a rulinglater vacated by the Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit, see 
				<em>
					Bell Atlantic Tel. Cos. 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					FCC
				</em>
				, 206 F. 3d 1 (2000)which categorized ISP-bound calls as nonlocal for purposes of reciprocal compensation but concluded that, absent a federal compensation mechanism for those calls, state commissions could construe interconnection agreements as requiring reciprocal compensation.  Verizon filed a new complaint with the Commission, arguing that the FCC ruling established that Verizon was no longer required to provide reciprocal compensation for ISP traffic.  In a 3-to-2 decision, the Commission rejected this contention, concluding that, as a matter of state contract law, WorldCom and Verizon had agreed to treat ISP-bound calls as local traffic subject to reciprocal compensation.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Verizon filed an action in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, citing 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/47/252.html#e_6" class="subref" title="subref">47 U. S. C. §252(e)(6)</a> and 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1331.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1331</a> as the basis for jurisdiction, and naming as defendants the Commission, its individual members in their official capacities, WorldCom, and other competing LECs.  In its complaint, Verizon sought declaratory and injunctive relief from the Commissions order, alleging that the determination that Verizon must pay reciprocal compensation to WorldCom for ISP traffic violated the 1996 Act and the FCC ruling.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				
				The District Court dismissed the action, and a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed.  240 F. 3d 279 (2001).  The Fourth Circuit held that the Commission had not waived its immunity from suit by voluntarily participating in the regulatory scheme set up under the 1996 Act, and that the doctrine of 
				<em>
					Ex parte Young,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/209/123" class="subref" title="subref">209 U. S. 123</a> (1908)
, does not permit suit against the individual commissioners in their official capacities.  It then held that neither 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/47/252.html#e_6" class="subref" title="subref">47 U. S. C. §252(e)(6)</a> nor

Both Verizon and the United States, an intervenor below, petitioned this Court for review of the four questions resolved by the Fourth Circuit.  Because we had previously granted certiorari in

				WorldCom, Verizon, and the United States contend that 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/47/252.html#e_6" class="subref" title="subref">47 U. S. C. §252(e)(6)</a> and 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1331.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1331</a> independently grant federal courts subject-matter jurisdiction to determine whether the Commissions order requiring that Verizon pay WorldCom reciprocal compensation for ISP-bound calls violates the 1996 Act.  Section 252 sets forth procedures relating to formation and commission approval of interconnection agreements, and commission approval and continuing review of interconnection terms and conditions (called [s]tatements of generally available terms, §252(f)) filed by LECs.  Section 252(e)(6) provides, in relevant part: In any case in which a State commission makes a determination under this section, any party aggrieved by such determination may bring an action in an appropriate Federal district court to determine whether the agreement or statement meets the requirements of section 251 of this title and this section.  The determination at issue here is neither the approval or disapproval of a negotiated agreement nor the approval or disapproval of a statement of generally available terms.  WorldCom, Verizon, and the United States argue, however, that a state commissions authority under §252 implicitly encompasses the authority to interpret and enforce an interconnection agreement that the commission has approved,
				<a name="ZO-2ref" href="#ZO-2" class="">

                </sup>
            </a>
				 and that an interpretation or enforcement decision is therefore a determination under [§252] subject to federal review.  Whether the text of §252(e)(6) can be so construed is a question we need not decide.  For we agree with the parties alternative contention, that even if §252(e)(6) does not 
				<em>
					confer
				</em>
				 jurisdiction, it at least does not 
				<em>
					divest
				</em>
				 the district courts of their authority under 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1331.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1331</a> to review the Commissions order for compliance with federal law.

				Verizon alleged in its complaint that the Commission violated the Act and the FCC ruling when it ordered payment of reciprocal compensation for ISP-bound calls.  Verizon sought a declaratory judgment that the Commissions order was unlawful, and an injunction prohibiting its enforcement.  We have no doubt that federal courts have jurisdiction under §1331 to entertain such a suit.  Verizon seeks relief from the Commissions order on the ground that such regulation is pre-empted by a federal statute which, by virtue of the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, must prevail, and its claim thus presents a federal question which the federal courts have jurisdiction under 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1331.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1331</a> to resolve.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Commission contends that since the Act does not create a private cause of action to challenge the Commissions order, there is no jurisdiction to entertain such a suit.  We need express no opinion on the premise of this argument.  It is firmly established in our cases that the absence of a valid (as opposed to arguable) cause of action does not implicate subject-matter jurisdiction, 
				<em>
					i.e.,
				</em>
				 the courts statutory or constitutional 
				<em>
					power 
				</em>
				to adjudicate the case.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">89</a> (1998)
.  As we have said, the district court has jurisdiction if the right of the petitioners to recover under their complaint will be sustained if the Constitution and laws of the United States are given one construction and will be defeated if they are given another, unless the claim clearly appears to be immaterial and made solely for the purpose of obtaining jurisdiction or where such a claim is wholly insubstantial and frivolous.   
				<em>
					Ibid. 
				</em>
				(citation omitted).  Here, resolution of Verizons claim turns on whether the Act, or an FCC ruling issued thereunder, precludes the Commission from ordering payment of reciprocal compensation, and there is no suggestion that Verizons claim is  immaterial  or  wholly insubstantial and frivolous.   Ibid.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				Verizons claim thus falls within 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1331.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1331</a>s general grant of jurisdiction, and contrary to the Fourth Circuits conclusion, nothing in 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/47/252.html#e_6" class="subref" title="subref">47 U. S. C. §252(e)(6)</a> purports to strip this jurisdiction.  Section 252(e)(6) provides for federal review of an agreement when a state commission makes a determination under [§252].  If this does not include (as WorldCom, Verizon, and the United States claim it does) the interpretation or enforcement of an interconnection agreement, then §252(e)(6) merely makes some other 
				actions by state commissions reviewable in federal court.  This is not enough to eliminate jurisdiction under §1331.  Although the situation is not precisely  parallel (in that here the elimination of federal district-court review would not amount to the elimination of all review), we think what we said in 
				<em>
					Abbott Laboratories
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Gardner,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/387/136" class="subref" title="subref">387 U. S. 136</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">141</a> (1967)
, is nonetheless apt: The mere fact that some acts are made reviewable should not suffice to support an implication of exclusion as to others.  (Internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  And here there is nothing more than that mere fact.  Section 252 does not establish a distinctive review mechanism for the commission actions that it covers (the mechanism is the same as §1331: district-court review), and it does not distinctively limit the substantive relief available.  Cf. 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Fausto,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/484/439" class="subref" title="subref">484 U. S. 439</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">448</a>449 (1988)
.  Indeed, it does not even mention subject-matter jurisdiction, but reads like the conferral of a private right of action ([A]ny party aggrieved by such determination may bring an action in an appropriate Federal district court, §252(e)(6)).  Cf. 
				<em>
					Steel Co.
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 supra,
				</em>
				 at 9091 (even a statutory provision that uses the word jurisdiction may not relate to subject-matter jurisdiction); see also 
				<em>
					Davis
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				And finally, none of the other provisions of the Act evince any intent to preclude federal review of a commission determination.  If anything, they reinforce the conclusion that §252(e)(6)s silence on the subject leaves the jurisdictional grant of §1331 untouched.  For where otherwise applicable jurisdiction was meant to be excluded, it was excluded expressly.  Section 252(e)(4) provides: No State court shall have jurisdiction to review the action of a State commission in approving or rejecting an agreement under this section.  In sum, nothing in the Act displays any intent to withdraw federal jurisdiction under §1331; we will not presume that the statute means what it neither says nor fairly implies.

				The Fourth Circuit suggested that Verizons claim could not be brought under 
				<em>
					Ex parte Young
				</em>
				, because the Commissions order was probably 
				<em>
					not 
				</em>
				inconsistent with federal law after all.  240 F. 3d, at 295297.  The court noted that the FCC ruling relied upon by Verizon does not seem to require compensation for ISP traffic; that the Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit has vacated the ruling; and that the Commission interpreted the interconnection agreement under state contract-law principles.  It may (or may not) be true that the FCCs since-vacated ruling does not support Verizons claim; it may (or may not) also be true that state contract law, and not federal law as Verizon contends, applies to disputes regarding the interpretation of Verizons agreement.  But the inquiry into whether suit lies under 
				<em>
					Ex parte Young 
				</em>
				does not include an analysis of the merits of the claim.  See 
				<em>
					Coeur dAlene,
				</em>
            <em>

				</em>
				 at 281 (An

					allegation

				Nor does the 1996 Act display any intent to foreclose jurisdiction under

Congress had specified the means to enforce that duty in §2710(d)(7), a provision intended … not only to define, but also to limit significantly, the duty imposed by §2710(d)(3).  517 U. S., at 74.  The intricate procedures set forth in that provision prescribed that a court could issue an order directing the State to negotiate, that it could require the State to submit to mediation, and that it could order that the Secretary of the Interior be notified.

That section provides only that when state commissions make certain determinations, an aggrieved party may bring suit in federal court to establish compliance with the requirements of §§251 and 252.  Even with regard to the determinations that it covers, it places no restriction on the relief a court can award.  And it does not even say whom the suit is to be brought againstthe state commission, the individual commissioners, or the carriers benefiting from the state commissions order.  The mere fact that Congress has authorized federal courts to review whether the Commissions action complies with §§251 and 252 does not without more impose upon the State a liability that is significantly more limited than would be the liability imposed upon the state officer under

						 Section 1.61 of the interconnection agreement provides:  Reciprocal Compensation is As Described in the Act, and refers to the payment arrangements that recover costs incurred for the transport and termination of Local Traffic originating on one Partys network and terminating on the other Partys network.  In turn, §1.44 defines  Local Traffic  as traffic that is originated by a Customer of one Party on that Partys network and terminates to a Customer of the other Party on that other Partys network, within a given local calling area, or expanded area service (EAS) area, as defined in [Bell Atlantics] effective Customer tariffs.

				The Telecommunications Act of 1996 (1996 Act or Act), Pub. L. 104104, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">110</a>Stat.
56, created a new telecommunications regime designed to foster competition in local telephone markets.  Toward that end, the Act imposed various obligations on incumbent local-exchange carriers (LECs), including a duty to share their networks with competitors.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/47/251.html#c" class="subref" title="subref">47 U. S. C. §251(c)</a> (1994 ed., Supp. V).  When a new entrant seeks access to a market, the incumbent LEC must provide … interconnection with the incumbents existing network, §251(c)(2), and the carriers must then establish reciprocal compensation arrangements for transporting and terminating the calls placed by each others customers,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				§251(b)(5).  As we have previously described, see 
				<em>
					AT&amp;T Corp.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Iowa Utilities Bd., 
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/525/366" class="subref" title="subref">525 U. S. 366</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">371</a>373 (1999)
, an incumbent LEC may negotiate and enter into a binding agreement with the new entrant to fulfill the duties imposed by §§251(b) and (c), but without regard to the standards set forth in those provisions.  §§252(a)(1), 251(c)(1).  That agreement must be submitted to the state commission for approval,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				§252(e)(1), which may reject it if it discriminates against a carrier not a party or is not consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity, §252(e)(2)(A).

				As required by the Act, the incumbent LEC in Maryland, petitioner Verizon Maryland Inc., formerly known as Bell Atlantic Maryland, Inc., negotiated an interconnection agreement with competitors, including MFS Intelenet of Maryland, later acquired by respondent MCI WorldCom, Inc.  The Maryland Public Service Commission (Commission) approved the agreement.  Six months later, Verizon informed WorldCom that it would no longer pay reciprocal compensation for telephone calls made by Verizons customers to the local access numbers of Internet Service Providers (ISPs), claiming that ISP traffic was not local traffic
				<a name="ZO-1ref" href="#ZO-1" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>

				</b>
                </sup>
            </a>
				 subject to the reciprocal compensation agreement because ISPs connect customers to distant Web sites.  WorldCom disputed Verizons claim and filed a complaint with the Commission.  The Commission found in favor of WorldCom, ordering Verizon to timely forward all future interconnection payments owed [WorldCom] for telephone calls placed to an ISP and to pay WorldCom any reciprocal compensation that it had withheld pending resolution of the dispute.  Verizon appealed to a Maryland state court, which affirmed the order.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Subsequently, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued a rulinglater vacated by the Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit, see 
				<em>
					Bell Atlantic Tel. Cos. 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					FCC
				</em>
				, 206 F. 3d 1 (2000)which categorized ISP-bound calls as nonlocal for purposes of reciprocal compensation but concluded that, absent a federal compensation mechanism for those calls, state commissions could construe interconnection agreements as requiring reciprocal compensation.  Verizon filed a new complaint with the Commission, arguing that the FCC ruling established that Verizon was no longer required to provide reciprocal compensation for ISP traffic.  In a 3-to-2 decision, the Commission rejected this contention, concluding that, as a matter of state contract law, WorldCom and Verizon had agreed to treat ISP-bound calls as local traffic subject to reciprocal compensation.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Verizon filed an action in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, citing 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/47/252.html#e_6" class="subref" title="subref">47 U. S. C. §252(e)(6)</a> and 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1331.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1331</a> as the basis for jurisdiction, and naming as defendants the Commission, its individual members in their official capacities, WorldCom, and other competing LECs.  In its complaint, Verizon sought declaratory and injunctive relief from the Commissions order, alleging that the determination that Verizon must pay reciprocal compensation to WorldCom for ISP traffic violated the 1996 Act and the FCC ruling.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				
				The District Court dismissed the action, and a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed.  240 F. 3d 279 (2001).  The Fourth Circuit held that the Commission had not waived its immunity from suit by voluntarily participating in the regulatory scheme set up under the 1996 Act, and that the doctrine of 
				<em>

				WorldCom, Verizon, and the United States contend that 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/47/252.html#e_6" class="subref" title="subref">47 U. S. C. §252(e)(6)</a> and 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1331.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1331</a> independently grant federal courts subject-matter jurisdiction to determine whether the Commissions order requiring that Verizon pay WorldCom reciprocal compensation for ISP-bound calls violates the 1996 Act.  Section 252 sets forth procedures relating to formation and commission approval of interconnection agreements, and commission approval and continuing review of interconnection terms and conditions (called [s]tatements of generally available terms, §252(f)) filed by LECs.  Section 252(e)(6) provides, in relevant part: In any case in which a State commission makes a determination under this section, any party aggrieved by such determination may bring an action in an appropriate Federal district court to determine whether the agreement or statement meets the requirements of section 251 of this title and this section.  The determination at issue here is neither the approval or disapproval of a negotiated agreement nor the approval or disapproval of a statement of generally available terms.  WorldCom, Verizon, and the United States argue, however, that a state commissions authority under §252 implicitly encompasses the authority to interpret and enforce an interconnection agreement that the commission has approved,
				<a name="ZO-2ref" href="#ZO-2" class="">

                </sup>
            </a>
				 and that an interpretation or enforcement decision is therefore a determination under [§252] subject to federal review.  Whether the text of §252(e)(6) can be so construed is a question we need not decide.  For we agree with the parties alternative contention, that even if §252(e)(6) does not 
				<em>
					confer
				</em>
				 jurisdiction, it at least does not 
				<em>
					divest
				</em>
				 the district courts of their authority under 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1331.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1331</a> to review the Commissions order for compliance with federal law.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Verizon alleged in its complaint that the Commission violated the Act and the FCC ruling when it ordered payment of reciprocal compensation for ISP-bound calls.  Verizon sought a declaratory judgment that the Commissions order was unlawful, and an injunction prohibiting its enforcement.  We have no doubt that federal courts have jurisdiction under §1331 to entertain such a suit.  Verizon seeks relief from the Commissions order on the ground that such regulation is pre-empted by a federal statute which, by virtue of the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, must prevail, and its claim thus presents a federal question which the federal courts have jurisdiction under 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1331.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1331</a> to resolve.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Commission contends that since the Act does not create a private cause of action to challenge the Commissions order, there is no jurisdiction to entertain such a suit.  We need express no opinion on the premise of this argument.  It is firmly established in our cases that the absence of a valid (as opposed to arguable) cause of action does not implicate subject-matter jurisdiction, 
				<em>
					i.e.,
				</em>
				 the courts statutory or constitutional 
				<em>
					power 
				</em>
				to adjudicate the case.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">89</a> (1998)
.  As we have said, the district court has jurisdiction if the right of the petitioners to recover under their complaint will be sustained if the Constitution and laws of the United States are given one construction and will be defeated if they are given another, unless the claim clearly appears to be immaterial and made solely for the purpose of obtaining jurisdiction or where such a claim is wholly insubstantial and frivolous.   
				<em>
					Ibid. 
				</em>
				(citation omitted).  Here, resolution of Verizons claim turns on whether the Act, or an FCC ruling issued thereunder, precludes the Commission from ordering payment of reciprocal compensation, and there is no suggestion that Verizons claim is  immaterial  or  wholly insubstantial and frivolous.   Ibid.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				Verizons claim thus falls within 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1331.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1331</a>s general grant of jurisdiction, and contrary to the Fourth Circuits conclusion, nothing in 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/47/252.html#e_6" class="subref" title="subref">47 U. S. C. §252(e)(6)</a> purports to strip this jurisdiction.  Section 252(e)(6) provides for federal review of an agreement when a state commission makes a determination under [§252].  If this does not include (as WorldCom, Verizon, and the United States claim it does) the interpretation or enforcement of an interconnection agreement, then §252(e)(6) merely makes some other 
				actions by state commissions reviewable in federal court.  This is not enough to eliminate jurisdiction under §1331.  Although the situation is not precisely  parallel (in that here the elimination of federal district-court review would not amount to the elimination of all review), we think what we said in 
				<em>
					Abbott Laboratories
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Gardner,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/387/136" class="subref" title="subref">387 U. S. 136</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">141</a> (1967)
, is nonetheless apt: The mere fact that some acts are made reviewable should not suffice to support an implication of exclusion as to others.  (Internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  And here there is nothing more than that mere fact.  Section 252 does not establish a distinctive review mechanism for the commission actions that it covers (the mechanism is the same as §1331: district-court review), and it does not distinctively limit the substantive relief available.  Cf. 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Fausto,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/484/439" class="subref" title="subref">484 U. S. 439</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">448</a>449 (1988)
.  Indeed, it does not even mention subject-matter jurisdiction, but reads like the conferral of a private right of action ([A]ny party aggrieved by such determination may bring an action in an appropriate Federal district court, §252(e)(6)).  Cf. 
				<em>
					Steel Co.
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 supra,
				</em>
				 at 9091 (even a statutory provision that uses the word jurisdiction may not relate to subject-matter jurisdiction); see also 
				<em>

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				And finally, none of the other provisions of the Act evince any intent to preclude federal review of a commission determination.  If anything, they reinforce the conclusion that §252(e)(6)s silence on the subject leaves the jurisdictional grant of §1331 untouched.  For where otherwise applicable jurisdiction was meant to be excluded, it was excluded expressly.  Section 252(e)(4) provides: No State court shall have jurisdiction to review the action of a State commission in approving or rejecting an agreement under this section.  In sum, nothing in the Act displays any intent to withdraw federal jurisdiction under §1331; we will not presume that the statute means what it neither says nor fairly implies.

				The Fourth Circuit suggested that Verizons claim could not be brought under 
				<em>
					Ex parte Young
				</em>
				, because the Commissions order was probably 
				<em>
					not 
				</em>
				inconsistent with federal law after all.  240 F. 3d, at 295297.  The court noted that the FCC ruling relied upon by Verizon does not seem to require compensation for ISP traffic; that the Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit has vacated the ruling; and that the Commission interpreted the interconnection agreement under state contract-law principles.  It may (or may not) be true that the FCCs since-vacated ruling does not support Verizons claim; it may (or may not) also be true that state contract law, and not federal law as Verizon contends, applies to disputes regarding the interpretation of Verizons agreement.  But the inquiry into whether suit lies under 
				<em>
					Ex parte Young 
				</em>
				does not include an analysis of the merits of the claim.  See 
				<em>
					Coeur dAlene,
				</em>
            <em>

				Nor does the 1996 Act display any intent to foreclose jurisdiction under

Congress had specified the means to enforce that duty in §2710(d)(7), a provision intended … not only to define, but also to limit significantly, the duty imposed by §2710(d)(3).  517 U. S., at 74.  The intricate procedures set forth in that provision prescribed that a court could issue an order directing the State to negotiate, that it could require the State to submit to mediation, and that it could order that the Secretary of the Interior be notified.  
				<em>

				 at 7475.  We concluded that this quite modest set of sanctions displayed an intent not to provide the more complete and more immediate relief that would otherwise be available under 
				<em>

				</em>
				.  517 U. S., at 75.  Permitting suit under 
				<em>
					Ex parte Young
				</em>
				 was thus inconsistent with the detailed remedial scheme, 517 U. S., at 74and the limited onethat Congress had prescribed to enforce the States statutory duty to negotiate.  The Commissions argument that §252(e)(6) constitutes a detailed and exclusive remedial scheme like the one in 
				<em>
					Seminole Tribe
				</em>
				, implicitly excluding 
				<em>
					Ex parte Young
				</em>
				 actions, is without merit.  That section provides only that when state commissions make certain determinations, an aggrieved party may bring suit in federal court to establish compliance with the requirements of §§251 and 252.  Even with regard to the determinations that it covers, it places no restriction on the relief a court can award.  And it does not even say whom the suit is to be brought againstthe state commission, the individual commissioners, or the carriers benefiting from the state commissions order.  The mere fact that Congress has authorized federal courts to review whether the Commissions action complies with §§251 and 252 does not without more impose upon the State a liability that is significantly more limited than would be the liability imposed upon the state officer under 
				<em>

						 Section 1.61 of the interconnection agreement provides:  Reciprocal Compensation is As Described in the Act, and refers to the payment arrangements that recover costs incurred for the transport and termination of Local Traffic originating on one Partys network and terminating on the other Partys network.  In turn, §1.44 defines  Local Traffic  as traffic that is originated by a Customer of one Party on that Partys network and terminates to a Customer of the other Party on that other Partys network, within a given local calling area, or expanded area service (EAS) area, as defined in [Bell Atlantics] effective Customer tariffs.

				The Telecommunications Act of 1996 (1996 Act or Act), Pub. L. 104104, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">110</a>Stat.
56, created a new telecommunications regime designed to foster competition in local telephone markets.  Toward that end, the Act imposed various obligations on incumbent local-exchange carriers (LECs), including a duty to share their networks with competitors.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/47/251.html#c" class="subref" title="subref">47 U. S. C. §251(c)</a> (1994 ed., Supp. V).  When a new entrant seeks access to a market, the incumbent LEC must provide … interconnection with the incumbents existing network, §251(c)(2), and the carriers must then establish reciprocal compensation arrangements for transporting and terminating the calls placed by each others customers,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				§251(b)(5).  As we have previously described, see 
				<em>
					AT&amp;T Corp.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Iowa Utilities Bd., 
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/525/366" class="subref" title="subref">525 U. S. 366</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">371</a>373 (1999)
, an incumbent LEC may negotiate and enter into a binding agreement with the new entrant to fulfill the duties imposed by §§251(b) and (c), but without regard to the standards set forth in those provisions.  §§252(a)(1), 251(c)(1).  That agreement must be submitted to the state commission for approval,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				§252(e)(1), which may reject it if it discriminates against a carrier not a party or is not consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity, §252(e)(2)(A).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				As required by the Act, the incumbent LEC in Maryland, petitioner Verizon Maryland Inc., formerly known as Bell Atlantic Maryland, Inc., negotiated an interconnection agreement with competitors, including MFS Intelenet of Maryland, later acquired by respondent MCI WorldCom, Inc.  The Maryland Public Service Commission (Commission) approved the agreement.  Six months later, Verizon informed WorldCom that it would no longer pay reciprocal compensation for telephone calls made by Verizons customers to the local access numbers of Internet Service Providers (ISPs), claiming that ISP traffic was not local traffic
				<a name="ZO-1ref" href="#ZO-1" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>
					1
				</b>
                </sup>
            </a>
				 subject to the reciprocal compensation agreement because ISPs connect customers to distant Web sites.  WorldCom disputed Verizons claim and filed a complaint with the Commission.  The Commission found in favor of WorldCom, ordering Verizon to timely forward all future interconnection payments owed [WorldCom] for telephone calls placed to an ISP and to pay WorldCom any reciprocal compensation that it had withheld pending resolution of the dispute.  Verizon appealed to a Maryland state court, which affirmed the order.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Subsequently, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued a rulinglater vacated by the Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit, see 
				<em>
					Bell Atlantic Tel. Cos. 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					FCC
				</em>
				, 206 F. 3d 1 (2000)which categorized ISP-bound calls as nonlocal for purposes of reciprocal compensation but concluded that, absent a federal compensation mechanism for those calls, state commissions could construe interconnection agreements as requiring reciprocal compensation.  Verizon filed a new complaint with the Commission, arguing that the FCC ruling established that Verizon was no longer required to provide reciprocal compensation for ISP traffic.  In a 3-to-2 decision, the Commission rejected this contention, concluding that, as a matter of state contract law, WorldCom and Verizon had agreed to treat ISP-bound calls as local traffic subject to reciprocal compensation.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Verizon filed an action in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, citing 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/47/252.html#e_6" class="subref" title="subref">47 U. S. C. §252(e)(6)</a> and 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1331.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1331</a> as the basis for jurisdiction, and naming as defendants the Commission, its individual members in their official capacities, WorldCom, and other competing LECs.  In its complaint, Verizon sought declaratory and injunctive relief from the Commissions order, alleging that the determination that Verizon must pay reciprocal compensation to WorldCom for ISP traffic violated the 1996 Act and the FCC ruling.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				
				The District Court dismissed the action, and a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed.  240 F. 3d 279 (2001).  The Fourth Circuit held that the Commission had not waived its immunity from suit by voluntarily participating in the regulatory scheme set up under the 1996 Act, and that the doctrine of 
				<em>
					Ex parte Young,

            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/209/123" class="subref" title="subref">209 U. S. 123</a> (1908)

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1331.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1331</a> independently grant federal courts subject-matter jurisdiction to determine whether the Commissions order requiring that Verizon pay WorldCom reciprocal compensation for ISP-bound calls violates the 1996 Act.  Section 252 sets forth procedures relating to formation and commission approval of interconnection agreements, and commission approval and continuing review of interconnection terms and conditions (called [s]tatements of generally available terms, §252(f)) filed by LECs.  Section 252(e)(6) provides, in relevant part: In any case in which a State commission makes a determination under this section, any party aggrieved by such determination may bring an action in an appropriate Federal district court to determine whether the agreement or statement meets the requirements of section 251 of this title and this section.  The determination at issue here is neither the approval or disapproval of a negotiated agreement nor the approval or disapproval of a statement of generally available terms.  WorldCom, Verizon, and the United States argue, however, that a state commissions authority under §252 implicitly encompasses the authority to interpret and enforce an interconnection agreement that the commission has approved,
				<a name="ZO-2ref" href="#ZO-2" class="">

            </a>
				 and that an interpretation or enforcement decision is therefore a determination under [§252] subject to federal review.  Whether the text of §252(e)(6) can be so construed is a question we need not decide.  For we agree with the parties alternative contention, that even if §252(e)(6) does not 
				<em>
					confer
				</em>
				 jurisdiction, it at least does not 
				<em>
					divest

				Verizon alleged in its complaint that the Commission violated the Act and the FCC ruling when it ordered payment of reciprocal compensation for ISP-bound calls.  Verizon sought a declaratory judgment that the Commissions order was unlawful, and an injunction prohibiting its enforcement.  We have no doubt that federal courts have jurisdiction under §1331 to entertain such a suit.  Verizon seeks relief from the Commissions order on the ground that such regulation is pre-empted by a federal statute which, by virtue of the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, must prevail, and its claim thus presents a federal question which the federal courts have jurisdiction under

				The Commission contends that since the Act does not create a private cause of action to challenge the Commissions order, there is no jurisdiction to entertain such a suit.  We need express no opinion on the premise of this argument.  It is firmly established in our cases that the absence of a valid (as opposed to arguable) cause of action does not implicate subject-matter jurisdiction,

.  As we have said, the district court has jurisdiction if the right of the petitioners to recover under their complaint will be sustained if the Constitution and laws of the United States are given one construction and will be defeated if they are given another, unless the claim clearly appears to be immaterial and made solely for the purpose of obtaining jurisdiction or where such a claim is wholly insubstantial and frivolous.   
				<em>

				</em>
				(citation omitted).  Here, resolution of Verizons claim turns on whether the Act, or an FCC ruling issued thereunder, precludes the Commission from ordering payment of reciprocal compensation, and there is no suggestion that Verizons claim is  immaterial  or  wholly insubstantial and frivolous.   Ibid.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1331.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1331</a>s general grant of jurisdiction, and contrary to the Fourth Circuits conclusion, nothing in

Section 252(e)(6) provides for federal review of an agreement when a state commission makes a determination under [§252].  If this does not include (as WorldCom, Verizon, and the United States claim it does) the interpretation or enforcement of an interconnection agreement, then §252(e)(6) merely makes some other 
				actions by state commissions reviewable in federal court.  This is not enough to eliminate jurisdiction under §1331.  Although the situation is not precisely  parallel (in that here the elimination of federal district-court review would not amount to the elimination of all review), we think what we said in 
				<em>
					Abbott Laboratories
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Gardner,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/387/136" class="subref" title="subref">387 U. S. 136</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">141</a> (1967)
, is nonetheless apt: The mere fact that some acts are made reviewable should not suffice to support an implication of exclusion as to others.  (Internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  And here there is nothing more than that mere fact.  Section 252 does not establish a distinctive review mechanism for the commission actions that it covers (the mechanism is the same as §1331: district-court review), and it does not distinctively limit the substantive relief available.  Cf. 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Fausto,
				</em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">448</a>449 (1988)
.  Indeed, it does not even mention subject-matter jurisdiction, but reads like the conferral of a private right of action ([A]ny party aggrieved by such determination may bring an action in an appropriate Federal district court, §252(e)(6)).  Cf. 
				<em>
					Steel Co.
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 supra,
				</em>
				 at 9091 (even a statutory provision that uses the word jurisdiction may not relate to subject-matter jurisdiction); see also

				And finally, none of the other provisions of the Act evince any intent to preclude federal review of a commission determination.  If anything, they reinforce the conclusion that §252(e)(6)s silence on the subject leaves the jurisdictional grant of §1331 untouched.  For where otherwise applicable jurisdiction was meant to be excluded, it was excluded expressly.  Section 252(e)(4) provides: No State court shall have jurisdiction to review the action of a State commission in approving or rejecting an agreement under this section.  In sum, nothing in the Act displays any intent to withdraw federal jurisdiction under §1331; we will not presume that the statute means what it neither says nor fairly implies.

				, ineffectiveness of the Commissions action, so that the past financial liability of private parties may be affected.  But no past liability of the State, or of any of its commissioners, is at issue.  It does not impose

				The Fourth Circuit suggested that Verizons claim could not be brought under 
				<em>
					Ex parte Young
				</em>
				, because the Commissions order was probably 
				<em>
					not 
				</em>
				inconsistent with federal law after all.  240 F. 3d, at 295297.  The court noted that the FCC ruling relied upon by Verizon does not seem to require compensation for ISP traffic; that the Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit has vacated the ruling; and that the Commission interpreted the interconnection agreement under state contract-law principles.  It may (or may not) be true that the FCCs since-vacated ruling does not support Verizons claim; it may (or may not) also be true that state contract law, and not federal law as Verizon contends, applies to disputes regarding the interpretation of Verizons agreement.  But the inquiry into whether suit lies under 
				<em>
					Ex parte Young 
				</em>
				does not include an analysis of the merits of the claim.  See 
				<em>
					Coeur dAlene,
				</em>
            <em>

				 at 281 (An

				Nor does the 1996 Act display any intent to foreclose jurisdiction under 
				<em>
					Ex parte Young
				</em>
				as we concluded the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act did in 
				<em>

				</em>
				 v.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/25/2710.html#d_3" class="subref" title="subref">25 U. S. C. §2710(d)(3)</a>.  Congress had specified the means to enforce that duty in §2710(d)(7), a provision intended … not only to define, but also to limit significantly, the duty imposed by §2710(d)(3).  517 U. S., at 74.  The intricate procedures set forth in that provision prescribed that a court could issue an order directing the State to negotiate, that it could require the State to submit to mediation, and that it could order that the Secretary of the Interior be notified.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 7475.  We concluded that this quite modest set of sanctions displayed an intent not to provide the more complete and more immediate relief that would otherwise be available under 
				<em>
					Ex parte Young
				</em>
				.  517 U. S., at 75.  Permitting suit under 
				<em>
					Ex parte Young
				</em>
				 was thus inconsistent with the detailed remedial scheme, 517 U. S., at 74and the limited onethat Congress had prescribed to enforce the States statutory duty to negotiate.  The Commissions argument that §252(e)(6) constitutes a detailed and exclusive remedial scheme like the one in 
				<em>
					Seminole Tribe
				</em>
				, implicitly excluding 
				<em>
					Ex parte Young
				</em>
				 actions, is without merit.  That section provides only that when state commissions make certain determinations, an aggrieved party may bring suit in federal court to establish compliance with the requirements of §§251 and 252.  Even with regard to the determinations that it covers, it places no restriction on the relief a court can award.  And it does not even say whom the suit is to be brought againstthe state commission, the individual commissioners, or the carriers benefiting from the state commissions order.  The mere fact that Congress has authorized federal courts to review whether the Commissions action complies with §§251 and 252 does not without more impose upon the State a liability that is significantly more limited than would be the liability imposed upon the state officer under

						 Section 1.61 of the interconnection agreement provides:  Reciprocal Compensation is As Described in the Act, and refers to the payment arrangements that recover costs incurred for the transport and termination of Local Traffic originating on one Partys network and terminating on the other Partys network.  In turn, §1.44 defines  Local Traffic  as traffic that is originated by a Customer of one Party on that Partys network and terminates to a Customer of the other Party on that other Partys network, within a given local calling area, or expanded area service (EAS) area, as defined in [Bell Atlantics] effective Customer tariffs.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1331.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1331</a> is a grant of original jurisdiction, and does not authorize district courts to exercise appellate jurisdiction over state-court judgments, which Congress has reserved to this Court, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1257.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1257(a)</a>.  The doctrine has no application to judicial review of executive action, including determinations made by a state administrative agency.

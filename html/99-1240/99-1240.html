				Prejudice, we are beginning to understand, rises not from malice or hostile animus alone.  It may result as well from insensitivity caused by simple want of careful, rational reflection or from some instinctive mechanism to guard against people who appear to be different in some respects from ourselves.  Quite apart from any historical documentation, knowledge of our own human instincts teaches that persons who find it difficult to perform routine functions by reason of some mental or physical impairment might at first seem unsettling to us, unless we are guided by the better angels of our nature.  There can be little doubt, then, that persons with mental or physical impairments are confronted with prejudice which can stem from indifference or insecurity as well as from malicious ill will.

				One of the undoubted achievements of statutes designed to assist those with impairments is that citizens have an incentive, flowing from a legal duty, to develop a better understanding, a more decent perspective, for accepting persons with impairments or disabilities into the larger society.  The law works this way because the law can be a teacher.  So I do not doubt that the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 will be a milestone on the path to a more decent, tolerant, progressive society.

				It is a question of quite a different order, however, to say that the States in their official capacities, the States as governmental entities, must be held in violation of the Constitution on the assumption that they embody the misconceived or malicious perceptions of some of their citizens.  It is a most serious charge to say a State has engaged in a pattern or practice designed to deny its citizens the equal protection of the laws, particularly where the accusation is based not on hostility but instead on the failure to act or the omission to remedy.  States can, and do, stand apart from the citizenry.  States act as neutral entities, ready to take instruction and to enact laws when their citizens so demand.  The failure of a State to revise policies now seen as incorrect under a new understanding of proper policy does not always constitute the purposeful and intentional action required to make out a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.

				Prejudice, we are beginning to understand, rises not from malice or hostile animus alone.  It may result as well from insensitivity caused by simple want of careful, rational reflection or from some instinctive mechanism to guard against people who appear to be different in some respects from ourselves.  Quite apart from any historical documentation, knowledge of our own human instincts teaches that persons who find it difficult to perform routine functions by reason of some mental or physical impairment might at first seem unsettling to us, unless we are guided by the better angels of our nature.  There can be little doubt, then, that persons with mental or physical impairments are confronted with prejudice which can stem from indifference or insecurity as well as from malicious ill will.

				One of the undoubted achievements of statutes designed to assist those with impairments is that citizens have an incentive, flowing from a legal duty, to develop a better understanding, a more decent perspective, for accepting persons with impairments or disabilities into the larger society.

So I do not doubt that the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 will be a milestone on the path to a more decent, tolerant, progressive society.

				Prejudice, we are beginning to understand, rises not from malice or hostile animus alone.  It may result as well from insensitivity caused by simple want of careful, rational reflection or from some instinctive mechanism to guard against people who appear to be different in some respects from ourselves.  Quite apart from any historical documentation, knowledge of our own human instincts teaches that persons who find it difficult to perform routine functions by reason of some mental or physical impairment might at first seem unsettling to us, unless we are guided by the better angels of our nature.  There can be little doubt, then, that persons with mental or physical impairments are confronted with prejudice which can stem from indifference or insecurity as well as from malicious ill will.

				One of the undoubted achievements of statutes designed to assist those with impairments is that citizens have an incentive, flowing from a legal duty, to develop a better understanding, a more decent perspective, for accepting persons with impairments or disabilities into the larger society.

				The Court says that its primary problem with this statutory provision is one of legislative evidence.  It says that Congress assembled only …  minimal evidence of unconstitutional state discrimination in employment.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 12.  In fact, Congress compiled a vast legislative record documenting  massive, society-wide discrimination  against persons with disabilities.  S. Rep. No. 101116, pp. 89 (1989) (quoting testimony of Justin Dart, chairperson of the Task Force on the Rights and Empowerment of Americans with Disabilities).  In addition to the information presented at 13 congressional hearings (see Appendix A, 
				<em>
					infra
				</em>
				), and its own prior experience gathered over 40 years during which it contemplated and enacted considerable similar legislation (see Appendix B, 
				<em>
					infra
				</em>
				), Congress created a special task force to assess the need for comprehensive legislation.  That task force held hearings in every State, attended by more than 30,000 people, including thousands who had experienced discrimination first hand.  See From ADA to Empowerment, Task Force on the Rights and Empowerment of Americans with Disabilities, 16 (Oct. 12, 1990) (hereinafter Task Force Report).  The task force hearings, Congress own hearings, and an analysis of census data, national polls, and other studies led Congress to conclude that people with disabilities, as a group, occupy an inferior status in our society, and are severely disadvantaged socially, vocationally, economically, and educationally.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/12101.html#a_6" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §12101(a)(6)</a>.  As to employment, Congress found that [t]wo-thirds of all disabled Americans between the age of 16 and 64 [were] not working at all, even though a large majority wanted to, and were able to, work productively.  S. Rep. No. 101116, at 9.  And Congress found that this discrimination flowed in significant part from stereotypic assumptions as well as purposeful unequal treatment.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/12101.html#a_7" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §12101(a)(7)</a>.

				The powerful evidence of discriminatory treatment throughout society in general, including discrimination by private persons and local governments, implicates state governments as well, for state agencies form part of that same larger society.  There is no particular reason to believe that they are immune from the stereotypic assumptions and pattern of purposeful unequal treatment that Congress found prevalent.  The Court claims that it make[s] no sense to take into consideration constitutional violations committed by local governments.  
				<em>
					Ante

				, at 71.  But the substantive obligation that the Equal Protection Clause creates applies to state and local governmental entities alike.

.  Local governments often work closely with, and under the supervision of, state officials, and in general, state and local government employers are similarly situated.  Nor is determining whether an apparently local entity is entitled to 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxi" class="subref" title="subref">Eleventh Amendment</a> immunity as simple as the majority suggestsit often requires a  detailed examination of the relevant provisions of [state] law. 

				The congressionally appointed task force collected numerous specific examples, provided by persons with disabilities themselves, of adverse, disparate treatment by state officials.  They reveal, not what the Court describes as half a dozen instances of discrimination, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 11, but hundreds of instances of adverse treatment at the hands of state officialsinstances in which a person with a disability found it impossible to obtain a state job, to retain state employment, to use the public transportation that was readily available to others in order to get to work, or to obtain a public education, which is often a prerequisite to obtaining employment.  State-imposed barriers also frequently made it difficult or impossible for people to vote, to enter a public building, to access important government services, such as calling for emergency assistance, and to find a place to live due to a pattern of irrational zoning decisions similar to the discrimination that we held unconstitutional in 
				<em>
					Cleburne,
				</em>
				 473 U. S., at 448.  See Appendix C, infra.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				As the Court notes, those who presented instances of discrimination rarely provided additional, independent evidence sufficient to prove in court that, in each instance, the discrimination they suffered lacked justification from a judicial standpoint.  Ante
				, at 12 (stating that instances of discrimination are described out of context).  Perhaps this explains the Courts view that there is minimal evidence of unconstitutional state discrimination.  
				<em>
					Ibid.  
				</em>
				But a legislature is not a court of law.  And Congress, unlike courts, must, and does, routinely draw general conclusionsfor example, of likely motive or of likely relationship to legitimate needfrom anecdotal and opinion-based evidence of this kind, particularly when the evidence lacks strong refutation.  See Task Force Report 16, 20 (task force met many times with significant representatives of groups opposed to [the] ADA, and as to the general public, although the task force received about 2,000 letters in support of the ADA, there was only one letter in opposition); S. Rep. No. 101116, at 10 (summarizing testimony that many reasonable accommodations cost less than $50, and the expense of others, such as hiring employees who can interpret for the deaf, is frequently exaggerated).  In reviewing §5 legislation, we have never required the sort of extensive investigation of each piece of evidence that the Court appears to contemplate.  Compare 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1213, with 
				<em>
					Katzenbach

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">652</a>656 (1966)
 (asking whether Congress likely conclusions were reasonable, not whether there was adequate evidentiary support in the record).  Nor has the Court traditionally required Congress to make findings as to state discrimination, or to break down the record evidence, category by category.  Compare 
				<em>
					ante, 
				</em>
				at 13 (noting statements in two congressional Reports that mentioned state discrimination in public services and transportation but not in employment), with 
				<em>

				, at 654 (considering what Congress might have concluded); 384 U. S., at 652 (holding that likely discrimination against Puerto Ricans in areas other than voting supported statute abolishing literacy test as qualification for voting).

				The evidence in the legislative record bears out Congress finding that the adverse treatment of persons with disabilities was often arbitrary or invidious in this sense, and thus unjustified.  For example, one study that was before Congress revealed that most … governmental agencies in [one State] discriminated in hiring against job applicants for an average period of five years after treatment for cancer, based in part on coworkers misguided belief that cancer is contagious.  2 Leg. Hist. 16191620 (testimony of Arlene B. Mayerson).  A school inexplicably refused to exempt a deaf teacher, who taught at a school for the deaf, from a listening skills requirement.

				Indeed, the Court in

				There is simply no reason to require Congress, seeking to determine facts relevant to the exercise of its §5 authority, to adopt rules or presumptions that reflect a courts institutional limitations.  Unlike courts, Congress can readily gather facts from across the Nation, assess the magnitude of a problem, and more easily find an appropriate remedy.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Cleburne
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 442443 (addressing the problems of the large and diversified group of persons with disabilities is a difficult and often a technical matter, very much a task for legislators guided by qualified professionals and not by the perhaps ill-informed opinions of the judiciary).  Unlike courts, Congress directly reflects public attitudes and beliefs, enabling Congress better to understand where, and to what extent, refusals to accommodate a disability amount to behavior that is callous or unreasonable to the point of lacking constitutional justification.  Unlike judges, Members of Congress can directly obtain information from constituents who have first-hand experience with discrimination and related issues.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Moreover, unlike judges, Members of Congress are elected.  When the Court has applied the majoritys burden of proof rule, it has explained that we, 
				<em>
					i.e.,

				 the courts, do not  sit as a superlegislature to judge the wisdom or desirability of legislative policy determinations. 

				).  To apply a rule designed to restrict courts as if it restricted Congress legislative power is to stand the underlying principlea principle of judicial restrainton its head.  But without the use of this burden of proof rule or some other unusually stringent standard of review, it is difficult to see how the Court can find the legislative record here inadequate.  Read with a reasonably favorable eye, the record indicates that state governments subjected those with disabilities to seriously adverse, disparate treatment.  And Congress could have found, in a significant number of instances, that this treatment violated the substantive principles of justificationshorn of their judicial-restraint-related presumptionsthat this Court recognized in

				And what is wrong with a remedy that, in response to unreasonable employer behavior, requires an employer to make accommodations that are reasonable?  Of course, what is reasonable in the statutory sense and what is unreasonable in the constitutional sense might differ.  In other words, the requirement may exceed what is necessary to avoid a constitutional violation.  But it is just that powerthe power to require more than the minimum that §5 grants to Congress, as this Court has repeatedly confirmed.  As long ago as 1880, the Court wrote that §5 brought within the domain of congressional power whatever tends to enforce submission to its prohibitions and to secure to all persons … the equal protection of the laws.

				The Court says that its primary problem with this statutory provision is one of legislative evidence.  It says that Congress assembled only …  minimal evidence of unconstitutional state discrimination in employment.

				, at 12.  In fact, Congress compiled a vast legislative record documenting  massive, society-wide discrimination  against persons with disabilities.  S. Rep. No. 101116, pp. 89 (1989) (quoting testimony of Justin Dart, chairperson of the Task Force on the Rights and Empowerment of Americans with Disabilities).  In addition to the information presented at 13 congressional hearings (see Appendix A, 
				<em>
					infra
				</em>
				), and its own prior experience gathered over 40 years during which it contemplated and enacted considerable similar legislation (see Appendix B, 
				<em>
					infra
				</em>
				), Congress created a special task force to assess the need for comprehensive legislation.  That task force held hearings in every State, attended by more than 30,000 people, including thousands who had experienced discrimination first hand.  See From ADA to Empowerment, Task Force on the Rights and Empowerment of Americans with Disabilities, 16 (Oct. 12, 1990) (hereinafter Task Force Report).  The task force hearings, Congress own hearings, and an analysis of census data, national polls, and other studies led Congress to conclude that people with disabilities, as a group, occupy an inferior status in our society, and are severely disadvantaged socially, vocationally, economically, and educationally.

As to employment, Congress found that [t]wo-thirds of all disabled Americans between the age of 16 and 64 [were] not working at all, even though a large majority wanted to, and were able to, work productively.  S. Rep. No. 101116, at 9.  And Congress found that this discrimination flowed in significant part from stereotypic assumptions as well as purposeful unequal treatment.

				The powerful evidence of discriminatory treatment throughout society in general, including discrimination by private persons and local governments, implicates state governments as well, for state agencies form part of that same larger society.  There is no particular reason to believe that they are immune from the stereotypic assumptions and pattern of purposeful unequal treatment that Congress found prevalent.  The Court claims that it make[s] no sense to take into consideration constitutional violations committed by local governments.

				The congressionally appointed task force collected numerous specific examples, provided by persons with disabilities themselves, of adverse, disparate treatment by state officials.  They reveal, not what the Court describes as half a dozen instances of discrimination, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 11, but hundreds of instances of adverse treatment at the hands of state officialsinstances in which a person with a disability found it impossible to obtain a state job, to retain state employment, to use the public transportation that was readily available to others in order to get to work, or to obtain a public education, which is often a prerequisite to obtaining employment.  State-imposed barriers also frequently made it difficult or impossible for people to vote, to enter a public building, to access important government services, such as calling for emergency assistance, and to find a place to live due to a pattern of irrational zoning decisions similar to the discrimination that we held unconstitutional in

				As the Court notes, those who presented instances of discrimination rarely provided additional, independent evidence sufficient to prove in court that, in each instance, the discrimination they suffered lacked justification from a judicial standpoint.  Ante
				, at 12 (stating that instances of discrimination are described out of context).  Perhaps this explains the Courts view that there is minimal evidence of unconstitutional state discrimination.  
				<em>
					Ibid.  
				</em>
				But a legislature is not a court of law.  And Congress, unlike courts, must, and does, routinely draw general conclusionsfor example, of likely motive or of likely relationship to legitimate needfrom anecdotal and opinion-based evidence of this kind, particularly when the evidence lacks strong refutation.  See Task Force Report 16, 20 (task force met many times with significant representatives of groups opposed to [the] ADA, and as to the general public, although the task force received about 2,000 letters in support of the ADA, there was only one letter in opposition); S. Rep. No. 101116, at 10 (summarizing testimony that many reasonable accommodations cost less than $50, and the expense of others, such as hiring employees who can interpret for the deaf, is frequently exaggerated).  In reviewing §5 legislation, we have never required the sort of extensive investigation of each piece of evidence that the Court appears to contemplate.  Compare

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">652</a>656 (1966)

				The evidence in the legislative record bears out Congress finding that the adverse treatment of persons with disabilities was often arbitrary or invidious in this sense, and thus unjustified.  For example, one study that was before Congress revealed that most … governmental agencies in [one State] discriminated in hiring against job applicants for an average period of five years after treatment for cancer, based in part on coworkers misguided belief that cancer is contagious.  2 Leg. Hist. 16191620 (testimony of Arlene B. Mayerson).  A school inexplicably refused to exempt a deaf teacher, who taught at a school for the deaf, from a listening skills requirement.

A complete listing of the hundreds of examples of discrimination by state and local governments that were submitted to the task force is set forth in Appendix C,

Unlike courts, Congress directly reflects public attitudes and beliefs, enabling Congress better to understand where, and to what extent, refusals to accommodate a disability amount to behavior that is callous or unreasonable to the point of lacking constitutional justification.

				).  To apply a rule designed to restrict courts as if it restricted Congress legislative power is to stand the underlying principlea principle of judicial restrainton its head.  But without the use of this burden of proof rule or some other unusually stringent standard of review, it is difficult to see how the Court can find the legislative record here inadequate.  Read with a reasonably favorable eye, the record indicates that state governments subjected those with disabilities to seriously adverse, disparate treatment.  And Congress could have found, in a significant number of instances, that this treatment violated the substantive principles of justificationshorn of their judicial-restraint-related presumptionsthat this Court recognized in

				And what is wrong with a remedy that, in response to unreasonable employer behavior, requires an employer to make accommodations that are reasonable?  Of course, what is reasonable in the statutory sense and what is unreasonable in the constitutional sense might differ.  In other words, the requirement may exceed what is necessary to avoid a constitutional violation.  But it is just that powerthe power to require more than the minimum that §5 grants to Congress, as this Court has repeatedly confirmed.  As long ago as 1880, the Court wrote that §5 brought within the domain of congressional power whatever tends to enforce submission to its prohibitions and to secure to all persons … the equal protection of the laws.

Rules for interpreting §5 that would provide States with special protection, however, run counter to the very object of the

				</em>
				 from denying their citizens equal protection of the laws.  U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, §1.  Hence principles of federalism that might otherwise be an obstacle to congressional authority are necessarily overridden by the power to enforce the Civil War Amendments by appropriate legislation.  Those Amendments were specifically designed as an expansion of federal power and an intrusion on state sovereignty.

				Reviewing the congressional record as if it were an administrative agency record, the Court holds the statutory provision before us, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/12202.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §12202</a>, unconstitutional.  The Court concludes that Congress assembled insufficient evidence of unconstitutional discrimination, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 12, that Congress improperly attempted to re-write the law we established in 
				<em>
					Cleburne
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>

            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/473/432" class="subref" title="subref">473 U. S. 432</a> (1985)
, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16, and that the law is not sufficiently tailored to address unconstitutional discrimination, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1415.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Section 5, however, grants Congress the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>s equal protection guarantee.  U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, §5.  As the Court recognizes, state discrimination in employment against persons with disabilities might  run afoul of the Equal Protection Clause  where there is no  rational relationship between the disparity of treatment and some legitimate governmental purpose.   
				<em>

).  See also

				 v. 
				<em>
					Cleburne Living Center, Inc., supra
				</em>
				, at 440 (stating that the Court will sustain a classification if it is rationally related to a legitimate state interest).  In my view, Congress reasonably could have concluded that the remedy before us constitutes an appropriate way to enforce this basic equal protection requirement.  And that is all the Constitution requires.

				The Court says that its primary problem with this statutory provision is one of legislative evidence.  It says that Congress assembled only …  minimal evidence of unconstitutional state discrimination in employment.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 12.  In fact, Congress compiled a vast legislative record documenting  massive, society-wide discrimination  against persons with disabilities.  S. Rep. No. 101116, pp. 89 (1989) (quoting testimony of Justin Dart, chairperson of the Task Force on the Rights and Empowerment of Americans with Disabilities).  In addition to the information presented at 13 congressional hearings (see Appendix A, 
				<em>
					infra
				</em>
				), and its own prior experience gathered over 40 years during which it contemplated and enacted considerable similar legislation (see Appendix B, 
				<em>
					infra
				</em>
				), Congress created a special task force to assess the need for comprehensive legislation.  That task force held hearings in every State, attended by more than 30,000 people, including thousands who had experienced discrimination first hand.  See From ADA to Empowerment, Task Force on the Rights and Empowerment of Americans with Disabilities, 16 (Oct. 12, 1990) (hereinafter Task Force Report).  The task force hearings, Congress own hearings, and an analysis of census data, national polls, and other studies led Congress to conclude that people with disabilities, as a group, occupy an inferior status in our society, and are severely disadvantaged socially, vocationally, economically, and educationally.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/12101.html#a_6" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §12101(a)(6)</a>.  As to employment, Congress found that [t]wo-thirds of all disabled Americans between the age of 16 and 64 [were] not working at all, even though a large majority wanted to, and were able to, work productively.  S. Rep. No. 101116, at 9.  And Congress found that this discrimination flowed in significant part from stereotypic assumptions as well as purposeful unequal treatment.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/12101.html#a_7" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §12101(a)(7)</a>.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The powerful evidence of discriminatory treatment throughout society in general, including discrimination by private persons and local governments, implicates state governments as well, for state agencies form part of that same larger society.  There is no particular reason to believe that they are immune from the stereotypic assumptions and pattern of purposeful unequal treatment that Congress found prevalent.  The Court claims that it make[s] no sense to take into consideration constitutional violations committed by local governments.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 71.  But the substantive obligation that the Equal Protection Clause creates applies to state and local governmental entities alike.

				The congressionally appointed task force collected numerous specific examples, provided by persons with disabilities themselves, of adverse, disparate treatment by state officials.  They reveal, not what the Court describes as half a dozen instances of discrimination, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 11, but hundreds of instances of adverse treatment at the hands of state officialsinstances in which a person with a disability found it impossible to obtain a state job, to retain state employment, to use the public transportation that was readily available to others in order to get to work, or to obtain a public education, which is often a prerequisite to obtaining employment.  State-imposed barriers also frequently made it difficult or impossible for people to vote, to enter a public building, to access important government services, such as calling for emergency assistance, and to find a place to live due to a pattern of irrational zoning decisions similar to the discrimination that we held unconstitutional in

				But a legislature is not a court of law.  And Congress, unlike courts, must, and does, routinely draw general conclusionsfor example, of likely motive or of likely relationship to legitimate needfrom anecdotal and opinion-based evidence of this kind, particularly when the evidence lacks strong refutation.  See Task Force Report 16, 20 (task force met many times with significant representatives of groups opposed to [the] ADA, and as to the general public, although the task force received about 2,000 letters in support of the ADA, there was only one letter in opposition); S.

				The evidence in the legislative record bears out Congress finding that the adverse treatment of persons with disabilities was often arbitrary or invidious in this sense, and thus unjustified.  For example, one study that was before Congress revealed that most … governmental agencies in [one State] discriminated in hiring against job applicants for an average period of five years after treatment for cancer, based in part on coworkers misguided belief that cancer is contagious.  2 Leg.

				There is simply no reason to require Congress, seeking to determine facts relevant to the exercise of its §5 authority, to adopt rules or presumptions that reflect a courts institutional limitations.  Unlike courts, Congress can readily gather facts from across the Nation, assess the magnitude of a problem, and more easily find an appropriate remedy.  Cf. 
				<em>

				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra

				, at 442443 (addressing the problems of the large and diversified group of persons with disabilities is a difficult and often a technical matter, very much a task for legislators guided by qualified professionals and not by the perhaps ill-informed opinions of the judiciary).  Unlike courts, Congress directly reflects public attitudes and beliefs, enabling Congress better to understand where, and to what extent, refusals to accommodate a disability amount to behavior that is callous or unreasonable to the point of lacking constitutional justification.  Unlike judges, Members of Congress can directly obtain information from constituents who have first-hand experience with discrimination and related issues.

				Moreover, unlike judges, Members of Congress are elected.  When the Court has applied the majoritys burden of proof rule, it has explained that we,

But without the use of this burden of proof rule or some other unusually stringent standard of review, it is difficult to see how the Court can find the legislative record here inadequate.  Read with a reasonably favorable eye, the record indicates that state governments subjected those with disabilities to seriously adverse, disparate treatment.  And Congress could have found, in a significant number of instances, that this treatment violated the substantive principles of justificationshorn of their judicial-restraint-related presumptionsthat this Court recognized in

				And what is wrong with a remedy that, in response to unreasonable employer behavior, requires an employer to make accommodations that are reasonable?  Of course, what is reasonable in the statutory sense and what is unreasonable in the constitutional sense might differ.  In other words, the requirement may exceed what is necessary to avoid a constitutional violation.  But it is just that powerthe power to require more than the minimum that §5 grants to Congress, as this Court has repeatedly confirmed.  As long ago as 1880, the Court wrote that §5 brought within the domain of congressional power whatever tends to enforce submission to its prohibitions and to secure to all persons … the equal protection of the laws.

				<em>
					Carter
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Carter Coal Co.,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/298/238" class="subref" title="subref">298 U. S. 238</a> (1936)

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">123</a> (1941)
 (rejecting 
				<em>
					Carter Coals

				rationale).  I could understand the legal basis for such review were we judging a statute that discriminated against those of a particular race or gender, see 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Virginia
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/518/515" class="subref" title="subref">518 U. S. 515</a> (1996)
, or a statute that threatened a basic constitutionally protected liberty such as free speech, see 
				<em>
					Reno
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					American Civil Liberties Union,
				</em>

; see also Post &amp; Siegel, Equal Protection by Law: Federal Antidiscrimination Legislation After 
				<em>
					Morrison
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Kimel
				</em>
				, 110 Yale L. J. 441, 477 (2000) (stating that the Courts recent review of §5 legislation appears to approach strict scrutiny); 1 L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law §516, p. 959 (3d ed. 2000) (same).  The legislation before us, however, does not discriminate against anyone, nor does it pose any threat to basic liberty.  And it is difficult to understand why the Court, which applies minimum rational-basis review to statutes that 
				<em>
					burden
				</em>
				 persons with disabilities, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 78, subjects to far stricter scrutiny a statute that seeks to 
				<em>
					help
				</em>
				 those same individuals.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				I recognize nonetheless that this statute imposes a burden upon States in that it removes their 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxi" class="subref" title="subref">Eleventh Amendment</a> protection from suit, thereby subjecting them to potential monetary liability.  Rules for interpreting §5 that would provide States with special protection, however, run counter to the very object of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>.  By its terms, that Amendment prohibits 
				<em>
					States
				</em>
				 from denying their citizens equal protection of the laws.  U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, §1.  Hence principles of federalism that might otherwise be an obstacle to congressional authority are necessarily overridden by the power to enforce the Civil War Amendments by appropriate legislation.  Those Amendments were specifically designed as an expansion of federal power and an intrusion on state sovereignty.

				And, ironically, the greater the obstacle the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxi" class="subref" title="subref">Eleventh Amendment</a> poses to the creation by Congress of the kind of remedy at issue herethe decentralized remedy of private damage actionsthe more Congress, seeking to cure important national problems, such as the problem of disability discrimination before us, will have to rely on more uniform remedies, such as federal standards and court injunctions,

				The Court, through its evidentiary demands, its non-deferential review, and its failure to distinguish between judicial and legislative constitutional competencies, improperly invades a power that the Constitution assigns to Congress.

				384 U. S., at 648, n. 7 (The sponsors and supporters of the [Fourteenth] Amendment were primarily interested in augmenting the power of Congress).

				The Court says that its primary problem with this statutory provision is one of legislative evidence.  It says that Congress assembled only …  minimal evidence of unconstitutional state discrimination in employment.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 12.  In fact, Congress compiled a vast legislative record documenting  massive, society-wide discrimination  against persons with disabilities.  S. Rep. No. 101116, pp. 89 (1989) (quoting testimony of Justin Dart, chairperson of the Task Force on the Rights and Empowerment of Americans with Disabilities).  In addition to the information presented at 13 congressional hearings (see Appendix A, 
				<em>
					infra
				</em>
				), and its own prior experience gathered over 40 years during which it contemplated and enacted considerable similar legislation (see Appendix B, 
				<em>
					infra
				</em>
				), Congress created a special task force to assess the need for comprehensive legislation.  That task force held hearings in every State, attended by more than 30,000 people, including thousands who had experienced discrimination first hand.  See From ADA to Empowerment, Task Force on the Rights and Empowerment of Americans with Disabilities, 16 (Oct. 12, 1990) (hereinafter Task Force Report).  The task force hearings, Congress own hearings, and an analysis of census data, national polls, and other studies led Congress to conclude that people with disabilities, as a group, occupy an inferior status in our society, and are severely disadvantaged socially, vocationally, economically, and educationally.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/12101.html#a_6" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §12101(a)(6)</a>.  As to employment, Congress found that [t]wo-thirds of all disabled Americans between the age of 16 and 64 [were] not working at all, even though a large majority wanted to, and were able to, work productively.  S. Rep. No. 101116, at 9.  And Congress found that this discrimination flowed in significant part from stereotypic assumptions as well as purposeful unequal treatment.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/12101.html#a_7" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §12101(a)(7)</a>.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The powerful evidence of discriminatory treatment throughout society in general, including discrimination by private persons and local governments, implicates state governments as well, for state agencies form part of that same larger society.  There is no particular reason to believe that they are immune from the stereotypic assumptions and pattern of purposeful unequal treatment that Congress found prevalent.  The Court claims that it make[s] no sense to take into consideration constitutional violations committed by local governments.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 71.  But the substantive obligation that the Equal Protection Clause creates applies to state and local governmental entities alike.

.  Local governments often work closely with, and under the supervision of, state officials, and in general, state and local government employers are similarly situated.  Nor is determining whether an apparently local entity is entitled to 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxi" class="subref" title="subref">Eleventh Amendment</a> immunity as simple as the majority suggestsit often requires a  detailed examination of the relevant provisions of [state] law. 

				In any event, there is no need to rest solely upon evidence of discrimination by local governments or general societal discrimination.  There are roughly 300 examples of discrimination by state governments themselves in the legislative record.  See,

				 Appendix C,

				The congressionally appointed task force collected numerous specific examples, provided by persons with disabilities themselves, of adverse, disparate treatment by state officials.  They reveal, not what the Court describes as half a dozen instances of discrimination, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 11, but hundreds of instances of adverse treatment at the hands of state officialsinstances in which a person with a disability found it impossible to obtain a state job, to retain state employment, to use the public transportation that was readily available to others in order to get to work, or to obtain a public education, which is often a prerequisite to obtaining employment.  State-imposed barriers also frequently made it difficult or impossible for people to vote, to enter a public building, to access important government services, such as calling for emergency assistance, and to find a place to live due to a pattern of irrational zoning decisions similar to the discrimination that we held unconstitutional in 
				<em>
					Cleburne,

				 473 U. S., at 448.  See Appendix C, infra.

				As the Court notes, those who presented instances of discrimination rarely provided additional, independent evidence sufficient to prove in court that, in each instance, the discrimination they suffered lacked justification from a judicial standpoint.  Ante
				, at 12 (stating that instances of discrimination are described out of context).  Perhaps this explains the Courts view that there is minimal evidence of unconstitutional state discrimination.  
				<em>
					Ibid.  
				</em>
				But a legislature is not a court of law.  And Congress, unlike courts, must, and does, routinely draw general conclusionsfor example, of likely motive or of likely relationship to legitimate needfrom anecdotal and opinion-based evidence of this kind, particularly when the evidence lacks strong refutation.  See Task Force Report 16, 20 (task force met many times with significant representatives of groups opposed to [the] ADA, and as to the general public, although the task force received about 2,000 letters in support of the ADA, there was only one letter in opposition); S. Rep. No. 101116, at 10 (summarizing testimony that many reasonable accommodations cost less than $50, and the expense of others, such as hiring employees who can interpret for the deaf, is frequently exaggerated).  In reviewing §5 legislation, we have never required the sort of extensive investigation of each piece of evidence that the Court appears to contemplate.  Compare 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1213, with 
				<em>
					Katzenbach
				</em>
				 v.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">652</a>656 (1966)
 (asking whether Congress likely conclusions were reasonable, not whether there was adequate evidentiary support in the record).  Nor has the Court traditionally required Congress to make findings as to state discrimination, or to break down the record evidence, category by category.  Compare 
				<em>
					ante, 
				</em>
				at 13 (noting statements in two congressional Reports that mentioned state discrimination in public services and transportation but not in employment), with 
				<em>
					Morgan, supra
				</em>
				, at 654 (considering what Congress might have concluded); 384 U. S., at 652 (holding that likely discrimination against Puerto Ricans in areas other than voting supported statute abolishing literacy test as qualification for voting).

				Regardless, Congress expressly found substantial unjustified discrimination against persons with disabilities.

(Committee Print compiled for the House Committee on Education and Labor), Ser. No. 102B, p. 1620 (1990) (testimony of Arlene B.

				The evidence in the legislative record bears out Congress finding that the adverse treatment of persons with disabilities was often arbitrary or invidious in this sense, and thus unjustified.  For example, one study that was before Congress revealed that most … governmental agencies in [one State] discriminated in hiring against job applicants for an average period of five years after treatment for cancer, based in part on coworkers misguided belief that cancer is contagious.  2 Leg. Hist. 16191620 (testimony of Arlene B. Mayerson).  A school inexplicably refused to exempt a deaf teacher, who taught at a school for the deaf, from a listening skills requirement.

				There is simply no reason to require Congress, seeking to determine facts relevant to the exercise of its §5 authority, to adopt rules or presumptions that reflect a courts institutional limitations.  Unlike courts, Congress can readily gather facts from across the Nation, assess the magnitude of a problem, and more easily find an appropriate remedy.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Cleburne
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra

				, at 442443 (addressing the problems of the large and diversified group of persons with disabilities is a difficult and often a technical matter, very much a task for legislators guided by qualified professionals and not by the perhaps ill-informed opinions of the judiciary).  Unlike courts, Congress directly reflects public attitudes and beliefs, enabling Congress better to understand where, and to what extent, refusals to accommodate a disability amount to behavior that is callous or unreasonable to the point of lacking constitutional justification.  Unlike judges, Members of Congress can directly obtain information from constituents who have first-hand experience with discrimination and related issues.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Moreover, unlike judges, Members of Congress are elected.  When the Court has applied the majoritys burden of proof rule, it has explained that we, 
				<em>

				).  To apply a rule designed to restrict courts as if it restricted Congress legislative power is to stand the underlying principlea principle of judicial restrainton its head.  But without the use of this burden of proof rule or some other unusually stringent standard of review, it is difficult to see how the Court can find the legislative record here inadequate.  Read with a reasonably favorable eye, the record indicates that state governments subjected those with disabilities to seriously adverse, disparate treatment.  And Congress could have found, in a significant number of instances, that this treatment violated the substantive principles of justificationshorn of their judicial-restraint-related presumptionsthat this Court recognized in

				And what is wrong with a remedy that, in response to unreasonable employer behavior, requires an employer to make accommodations that are reasonable?  Of course, what is reasonable in the statutory sense and what is unreasonable in the constitutional sense might differ.  In other words, the requirement may exceed what is necessary to avoid a constitutional violation.  But it is just that powerthe power to require more than the minimum that §5 grants to Congress, as this Court has repeatedly confirmed.  As long ago as 1880, the Court wrote that §5 brought within the domain of congressional power whatever tends to enforce submission to its prohibitions and to secure to all persons … the equal protection of the laws.

No. 101116, pp. 89 (1989) (quoting testimony of Justin Dart, chairperson of the Task Force on the Rights and Empowerment of Americans with Disabilities).  In addition to the information presented at 13 congressional hearings (see Appendix A, 
				<em>
					infra
				</em>
				), and its own prior experience gathered over 40 years during which it contemplated and enacted considerable similar legislation (see Appendix B, 
				<em>
					infra
				</em>
				), Congress created a special task force to assess the need for comprehensive legislation.  That task force held hearings in every State, attended by more than 30,000 people, including thousands who had experienced discrimination first hand.  See From ADA to Empowerment, Task Force on the Rights and Empowerment of Americans with Disabilities, 16 (Oct. 12, 1990) (hereinafter Task Force Report).  The task force hearings, Congress own hearings, and an analysis of census data, national polls, and other studies led Congress to conclude that people with disabilities, as a group, occupy an inferior status in our society, and are severely disadvantaged socially, vocationally, economically, and educationally.

S. Rep. No. 101116, at 9.  And Congress found that this discrimination flowed in significant part from stereotypic assumptions as well as purposeful unequal treatment.

				The powerful evidence of discriminatory treatment throughout society in general, including discrimination by private persons and local governments, implicates state governments as well, for state agencies form part of that same larger society.  There is no particular reason to believe that they are immune from the stereotypic assumptions and pattern of purposeful unequal treatment that Congress found prevalent.  The Court claims that it make[s] no sense to take into consideration constitutional violations committed by local governments.

				The congressionally appointed task force collected numerous specific examples, provided by persons with disabilities themselves, of adverse, disparate treatment by state officials.  They reveal, not what the Court describes as half a dozen instances of discrimination, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 11, but hundreds of instances of adverse treatment at the hands of state officialsinstances in which a person with a disability found it impossible to obtain a state job, to retain state employment, to use the public transportation that was readily available to others in order to get to work, or to obtain a public education, which is often a prerequisite to obtaining employment.  State-imposed barriers also frequently made it difficult or impossible for people to vote, to enter a public building, to access important government services, such as calling for emergency assistance, and to find a place to live due to a pattern of irrational zoning decisions similar to the discrimination that we held unconstitutional in

				As the Court notes, those who presented instances of discrimination rarely provided additional, independent evidence sufficient to prove in court that, in each instance, the discrimination they suffered lacked justification from a judicial standpoint.  Ante
				, at 12 (stating that instances of discrimination are described out of context).  Perhaps this explains the Courts view that there is minimal evidence of unconstitutional state discrimination.  
				<em>
					Ibid.

				But a legislature is not a court of law.  And Congress, unlike courts, must, and does, routinely draw general conclusionsfor example, of likely motive or of likely relationship to legitimate needfrom anecdotal and opinion-based evidence of this kind, particularly when the evidence lacks strong refutation.  See Task Force Report 16, 20 (task force met many times with significant representatives of groups opposed to [the] ADA, and as to the general public, although the task force received about 2,000 letters in support of the ADA, there was only one letter in opposition); S. Rep. No. 101116, at 10 (summarizing testimony that many reasonable accommodations cost less than $50, and the expense of others, such as hiring employees who can interpret for the deaf, is frequently exaggerated).  In reviewing §5 legislation, we have never required the sort of extensive investigation of each piece of evidence that the Court appears to contemplate.  Compare

				The evidence in the legislative record bears out Congress finding that the adverse treatment of persons with disabilities was often arbitrary or invidious in this sense, and thus unjustified.  For example, one study that was before Congress revealed that most … governmental agencies in [one State] discriminated in hiring against job applicants for an average period of five years after treatment for cancer, based in part on coworkers misguided belief that cancer is contagious.  2 Leg. Hist. 16191620 (testimony of Arlene B. Mayerson).  A school inexplicably refused to exempt a deaf teacher, who taught at a school for the deaf, from a listening skills requirement.

A complete listing of the hundreds of examples of discrimination by state and local governments that were submitted to the task force is set forth in Appendix C,

				There is simply no reason to require Congress, seeking to determine facts relevant to the exercise of its §5 authority, to adopt rules or presumptions that reflect a courts institutional limitations.  Unlike courts, Congress can readily gather facts from across the Nation, assess the magnitude of a problem, and more easily find an appropriate remedy.  Cf.

				, at 442443 (addressing the problems of the large and diversified group of persons with disabilities is a difficult and often a technical matter, very much a task for legislators guided by qualified professionals and not by the perhaps ill-informed opinions of the judiciary).  Unlike courts, Congress directly reflects public attitudes and beliefs, enabling Congress better to understand where, and to what extent, refusals to accommodate a disability amount to behavior that is callous or unreasonable to the point of lacking constitutional justification.  Unlike judges, Members of Congress can directly obtain information from constituents who have first-hand experience with discrimination and related issues.

				Moreover, unlike judges, Members of Congress are elected.  When the Court has applied the majoritys burden of proof rule, it has explained that we,

But without the use of this burden of proof rule or some other unusually stringent standard of review, it is difficult to see how the Court can find the legislative record here inadequate.  Read with a reasonably favorable eye, the record indicates that state governments subjected those with disabilities to seriously adverse, disparate treatment.

				And what is wrong with a remedy that, in response to unreasonable employer behavior, requires an employer to make accommodations that are reasonable?  Of course, what is reasonable in the statutory sense and what is unreasonable in the constitutional sense might differ.  In other words, the requirement may exceed what is necessary to avoid a constitutional violation.  But it is just that powerthe power to require more than the minimum that §5 grants to Congress, as this Court has repeatedly confirmed.  As long ago as 1880, the Court wrote that §5 brought within the domain of congressional power whatever tends to enforce submission to its prohibitions and to secure to all persons … the equal protection of the laws.

				In keeping with these principles, the Court has said that [i]t is not for us to review the congressional resolution of the various conflicting considerationsthe risk or pervasiveness of the discrimination in governmental services … , the adequacy or availability of alternative remedies, and the nature and significance of the state interests that would be affected.  384 U.

				I recognize nonetheless that this statute imposes a burden upon States in that it removes their 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxi" class="subref" title="subref">Eleventh Amendment</a> protection from suit, thereby subjecting them to potential monetary liability.  Rules for interpreting §5 that would provide States with special protection, however, run counter to the very object of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>.  By its terms, that Amendment prohibits 
				<em>
					States
				</em>
				 from denying their citizens equal protection of the laws.  U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, §1.  Hence principles of federalism that might otherwise be an obstacle to congressional authority are necessarily overridden by the power to enforce the Civil War Amendments by appropriate legislation.  Those Amendments were specifically designed as an expansion of federal power and an intrusion on state sovereignty.

				Reviewing the congressional record as if it were an administrative agency record, the Court holds the statutory provision before us, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/12202.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §12202</a>, unconstitutional.  The Court concludes that Congress assembled insufficient evidence of unconstitutional discrimination, 
				<em>
					ante

				, at 12, that Congress improperly attempted to re-write the law we established in 
				<em>
					Cleburne
				</em>
				 v.

				<em>

				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1415.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Section 5, however, grants Congress the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>s equal protection guarantee.  U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, §5.  As the Court recognizes, state discrimination in employment against persons with disabilities might  run afoul of the Equal Protection Clause  where there is no  rational relationship between the disparity of treatment and some legitimate governmental purpose. 

				 v. 
				<em>

				, at 440 (stating that the Court will sustain a classification if it is rationally related to a legitimate state interest).  In my view, Congress reasonably could have concluded that the remedy before us constitutes an appropriate way to enforce this basic equal protection requirement.  And that is all the Constitution requires.

				The Court says that its primary problem with this statutory provision is one of legislative evidence.  It says that Congress assembled only …  minimal evidence of unconstitutional state discrimination in employment.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 12.  In fact, Congress compiled a vast legislative record documenting  massive, society-wide discrimination  against persons with disabilities.  S. Rep. No. 101116, pp. 89 (1989) (quoting testimony of Justin Dart, chairperson of the Task Force on the Rights and Empowerment of Americans with Disabilities).  In addition to the information presented at 13 congressional hearings (see Appendix A, 
				<em>
					infra
				</em>
				), and its own prior experience gathered over 40 years during which it contemplated and enacted considerable similar legislation (see Appendix B, 
				<em>
					infra
				</em>
				), Congress created a special task force to assess the need for comprehensive legislation.  That task force held hearings in every State, attended by more than 30,000 people, including thousands who had experienced discrimination first hand.  See From ADA to Empowerment, Task Force on the Rights and Empowerment of Americans with Disabilities, 16 (Oct. 12, 1990) (hereinafter Task Force Report).  The task force hearings, Congress own hearings, and an analysis of census data, national polls, and other studies led Congress to conclude that people with disabilities, as a group, occupy an inferior status in our society, and are severely disadvantaged socially, vocationally, economically, and educationally.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/12101.html#a_6" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §12101(a)(6)</a>.  As to employment, Congress found that [t]wo-thirds of all disabled Americans between the age of 16 and 64 [were] not working at all, even though a large majority wanted to, and were able to, work productively.  S. Rep. No. 101116, at 9.  And Congress found that this discrimination flowed in significant part from stereotypic assumptions as well as purposeful unequal treatment.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/12101.html#a_7" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §12101(a)(7)</a>.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The powerful evidence of discriminatory treatment throughout society in general, including discrimination by private persons and local governments, implicates state governments as well, for state agencies form part of that same larger society.  There is no particular reason to believe that they are immune from the stereotypic assumptions and pattern of purposeful unequal treatment that Congress found prevalent.  The Court claims that it make[s] no sense to take into consideration constitutional violations committed by local governments.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 71.  But the substantive obligation that the Equal Protection Clause creates applies to state and local governmental entities alike.  
				<em>
					E.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Richmond
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					J. A. Croson Co.,
				</em>

.  Local governments often work closely with, and under the supervision of, state officials, and in general, state and local government employers are similarly situated.  Nor is determining whether an apparently local entity is entitled to 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxi" class="subref" title="subref">Eleventh Amendment</a> immunity as simple as the majority suggestsit often requires a  detailed examination of the relevant provisions of [state] law. 

				The congressionally appointed task force collected numerous specific examples, provided by persons with disabilities themselves, of adverse, disparate treatment by state officials.  They reveal, not what the Court describes as half a dozen instances of discrimination, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 11, but hundreds of instances of adverse treatment at the hands of state officialsinstances in which a person with a disability found it impossible to obtain a state job, to retain state employment, to use the public transportation that was readily available to others in order to get to work, or to obtain a public education, which is often a prerequisite to obtaining employment.  State-imposed barriers also frequently made it difficult or impossible for people to vote, to enter a public building, to access important government services, such as calling for emergency assistance, and to find a place to live due to a pattern of irrational zoning decisions similar to the discrimination that we held unconstitutional in

				But a legislature is not a court of law.  And Congress, unlike courts, must, and does, routinely draw general conclusionsfor example, of likely motive or of likely relationship to legitimate needfrom anecdotal and opinion-based evidence of this kind, particularly when the evidence lacks strong refutation.  See Task Force Report 16, 20 (task force met many times with significant representatives of groups opposed to [the] ADA, and as to the general public, although the task force received about 2,000 letters in support of the ADA, there was only one letter in opposition); S. Rep. No. 101116, at 10 (summarizing testimony that many reasonable accommodations cost less than $50, and the expense of others, such as hiring employees who can interpret for the deaf, is frequently exaggerated).

				The evidence in the legislative record bears out Congress finding that the adverse treatment of persons with disabilities was often arbitrary or invidious in this sense, and thus unjustified.  For example, one study that was before Congress revealed that most … governmental agencies in [one State] discriminated in hiring against job applicants for an average period of five years after treatment for cancer, based in part on coworkers misguided belief that cancer is contagious.  2 Leg. Hist. 16191620 (testimony of Arlene B. Mayerson).  A school inexplicably refused to exempt a deaf teacher, who taught at a school for the deaf, from a listening skills requirement.

				Indeed, the Court in

				There is simply no reason to require Congress, seeking to determine facts relevant to the exercise of its §5 authority, to adopt rules or presumptions that reflect a courts institutional limitations.  Unlike courts, Congress can readily gather facts from across the Nation, assess the magnitude of a problem, and more easily find an appropriate remedy.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Cleburne
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra

				, at 442443 (addressing the problems of the large and diversified group of persons with disabilities is a difficult and often a technical matter, very much a task for legislators guided by qualified professionals and not by the perhaps ill-informed opinions of the judiciary).  Unlike courts, Congress directly reflects public attitudes and beliefs, enabling Congress better to understand where, and to what extent, refusals to accommodate a disability amount to behavior that is callous or unreasonable to the point of lacking constitutional justification.  Unlike judges, Members of Congress can directly obtain information from constituents who have first-hand experience with discrimination and related issues.

				Moreover, unlike judges, Members of Congress are elected.  When the Court has applied the majoritys burden of proof rule, it has explained that we,

But without the use of this burden of proof rule or some other unusually stringent standard of review, it is difficult to see how the Court can find the legislative record here inadequate.  Read with a reasonably favorable eye, the record indicates that state governments subjected those with disabilities to seriously adverse, disparate treatment.  And Congress could have found, in a significant number of instances, that this treatment violated the substantive principles of justificationshorn of their judicial-restraint-related presumptionsthat this Court recognized in

				And what is wrong with a remedy that, in response to unreasonable employer behavior, requires an employer to make accommodations that are reasonable?  Of course, what is reasonable in the statutory sense and what is unreasonable in the constitutional sense might differ.  In other words, the requirement may exceed what is necessary to avoid a constitutional violation.  But it is just that powerthe power to require more than the minimum that §5 grants to Congress, as this Court has repeatedly confirmed.  As long ago as 1880, the Court wrote that §5 brought within the domain of congressional power whatever tends to enforce submission to its prohibitions and to secure to all persons … the equal protection of the laws.

Tribe, American Constitutional Law §516, p. 959 (3d ed. 2000) (same).  The legislation before us, however, does not discriminate against anyone, nor does it pose any threat to basic liberty.

				I recognize nonetheless that this statute imposes a burden upon States in that it removes their 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxi" class="subref" title="subref">Eleventh Amendment</a> protection from suit, thereby subjecting them to potential monetary liability.  Rules for interpreting §5 that would provide States with special protection, however, run counter to the very object of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>.  By its terms, that Amendment prohibits 
				<em>
					States
				</em>
				 from denying their citizens equal protection of the laws.  U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, §1.  Hence principles of federalism that might otherwise be an obstacle to congressional authority are necessarily overridden by the power to enforce the Civil War Amendments by appropriate legislation.  Those Amendments were specifically designed as an expansion of federal power and an intrusion on state sovereignty.

				And, ironically, the greater the obstacle the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxi" class="subref" title="subref">Eleventh Amendment</a> poses to the creation by Congress of the kind of remedy at issue herethe decentralized remedy of private damage actionsthe more Congress, seeking to cure important national problems, such as the problem of disability discrimination before us, will have to rely on more uniform remedies, such as federal standards and court injunctions,

				The Court says that its primary problem with this statutory provision is one of legislative evidence.  It says that Congress assembled only …  minimal evidence of unconstitutional state discrimination in employment.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 12.  In fact, Congress compiled a vast legislative record documenting  massive, society-wide discrimination  against persons with disabilities.  S. Rep. No. 101116, pp. 89 (1989) (quoting testimony of Justin Dart, chairperson of the Task Force on the Rights and Empowerment of Americans with Disabilities).  In addition to the information presented at 13 congressional hearings (see Appendix A, 
				<em>
					infra
				</em>
				), and its own prior experience gathered over 40 years during which it contemplated and enacted considerable similar legislation (see Appendix B, 
				<em>
					infra
				</em>
				), Congress created a special task force to assess the need for comprehensive legislation.  That task force held hearings in every State, attended by more than 30,000 people, including thousands who had experienced discrimination first hand.  See From ADA to Empowerment, Task Force on the Rights and Empowerment of Americans with Disabilities, 16 (Oct. 12, 1990) (hereinafter Task Force Report).  The task force hearings, Congress own hearings, and an analysis of census data, national polls, and other studies led Congress to conclude that people with disabilities, as a group, occupy an inferior status in our society, and are severely disadvantaged socially, vocationally, economically, and educationally.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/12101.html#a_6" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §12101(a)(6)</a>.  As to employment, Congress found that [t]wo-thirds of all disabled Americans between the age of 16 and 64 [were] not working at all, even though a large majority wanted to, and were able to, work productively.  S. Rep. No. 101116, at 9.  And Congress found that this discrimination flowed in significant part from stereotypic assumptions as well as purposeful unequal treatment.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/12101.html#a_7" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §12101(a)(7)</a>.

				The powerful evidence of discriminatory treatment throughout society in general, including discrimination by private persons and local governments, implicates state governments as well, for state agencies form part of that same larger society.  There is no particular reason to believe that they are immune from the stereotypic assumptions and pattern of purposeful unequal treatment that Congress found prevalent.  The Court claims that it make[s] no sense to take into consideration constitutional violations committed by local governments.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 71.  But the substantive obligation that the Equal Protection Clause creates applies to state and local governmental entities alike.

.  Local governments often work closely with, and under the supervision of, state officials, and in general, state and local government employers are similarly situated.  Nor is determining whether an apparently local entity is entitled to 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxi" class="subref" title="subref">Eleventh Amendment</a> immunity as simple as the majority suggestsit often requires a  detailed examination of the relevant provisions of [state] law. 

				In any event, there is no need to rest solely upon evidence of discrimination by local governments or general societal discrimination.  There are roughly 300 examples of discrimination by state governments themselves in the legislative record.  See,

				The congressionally appointed task force collected numerous specific examples, provided by persons with disabilities themselves, of adverse, disparate treatment by state officials.  They reveal, not what the Court describes as half a dozen instances of discrimination, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 11, but hundreds of instances of adverse treatment at the hands of state officialsinstances in which a person with a disability found it impossible to obtain a state job, to retain state employment, to use the public transportation that was readily available to others in order to get to work, or to obtain a public education, which is often a prerequisite to obtaining employment.  State-imposed barriers also frequently made it difficult or impossible for people to vote, to enter a public building, to access important government services, such as calling for emergency assistance, and to find a place to live due to a pattern of irrational zoning decisions similar to the discrimination that we held unconstitutional in

				 473 U. S., at 448.  See Appendix C, infra.

				As the Court notes, those who presented instances of discrimination rarely provided additional, independent evidence sufficient to prove in court that, in each instance, the discrimination they suffered lacked justification from a judicial standpoint.  Ante
				, at 12 (stating that instances of discrimination are described out of context).  Perhaps this explains the Courts view that there is minimal evidence of unconstitutional state discrimination.  
				<em>
					Ibid.  
				</em>
				But a legislature is not a court of law.  And Congress, unlike courts, must, and does, routinely draw general conclusionsfor example, of likely motive or of likely relationship to legitimate needfrom anecdotal and opinion-based evidence of this kind, particularly when the evidence lacks strong refutation.  See Task Force Report 16, 20 (task force met many times with significant representatives of groups opposed to [the] ADA, and as to the general public, although the task force received about 2,000 letters in support of the ADA, there was only one letter in opposition); S. Rep. No. 101116, at 10 (summarizing testimony that many reasonable accommodations cost less than $50, and the expense of others, such as hiring employees who can interpret for the deaf, is frequently exaggerated).  In reviewing §5 legislation, we have never required the sort of extensive investigation of each piece of evidence that the Court appears to contemplate.  Compare 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1213, with 
				<em>
					Katzenbach

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">652</a>656 (1966)
 (asking whether Congress likely conclusions were reasonable, not whether there was adequate evidentiary support in the record).  Nor has the Court traditionally required Congress to make findings as to state discrimination, or to break down the record evidence, category by category.  Compare 
				<em>
					ante, 
				</em>
				at 13 (noting statements in two congressional Reports that mentioned state discrimination in public services and transportation but not in employment), with 
				<em>
					Morgan, supra

				, at 654 (considering what Congress might have concluded); 384 U. S., at 652 (holding that likely discrimination against Puerto Ricans in areas other than voting supported statute abolishing literacy test as qualification for voting).

(Committee Print compiled for the House Committee on Education and Labor), Ser. No. 102B, p. 1620 (1990) (testimony of Arlene B.

				The evidence in the legislative record bears out Congress finding that the adverse treatment of persons with disabilities was often arbitrary or invidious in this sense, and thus unjustified.  For example, one study that was before Congress revealed that most … governmental agencies in [one State] discriminated in hiring against job applicants for an average period of five years after treatment for cancer, based in part on coworkers misguided belief that cancer is contagious.  2 Leg. Hist. 16191620 (testimony of Arlene B. Mayerson).  A school inexplicably refused to exempt a deaf teacher, who taught at a school for the deaf, from a listening skills requirement.  Governments Lodging 1503.  A State refused to hire a blind employee as director of an agency for the blindeven though he was the most qualified applicant.

				, at 1159, 1577.  A zoo turned away children with Downs Syndrome because [the zookeeper] feared they would upset the chimpanzees.  S. Rep. No. 101116, at 7.  There were reports of numerous zoning decisions based upon negative attitudes or fear, 
				<em>

				, at 448, such as a zoning board that denied a permit for an obviously pretextual reason after hearing arguments that a facility would house  deviants  who needed  room to roam,  Governments Lodging 1068.  A complete listing of the hundreds of examples of discrimination by state and local governments that were submitted to the task force is set forth in Appendix C,

				Indeed, the Court in

				 drew this very institutional distinction.  We emphasized that courts have been very reluctant, as they should be in our federal system and with our respect for the separation of powers, to closely scrutinize legislative choices.  473 U.

				There is simply no reason to require Congress, seeking to determine facts relevant to the exercise of its §5 authority, to adopt rules or presumptions that reflect a courts institutional limitations.  Unlike courts, Congress can readily gather facts from across the Nation, assess the magnitude of a problem, and more easily find an appropriate remedy.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Cleburne
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 442443 (addressing the problems of the large and diversified group of persons with disabilities is a difficult and often a technical matter, very much a task for legislators guided by qualified professionals and not by the perhaps ill-informed opinions of the judiciary).  Unlike courts, Congress directly reflects public attitudes and beliefs, enabling Congress better to understand where, and to what extent, refusals to accommodate a disability amount to behavior that is callous or unreasonable to the point of lacking constitutional justification.  Unlike judges, Members of Congress can directly obtain information from constituents who have first-hand experience with discrimination and related issues.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Moreover, unlike judges, Members of Congress are elected.  When the Court has applied the majoritys burden of proof rule, it has explained that we, 
				<em>
					i.e.,
				</em>
				 the courts, do not  sit as a superlegislature to judge the wisdom or desirability of legislative policy determinations. 

				).  To apply a rule designed to restrict courts as if it restricted Congress legislative power is to stand the underlying principlea principle of judicial restrainton its head.  But without the use of this burden of proof rule or some other unusually stringent standard of review, it is difficult to see how the Court can find the legislative record here inadequate.  Read with a reasonably favorable eye, the record indicates that state governments subjected those with disabilities to seriously adverse, disparate treatment.  And Congress could have found, in a significant number of instances, that this treatment violated the substantive principles of justificationshorn of their judicial-restraint-related presumptionsthat this Court recognized in

				And what is wrong with a remedy that, in response to unreasonable employer behavior, requires an employer to make accommodations that are reasonable?  Of course, what is reasonable in the statutory sense and what is unreasonable in the constitutional sense might differ.  In other words, the requirement may exceed what is necessary to avoid a constitutional violation.  But it is just that powerthe power to require more than the minimum that §5 grants to Congress, as this Court has repeatedly confirmed.  As long ago as 1880, the Court wrote that §5 brought within the domain of congressional power whatever tends to enforce submission to its prohibitions and to secure to all persons … the equal protection of the laws.

				, at 12.  In fact, Congress compiled a vast legislative record documenting  massive, society-wide discrimination  against persons with disabilities.  S. Rep. No. 101116, pp. 89 (1989) (quoting testimony of Justin Dart, chairperson of the Task Force on the Rights and Empowerment of Americans with Disabilities).  In addition to the information presented at 13 congressional hearings (see Appendix A, 
				<em>
					infra
				</em>
				), and its own prior experience gathered over 40 years during which it contemplated and enacted considerable similar legislation (see Appendix B, 
				<em>
					infra
				</em>
				), Congress created a special task force to assess the need for comprehensive legislation.  That task force held hearings in every State, attended by more than 30,000 people, including thousands who had experienced discrimination first hand.  See From ADA to Empowerment, Task Force on the Rights and Empowerment of Americans with Disabilities, 16 (Oct. 12, 1990) (hereinafter Task Force Report).  The task force hearings, Congress own hearings, and an analysis of census data, national polls, and other studies led Congress to conclude that people with disabilities, as a group, occupy an inferior status in our society, and are severely disadvantaged socially, vocationally, economically, and educationally.

As to employment, Congress found that [t]wo-thirds of all disabled Americans between the age of 16 and 64 [were] not working at all, even though a large majority wanted to, and were able to, work productively.  S. Rep. No. 101116, at 9.  And Congress found that this discrimination flowed in significant part from stereotypic assumptions as well as purposeful unequal treatment.

				The powerful evidence of discriminatory treatment throughout society in general, including discrimination by private persons and local governments, implicates state governments as well, for state agencies form part of that same larger society.  There is no particular reason to believe that they are immune from the stereotypic assumptions and pattern of purposeful unequal treatment that Congress found prevalent.  The Court claims that it make[s] no sense to take into consideration constitutional violations committed by local governments.

				The congressionally appointed task force collected numerous specific examples, provided by persons with disabilities themselves, of adverse, disparate treatment by state officials.  They reveal, not what the Court describes as half a dozen instances of discrimination, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 11, but hundreds of instances of adverse treatment at the hands of state officialsinstances in which a person with a disability found it impossible to obtain a state job, to retain state employment, to use the public transportation that was readily available to others in order to get to work, or to obtain a public education, which is often a prerequisite to obtaining employment.  State-imposed barriers also frequently made it difficult or impossible for people to vote, to enter a public building, to access important government services, such as calling for emergency assistance, and to find a place to live due to a pattern of irrational zoning decisions similar to the discrimination that we held unconstitutional in

				As the Court notes, those who presented instances of discrimination rarely provided additional, independent evidence sufficient to prove in court that, in each instance, the discrimination they suffered lacked justification from a judicial standpoint.  Ante
				, at 12 (stating that instances of discrimination are described out of context).  Perhaps this explains the Courts view that there is minimal evidence of unconstitutional state discrimination.  
				<em>
					Ibid.  
				</em>
				But a legislature is not a court of law.  And Congress, unlike courts, must, and does, routinely draw general conclusionsfor example, of likely motive or of likely relationship to legitimate needfrom anecdotal and opinion-based evidence of this kind, particularly when the evidence lacks strong refutation.  See Task Force Report 16, 20 (task force met many times with significant representatives of groups opposed to [the] ADA, and as to the general public, although the task force received about 2,000 letters in support of the ADA, there was only one letter in opposition); S. Rep. No. 101116, at 10 (summarizing testimony that many reasonable accommodations cost less than $50, and the expense of others, such as hiring employees who can interpret for the deaf, is frequently exaggerated).  In reviewing §5 legislation, we have never required the sort of extensive investigation of each piece of evidence that the Court appears to contemplate.  Compare

				The evidence in the legislative record bears out Congress finding that the adverse treatment of persons with disabilities was often arbitrary or invidious in this sense, and thus unjustified.  For example, one study that was before Congress revealed that most … governmental agencies in [one State] discriminated in hiring against job applicants for an average period of five years after treatment for cancer, based in part on coworkers misguided belief that cancer is contagious.  2 Leg. Hist. 16191620 (testimony of Arlene B. Mayerson).  A school inexplicably refused to exempt a deaf teacher, who taught at a school for the deaf, from a listening skills requirement.

A complete listing of the hundreds of examples of discrimination by state and local governments that were submitted to the task force is set forth in Appendix C,

				There is simply no reason to require Congress, seeking to determine facts relevant to the exercise of its §5 authority, to adopt rules or presumptions that reflect a courts institutional limitations.  Unlike courts, Congress can readily gather facts from across the Nation, assess the magnitude of a problem, and more easily find an appropriate remedy.  Cf.

				, at 442443 (addressing the problems of the large and diversified group of persons with disabilities is a difficult and often a technical matter, very much a task for legislators guided by qualified professionals and not by the perhaps ill-informed opinions of the judiciary).  Unlike courts, Congress directly reflects public attitudes and beliefs, enabling Congress better to understand where, and to what extent, refusals to accommodate a disability amount to behavior that is callous or unreasonable to the point of lacking constitutional justification.  Unlike judges, Members of Congress can directly obtain information from constituents who have first-hand experience with discrimination and related issues.

				Moreover, unlike judges, Members of Congress are elected.  When the Court has applied the majoritys burden of proof rule, it has explained that we,

But without the use of this burden of proof rule or some other unusually stringent standard of review, it is difficult to see how the Court can find the legislative record here inadequate.  Read with a reasonably favorable eye, the record indicates that state governments subjected those with disabilities to seriously adverse, disparate treatment.  And Congress could have found, in a significant number of instances, that this treatment violated the substantive principles of justificationshorn of their judicial-restraint-related presumptionsthat this Court recognized in

				And what is wrong with a remedy that, in response to unreasonable employer behavior, requires an employer to make accommodations that are reasonable?  Of course, what is reasonable in the statutory sense and what is unreasonable in the constitutional sense might differ.  In other words, the requirement may exceed what is necessary to avoid a constitutional violation.  But it is just that powerthe power to require more than the minimum that §5 grants to Congress, as this Court has repeatedly confirmed.  As long ago as 1880, the Court wrote that §5 brought within the domain of congressional power whatever tends to enforce submission to its prohibitions and to secure to all persons … the equal protection of the laws.

				In keeping with these principles, the Court has said that [i]t is not for us to review the congressional resolution of the various conflicting considerationsthe risk or pervasiveness of the discrimination in governmental services … , the adequacy or availability of alternative remedies, and the nature and significance of the state interests that would be affected.  384 U.

				I recognize nonetheless that this statute imposes a burden upon States in that it removes their 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxi" class="subref" title="subref">Eleventh Amendment</a> protection from suit, thereby subjecting them to potential monetary liability.  Rules for interpreting §5 that would provide States with special protection, however, run counter to the very object of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>.  By its terms, that Amendment prohibits 
				<em>
					States
				</em>
				 from denying their citizens equal protection of the laws.  U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, §1.  Hence principles of federalism that might otherwise be an obstacle to congressional authority are necessarily overridden by the power to enforce the Civil War Amendments by appropriate legislation.  Those Amendments were specifically designed as an expansion of federal power and an intrusion on state sovereignty.

				Reviewing the congressional record as if it were an administrative agency record, the Court holds the statutory provision before us, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/12202.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §12202</a>, unconstitutional.  The Court concludes that Congress assembled insufficient evidence of unconstitutional discrimination,

				Section 5, however, grants Congress the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation the

				The Court says that its primary problem with this statutory provision is one of legislative evidence.  It says that Congress assembled only …  minimal evidence of unconstitutional state discrimination in employment.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 12.  In fact, Congress compiled a vast legislative record documenting  massive, society-wide discrimination  against persons with disabilities.  S. Rep. No. 101116, pp. 89 (1989) (quoting testimony of Justin Dart, chairperson of the Task Force on the Rights and Empowerment of Americans with Disabilities).  In addition to the information presented at 13 congressional hearings (see Appendix A, 
				<em>
					infra
				</em>
				), and its own prior experience gathered over 40 years during which it contemplated and enacted considerable similar legislation (see Appendix B, 
				<em>
					infra
				</em>
				), Congress created a special task force to assess the need for comprehensive legislation.  That task force held hearings in every State, attended by more than 30,000 people, including thousands who had experienced discrimination first hand.  See From ADA to Empowerment, Task Force on the Rights and Empowerment of Americans with Disabilities, 16 (Oct. 12, 1990) (hereinafter Task Force Report).  The task force hearings, Congress own hearings, and an analysis of census data, national polls, and other studies led Congress to conclude that people with disabilities, as a group, occupy an inferior status in our society, and are severely disadvantaged socially, vocationally, economically, and educationally.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/12101.html#a_6" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §12101(a)(6)</a>.  As to employment, Congress found that [t]wo-thirds of all disabled Americans between the age of 16 and 64 [were] not working at all, even though a large majority wanted to, and were able to, work productively.  S. Rep. No. 101116, at 9.  And Congress found that this discrimination flowed in significant part from stereotypic assumptions as well as purposeful unequal treatment.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/12101.html#a_7" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §12101(a)(7)</a>.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The powerful evidence of discriminatory treatment throughout society in general, including discrimination by private persons and local governments, implicates state governments as well, for state agencies form part of that same larger society.  There is no particular reason to believe that they are immune from the stereotypic assumptions and pattern of purposeful unequal treatment that Congress found prevalent.  The Court claims that it make[s] no sense to take into consideration constitutional violations committed by local governments.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 71.  But the substantive obligation that the Equal Protection Clause creates applies to state and local governmental entities alike.  
				<em>
					E.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Richmond
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					J. A. Croson Co.,

.  Local governments often work closely with, and under the supervision of, state officials, and in general, state and local government employers are similarly situated.  Nor is determining whether an apparently local entity is entitled to 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxi" class="subref" title="subref">Eleventh Amendment</a> immunity as simple as the majority suggestsit often requires a  detailed examination of the relevant provisions of [state] law. 

				In any event, there is no need to rest solely upon evidence of discrimination by local governments or general societal discrimination.  There are roughly 300 examples of discrimination by state governments themselves in the legislative record.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 Appendix C, 
				<em>
					infra.
				</em>
				  I fail to see how this evidence fall[s] far short of even suggesting the pattern of unconstitutional discrimination on which §5 legislation must be based.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The congressionally appointed task force collected numerous specific examples, provided by persons with disabilities themselves, of adverse, disparate treatment by state officials.  They reveal, not what the Court describes as half a dozen instances of discrimination, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 11, but hundreds of instances of adverse treatment at the hands of state officialsinstances in which a person with a disability found it impossible to obtain a state job, to retain state employment, to use the public transportation that was readily available to others in order to get to work, or to obtain a public education, which is often a prerequisite to obtaining employment.  State-imposed barriers also frequently made it difficult or impossible for people to vote, to enter a public building, to access important government services, such as calling for emergency assistance, and to find a place to live due to a pattern of irrational zoning decisions similar to the discrimination that we held unconstitutional in

				As the Court notes, those who presented instances of discrimination rarely provided additional, independent evidence sufficient to prove in court that, in each instance, the discrimination they suffered lacked justification from a judicial standpoint.  Ante

				But a legislature is not a court of law.  And Congress, unlike courts, must, and does, routinely draw general conclusionsfor example, of likely motive or of likely relationship to legitimate needfrom anecdotal and opinion-based evidence of this kind, particularly when the evidence lacks strong refutation.  See Task Force Report 16, 20 (task force met many times with significant representatives of groups opposed to [the] ADA, and as to the general public, although the task force received about 2,000 letters in support of the ADA, there was only one letter in opposition); S. Rep. No. 101116, at 10 (summarizing testimony that many reasonable accommodations cost less than $50, and the expense of others, such as hiring employees who can interpret for the deaf, is frequently exaggerated).  In reviewing §5 legislation, we have never required the sort of extensive investigation of each piece of evidence that the Court appears to contemplate.  Compare

				The evidence in the legislative record bears out Congress finding that the adverse treatment of persons with disabilities was often arbitrary or invidious in this sense, and thus unjustified.  For example, one study that was before Congress revealed that most … governmental agencies in [one State] discriminated in hiring against job applicants for an average period of five years after treatment for cancer, based in part on coworkers misguided belief that cancer is contagious.  2 Leg. Hist. 16191620 (testimony of Arlene B. Mayerson).  A school inexplicably refused to exempt a deaf teacher, who taught at a school for the deaf, from a listening skills requirement.

A complete listing of the hundreds of examples of discrimination by state and local governments that were submitted to the task force is set forth in Appendix C,

				Indeed, the Court in

				 drew this very institutional distinction.  We emphasized that courts have been very reluctant, as they should be in our federal system and with our respect for the separation of powers, to closely scrutinize legislative choices.  473 U.

				There is simply no reason to require Congress, seeking to determine facts relevant to the exercise of its §5 authority, to adopt rules or presumptions that reflect a courts institutional limitations.  Unlike courts, Congress can readily gather facts from across the Nation, assess the magnitude of a problem, and more easily find an appropriate remedy.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Cleburne
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 442443 (addressing the problems of the large and diversified group of persons with disabilities is a difficult and often a technical matter, very much a task for legislators guided by qualified professionals and not by the perhaps ill-informed opinions of the judiciary).  Unlike courts, Congress directly reflects public attitudes and beliefs, enabling Congress better to understand where, and to what extent, refusals to accommodate a disability amount to behavior that is callous or unreasonable to the point of lacking constitutional justification.  Unlike judges, Members of Congress can directly obtain information from constituents who have first-hand experience with discrimination and related issues.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Moreover, unlike judges, Members of Congress are elected.  When the Court has applied the majoritys burden of proof rule, it has explained that we, 
				<em>
					i.e.,
				</em>
				 the courts, do not  sit as a superlegislature to judge the wisdom or desirability of legislative policy determinations. 

				).  To apply a rule designed to restrict courts as if it restricted Congress legislative power is to stand the underlying principlea principle of judicial restrainton its head.  But without the use of this burden of proof rule or some other unusually stringent standard of review, it is difficult to see how the Court can find the legislative record here inadequate.  Read with a reasonably favorable eye, the record indicates that state governments subjected those with disabilities to seriously adverse, disparate treatment.  And Congress could have found, in a significant number of instances, that this treatment violated the substantive principles of justificationshorn of their judicial-restraint-related presumptionsthat this Court recognized in

				And what is wrong with a remedy that, in response to unreasonable employer behavior, requires an employer to make accommodations that are reasonable?  Of course, what is reasonable in the statutory sense and what is unreasonable in the constitutional sense might differ.  In other words, the requirement may exceed what is necessary to avoid a constitutional violation.  But it is just that powerthe power to require more than the minimum that §5 grants to Congress, as this Court has repeatedly confirmed.  As long ago as 1880, the Court wrote that §5 brought within the domain of congressional power whatever tends to enforce submission to its prohibitions and to secure to all persons … the equal protection of the laws.

				The Court says that its primary problem with this statutory provision is one of legislative evidence.  It says that Congress assembled only …  minimal evidence of unconstitutional state discrimination in employment.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 12.  In fact, Congress compiled a vast legislative record documenting  massive, society-wide discrimination  against persons with disabilities.  S. Rep. No. 101116, pp. 89 (1989) (quoting testimony of Justin Dart, chairperson of the Task Force on the Rights and Empowerment of Americans with Disabilities).  In addition to the information presented at 13 congressional hearings (see Appendix A, 
				<em>
					infra
				</em>
				), and its own prior experience gathered over 40 years during which it contemplated and enacted considerable similar legislation (see Appendix B, 
				<em>
					infra
				</em>
				), Congress created a special task force to assess the need for comprehensive legislation.  That task force held hearings in every State, attended by more than 30,000 people, including thousands who had experienced discrimination first hand.  See From ADA to Empowerment, Task Force on the Rights and Empowerment of Americans with Disabilities, 16 (Oct. 12, 1990) (hereinafter Task Force Report).  The task force hearings, Congress own hearings, and an analysis of census data, national polls, and other studies led Congress to conclude that people with disabilities, as a group, occupy an inferior status in our society, and are severely disadvantaged socially, vocationally, economically, and educationally.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/12101.html#a_6" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §12101(a)(6)</a>.  As to employment, Congress found that [t]wo-thirds of all disabled Americans between the age of 16 and 64 [were] not working at all, even though a large majority wanted to, and were able to, work productively.  S. Rep. No. 101116, at 9.  And Congress found that this discrimination flowed in significant part from stereotypic assumptions as well as purposeful unequal treatment.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/12101.html#a_7" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §12101(a)(7)</a>.

				The powerful evidence of discriminatory treatment throughout society in general, including discrimination by private persons and local governments, implicates state governments as well, for state agencies form part of that same larger society.  There is no particular reason to believe that they are immune from the stereotypic assumptions and pattern of purposeful unequal treatment that Congress found prevalent.  The Court claims that it make[s] no sense to take into consideration constitutional violations committed by local governments.  
				<em>

.  Local governments often work closely with, and under the supervision of, state officials, and in general, state and local government employers are similarly situated.  Nor is determining whether an apparently local entity is entitled to 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxi" class="subref" title="subref">Eleventh Amendment</a> immunity as simple as the majority suggestsit often requires a  detailed examination of the relevant provisions of [state] law. 

				In any event, there is no need to rest solely upon evidence of discrimination by local governments or general societal discrimination.  There are roughly 300 examples of discrimination by state governments themselves in the legislative record.  See,

				The congressionally appointed task force collected numerous specific examples, provided by persons with disabilities themselves, of adverse, disparate treatment by state officials.  They reveal, not what the Court describes as half a dozen instances of discrimination, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 11, but hundreds of instances of adverse treatment at the hands of state officialsinstances in which a person with a disability found it impossible to obtain a state job, to retain state employment, to use the public transportation that was readily available to others in order to get to work, or to obtain a public education, which is often a prerequisite to obtaining employment.  State-imposed barriers also frequently made it difficult or impossible for people to vote, to enter a public building, to access important government services, such as calling for emergency assistance, and to find a place to live due to a pattern of irrational zoning decisions similar to the discrimination that we held unconstitutional in

				As the Court notes, those who presented instances of discrimination rarely provided additional, independent evidence sufficient to prove in court that, in each instance, the discrimination they suffered lacked justification from a judicial standpoint.  Ante
				, at 12 (stating that instances of discrimination are described out of context).  Perhaps this explains the Courts view that there is minimal evidence of unconstitutional state discrimination.  
				<em>
					Ibid.  
				</em>
				But a legislature is not a court of law.  And Congress, unlike courts, must, and does, routinely draw general conclusionsfor example, of likely motive or of likely relationship to legitimate needfrom anecdotal and opinion-based evidence of this kind, particularly when the evidence lacks strong refutation.  See Task Force Report 16, 20 (task force met many times with significant representatives of groups opposed to [the] ADA, and as to the general public, although the task force received about 2,000 letters in support of the ADA, there was only one letter in opposition); S. Rep. No. 101116, at 10 (summarizing testimony that many reasonable accommodations cost less than $50, and the expense of others, such as hiring employees who can interpret for the deaf, is frequently exaggerated).  In reviewing §5 legislation, we have never required the sort of extensive investigation of each piece of evidence that the Court appears to contemplate.  Compare 
				<em>

				</em>
				, at 1213, with 
				<em>
					Katzenbach

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">652</a>656 (1966)
 (asking whether Congress likely conclusions were reasonable, not whether there was adequate evidentiary support in the record).  Nor has the Court traditionally required Congress to make findings as to state discrimination, or to break down the record evidence, category by category.  Compare 
				<em>
					ante, 
				</em>
				at 13 (noting statements in two congressional Reports that mentioned state discrimination in public services and transportation but not in employment), with 
				<em>
					Morgan, supra

				, at 654 (considering what Congress might have concluded); 384 U. S., at 652 (holding that likely discrimination against Puerto Ricans in areas other than voting supported statute abolishing literacy test as qualification for voting).

				The evidence in the legislative record bears out Congress finding that the adverse treatment of persons with disabilities was often arbitrary or invidious in this sense, and thus unjustified.  For example, one study that was before Congress revealed that most … governmental agencies in [one State] discriminated in hiring against job applicants for an average period of five years after treatment for cancer, based in part on coworkers misguided belief that cancer is contagious.  2 Leg. Hist. 16191620 (testimony of Arlene B. Mayerson).  A school inexplicably refused to exempt a deaf teacher, who taught at a school for the deaf, from a listening skills requirement.  Governments Lodging 1503.  A State refused to hire a blind employee as director of an agency for the blindeven though he was the most qualified applicant.

				, at 1159, 1577.  A zoo turned away children with Downs Syndrome because [the zookeeper] feared they would upset the chimpanzees.  S. Rep. No. 101116, at 7.  There were reports of numerous zoning decisions based upon negative attitudes or fear,

				, at 448, such as a zoning board that denied a permit for an obviously pretextual reason after hearing arguments that a facility would house  deviants  who needed  room to roam,  Governments Lodging 1068.  A complete listing of the hundreds of examples of discrimination by state and local governments that were submitted to the task force is set forth in Appendix C,

				Indeed, the Court in

				 drew this very institutional distinction.  We emphasized that courts have been very reluctant, as they should be in our federal system and with our respect for the separation of powers, to closely scrutinize legislative choices.  473 U. S., at 441.  Our invocation of judicial deference and respect for Congress was based on the fact that [§]5 of the [Fourteenth] Amendment empowers

Indeed, we made clear that the absence of a contrary congressional finding was critical to our decision to apply mere rational-basis review to disability discrimination claimsa congressional direction to apply a more stringent standard would have been controlling.

				There is simply no reason to require Congress, seeking to determine facts relevant to the exercise of its §5 authority, to adopt rules or presumptions that reflect a courts institutional limitations.  Unlike courts, Congress can readily gather facts from across the Nation, assess the magnitude of a problem, and more easily find an appropriate remedy.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Cleburne
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 442443 (addressing the problems of the large and diversified group of persons with disabilities is a difficult and often a technical matter, very much a task for legislators guided by qualified professionals and not by the perhaps ill-informed opinions of the judiciary).  Unlike courts, Congress directly reflects public attitudes and beliefs, enabling Congress better to understand where, and to what extent, refusals to accommodate a disability amount to behavior that is callous or unreasonable to the point of lacking constitutional justification.  Unlike judges, Members of Congress can directly obtain information from constituents who have first-hand experience with discrimination and related issues.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Moreover, unlike judges, Members of Congress are elected.  When the Court has applied the majoritys burden of proof rule, it has explained that we, 
				<em>
					i.e.,
				</em>
				 the courts, do not  sit as a superlegislature to judge the wisdom or desirability of legislative policy determinations. 

				).  To apply a rule designed to restrict courts as if it restricted Congress legislative power is to stand the underlying principlea principle of judicial restrainton its head.  But without the use of this burden of proof rule or some other unusually stringent standard of review, it is difficult to see how the Court can find the legislative record here inadequate.  Read with a reasonably favorable eye, the record indicates that state governments subjected those with disabilities to seriously adverse, disparate treatment.  And Congress could have found, in a significant number of instances, that this treatment violated the substantive principles of justificationshorn of their judicial-restraint-related presumptionsthat this Court recognized in

				And what is wrong with a remedy that, in response to unreasonable employer behavior, requires an employer to make accommodations that are reasonable?  Of course, what is reasonable in the statutory sense and what is unreasonable in the constitutional sense might differ.  In other words, the requirement may exceed what is necessary to avoid a constitutional violation.  But it is just that powerthe power to require more than the minimum that §5 grants to Congress, as this Court has repeatedly confirmed.  As long ago as 1880, the Court wrote that §5 brought within the domain of congressional power whatever tends to enforce submission to its prohibitions and to secure to all persons … the equal protection of the laws.

				Reviewing the congressional record as if it were an administrative agency record, the Court holds the statutory provision before us,

No. 101116, pp. 89 (1989) (quoting testimony of Justin Dart, chairperson of the Task Force on the Rights and Empowerment of Americans with Disabilities).  In addition to the information presented at 13 congressional hearings (see Appendix A, 
				<em>
					infra
				</em>
				), and its own prior experience gathered over 40 years during which it contemplated and enacted considerable similar legislation (see Appendix B, 
				<em>
					infra

				), Congress created a special task force to assess the need for comprehensive legislation.  That task force held hearings in every State, attended by more than 30,000 people, including thousands who had experienced discrimination first hand.  See From ADA to Empowerment, Task Force on the Rights and Empowerment of Americans with Disabilities, 16 (Oct. 12, 1990) (hereinafter Task Force Report).  The task force hearings, Congress own hearings, and an analysis of census data, national polls, and other studies led Congress to conclude that people with disabilities, as a group, occupy an inferior status in our society, and are severely disadvantaged socially, vocationally, economically, and educationally.

				The powerful evidence of discriminatory treatment throughout society in general, including discrimination by private persons and local governments, implicates state governments as well, for state agencies form part of that same larger society.  There is no particular reason to believe that they are immune from the stereotypic assumptions and pattern of purposeful unequal treatment that Congress found prevalent.  The Court claims that it make[s] no sense to take into consideration constitutional violations committed by local governments.

				The congressionally appointed task force collected numerous specific examples, provided by persons with disabilities themselves, of adverse, disparate treatment by state officials.  They reveal, not what the Court describes as half a dozen instances of discrimination, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 11, but hundreds of instances of adverse treatment at the hands of state officialsinstances in which a person with a disability found it impossible to obtain a state job, to retain state employment, to use the public transportation that was readily available to others in order to get to work, or to obtain a public education, which is often a prerequisite to obtaining employment.  State-imposed barriers also frequently made it difficult or impossible for people to vote, to enter a public building, to access important government services, such as calling for emergency assistance, and to find a place to live due to a pattern of irrational zoning decisions similar to the discrimination that we held unconstitutional in

				But a legislature is not a court of law.  And Congress, unlike courts, must, and does, routinely draw general conclusionsfor example, of likely motive or of likely relationship to legitimate needfrom anecdotal and opinion-based evidence of this kind, particularly when the evidence lacks strong refutation.  See Task Force Report 16, 20 (task force met many times with significant representatives of groups opposed to [the] ADA, and as to the general public, although the task force received about 2,000 letters in support of the ADA, there was only one letter in opposition); S. Rep. No. 101116, at 10 (summarizing testimony that many reasonable accommodations cost less than $50, and the expense of others, such as hiring employees who can interpret for the deaf, is frequently exaggerated).

				The evidence in the legislative record bears out Congress finding that the adverse treatment of persons with disabilities was often arbitrary or invidious in this sense, and thus unjustified.  For example, one study that was before Congress revealed that most … governmental agencies in [one State] discriminated in hiring against job applicants for an average period of five years after treatment for cancer, based in part on coworkers misguided belief that cancer is contagious.  2 Leg.

				There is simply no reason to require Congress, seeking to determine facts relevant to the exercise of its §5 authority, to adopt rules or presumptions that reflect a courts institutional limitations.

Unlike courts, Congress directly reflects public attitudes and beliefs, enabling Congress better to understand where, and to what extent, refusals to accommodate a disability amount to behavior that is callous or unreasonable to the point of lacking constitutional justification.  Unlike judges, Members of Congress can directly obtain information from constituents who have first-hand experience with discrimination and related issues.

				Moreover, unlike judges, Members of Congress are elected.  When the Court has applied the majoritys burden of proof rule, it has explained that we,

But without the use of this burden of proof rule or some other unusually stringent standard of review, it is difficult to see how the Court can find the legislative record here inadequate.  Read with a reasonably favorable eye, the record indicates that state governments subjected those with disabilities to seriously adverse, disparate treatment.

				And what is wrong with a remedy that, in response to unreasonable employer behavior, requires an employer to make accommodations that are reasonable?  Of course, what is reasonable in the statutory sense and what is unreasonable in the constitutional sense might differ.  In other words, the requirement may exceed what is necessary to avoid a constitutional violation.  But it is just that powerthe power to require more than the minimum that §5 grants to Congress, as this Court has repeatedly confirmed.  As long ago as 1880, the Court wrote that §5 brought within the domain of congressional power whatever tends to enforce submission to its prohibitions and to secure to all persons … the equal protection of the laws.

				In keeping with these principles, the Court has said that [i]t is not for us to review the congressional resolution of the various conflicting considerationsthe risk or pervasiveness of the discrimination in governmental services … , the adequacy or availability of alternative remedies, and the nature and significance of the state interests that would be affected.  384 U.

				The Courts harsh review of Congress use of its §5 power is reminiscent of the similar (nowdiscredited) limitation that it once imposed upon Congress Commerce Clause power.  Compare

				<em>

				I recognize nonetheless that this statute imposes a burden upon States in that it removes their 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxi" class="subref" title="subref">Eleventh Amendment</a> protection from suit, thereby subjecting them to potential monetary liability.  Rules for interpreting §5 that would provide States with special protection, however, run counter to the very object of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>.  By its terms, that Amendment prohibits 
				<em>
					States
				</em>
				 from denying their citizens equal protection of the laws.  U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, §1.  Hence principles of federalism that might otherwise be an obstacle to congressional authority are necessarily overridden by the power to enforce the Civil War Amendments by appropriate legislation.  Those Amendments were specifically designed as an expansion of federal power and an intrusion on state sovereignty.

				Reviewing the congressional record as if it were an administrative agency record, the Court holds the statutory provision before us, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/12202.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §12202</a>, unconstitutional.  The Court concludes that Congress assembled insufficient evidence of unconstitutional discrimination,

				The Court says that its primary problem with this statutory provision is one of legislative evidence.  It says that Congress assembled only …  minimal evidence of unconstitutional state discrimination in employment.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 12.  In fact, Congress compiled a vast legislative record documenting  massive, society-wide discrimination  against persons with disabilities.  S. Rep. No. 101116, pp. 89 (1989) (quoting testimony of Justin Dart, chairperson of the Task Force on the Rights and Empowerment of Americans with Disabilities).  In addition to the information presented at 13 congressional hearings (see Appendix A, 
				<em>
					infra
				</em>
				), and its own prior experience gathered over 40 years during which it contemplated and enacted considerable similar legislation (see Appendix B, 
				<em>
					infra
				</em>
				), Congress created a special task force to assess the need for comprehensive legislation.  That task force held hearings in every State, attended by more than 30,000 people, including thousands who had experienced discrimination first hand.  See From ADA to Empowerment, Task Force on the Rights and Empowerment of Americans with Disabilities, 16 (Oct. 12, 1990) (hereinafter Task Force Report).  The task force hearings, Congress own hearings, and an analysis of census data, national polls, and other studies led Congress to conclude that people with disabilities, as a group, occupy an inferior status in our society, and are severely disadvantaged socially, vocationally, economically, and educationally.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/12101.html#a_6" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §12101(a)(6)</a>.  As to employment, Congress found that [t]wo-thirds of all disabled Americans between the age of 16 and 64 [were] not working at all, even though a large majority wanted to, and were able to, work productively.  S. Rep. No. 101116, at 9.  And Congress found that this discrimination flowed in significant part from stereotypic assumptions as well as purposeful unequal treatment.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/12101.html#a_7" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §12101(a)(7)</a>.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The powerful evidence of discriminatory treatment throughout society in general, including discrimination by private persons and local governments, implicates state governments as well, for state agencies form part of that same larger society.  There is no particular reason to believe that they are immune from the stereotypic assumptions and pattern of purposeful unequal treatment that Congress found prevalent.  The Court claims that it make[s] no sense to take into consideration constitutional violations committed by local governments.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 71.  But the substantive obligation that the Equal Protection Clause creates applies to state and local governmental entities alike.  
				<em>
					E.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Richmond
				</em>
				 v.

.  Local governments often work closely with, and under the supervision of, state officials, and in general, state and local government employers are similarly situated.  Nor is determining whether an apparently local entity is entitled to 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxi" class="subref" title="subref">Eleventh Amendment</a> immunity as simple as the majority suggestsit often requires a  detailed examination of the relevant provisions of [state] law. 

				In any event, there is no need to rest solely upon evidence of discrimination by local governments or general societal discrimination.  There are roughly 300 examples of discrimination by state governments themselves in the legislative record.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 Appendix C, 
				<em>
					infra.
				</em>
				  I fail to see how this evidence fall[s] far short of even suggesting the pattern of unconstitutional discrimination on which §5 legislation must be based.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The congressionally appointed task force collected numerous specific examples, provided by persons with disabilities themselves, of adverse, disparate treatment by state officials.  They reveal, not what the Court describes as half a dozen instances of discrimination, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 11, but hundreds of instances of adverse treatment at the hands of state officialsinstances in which a person with a disability found it impossible to obtain a state job, to retain state employment, to use the public transportation that was readily available to others in order to get to work, or to obtain a public education, which is often a prerequisite to obtaining employment.  State-imposed barriers also frequently made it difficult or impossible for people to vote, to enter a public building, to access important government services, such as calling for emergency assistance, and to find a place to live due to a pattern of irrational zoning decisions similar to the discrimination that we held unconstitutional in 
				<em>
					Cleburne,
				</em>
				 473 U. S., at 448.  See Appendix C, infra.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				As the Court notes, those who presented instances of discrimination rarely provided additional, independent evidence sufficient to prove in court that, in each instance, the discrimination they suffered lacked justification from a judicial standpoint.  Ante
				, at 12 (stating that instances of discrimination are described out of context).  Perhaps this explains the Courts view that there is minimal evidence of unconstitutional state discrimination.  
				<em>
					Ibid.  
				</em>
				But a legislature is not a court of law.  And Congress, unlike courts, must, and does, routinely draw general conclusionsfor example, of likely motive or of likely relationship to legitimate needfrom anecdotal and opinion-based evidence of this kind, particularly when the evidence lacks strong refutation.  See Task Force Report 16, 20 (task force met many times with significant representatives of groups opposed to [the] ADA, and as to the general public, although the task force received about 2,000 letters in support of the ADA, there was only one letter in opposition); S. Rep. No. 101116, at 10 (summarizing testimony that many reasonable accommodations cost less than $50, and the expense of others, such as hiring employees who can interpret for the deaf, is frequently exaggerated).  In reviewing §5 legislation, we have never required the sort of extensive investigation of each piece of evidence that the Court appears to contemplate.  Compare

				The evidence in the legislative record bears out Congress finding that the adverse treatment of persons with disabilities was often arbitrary or invidious in this sense, and thus unjustified.  For example, one study that was before Congress revealed that most … governmental agencies in [one State] discriminated in hiring against job applicants for an average period of five years after treatment for cancer, based in part on coworkers misguided belief that cancer is contagious.  2 Leg.

				Indeed, the Court in

				There is simply no reason to require Congress, seeking to determine facts relevant to the exercise of its §5 authority, to adopt rules or presumptions that reflect a courts institutional limitations.  Unlike courts, Congress can readily gather facts from across the Nation, assess the magnitude of a problem, and more easily find an appropriate remedy.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Cleburne
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 442443 (addressing the problems of the large and diversified group of persons with disabilities is a difficult and often a technical matter, very much a task for legislators guided by qualified professionals and not by the perhaps ill-informed opinions of the judiciary).  Unlike courts, Congress directly reflects public attitudes and beliefs, enabling Congress better to understand where, and to what extent, refusals to accommodate a disability amount to behavior that is callous or unreasonable to the point of lacking constitutional justification.  Unlike judges, Members of Congress can directly obtain information from constituents who have first-hand experience with discrimination and related issues.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Moreover, unlike judges, Members of Congress are elected.  When the Court has applied the majoritys burden of proof rule, it has explained that we, 
				<em>

				 the courts, do not  sit as a superlegislature to judge the wisdom or desirability of legislative policy determinations. 

				).  To apply a rule designed to restrict courts as if it restricted Congress legislative power is to stand the underlying principlea principle of judicial restrainton its head.  But without the use of this burden of proof rule or some other unusually stringent standard of review, it is difficult to see how the Court can find the legislative record here inadequate.  Read with a reasonably favorable eye, the record indicates that state governments subjected those with disabilities to seriously adverse, disparate treatment.  And Congress could have found, in a significant number of instances, that this treatment violated the substantive principles of justificationshorn of their judicial-restraint-related presumptionsthat this Court recognized in

				And what is wrong with a remedy that, in response to unreasonable employer behavior, requires an employer to make accommodations that are reasonable?  Of course, what is reasonable in the statutory sense and what is unreasonable in the constitutional sense might differ.  In other words, the requirement may exceed what is necessary to avoid a constitutional violation.  But it is just that powerthe power to require more than the minimum that §5 grants to Congress, as this Court has repeatedly confirmed.  As long ago as 1880, the Court wrote that §5 brought within the domain of congressional power whatever tends to enforce submission to its prohibitions and to secure to all persons … the equal protection of the laws.

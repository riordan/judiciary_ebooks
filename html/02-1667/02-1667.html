        <p class="bodytext">
				Respondent paraplegics filed this action for damages and equitable relief, alleging that Tennessee and a number of its counties had denied them physical access to that States courts in violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), which provides: [N]o qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation or denied the benefits of the services, programs or activities of a public entity, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/12132.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §12132</a>.  After the District Court denied the States motion to dismiss on 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxi" class="subref" title="subref">Eleventh Amendment</a> immunity grounds, the Sixth Circuit held the appeal in abeyance pending 
				<em>
					Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Garrett,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/531/356" class="subref" title="subref">531 U. S. 356</a>.  This Court later ruled in 
				<em>
					Garrett
				</em>
				 that the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxi" class="subref" title="subref">Eleventh Amendment</a> bars private money damages actions for state violations of ADA Title I, which prohibits employment discrimination against the disabled.  The en banc Sixth Circuit then issued its 
				<em>
					Popovich 
				</em>
				decision, in which it interpreted 
				<em>
					Garrett
				</em>
				 to bar private ADA suits against States based on equal protection principles, but not those relying on due process, and therefore permitted a Title II damages action to proceed despite the States immunity claim.  Thereafter, a Sixth Circuit panel affirmed the dismissal denial in this case, explaining that respondents claims were not barred because they were based on due process principles.  In response to a rehearing petition arguing that 
				<em>
					Popovich 
				</em>
				did not control because respondents complaint did not allege due process violations, the panel filed an amended opinion, explaining that due process protects the right of access to the courts, and that the evidence before Congress when it enacted Title II established, 
				<em>
					inter alia
				</em>
				, that physical barriers in courthouses and courtrooms have had the effect of denying disabled people the opportunity for such access.

        <p class="SYLCTE">
            <em>

				</em>
				As it applies to the class of cases implicating the fundamental right of access to the courts, Title II constitutes a valid exercise of Congress authority under §5 of the

				(a) Determining whether Congress has constitutionally abrogated a States 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxi" class="subref" title="subref">Eleventh Amendment</a> immunity requires resolution of two predicate questions: (1) whether Congress unequivocally expressed its intent to abrogate; and (2), if so, whether it acted pursuant to a valid grant of constitutional authority.  
				<em>
					Kimel

				 v. 
				<em>
					Florida Bd. of Regents,

            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/528/62" class="subref" title="subref">528 U. S. 62</a>.  The first question is easily answered here, since the ADA specifically provides for abrogation.  See §12202.  With regard to the second question, Congress can abrogate state sovereign immunity pursuant to a valid exercise of its power under §5 of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>.  
				<em>
					E.g., Fitzpatrick

				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/427/445" class="subref" title="subref">427 U. S. 445</a>.  That power is not, however, unlimited.  While Congress must have a wide berth in devising appropriate remedial and preventative measures for unconstitutional actions, those measures may not work a substantive change in the governing law.  
				<em>
					City of Boerne

				 v. 
				<em>
					Flores,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/521/507" class="subref" title="subref">521 U. S. 507</a>.  In 
				<em>
					Boerne
				</em>
				, the Court set forth the test for distinguishing between permissible remedial legislation and unconstitutional substantive redefinition: Section 5 legislation is valid if it exhibits a congruence and proportionality between an injury and the means adopted to prevent or remedy it.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 520.  Applying the 
				<em>
					Boerne
				</em>
				 test in 
				<em>
					Garrett
				</em>
				, the Court concluded that ADA Title I was not a valid exercise of Congress §5 power because the historical record and the statutes broad sweep suggested that Title Is true aim was not so much enforcement, but an attempt to rewrite this Courts 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a> jurisprudence.  531 U. S., at 372374.  In view of significant differences between Titles I and II, however, 
				<em>
					Garrett
				</em>
				 left open the question whether Title II is a valid exercise of Congress §5 power,

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				
				    
				(1) The 
				<em>
					Boerne
				</em>
				 inquirys first step requires identification of the constitutional rights Congress sought to enforce when it enacted Title II.  
				<em>
					Garrett,
				</em>
				 531 U. S., at 365.  Like Title I, Title II seeks to enforce the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>s prohibition on irrational disability discrimination, 
				<em>
					Garrett,
				</em>
				 531 U. S., at 366.  But it also seeks to enforce a variety of other basic constitutional guarantees, including some, like the right of access to the courts here at issue, infringements of which are subject to heightened judicial scrutiny.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g., Dunn
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Blumstein,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/405/330" class="subref" title="subref">405 U. S. 330</a>.  Whether Title II validly enforces such constitutional rights is a question that must be judged with reference to the historical experience which it reflects.  
				<em>
					E.g., South Carolina
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Katzenbach,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/383/301" class="subref" title="subref">383 U. S. 301</a>.  Congress enacted Title II against a backdrop of pervasive unequal treatment of persons with disabilities in the administration of state services and programs, including systematic deprivations of fundamental rights.  The historical experience that Title II reflects is also documented in the decisions of this and other courts, which have identified unconstitutional treatment of disabled persons by state agencies in a variety of public programs and services.  With respect to the particular services at issue, Congress learned that many individuals, in many States, were being excluded from courthouses and court proceedings by reason of their disabilities.  A Civil Rights Commission report before Congress showed that some 76% of public services and programs housed in state-owned buildings were inaccessible to and unusable by such persons.  Congress also heard testimony from those persons describing the physical inaccessibility of local courthouses.  And its appointed task force heard numerous examples of their exclusion from state judicial services and programs, including failure to make courtrooms accessible to witnesses with physical disabilities.  The sheer volume of such evidence far exceeds the record in last Terms 
				<em>
					Nevada Dept. of Human Resources 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					Hibbs, 
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/538/721" class="subref" title="subref">538 U. S. 721</a>, in which the Court approved the family-care leave provision of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 as valid §5 legislation.  Congress finding in the ADA that discrimination against individuals with disabilities persists in such critical areas as … access to public services, §12101(a)(3), together with the extensive record of disability discrimination that underlies it, makes clear that inadequate provision of public services and access to public facilities was an appropriate subject for prophylactic legislation.  Pp. 1118.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				
				    
				(2) Title II is an appropriate response to this history and pattern of unequal treatment.  Unquestionably, it is valid §5 legislation as it applies to the class of cases implicating the accessibility of judicial services.  Congress chosen remedy for the pattern of exclusion and discrimination at issue, Title IIs requirement of program accessibility, is congruent and proportional to its object of enforcing the right of access to the courts.  The long history of unequal treatment of disabled persons in the administration of judicial services has persisted despite several state and federal legislative efforts to remedy the problem.  Faced with considerable evidence of the shortcomings of these previous efforts, Congress was justified in concluding that the difficult and intractable problem of disability discrimination warranted added prophylactic measures.  
				<em>
					Hibbs, 
				</em>
				538 U. S., at 737.  The remedy Congress chose is nevertheless a limited one.  Recognizing that failure to accommodate persons with disabilities will often have the same practical effect as outright exclusion, Congress required the States to take reasonable measures to remove architectural and other barriers to accessibility.  §12132.  But Title II does not require States to employ any and all means to make judicial services accessible or to compromise essential eligibility criteria for public programs.  It requires only reasonable modifications that would not fundamentally alter the nature of the service provided, and only when the individual seeking modification is otherwise eligible for the service.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  Title IIs implementing regulations make clear that the reasonable modification requirement can be satisfied in various ways, including less costly measures than structural changes.  This duty to accommodate is perfectly consistent with the well-established due process principle that, within the limits of practicability, a State must afford to all individuals a meaningful opportunity to be heard in its courts.  
				<em>
					Boddie, 
				</em>
				401 U. S., at 379.  A number of affirmative obligations flow from this principle.  Cases such as 
				<em>
					Boddie, Griffin
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Illinois,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/351/12" class="subref" title="subref">351 U. S. 12</a>, and 
				<em>
					Gideon

				 v. 
				<em>

				</em>

S. 335</a>, make clear that ordinary considerations of cost and convenience alone cannot justify a States failure to provide individuals with a meaningful right of access to the courts.  Judged against this backdrop, Title IIs affirmative obligation to accommodate is a reasonable prophylactic measure, reasonably targeted to a legitimate end.  Pp. 1823.

				<em>

				Having traced the metes and bounds of the constitutional rights at issue, the next step in the congruence-and-proportionality inquiry requires us to examine whether Congress identified a history and pattern of violations of these constitutional rights by the States with respect to the disabled.  
				<em>
					Garrett, 
				</em>
				531 U. S., at 368.  This step is crucial to determining whether Title II is a legitimate attempt to remedy or prevent actual constitutional violations by the States or an illegitimate attempt to rewrite the constitutional provisions it purports to enforce.  Indeed, Congress §5 power is appropriately exercised 
				<em>
					only
				</em>
				 in response to state transgressions.

				Rather than limiting its discussion of constitutional violations to the due process rights on which it ultimately relies, the majority sets out on a wide-ranging account of societal discrimination against the disabled.

This digression recounts historical discrimination against the disabled through institutionalization laws, restrictions on marriage, voting, and public education, conditions in mental hospitals, and various other forms of unequal treatment in the administration of public programs and services.  Some of this evidence would be relevant if the Court were considering the constitutionality of the statute as a whole; but the Court rejects that approach in favor of a narrower as-applied inquiry.

				Lacking any real evidence that Congress was responding to actual due process violations, the majority relies primarily on three items to justify its decision: (1) a 1983 U. S. Civil Rights Commission Report showing that 76% of public services and programs housed in state-owned buildings were inaccessible to persons with disabilities, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1516; (2) testimony before a House subcommittee regarding the physical inaccessibility of local courthouses, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16; and (3) evidence submitted to Congress designated ADA task force that purportedly contains numerous examples of the exclusion of persons with disabilities from state judicial services and programs.  Ibid.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				On closer examination, however, the Civil Rights Commissions finding consists of a single conclusory sentence in its report, and it is far from clear that its finding even includes courthouses. The House subcommittee report, for its part, contains the testimony of two
				 witnesses, neither of whom reported being denied the right to be present at constitutionally protected court proceedings.

                </sup>
            </a>
				  Indeed, the witnesses testimony, like the U. S. Civil Rights Commission Report, concerns only physical barriers to access, and does not address whether States either provided means to overcome those barriers or alternative locations for proceedings involving disabled persons.  Cf., n. 4, 
				<em>

				Based on the majoritys description, 
				<em>
					ante, 
				</em>
				at 16, the report of the ADA Task Force on the Rights and Empowerment of Americans with Disabilities sounds promising.  But the report itself says nothing about any disabled person being denied access to court.  The Court thus apparently relies solely on a general citation to the Governments Lodging in 
				<em>
					Garrett
				</em>
				, O. T. 2000, No. 991240 which, amidst thousands of pages, contains only a few anecdotal handwritten reports of physically inaccessible courthouses, again with no mention of whether States provided alternate means of access.  This evidence, moreover, was submitted not to Congress, but only to the task force, which itself made no findings regarding disabled persons access to judicial proceedings.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Garrett
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				531 U. S., at 370371 (rejecting anecdotal task force evidence for similar reasons).  As we noted in

				Even if the anecdotal evidence and conclusory statements relied on by the majority could be properly considered, the mere existence of an architecturally inaccessible courthouse
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, one a disabled person cannot utilize without assistancedoes not state a constitutional violation.  A violation of due process occurs only when a person is actually denied the constitutional right to access a given  judicial proceeding.  We have never held that a person has a 
				<em>
					constitutional
				</em>
				 right to make his way into a courtroom without any external assistance.  Indeed, the fact that the State may need to assist an individual to attend a hearing has no bearing on whether the individual successfully exercises his due process right to be present at the proceeding.  Nor does an inaccessible courthouse violate the Equal Protection Clause, unless it is irrational for the State not to alter the courthouse to make it accessible.  But financial considerations almost always furnish a rational basis for a State to decline to make those alterations.  See 
				<em>
					Garrett, 
				</em>
				531 U. S.
				<em>
					, 
				</em>
				at 372 (noting that it would be constitutional for an employer to conserve scarce financial resources by hiring employees who can use existing facilities rather than making the facilities accessible to disabled employees).  Thus, evidence regarding inaccessible courthouses, because it is not evidence of constitutional violations, provides no basis to abrogate States sovereign immunity.

				The near-total lack of actual constitutional violations in the congressional record is reminiscent of

				The barren record here should likewise be fatal to the majoritys holding that Title II is valid legislation enforcing due process rights that involve access to the courts.  This conclusion gains even more support when Title IIs nonexistent record of constitutional violations is compared with legislation that we have sustained as valid §5 enforcement legislation.  See,

Its provisions affect transportation, health, education, and recreation programs, among many others, all of which are accorded only rational-basis scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause.  A requirement of accommodation for the disabled at a state-owned amusement park or sports stadium, for example, bears no permissible prophylactic relationship to enabling disabled persons to exercise their fundamental constitutional rights.

).  I have grave doubts about importing an as applied approach into the §5 context.  While the majority is of course correct that this Court normally only considers the application of a statute to a particular case, the proper inquiry under 
				<em>
					City of Boerne 
				</em>
				and its progeny is somewhat different.  In applying the congruence-and-proportionality test, we ask whether Congress has attempted to statutorily redefine the constitutional rights protected by the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>.  This question can only be answered by measuring the breadth of a statutes coverage against the scope of the constitutional rights it purports to enforce and the record of violations it purports to remedy.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In conducting its as-applied analysis, however, the majority posits a hypothetical statute, never enacted by Congress, that applies only to courthouses.  The effect is to rig the congruence-and-proportionality test by artificially constricting the scope of the statute to closely mirror a recognized constitutional right.  But Title II is not susceptible of being carved up in this manner; it applies indiscriminately to all services, programs, or activities of any public entity.  Thus, the majoritys approach is not really an assessment of whether Title II is appropriate 
				<em>
					legislation
				</em>
				 at all, U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, §5 (emphasis added), but a test of whether the Court can conceive of a hypothetical statute narrowly tailored enough to constitute valid prophylactic legislation.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Our §5 precedents do not support this as-applied approach.  In each case, we measured the full breadth of the statute or relevant provision that Congress enacted against the scope of the constitutional right it purported to enforce.  If we had arbitrarily constricted the scope of the statutes to match the scope of a core constitutional right, those cases might have come out differently.  In 
				<em>
					Garrett
				</em>
				, for example, Title I might have been upheld as applied to irrational employment discrimination; or in 
				<em>
					Florida Prepaid
				</em>
				, the Patent Remedy Act might have been upheld as applied to intentional, uncompensated patent infringements.  It is thus not surprising that the only authority cited by the majority is

				I fear that the Courts adoption of an as-applied approach eliminates any incentive for Congress to craft §5 legislation for the purpose of remedying or deterring actual constitutional violations.  Congress can now simply rely on the courts to sort out which hypothetical applications of an undifferentiated statute, such as Title II, may be enforced against the States.  All the while, States will be subjected to substantial litigation in a piecemeal attempt to vindicate their 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxi" class="subref" title="subref">Eleventh Amendment</a> rights.  The majoritys as-applied approach simply cannot be squared with either our recent precedent or the proper role of the Judiciary.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Even in the limited courthouse-access context, Title II does not properly abrogate state sovereign immunity.  As demonstrated in depth above, Congress utterly failed to identify any evidence that disabled persons were denied constitutionally protected access to judicial proceedings.  Without this predicate showing, Title II, even if we were to hypothesize that it applies only to courthouses, cannot be viewed as a congruent and proportional response to state constitutional violations.

				Moreover, even in the courthouse-access context, Title II requires substantially more than the Due Process Clause.  Title II subjects States to private lawsuits if, 
				<em>
					inter alia,
				</em>
				 they fail to make reasonable modifications to fa-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				cilities, such as removing architectural … barriers. 42 U. S., C. §§12131(2), 12132.  Yet the statute is not limited to occasions when the failure to modify results, or will likely result, in an actual due process violation
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, the inability of a disabled person to participate in a judicial proceeding.  Indeed, liability is triggered if an inaccessible building results in a disabled person being subjected to discriminationa term that presumably encompasses any sort of inconvenience in accessing the facility, for whatever purpose.  §12132.

, and other cases in which we held that due process requires the State to waive filing fees for indigent litigants, is unavailing.  While these cases support the principle that the State must remove financial requirements that in fact prevent an individual from exercising his constitutional rights, they certainly do not support a statute that subjects a State to liability for failing to make a vast array of special accommodations, without regard for whether the failure to accommodate results in a constitutional wrong.

				In this respect, Title II is analogous to the Patent Remedy Act at issue in Florida Prepaid.
				  That statute subjected States to monetary liability for any act of patent infringement.  527 U. S., at 646647.  Thus, Congress did nothing to limit the Acts coverage to cases involving arguable [Due Process] violations, such as when the infringement was nonnegligent or uncompensated.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  Similarly here, Congress has authorized private damages suits against a State for merely maintaining a courthouse that is not readily accessible to the disabled, without regard to whether a disabled persons due process rights are ever violated.  Accordingly, even as applied to the access to the courts context, Title IIs indiscriminate scope offends [the congruence-and-proportionality] principle, particularly in light of the lack of record evidence showing that inaccessible courthouses cause actual Due Process violations.

						 Certainly, respondents Lane and Jones were not denied these constitutional rights.  The majority admits that Lane was able to attend the initial hearing of his criminal trial.  Ante, at 1.  Lane was arrested for failing to appear at his second hearing only after he refused assistance from officers dispatched by the court to help him to the courtroom.  Ante, at 2.  The court conducted a preliminary hearing in the first-floor library to accommodate Lanes disability, App. to Pet. for Cert. 16, and later offered to move all further proceedings in the case to a handicapped-accessible courthouse in a nearby town.  In light of these facts, it can hardly be said that the State violated Lanes right to be present at his trial; indeed, it made affirmative attempts to secure that right.  Respondent Jones, a disabled court reporter, does not seriously contend that she suffered a constitutional injury.

						 The majority rather peculiarly points to Congress finding that  discrimination against individuals with disabilities persists in such critical areas as access to public services  as evidence that Congress sought to vindicate the Due Process rights of disabled persons.  Ante, at 18 (quoting 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/12101.html#a_3" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §12101(a)(3)</a> (emphasis added by the Court)).  However, one does not usually refer to the right to attend a judicial proceeding as access to [a] public servic[e].  Given the lack of any concern over courthouse accessibility issues in the legislative history, it is highly unlikely that this legislative finding obliquely refers to state violations of the due process rights of disabled persons to attend judicial proceedings.

						 The Court correctly explains that  it [i]s easier for Congress to show a pattern of state constitutional violations  when it targets state action that triggers a higher level of constitutional scrutiny.  Ante, at 18 (quoting Nevada Dept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/538/721" class="subref" title="subref">538 U. S. 721</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">736</a> (2003)
).  However, this Courts precedents attest that Congress may not dispense with the required showing altogether simply because it purports to enforce due process rights.  See Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd. v. College Savings Bank, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/527/627" class="subref" title="subref">527 U. S. 627</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">645</a>646 (1999)

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">530</a>531 (1997)
 (same with respect to Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA)).  As the foregoing discussion demonstrates, that is precisely what the Court has sanctioned here.  Because the record is utterly devoid of proof that Congress was responding to state violations of due process access-to-the-courts rights, this case is controlled by Florida Prepaid and City of Boerne, rather than Hibbs.

						 Title IIs all-encompassing approach to regulating public services contrasts starkly with the more closely tailored laws we have upheld as legitimate prophylactic §5 legislation.  In Hibbs, for example, the FMLA was narrowly targeted to remedy widespread gender discrimination in the availability of family leave.  538 U. S., at 738739 (distinguishing City of Boerne, Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/528/62" class="subref" title="subref">528 U. S. 62</a> (2000)
, and Garrett on this ground).  Similarly, in cases involving enforcement of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifteenth Amendment</a>, we upheld limited remedial scheme[s] that were narrowly tailored to address massive evidence of discrimination in voting.  Garrett, 531 U. S., at 373 (discussing South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/383/301" class="subref" title="subref">383 U. S. 301</a> (1966)
).  Unlike these statutes, Title IIs indiscriminate scope … is particularly incongruous in light of the scant support for the predicate unconstitutional conduct that Congress intended to remedy.  Florida Prepaid, 527 U. S., at 647.

						 Raines is inapposite in any event.  The Court there considered the constitutionality of the Civil Rights Act of 1957a statute designed to enforce the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifteenth Amendment</a>whose narrowly tailored substantive provisions could unquestionably be applied to state actors (like the respondents therein).  362 U. S., at 25, 26.  The only question presented was whether the statute was facially invalid because it might be read to constrain nonstate actors as well.  Id., at 20.  The Court upheld the statute as applied to respondents and declined to entertain the facial challenge.  Id., at 2426.  The situation in this case is much different: The very question presented is whether Title IIs indiscriminate substantive provisions can constitutionally be applied to the petitioner State.  Raines thus provides no support for avoiding this question by conjuring up an imaginary statute with substantive provisions that might pass the congruence-and-proportionality test.

						 The majoritys invocation of Hibbs to justify Title IIs overbreadth is unpersuasive.  See ante, at 22, n. 24.  The Hibbs Court concluded that in light of the evidence before Congress the FMLAs 12-week family-leave provision was necessary to achiev[e] Congress remedial object.  538 U. S, at 748.  The Court found that the legislative record included not only evidence of state constitutional violations, but evidence that a provision merely enforcing the Equal Protection Clause would actually perpetuate the gender stereotypes Congress sought to eradicate because employers could simply eliminate family leave entirely.  Ibid.  Without comparable evidence of constitutional violations and the necessity of prophylactic measures, the Court has no basis on which to uphold Title IIs special-accommodation requirements.

				Having traced the metes and bounds of the constitutional rights at issue, the next step in the congruence-and-proportionality inquiry requires us to examine whether Congress identified a history and pattern of violations of these constitutional rights by the States with respect to the disabled.  
				<em>

This step is crucial to determining whether Title II is a legitimate attempt to remedy or prevent actual constitutional violations by the States or an illegitimate attempt to rewrite the constitutional provisions it purports to enforce.

				<em>

This digression recounts historical discrimination against the disabled through institutionalization laws, restrictions on marriage, voting, and public education, conditions in mental hospitals, and various other forms of unequal treatment in the administration of public programs and services.

				Lacking any real evidence that Congress was responding to actual due process violations, the majority relies primarily on three items to justify its decision: (1) a 1983 U. S. Civil Rights Commission Report showing that 76% of public services and programs housed in state-owned buildings were inaccessible to persons with disabilities, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1516; (2) testimony before a House subcommittee regarding the physical inaccessibility of local courthouses, 
				<em>

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				On closer examination, however, the Civil Rights Commissions finding consists of a single conclusory sentence in its report, and it is far from clear that its finding even includes courthouses. The House subcommittee report, for its part, contains the testimony of two
				 witnesses, neither of whom reported being denied the right to be present at constitutionally protected court proceedings.

            </a>
				  Indeed, the witnesses testimony, like the U. S. Civil Rights Commission Report, concerns only physical barriers to access, and does not address whether States either provided means to overcome those barriers or alternative locations for proceedings involving disabled persons.  Cf., n. 4,

				Based on the majoritys description, 
				<em>
					ante, 
				</em>
				at 16, the report of the ADA Task Force on the Rights and Empowerment of Americans with Disabilities sounds promising.  But the report itself says nothing about any disabled person being denied access to court.  The Court thus apparently relies solely on a general citation to the Governments Lodging in 
				<em>
					Garrett
				</em>
				, O. T. 2000, No. 991240 which, amidst thousands of pages, contains only a few anecdotal handwritten reports of physically inaccessible courthouses, again with no mention of whether States provided alternate means of access.  This evidence, moreover, was submitted not to Congress, but only to the task force, which itself made no findings regarding disabled persons access to judicial proceedings.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Garrett
				</em>
				,
				<em>

				531 U. S., at 370371 (rejecting anecdotal task force evidence for similar reasons).  As we noted in

				Even if the anecdotal evidence and conclusory statements relied on by the majority could be properly considered, the mere existence of an architecturally inaccessible courthouse
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, one a disabled person cannot utilize without assistancedoes not state a constitutional violation.  A violation of due process occurs only when a person is actually denied the constitutional right to access a given  judicial proceeding.  We have never held that a person has a 
				<em>
					constitutional
				</em>
				 right to make his way into a courtroom without any external assistance.  Indeed, the fact that the State may need to assist an individual to attend a hearing has no bearing on whether the individual successfully exercises his due process right to be present at the proceeding.  Nor does an inaccessible courthouse violate the Equal Protection Clause, unless it is irrational for the State not to alter the courthouse to make it accessible.  But financial considerations almost always furnish a rational basis for a State to decline to make those alterations.  See 
				<em>
					Garrett, 
				</em>
				531 U. S.
				<em>
					, 
				</em>
				at 372 (noting that it would be constitutional for an employer to conserve scarce financial resources by hiring employees who can use existing facilities rather than making the facilities accessible to disabled employees).  Thus, evidence regarding inaccessible courthouses, because it is not evidence of constitutional violations, provides no basis to abrogate States sovereign immunity.

				The near-total lack of actual constitutional violations in the congressional record is reminiscent of

				The barren record here should likewise be fatal to the majoritys holding that Title II is valid legislation enforcing due process rights that involve access to the courts.

Its provisions affect transportation, health, education, and recreation programs, among many others, all of which are accorded only rational-basis scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause.  A requirement of accommodation for the disabled at a state-owned amusement park or sports stadium, for example, bears no permissible prophylactic relationship to enabling disabled persons to exercise their fundamental constitutional rights.  Thus, as with Title I in

).  I have grave doubts about importing an as applied approach into the §5 context.  While the majority is of course correct that this Court normally only considers the application of a statute to a particular case, the proper inquiry under 
				<em>
					City of Boerne 
				</em>
				and its progeny is somewhat different.  In applying the congruence-and-proportionality test, we ask whether Congress has attempted to statutorily redefine the constitutional rights protected by the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>.  This question can only be answered by measuring the breadth of a statutes coverage against the scope of the constitutional rights it purports to enforce and the record of violations it purports to remedy.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In conducting its as-applied analysis, however, the majority posits a hypothetical statute, never enacted by Congress, that applies only to courthouses.  The effect is to rig the congruence-and-proportionality test by artificially constricting the scope of the statute to closely mirror a recognized constitutional right.  But Title II is not susceptible of being carved up in this manner; it applies indiscriminately to all services, programs, or activities of any public entity.  Thus, the majoritys approach is not really an assessment of whether Title II is appropriate 
				<em>
					legislation
				</em>
				 at all, U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, §5 (emphasis added), but a test of whether the Court can conceive of a hypothetical statute narrowly tailored enough to constitute valid prophylactic legislation.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Our §5 precedents do not support this as-applied approach.  In each case, we measured the full breadth of the statute or relevant provision that Congress enacted against the scope of the constitutional right it purported to enforce.  If we had arbitrarily constricted the scope of the statutes to match the scope of a core constitutional right, those cases might have come out differently.  In 
				<em>
					Garrett
				</em>
				, for example, Title I might have been upheld as applied to irrational employment discrimination; or in 
				<em>
					Florida Prepaid
				</em>
				, the Patent Remedy Act might have been upheld as applied to intentional, uncompensated patent infringements.  It is thus not surprising that the only authority cited by the majority is

				I fear that the Courts adoption of an as-applied approach eliminates any incentive for Congress to craft §5 legislation for the purpose of remedying or deterring actual constitutional violations.  Congress can now simply rely on the courts to sort out which hypothetical applications of an undifferentiated statute, such as Title II, may be enforced against the States.  All the while, States will be subjected to substantial litigation in a piecemeal attempt to vindicate their 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxi" class="subref" title="subref">Eleventh Amendment</a> rights.  The majoritys as-applied approach simply cannot be squared with either our recent precedent or the proper role of the Judiciary.

				Even in the limited courthouse-access context, Title II does not properly abrogate state sovereign immunity.  As demonstrated in depth above, Congress utterly failed to identify any evidence that disabled persons were denied constitutionally protected access to judicial proceedings.  Without this predicate showing, Title II, even if we were to hypothesize that it applies only to courthouses, cannot be viewed as a congruent and proportional response to state constitutional violations.

				Moreover, even in the courthouse-access context, Title II requires substantially more than the Due Process Clause.  Title II subjects States to private lawsuits if,

				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				cilities, such as removing architectural … barriers. 42 U. S., C. §§12131(2), 12132.  Yet the statute is not limited to occasions when the failure to modify results, or will likely result, in an actual due process violation
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, the inability of a disabled person to participate in a judicial proceeding.  Indeed, liability is triggered if an inaccessible building results in a disabled person being subjected to discriminationa term that presumably encompasses any sort of inconvenience in accessing the facility, for whatever purpose.  §12132.

, and other cases in which we held that due process requires the State to waive filing fees for indigent litigants, is unavailing.  While these cases support the principle that the State must remove financial requirements that in fact prevent an individual from exercising his constitutional rights, they certainly do not support a statute that subjects a State to liability for failing to make a vast array of special accommodations, without regard for whether the failure to accommodate results in a constitutional wrong.

				In this respect, Title II is analogous to the Patent Remedy Act at issue in Florida Prepaid.
				  That statute subjected States to monetary liability for any act of patent infringement.  527 U. S., at 646647.  Thus, Congress did nothing to limit the Acts coverage to cases involving arguable [Due Process] violations, such as when the infringement was nonnegligent or uncompensated.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  Similarly here, Congress has authorized private damages suits against a State for merely maintaining a courthouse that is not readily accessible to the disabled, without regard to whether a disabled persons due process rights are ever violated.  Accordingly, even as applied to the access to the courts context, Title IIs indiscriminate scope offends [the congruence-and-proportionality] principle, particularly in light of the lack of record evidence showing that inaccessible courthouses cause actual Due Process violations.

						 Certainly, respondents Lane and Jones were not denied these constitutional rights.  The majority admits that Lane was able to attend the initial hearing of his criminal trial.  Ante, at 1.  Lane was arrested for failing to appear at his second hearing only after he refused assistance from officers dispatched by the court to help him to the courtroom.  Ante, at 2.  The court conducted a preliminary hearing in the first-floor library to accommodate Lanes disability, App. to Pet. for Cert. 16, and later offered to move all further proceedings in the case to a handicapped-accessible courthouse in a nearby town.  In light of these facts, it can hardly be said that the State violated Lanes right to be present at his trial; indeed, it made affirmative attempts to secure that right.  Respondent Jones, a disabled court reporter, does not seriously contend that she suffered a constitutional injury.

						 The majority rather peculiarly points to Congress finding that  discrimination against individuals with disabilities persists in such critical areas as access to public services  as evidence that Congress sought to vindicate the Due Process rights of disabled persons.  Ante, at 18 (quoting 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/12101.html#a_3" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §12101(a)(3)</a> (emphasis added by the Court)).  However, one does not usually refer to the right to attend a judicial proceeding as access to [a] public servic[e].  Given the lack of any concern over courthouse accessibility issues in the legislative history, it is highly unlikely that this legislative finding obliquely refers to state violations of the due process rights of disabled persons to attend judicial proceedings.

						 The Court correctly explains that  it [i]s easier for Congress to show a pattern of state constitutional violations  when it targets state action that triggers a higher level of constitutional scrutiny.  Ante, at 18 (quoting Nevada Dept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/538/721" class="subref" title="subref">538 U. S. 721</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">736</a> (2003)
).  However, this Courts precedents attest that Congress may not dispense with the required showing altogether simply because it purports to enforce due process rights.  See Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd. v. College Savings Bank, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/527/627" class="subref" title="subref">527 U. S. 627</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">645</a>646 (1999)
 (invalidating Patent Remedy Act, which purported to enforce the Due Process Clause, because Congress failed to identify a record of constitutional violations); City of Boerne v. Flores,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">530</a>531 (1997)
 (same with respect to Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA)).  As the foregoing discussion demonstrates, that is precisely what the Court has sanctioned here.  Because the record is utterly devoid of proof that Congress was responding to state violations of due process access-to-the-courts rights, this case is controlled by Florida Prepaid and City of Boerne, rather than Hibbs.

						 Title IIs all-encompassing approach to regulating public services contrasts starkly with the more closely tailored laws we have upheld as legitimate prophylactic §5 legislation.  In Hibbs, for example, the FMLA was narrowly targeted to remedy widespread gender discrimination in the availability of family leave.  538 U. S., at 738739 (distinguishing City of Boerne, Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/528/62" class="subref" title="subref">528 U. S. 62</a> (2000)
, and Garrett on this ground).  Similarly, in cases involving enforcement of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifteenth Amendment</a>, we upheld limited remedial scheme[s] that were narrowly tailored to address massive evidence of discrimination in voting.  Garrett, 531 U. S., at 373 (discussing South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/383/301" class="subref" title="subref">383 U. S. 301</a> (1966)
).  Unlike these statutes, Title IIs indiscriminate scope … is particularly incongruous in light of the scant support for the predicate unconstitutional conduct that Congress intended to remedy.  Florida Prepaid, 527 U. S., at 647.

						 Raines is inapposite in any event.  The Court there considered the constitutionality of the Civil Rights Act of 1957a statute designed to enforce the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifteenth Amendment</a>whose narrowly tailored substantive provisions could unquestionably be applied to state actors (like the respondents therein).  362 U. S., at 25, 26.  The only question presented was whether the statute was facially invalid because it might be read to constrain nonstate actors as well.  Id., at 20.  The Court upheld the statute as applied to respondents and declined to entertain the facial challenge.  Id., at 2426.  The situation in this case is much different: The very question presented is whether Title IIs indiscriminate substantive provisions can constitutionally be applied to the petitioner State.  Raines thus provides no support for avoiding this question by conjuring up an imaginary statute with substantive provisions that might pass the congruence-and-proportionality test.

						 The majoritys invocation of Hibbs to justify Title IIs overbreadth is unpersuasive.  See ante, at 22, n. 24.  The Hibbs Court concluded that in light of the evidence before Congress the FMLAs 12-week family-leave provision was necessary to achiev[e] Congress remedial object.  538 U. S, at 748.  The Court found that the legislative record included not only evidence of state constitutional violations, but evidence that a provision merely enforcing the Equal Protection Clause would actually perpetuate the gender stereotypes Congress sought to eradicate because employers could simply eliminate family leave entirely.  Ibid.  Without comparable evidence of constitutional violations and the necessity of prophylactic measures, the Court has no basis on which to uphold Title IIs special-accommodation requirements.

				<em>

				Having traced the metes and bounds of the constitutional rights at issue, the next step in the congruence-and-proportionality inquiry requires us to examine whether Congress identified a history and pattern of violations of these constitutional rights by the States with respect to the disabled.  
				<em>
					Garrett, 
				</em>
				531 U. S., at 368.  This step is crucial to determining whether Title II is a legitimate attempt to remedy or prevent actual constitutional violations by the States or an illegitimate attempt to rewrite the constitutional provisions it purports to enforce.  Indeed, Congress §5 power is appropriately exercised 
				<em>
					only
				</em>
				 in response to state transgressions.

				Rather than limiting its discussion of constitutional violations to the due process rights on which it ultimately relies, the majority sets out on a wide-ranging account of societal discrimination against the disabled.

This digression recounts historical discrimination against the disabled through institutionalization laws, restrictions on marriage, voting, and public education, conditions in mental hospitals, and various other forms of unequal treatment in the administration of public programs and services.  Some of this evidence would be relevant if the Court were considering the constitutionality of the statute as a whole; but the Court rejects that approach in favor of a narrower as-applied inquiry.

				Lacking any real evidence that Congress was responding to actual due process violations, the majority relies primarily on three items to justify its decision: (1) a 1983 U. S. Civil Rights Commission Report showing that 76% of public services and programs housed in state-owned buildings were inaccessible to persons with disabilities, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1516; (2) testimony before a House subcommittee regarding the physical inaccessibility of local courthouses, 
				<em>

				, at 16; and (3) evidence submitted to Congress designated ADA task force that purportedly contains numerous examples of the exclusion of persons with disabilities from state judicial services and programs.  Ibid.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				On closer examination, however, the Civil Rights Commissions finding consists of a single conclusory sentence in its report, and it is far from clear that its finding even includes courthouses. The House subcommittee report, for its part, contains the testimony of two
				 witnesses, neither of whom reported being denied the right to be present at constitutionally protected court proceedings.

                </sup>
            </a>
				  Indeed, the witnesses testimony, like the U. S. Civil Rights Commission Report, concerns only physical barriers to access, and does not address whether States either provided means to overcome those barriers or alternative locations for proceedings involving disabled persons.  Cf., n. 4, 
				<em>

				Based on the majoritys description, 
				<em>
					ante, 
				</em>
				at 16, the report of the ADA Task Force on the Rights and Empowerment of Americans with Disabilities sounds promising.  But the report itself says nothing about any disabled person being denied access to court.  The Court thus apparently relies solely on a general citation to the Governments Lodging in 
				<em>
					Garrett
				</em>
				, O. T. 2000, No. 991240 which, amidst thousands of pages, contains only a few anecdotal handwritten reports of physically inaccessible courthouses, again with no mention of whether States provided alternate means of access.  This evidence, moreover, was submitted not to Congress, but only to the task force, which itself made no findings regarding disabled persons access to judicial proceedings.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Garrett
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				531 U. S., at 370371 (rejecting anecdotal task force evidence for similar reasons).  As we noted in

				Even if the anecdotal evidence and conclusory statements relied on by the majority could be properly considered, the mere existence of an architecturally inaccessible courthouse
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, one a disabled person cannot utilize without assistancedoes not state a constitutional violation.  A violation of due process occurs only when a person is actually denied the constitutional right to access a given  judicial proceeding.  We have never held that a person has a 
				<em>
					constitutional
				</em>
				 right to make his way into a courtroom without any external assistance.  Indeed, the fact that the State may need to assist an individual to attend a hearing has no bearing on whether the individual successfully exercises his due process right to be present at the proceeding.  Nor does an inaccessible courthouse violate the Equal Protection Clause, unless it is irrational for the State not to alter the courthouse to make it accessible.  But financial considerations almost always furnish a rational basis for a State to decline to make those alterations.  See 
				<em>
					Garrett, 
				</em>
				531 U. S.
				<em>
					, 
				</em>
				at 372 (noting that it would be constitutional for an employer to conserve scarce financial resources by hiring employees who can use existing facilities rather than making the facilities accessible to disabled employees).  Thus, evidence regarding inaccessible courthouses, because it is not evidence of constitutional violations, provides no basis to abrogate States sovereign immunity.

				The near-total lack of actual constitutional violations in the congressional record is reminiscent of

				The barren record here should likewise be fatal to the majoritys holding that Title II is valid legislation enforcing due process rights that involve access to the courts.

Its provisions affect transportation, health, education, and recreation programs, among many others, all of which are accorded only rational-basis scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause.  A requirement of accommodation for the disabled at a state-owned amusement park or sports stadium, for example, bears no permissible prophylactic relationship to enabling disabled persons to exercise their fundamental constitutional rights.

).  I have grave doubts about importing an as applied approach into the §5 context.  While the majority is of course correct that this Court normally only considers the application of a statute to a particular case, the proper inquiry under 
				<em>
					City of Boerne 
				</em>
				and its progeny is somewhat different.  In applying the congruence-and-proportionality test, we ask whether Congress has attempted to statutorily redefine the constitutional rights protected by the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>.  This question can only be answered by measuring the breadth of a statutes coverage against the scope of the constitutional rights it purports to enforce and the record of violations it purports to remedy.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In conducting its as-applied analysis, however, the majority posits a hypothetical statute, never enacted by Congress, that applies only to courthouses.  The effect is to rig the congruence-and-proportionality test by artificially constricting the scope of the statute to closely mirror a recognized constitutional right.  But Title II is not susceptible of being carved up in this manner; it applies indiscriminately to all services, programs, or activities of any public entity.  Thus, the majoritys approach is not really an assessment of whether Title II is appropriate 
				<em>
					legislation
				</em>
				 at all, U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, §5 (emphasis added), but a test of whether the Court can conceive of a hypothetical statute narrowly tailored enough to constitute valid prophylactic legislation.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Our §5 precedents do not support this as-applied approach.  In each case, we measured the full breadth of the statute or relevant provision that Congress enacted against the scope of the constitutional right it purported to enforce.  If we had arbitrarily constricted the scope of the statutes to match the scope of a core constitutional right, those cases might have come out differently.  In 
				<em>
					Garrett
				</em>
				, for example, Title I might have been upheld as applied to irrational employment discrimination; or in 
				<em>
					Florida Prepaid
				</em>
				, the Patent Remedy Act might have been upheld as applied to intentional, uncompensated patent infringements.  It is thus not surprising that the only authority cited by the majority is

				I fear that the Courts adoption of an as-applied approach eliminates any incentive for Congress to craft §5 legislation for the purpose of remedying or deterring actual constitutional violations.  Congress can now simply rely on the courts to sort out which hypothetical applications of an undifferentiated statute, such as Title II, may be enforced against the States.  All the while, States will be subjected to substantial litigation in a piecemeal attempt to vindicate their 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxi" class="subref" title="subref">Eleventh Amendment</a> rights.  The majoritys as-applied approach simply cannot be squared with either our recent precedent or the proper role of the Judiciary.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Even in the limited courthouse-access context, Title II does not properly abrogate state sovereign immunity.  As demonstrated in depth above, Congress utterly failed to identify any evidence that disabled persons were denied constitutionally protected access to judicial proceedings.  Without this predicate showing, Title II, even if we were to hypothesize that it applies only to courthouses, cannot be viewed as a congruent and proportional response to state constitutional violations.

				Moreover, even in the courthouse-access context, Title II requires substantially more than the Due Process Clause.  Title II subjects States to private lawsuits if,

				 they fail to make reasonable modifications to fa-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				cilities, such as removing architectural … barriers. 42 U. S., C. §§12131(2), 12132.  Yet the statute is not limited to occasions when the failure to modify results, or will likely result, in an actual due process violation
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, the inability of a disabled person to participate in a judicial proceeding.  Indeed, liability is triggered if an inaccessible building results in a disabled person being subjected to discriminationa term that presumably encompasses any sort of inconvenience in accessing the facility, for whatever purpose.  §12132.

, and other cases in which we held that due process requires the State to waive filing fees for indigent litigants, is unavailing.  While these cases support the principle that the State must remove financial requirements that in fact prevent an individual from exercising his constitutional rights, they certainly do not support a statute that subjects a State to liability for failing to make a vast array of special accommodations, without regard for whether the failure to accommodate results in a constitutional wrong.

				In this respect, Title II is analogous to the Patent Remedy Act at issue in Florida Prepaid.
				  That statute subjected States to monetary liability for any act of patent infringement.  527 U. S., at 646647.  Thus, Congress did nothing to limit the Acts coverage to cases involving arguable [Due Process] violations, such as when the infringement was nonnegligent or uncompensated.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  Similarly here, Congress has authorized private damages suits against a State for merely maintaining a courthouse that is not readily accessible to the disabled, without regard to whether a disabled persons due process rights are ever violated.  Accordingly, even as applied to the access to the courts context, Title IIs indiscriminate scope offends [the congruence-and-proportionality] principle, particularly in light of the lack of record evidence showing that inaccessible courthouses cause actual Due Process violations.

The court conducted a preliminary hearing in the first-floor library to accommodate Lanes disability, App. to Pet. for Cert. 16, and later offered to move all further proceedings in the case to a handicapped-accessible courthouse in a nearby town.  In light of these facts, it can hardly be said that the State violated Lanes right to be present at his trial; indeed, it made affirmative attempts to secure that right.  Respondent Jones, a disabled court reporter, does not seriously contend that she suffered a constitutional injury.

						 The majority rather peculiarly points to Congress finding that  discrimination against individuals with disabilities persists in such critical areas as access to public services  as evidence that Congress sought to vindicate the Due Process rights of disabled persons.  Ante, at 18 (quoting 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/12101.html#a_3" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §12101(a)(3)</a> (emphasis added by the Court)).  However, one does not usually refer to the right to attend a judicial proceeding as access to [a] public servic[e].  Given the lack of any concern over courthouse accessibility issues in the legislative history, it is highly unlikely that this legislative finding obliquely refers to state violations of the due process rights of disabled persons to attend judicial proceedings.

						 The Court correctly explains that  it [i]s easier for Congress to show a pattern of state constitutional violations  when it targets state action that triggers a higher level of constitutional scrutiny.  Ante, at 18 (quoting Nevada Dept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/538/721" class="subref" title="subref">538 U. S. 721</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">736</a> (2003)
).  However, this Courts precedents attest that Congress may not dispense with the required showing altogether simply because it purports to enforce due process rights.  See Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd. v. College Savings Bank, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/527/627" class="subref" title="subref">527 U. S. 627</a>,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">530</a>531 (1997)
 (same with respect to Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA)).  As the foregoing discussion demonstrates, that is precisely what the Court has sanctioned here.  Because the record is utterly devoid of proof that Congress was responding to state violations of due process access-to-the-courts rights, this case is controlled by Florida Prepaid and City of Boerne, rather than Hibbs.

						 Title IIs all-encompassing approach to regulating public services contrasts starkly with the more closely tailored laws we have upheld as legitimate prophylactic §5 legislation.  In Hibbs, for example, the FMLA was narrowly targeted to remedy widespread gender discrimination in the availability of family leave.  538 U. S., at 738739 (distinguishing City of Boerne, Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/528/62" class="subref" title="subref">528 U. S. 62</a> (2000)
, and Garrett on this ground).  Similarly, in cases involving enforcement of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifteenth Amendment</a>, we upheld limited remedial scheme[s] that were narrowly tailored to address massive evidence of discrimination in voting.  Garrett, 531 U. S., at 373 (discussing South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/383/301" class="subref" title="subref">383 U. S. 301</a> (1966)
).  Unlike these statutes, Title IIs indiscriminate scope … is particularly incongruous in light of the scant support for the predicate unconstitutional conduct that Congress intended to remedy.  Florida Prepaid, 527 U. S., at 647.

						 Raines is inapposite in any event.  The Court there considered the constitutionality of the Civil Rights Act of 1957a statute designed to enforce the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifteenth Amendment</a>whose narrowly tailored substantive provisions could unquestionably be applied to state actors (like the respondents therein).  362 U. S., at 25, 26.  The only question presented was whether the statute was facially invalid because it might be read to constrain nonstate actors as well.  Id., at 20.  The Court upheld the statute as applied to respondents and declined to entertain the facial challenge.  Id., at 2426.  The situation in this case is much different: The very question presented is whether Title IIs indiscriminate substantive provisions can constitutionally be applied to the petitioner State.  Raines thus provides no support for avoiding this question by conjuring up an imaginary statute with substantive provisions that might pass the congruence-and-proportionality test.

						 The majoritys invocation of Hibbs to justify Title IIs overbreadth is unpersuasive.  See ante, at 22, n. 24.  The Hibbs Court concluded that in light of the evidence before Congress the FMLAs 12-week family-leave provision was necessary to achiev[e] Congress remedial object.  538 U. S, at 748.  The Court found that the legislative record included not only evidence of state constitutional violations, but evidence that a provision merely enforcing the Equal Protection Clause would actually perpetuate the gender stereotypes Congress sought to eradicate because employers could simply eliminate family leave entirely.  Ibid.  Without comparable evidence of constitutional violations and the necessity of prophylactic measures, the Court has no basis on which to uphold Title IIs special-accommodation requirements.

				<em>

				Having traced the metes and bounds of the constitutional rights at issue, the next step in the congruence-and-proportionality inquiry requires us to examine whether Congress identified a history and pattern of violations of these constitutional rights by the States with respect to the disabled.  
				<em>
					Garrett,

				531 U. S., at 368.  This step is crucial to determining whether Title II is a legitimate attempt to remedy or prevent actual constitutional violations by the States or an illegitimate attempt to rewrite the constitutional provisions it purports to enforce.

				<em>
					only

This digression recounts historical discrimination against the disabled through institutionalization laws, restrictions on marriage, voting, and public education, conditions in mental hospitals, and various other forms of unequal treatment in the administration of public programs and services.

				Lacking any real evidence that Congress was responding to actual due process violations, the majority relies primarily on three items to justify its decision: (1) a 1983 U. S. Civil Rights Commission Report showing that 76% of public services and programs housed in state-owned buildings were inaccessible to persons with disabilities, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1516; (2) testimony before a House subcommittee regarding the physical inaccessibility of local courthouses,

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				On closer examination, however, the Civil Rights Commissions finding consists of a single conclusory sentence in its report, and it is far from clear that its finding even includes courthouses. The House subcommittee report, for its part, contains the testimony of two
				 witnesses, neither of whom reported being denied the right to be present at constitutionally protected court proceedings.

            </a>
				  Indeed, the witnesses testimony, like the U. S. Civil Rights Commission Report, concerns only physical barriers to access, and does not address whether States either provided means to overcome those barriers or alternative locations for proceedings involving disabled persons.  Cf., n. 4,

				Based on the majoritys description, 
				<em>
					ante,

				at 16, the report of the ADA Task Force on the Rights and Empowerment of Americans with Disabilities sounds promising.  But the report itself says nothing about any disabled person being denied access to court.  The Court thus apparently relies solely on a general citation to the Governments Lodging in 
				<em>
					Garrett
				</em>
				, O. T. 2000, No. 991240 which, amidst thousands of pages, contains only a few anecdotal handwritten reports of physically inaccessible courthouses, again with no mention of whether States provided alternate means of access.  This evidence, moreover, was submitted not to Congress, but only to the task force, which itself made no findings regarding disabled persons access to judicial proceedings.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Garrett
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				531 U. S., at 370371 (rejecting anecdotal task force evidence for similar reasons).  As we noted in

				Even if the anecdotal evidence and conclusory statements relied on by the majority could be properly considered, the mere existence of an architecturally inaccessible courthouse
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, one a disabled person cannot utilize without assistancedoes not state a constitutional violation.  A violation of due process occurs only when a person is actually denied the constitutional right to access a given  judicial proceeding.  We have never held that a person has a 
				<em>
					constitutional
				</em>
				 right to make his way into a courtroom without any external assistance.  Indeed, the fact that the State may need to assist an individual to attend a hearing has no bearing on whether the individual successfully exercises his due process right to be present at the proceeding.  Nor does an inaccessible courthouse violate the Equal Protection Clause, unless it is irrational for the State not to alter the courthouse to make it accessible.  But financial considerations almost always furnish a rational basis for a State to decline to make those alterations.  See 
				<em>
					Garrett, 
				</em>
				531 U. S.
				<em>
					, 
				</em>
				at 372 (noting that it would be constitutional for an employer to conserve scarce financial resources by hiring employees who can use existing facilities rather than making the facilities accessible to disabled employees).  Thus, evidence regarding inaccessible courthouses, because it is not evidence of constitutional violations, provides no basis to abrogate States sovereign immunity.

				The near-total lack of actual constitutional violations in the congressional record is reminiscent of

				The barren record here should likewise be fatal to the majoritys holding that Title II is valid legislation enforcing due process rights that involve access to the courts.

				The third step of our congruence-and-proportionality inquiry removes any doubt as to whether Title II is valid §5 legislation.  At this stage, we ask whether the rights and remedies created by Title II are congruent and proportional to the constitutional rights it purports to enforce and the record of constitutional violations adduced by Congress.

				Title II provides that no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/12132.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §12132</a>.  A disabled person is considered qualified if he meets the essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of the entitys services or participation in the entitys programs, 
				<em>
					with or without reasonable modifications to rules, policies, or practices, the removal of architectural, communication, or transportation barriers, or the provision of auxiliary aids and services.
				</em>
				  §12131(2) (emphasis added).  The ADAs findings make clear that Congress believed it was attacking discrimination in all areas of public services, as well as the discriminatory effect of architectural, transportation, and communication barriers.  §§12101(a)(3), (a)(5).  In sum, Title II requires, on pain of money damages, special accommodations for disabled persons in virtually every interaction they have with the State.

Like Title I, Title II may be laudable public policy, but it cannot be seriously disputed that it is also an attempt to legislatively redefine the States legal obligations under the

Its provisions affect transportation, health, education, and recreation programs, among many others, all of which are accorded only rational-basis scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause.  A requirement of accommodation for the disabled at a state-owned amusement park or sports stadium, for example, bears no permissible prophylactic relationship to enabling disabled persons to exercise their fundamental constitutional rights.  Thus, as with Title I in

).  I have grave doubts about importing an as applied approach into the §5 context.  While the majority is of course correct that this Court normally only considers the application of a statute to a particular case, the proper inquiry under 
				<em>
					City of Boerne 
				</em>
				and its progeny is somewhat different.  In applying the congruence-and-proportionality test, we ask whether Congress has attempted to statutorily redefine the constitutional rights protected by the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>.  This question can only be answered by measuring the breadth of a statutes coverage against the scope of the constitutional rights it purports to enforce and the record of violations it purports to remedy.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In conducting its as-applied analysis, however, the majority posits a hypothetical statute, never enacted by Congress, that applies only to courthouses.  The effect is to rig the congruence-and-proportionality test by artificially constricting the scope of the statute to closely mirror a recognized constitutional right.  But Title II is not susceptible of being carved up in this manner; it applies indiscriminately to all services, programs, or activities of any public entity.  Thus, the majoritys approach is not really an assessment of whether Title II is appropriate 
				<em>
					legislation
				</em>
				 at all, U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, §5 (emphasis added), but a test of whether the Court can conceive of a hypothetical statute narrowly tailored enough to constitute valid prophylactic legislation.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Our §5 precedents do not support this as-applied approach.  In each case, we measured the full breadth of the statute or relevant provision that Congress enacted against the scope of the constitutional right it purported to enforce.  If we had arbitrarily constricted the scope of the statutes to match the scope of a core constitutional right, those cases might have come out differently.  In 
				<em>
					Garrett
				</em>
				, for example, Title I might have been upheld as applied to irrational employment discrimination; or in 
				<em>
					Florida Prepaid
				</em>
				, the Patent Remedy Act might have been upheld as applied to intentional, uncompensated patent infringements.  It is thus not surprising that the only authority cited by the majority is

				I fear that the Courts adoption of an as-applied approach eliminates any incentive for Congress to craft §5 legislation for the purpose of remedying or deterring actual constitutional violations.  Congress can now simply rely on the courts to sort out which hypothetical applications of an undifferentiated statute, such as Title II, may be enforced against the States.  All the while, States will be subjected to substantial litigation in a piecemeal attempt to vindicate their 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxi" class="subref" title="subref">Eleventh Amendment</a> rights.  The majoritys as-applied approach simply cannot be squared with either our recent precedent or the proper role of the Judiciary.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Even in the limited courthouse-access context, Title II does not properly abrogate state sovereign immunity.  As demonstrated in depth above, Congress utterly failed to identify any evidence that disabled persons were denied constitutionally protected access to judicial proceedings.  Without this predicate showing, Title II, even if we were to hypothesize that it applies only to courthouses, cannot be viewed as a congruent and proportional response to state constitutional violations.

				Moreover, even in the courthouse-access context, Title II requires substantially more than the Due Process Clause.  Title II subjects States to private lawsuits if,

				 they fail to make reasonable modifications to fa-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				cilities, such as removing architectural … barriers. 42 U. S., C. §§12131(2), 12132.  Yet the statute is not limited to occasions when the failure to modify results, or will likely result, in an actual due process violation
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, the inability of a disabled person to participate in a judicial proceeding.  Indeed, liability is triggered if an inaccessible building results in a disabled person being subjected to discriminationa term that presumably encompasses any sort of inconvenience in accessing the facility, for whatever purpose.  §12132.

, and other cases in which we held that due process requires the State to waive filing fees for indigent litigants, is unavailing.  While these cases support the principle that the State must remove financial requirements that in fact prevent an individual from exercising his constitutional rights, they certainly do not support a statute that subjects a State to liability for failing to make a vast array of special accommodations, without regard for whether the failure to accommodate results in a constitutional wrong.

				In this respect, Title II is analogous to the Patent Remedy Act at issue in Florida Prepaid.
				  That statute subjected States to monetary liability for any act of patent infringement.  527 U. S., at 646647.  Thus, Congress did nothing to limit the Acts coverage to cases involving arguable [Due Process] violations, such as when the infringement was nonnegligent or uncompensated.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  Similarly here, Congress has authorized private damages suits against a State for merely maintaining a courthouse that is not readily accessible to the disabled, without regard to whether a disabled persons due process rights are ever violated.  Accordingly, even as applied to the access to the courts context, Title IIs indiscriminate scope offends [the congruence-and-proportionality] principle, particularly in light of the lack of record evidence showing that inaccessible courthouses cause actual Due Process violations.

In light of these facts, it can hardly be said that the State violated Lanes right to be present at his trial; indeed, it made affirmative attempts to secure that right.  Respondent Jones, a disabled court reporter, does not seriously contend that she suffered a constitutional injury.

						 The majority rather peculiarly points to Congress finding that  discrimination against individuals with disabilities persists in such critical areas as access to public services  as evidence that Congress sought to vindicate the Due Process rights of disabled persons.

However, one does not usually refer to the right to attend a judicial proceeding as access to [a] public servic[e].  Given the lack of any concern over courthouse accessibility issues in the legislative history, it is highly unlikely that this legislative finding obliquely refers to state violations of the due process rights of disabled persons to attend judicial proceedings.

						 The Court correctly explains that  it [i]s easier for Congress to show a pattern of state constitutional violations  when it targets state action that triggers a higher level of constitutional scrutiny.  Ante, at 18 (quoting Nevada Dept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">736</a> (2003)
).  However, this Courts precedents attest that Congress may not dispense with the required showing altogether simply because it purports to enforce due process rights.  See Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd. v. College Savings Bank, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/527/627" class="subref" title="subref">527 U. S. 627</a>,

 (same with respect to Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA)).  As the foregoing discussion demonstrates, that is precisely what the Court has sanctioned here.  Because the record is utterly devoid of proof that Congress was responding to state violations of due process access-to-the-courts rights, this case is controlled by Florida Prepaid and City of Boerne, rather than Hibbs.

						 Title IIs all-encompassing approach to regulating public services contrasts starkly with the more closely tailored laws we have upheld as legitimate prophylactic §5 legislation.  In Hibbs, for example, the FMLA was narrowly targeted to remedy widespread gender discrimination in the availability of family leave.  538 U. S., at 738739 (distinguishing City of Boerne, Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/528/62" class="subref" title="subref">528 U. S. 62</a> (2000)
, and Garrett on this ground).  Similarly, in cases involving enforcement of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifteenth Amendment</a>, we upheld limited remedial scheme[s] that were narrowly tailored to address massive evidence of discrimination in voting.  Garrett, 531 U. S., at 373 (discussing South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/383/301" class="subref" title="subref">383 U. S. 301</a> (1966)

						 Raines is inapposite in any event.  The Court there considered the constitutionality of the Civil Rights Act of 1957a statute designed to enforce the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifteenth Amendment</a>whose narrowly tailored substantive provisions could unquestionably be applied to state actors (like the respondents therein).  362 U. S., at 25, 26.  The only question presented was whether the statute was facially invalid because it might be read to constrain nonstate actors as well.  Id., at 20.  The Court upheld the statute as applied to respondents and declined to entertain the facial challenge.  Id., at 2426.  The situation in this case is much different: The very question presented is whether Title IIs indiscriminate substantive provisions can constitutionally be applied to the petitioner State.  Raines thus provides no support for avoiding this question by conjuring up an imaginary statute with substantive provisions that might pass the congruence-and-proportionality test.

						 The majoritys invocation of Hibbs to justify Title IIs overbreadth is unpersuasive.  See ante, at 22, n. 24.  The Hibbs Court concluded that in light of the evidence before Congress the FMLAs 12-week family-leave provision was necessary to achiev[e] Congress remedial object.  538 U. S, at 748.  The Court found that the legislative record included not only evidence of state constitutional violations, but evidence that a provision merely enforcing the Equal Protection Clause would actually perpetuate the gender stereotypes Congress sought to eradicate because employers could simply eliminate family leave entirely.  Ibid.  Without comparable evidence of constitutional violations and the necessity of prophylactic measures, the Court has no basis on which to uphold Title IIs special-accommodation requirements.

				The first step is to identify with some precision the scope of the constitutional right at issue.  
				<em>
					Garrett, supra, 
				</em>
				at 365.  This task was easy in 
				<em>
					Garrett, Hibbs, Kimel, 
				</em>
				and 
				<em>
					City of Boerne
				</em>
				 because the statutes in those cases sought to enforce only one constitutional right.  In 
				<em>
					Garrett
				</em>
				, for example, the statute addressed the equal protection right of disabled persons to be free from unconstitutional employment discrimination.  
				<em>
					Garrett, supra, 
				</em>
				at 365.  See also 
				<em>
					Hibbs, supra
				</em>
				, at 728 (The [Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA)] aims to protect the right to be free from gender-based discrimination in the workplace); 
				<em>
					Kimel, supra
				</em>
				, at 83 (right to be free from unconstitutional age discrimination in employment); 
				<em>
					City of Boerne, supra,
				</em>
				 at 529 (right of free exercise of religion).  The scope of that right, we explained, is quite limited; indeed, the Equal Protection Clause permits a State to classify on the basis of disability so long as it has a rational basis for doing so.

				In this case, the task of identifying the scope of the relevant constitutional protection is more difficult because Title II purports to enforce a panoply of constitutional rights of disabled persons: not only the equal protection right against irrational discrimination, but also certain rights protected by the Due Process Clause.  
				<em>

				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 19, the proper inquiry focuses on the scope of those due process rights.  The Court cites four access-to-the-courts rights that Title II purportedly enforces: (1) the right of the criminal defendant to be present at all critical stages of the trial,

				Having traced the metes and bounds of the constitutional rights at issue, the next step in the congruence-and-proportionality inquiry requires us to examine whether Congress identified a history and pattern of violations of these constitutional rights by the States with respect to the disabled.  
				<em>
					Garrett, 
				</em>
				531 U. S., at 368.  This step is crucial to determining whether Title II is a legitimate attempt to remedy or prevent actual constitutional violations by the States or an illegitimate attempt to rewrite the constitutional provisions it purports to enforce.  Indeed, Congress §5 power is appropriately exercised 
				<em>
					only
				</em>
				 in response to state transgressions.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				 (emphasis added).  But the majority identifies nothing in the legislative record that shows Congress was responding to widespread violations of the due process rights of disabled persons.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Rather than limiting its discussion of constitutional violations to the due process rights on which it ultimately relies, the majority sets out on a wide-ranging account of societal discrimination against the disabled.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 1215.  This digression recounts historical discrimination against the disabled through institutionalization laws, restrictions on marriage, voting, and public education, conditions in mental hospitals, and various other forms of unequal treatment in the administration of public programs and services.  Some of this evidence would be relevant if the Court were considering the constitutionality of the statute as a whole; but the Court rejects that approach in favor of a narrower as-applied inquiry.

				Lacking any real evidence that Congress was responding to actual due process violations, the majority relies primarily on three items to justify its decision: (1) a 1983 U. S. Civil Rights Commission Report showing that 76% of public services and programs housed in state-owned buildings were inaccessible to persons with disabilities, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1516; (2) testimony before a House subcommittee regarding the physical inaccessibility of local courthouses, 
				<em>
					ante

				, at 16; and (3) evidence submitted to Congress designated ADA task force that purportedly contains numerous examples of the exclusion of persons with disabilities from state judicial services and programs.  Ibid.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				On closer examination, however, the Civil Rights Commissions finding consists of a single conclusory sentence in its report, and it is far from clear that its finding even includes courthouses. The House subcommittee report, for its part, contains the testimony of two
				 witnesses, neither of whom reported being denied the right to be present at constitutionally protected court proceedings.

            </a>
				  Indeed, the witnesses testimony, like the U. S. Civil Rights Commission Report, concerns only physical barriers to access, and does not address whether States either provided means to overcome those barriers or alternative locations for proceedings involving disabled persons.  Cf., n. 4, 
				<em>

				Based on the majoritys description, 
				<em>
					ante, 
				</em>
				at 16, the report of the ADA Task Force on the Rights and Empowerment of Americans with Disabilities sounds promising.  But the report itself says nothing about any disabled person being denied access to court.  The Court thus apparently relies solely on a general citation to the Governments Lodging in 
				<em>
					Garrett
				</em>
				, O. T. 2000, No. 991240 which, amidst thousands of pages, contains only a few anecdotal handwritten reports of physically inaccessible courthouses, again with no mention of whether States provided alternate means of access.  This evidence, moreover, was submitted not to Congress, but only to the task force, which itself made no findings regarding disabled persons access to judicial proceedings.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Garrett
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				531 U. S., at 370371 (rejecting anecdotal task force evidence for similar reasons).  As we noted in

				Even if the anecdotal evidence and conclusory statements relied on by the majority could be properly considered, the mere existence of an architecturally inaccessible courthouse
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, one a disabled person cannot utilize without assistancedoes not state a constitutional violation.  A violation of due process occurs only when a person is actually denied the constitutional right to access a given  judicial proceeding.  We have never held that a person has a 
				<em>
					constitutional
				</em>
				 right to make his way into a courtroom without any external assistance.  Indeed, the fact that the State may need to assist an individual to attend a hearing has no bearing on whether the individual successfully exercises his due process right to be present at the proceeding.  Nor does an inaccessible courthouse violate the Equal Protection Clause, unless it is irrational for the State not to alter the courthouse to make it accessible.  But financial considerations almost always furnish a rational basis for a State to decline to make those alterations.  See 
				<em>
					Garrett, 
				</em>
				531 U. S.
				<em>
					, 
				</em>
				at 372 (noting that it would be constitutional for an employer to conserve scarce financial resources by hiring employees who can use existing facilities rather than making the facilities accessible to disabled employees).  Thus, evidence regarding inaccessible courthouses, because it is not evidence of constitutional violations, provides no basis to abrogate States sovereign immunity.

				The barren record here should likewise be fatal to the majoritys holding that Title II is valid legislation enforcing due process rights that involve access to the courts.  This conclusion gains even more support when Title IIs nonexistent record of constitutional violations is compared with legislation that we have sustained as valid §5 enforcement legislation.  See,

Its provisions affect transportation, health, education, and recreation programs, among many others, all of which are accorded only rational-basis scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause.  A requirement of accommodation for the disabled at a state-owned amusement park or sports stadium, for example, bears no permissible prophylactic relationship to enabling disabled persons to exercise their fundamental constitutional rights.  Thus, as with Title I in

).  I have grave doubts about importing an as applied approach into the §5 context.  While the majority is of course correct that this Court normally only considers the application of a statute to a particular case, the proper inquiry under 
				<em>
					City of Boerne 
				</em>
				and its progeny is somewhat different.  In applying the congruence-and-proportionality test, we ask whether Congress has attempted to statutorily redefine the constitutional rights protected by the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>.  This question can only be answered by measuring the breadth of a statutes coverage against the scope of the constitutional rights it purports to enforce and the record of violations it purports to remedy.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In conducting its as-applied analysis, however, the majority posits a hypothetical statute, never enacted by Congress, that applies only to courthouses.  The effect is to rig the congruence-and-proportionality test by artificially constricting the scope of the statute to closely mirror a recognized constitutional right.  But Title II is not susceptible of being carved up in this manner; it applies indiscriminately to all services, programs, or activities of any public entity.  Thus, the majoritys approach is not really an assessment of whether Title II is appropriate 
				<em>
					legislation
				</em>
				 at all, U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, §5 (emphasis added), but a test of whether the Court can conceive of a hypothetical statute narrowly tailored enough to constitute valid prophylactic legislation.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Our §5 precedents do not support this as-applied approach.  In each case, we measured the full breadth of the statute or relevant provision that Congress enacted against the scope of the constitutional right it purported to enforce.  If we had arbitrarily constricted the scope of the statutes to match the scope of a core constitutional right, those cases might have come out differently.  In 
				<em>
					Garrett
				</em>
				, for example, Title I might have been upheld as applied to irrational employment discrimination; or in 
				<em>

				I fear that the Courts adoption of an as-applied approach eliminates any incentive for Congress to craft §5 legislation for the purpose of remedying or deterring actual constitutional violations.  Congress can now simply rely on the courts to sort out which hypothetical applications of an undifferentiated statute, such as Title II, may be enforced against the States.  All the while, States will be subjected to substantial litigation in a piecemeal attempt to vindicate their 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxi" class="subref" title="subref">Eleventh Amendment</a> rights.  The majoritys as-applied approach simply cannot be squared with either our recent precedent or the proper role of the Judiciary.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Even in the limited courthouse-access context, Title II does not properly abrogate state sovereign immunity.  As demonstrated in depth above, Congress utterly failed to identify any evidence that disabled persons were denied constitutionally protected access to judicial proceedings.  Without this predicate showing, Title II, even if we were to hypothesize that it applies only to courthouses, cannot be viewed as a congruent and proportional response to state constitutional violations.

				Moreover, even in the courthouse-access context, Title II requires substantially more than the Due Process Clause.  Title II subjects States to private lawsuits if,

				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				cilities, such as removing architectural … barriers. 42 U. S., C. §§12131(2), 12132.  Yet the statute is not limited to occasions when the failure to modify results, or will likely result, in an actual due process violation
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, the inability of a disabled person to participate in a judicial proceeding.  Indeed, liability is triggered if an inaccessible building results in a disabled person being subjected to discriminationa term that presumably encompasses any sort of inconvenience in accessing the facility, for whatever purpose.  §12132.

, and other cases in which we held that due process requires the State to waive filing fees for indigent litigants, is unavailing.  While these cases support the principle that the State must remove financial requirements that in fact prevent an individual from exercising his constitutional rights, they certainly do not support a statute that subjects a State to liability for failing to make a vast array of special accommodations, without regard for whether the failure to accommodate results in a constitutional wrong.

				In this respect, Title II is analogous to the Patent Remedy Act at issue in Florida Prepaid.
				  That statute subjected States to monetary liability for any act of patent infringement.  527 U. S., at 646647.  Thus, Congress did nothing to limit the Acts coverage to cases involving arguable [Due Process] violations, such as when the infringement was nonnegligent or uncompensated.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  Similarly here, Congress has authorized private damages suits against a State for merely maintaining a courthouse that is not readily accessible to the disabled, without regard to whether a disabled persons due process rights are ever violated.  Accordingly, even as applied to the access to the courts context, Title IIs indiscriminate scope offends [the congruence-and-proportionality] principle, particularly in light of the lack of record evidence showing that inaccessible courthouses cause actual Due Process violations.

In light of these facts, it can hardly be said that the State violated Lanes right to be present at his trial; indeed, it made affirmative attempts to secure that right.  Respondent Jones, a disabled court reporter, does not seriously contend that she suffered a constitutional injury.

However, one does not usually refer to the right to attend a judicial proceeding as access to [a] public servic[e].  Given the lack of any concern over courthouse accessibility issues in the legislative history, it is highly unlikely that this legislative finding obliquely refers to state violations of the due process rights of disabled persons to attend judicial proceedings.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">736</a> (2003)
).  However, this Courts precedents attest that Congress may not dispense with the required showing altogether simply because it purports to enforce due process rights.  See Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd. v. College Savings Bank,

 (same with respect to Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA)).  As the foregoing discussion demonstrates, that is precisely what the Court has sanctioned here.  Because the record is utterly devoid of proof that Congress was responding to state violations of due process access-to-the-courts rights, this case is controlled by Florida Prepaid and City of Boerne, rather than Hibbs.

						 Title IIs all-encompassing approach to regulating public services contrasts starkly with the more closely tailored laws we have upheld as legitimate prophylactic §5 legislation.  In Hibbs, for example, the FMLA was narrowly targeted to remedy widespread gender discrimination in the availability of family leave.  538 U. S., at 738739 (distinguishing City of Boerne, Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/528/62" class="subref" title="subref">528 U. S. 62</a> (2000)
, and Garrett on this ground).  Similarly, in cases involving enforcement of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifteenth Amendment</a>, we upheld limited remedial scheme[s] that were narrowly tailored to address massive evidence of discrimination in voting.  Garrett, 531 U. S., at 373 (discussing South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/383/301" class="subref" title="subref">383 U. S. 301</a> (1966)

						 Raines is inapposite in any event.  The Court there considered the constitutionality of the Civil Rights Act of 1957a statute designed to enforce the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifteenth Amendment</a>whose narrowly tailored substantive provisions could unquestionably be applied to state actors (like the respondents therein).  362 U. S., at 25, 26.  The only question presented was whether the statute was facially invalid because it might be read to constrain nonstate actors as well.  Id., at 20.  The Court upheld the statute as applied to respondents and declined to entertain the facial challenge.  Id., at 2426.  The situation in this case is much different: The very question presented is whether Title IIs indiscriminate substantive provisions can constitutionally be applied to the petitioner State.  Raines thus provides no support for avoiding this question by conjuring up an imaginary statute with substantive provisions that might pass the congruence-and-proportionality test.

						 The majoritys invocation of Hibbs to justify Title IIs overbreadth is unpersuasive.  See ante, at 22, n. 24.  The Hibbs Court concluded that in light of the evidence before Congress the FMLAs 12-week family-leave provision was necessary to achiev[e] Congress remedial object.  538 U. S, at 748.  The Court found that the legislative record included not only evidence of state constitutional violations, but evidence that a provision merely enforcing the Equal Protection Clause would actually perpetuate the gender stereotypes Congress sought to eradicate because employers could simply eliminate family leave entirely.  Ibid.  Without comparable evidence of constitutional violations and the necessity of prophylactic measures, the Court has no basis on which to uphold Title IIs special-accommodation requirements.

				The first step is to identify with some precision the scope of the constitutional right at issue.  
				<em>

				</em>
				at 365.  This task was easy in 
				<em>
					Garrett, Hibbs, Kimel, 
				</em>
				and 
				<em>
					City of Boerne
				</em>
				 because the statutes in those cases sought to enforce only one constitutional right.  In 
				<em>
					Garrett
				</em>
				, for example, the statute addressed the equal protection right of disabled persons to be free from unconstitutional employment discrimination.  
				<em>
					Garrett, supra, 
				</em>
				at 365.  See also 
				<em>
					Hibbs, supra
				</em>
				, at 728 (The [Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA)] aims to protect the right to be free from gender-based discrimination in the workplace); 
				<em>

				</em>
				, at 83 (right to be free from unconstitutional age discrimination in employment); 
				<em>
					City of Boerne, supra,
				</em>
				 at 529 (right of free exercise of religion).  The scope of that right, we explained, is quite limited; indeed, the Equal Protection Clause permits a State to classify on the basis of disability so long as it has a rational basis for doing so.

				In this case, the task of identifying the scope of the relevant constitutional protection is more difficult because Title II purports to enforce a panoply of constitutional rights of disabled persons: not only the equal protection right against irrational discrimination, but also certain rights protected by the Due Process Clause.

				Having traced the metes and bounds of the constitutional rights at issue, the next step in the congruence-and-proportionality inquiry requires us to examine whether Congress identified a history and pattern of violations of these constitutional rights by the States with respect to the disabled.  
				<em>
					Garrett, 
				</em>
				531 U. S., at 368.  This step is crucial to determining whether Title II is a legitimate attempt to remedy or prevent actual constitutional violations by the States or an illegitimate attempt to rewrite the constitutional provisions it purports to enforce.  Indeed, Congress §5 power is appropriately exercised 
				<em>
					only
				</em>
				 in response to state transgressions.  
				<em>

				Rather than limiting its discussion of constitutional violations to the due process rights on which it ultimately relies, the majority sets out on a wide-ranging account of societal discrimination against the disabled.  
				<em>

				, at 1215.  This digression recounts historical discrimination against the disabled through institutionalization laws, restrictions on marriage, voting, and public education, conditions in mental hospitals, and various other forms of unequal treatment in the administration of public programs and services.  Some of this evidence would be relevant if the Court were considering the constitutionality of the statute as a whole; but the Court rejects that approach in favor of a narrower as-applied inquiry.

				Lacking any real evidence that Congress was responding to actual due process violations, the majority relies primarily on three items to justify its decision: (1) a 1983 U. S. Civil Rights Commission Report showing that 76% of public services and programs housed in state-owned buildings were inaccessible to persons with disabilities, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1516; (2) testimony before a House subcommittee regarding the physical inaccessibility of local courthouses, 
				<em>

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				On closer examination, however, the Civil Rights Commissions finding consists of a single conclusory sentence in its report, and it is far from clear that its finding even includes courthouses. The House subcommittee report, for its part, contains the testimony of two
				 witnesses, neither of whom reported being denied the right to be present at constitutionally protected court proceedings.

                </sup>
            </a>
				  Indeed, the witnesses testimony, like the U. S. Civil Rights Commission Report, concerns only physical barriers to access, and does not address whether States either provided means to overcome those barriers or alternative locations for proceedings involving disabled persons.  Cf., n. 4,

				Based on the majoritys description, 
				<em>
					ante, 
				</em>
				at 16, the report of the ADA Task Force on the Rights and Empowerment of Americans with Disabilities sounds promising.  But the report itself says nothing about any disabled person being denied access to court.  The Court thus apparently relies solely on a general citation to the Governments Lodging in 
				<em>
					Garrett
				</em>
				, O. T. 2000, No. 991240 which, amidst thousands of pages, contains only a few anecdotal handwritten reports of physically inaccessible courthouses, again with no mention of whether States provided alternate means of access.  This evidence, moreover, was submitted not to Congress, but only to the task force, which itself made no findings regarding disabled persons access to judicial proceedings.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Garrett
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				531 U. S., at 370371 (rejecting anecdotal task force evidence for similar reasons).  As we noted in

				Even if the anecdotal evidence and conclusory statements relied on by the majority could be properly considered, the mere existence of an architecturally inaccessible courthouse
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, one a disabled person cannot utilize without assistancedoes not state a constitutional violation.  A violation of due process occurs only when a person is actually denied the constitutional right to access a given  judicial proceeding.  We have never held that a person has a 
				<em>
					constitutional
				</em>
				 right to make his way into a courtroom without any external assistance.  Indeed, the fact that the State may need to assist an individual to attend a hearing has no bearing on whether the individual successfully exercises his due process right to be present at the proceeding.  Nor does an inaccessible courthouse violate the Equal Protection Clause, unless it is irrational for the State not to alter the courthouse to make it accessible.  But financial considerations almost always furnish a rational basis for a State to decline to make those alterations.

Its provisions affect transportation, health, education, and recreation programs, among many others, all of which are accorded only rational-basis scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause.  A requirement of accommodation for the disabled at a state-owned amusement park or sports stadium, for example, bears no permissible prophylactic relationship to enabling disabled persons to exercise their fundamental constitutional rights.

).  I have grave doubts about importing an as applied approach into the §5 context.  While the majority is of course correct that this Court normally only considers the application of a statute to a particular case, the proper inquiry under 
				<em>
					City of Boerne 
				</em>
				and its progeny is somewhat different.  In applying the congruence-and-proportionality test, we ask whether Congress has attempted to statutorily redefine the constitutional rights protected by the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>.  This question can only be answered by measuring the breadth of a statutes coverage against the scope of the constitutional rights it purports to enforce and the record of violations it purports to remedy.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In conducting its as-applied analysis, however, the majority posits a hypothetical statute, never enacted by Congress, that applies only to courthouses.  The effect is to rig the congruence-and-proportionality test by artificially constricting the scope of the statute to closely mirror a recognized constitutional right.  But Title II is not susceptible of being carved up in this manner; it applies indiscriminately to all services, programs, or activities of any public entity.  Thus, the majoritys approach is not really an assessment of whether Title II is appropriate 
				<em>
					legislation
				</em>
				 at all, U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, §5 (emphasis added), but a test of whether the Court can conceive of a hypothetical statute narrowly tailored enough to constitute valid prophylactic legislation.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Our §5 precedents do not support this as-applied approach.  In each case, we measured the full breadth of the statute or relevant provision that Congress enacted against the scope of the constitutional right it purported to enforce.  If we had arbitrarily constricted the scope of the statutes to match the scope of a core constitutional right, those cases might have come out differently.  In 
				<em>

				</em>
				, for example, Title I might have been upheld as applied to irrational employment discrimination; or in 
				<em>

				I fear that the Courts adoption of an as-applied approach eliminates any incentive for Congress to craft §5 legislation for the purpose of remedying or deterring actual constitutional violations.  Congress can now simply rely on the courts to sort out which hypothetical applications of an undifferentiated statute, such as Title II, may be enforced against the States.  All the while, States will be subjected to substantial litigation in a piecemeal attempt to vindicate their 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxi" class="subref" title="subref">Eleventh Amendment</a> rights.  The majoritys as-applied approach simply cannot be squared with either our recent precedent or the proper role of the Judiciary.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Even in the limited courthouse-access context, Title II does not properly abrogate state sovereign immunity.  As demonstrated in depth above, Congress utterly failed to identify any evidence that disabled persons were denied constitutionally protected access to judicial proceedings.  Without this predicate showing, Title II, even if we were to hypothesize that it applies only to courthouses, cannot be viewed as a congruent and proportional response to state constitutional violations.

				Moreover, even in the courthouse-access context, Title II requires substantially more than the Due Process Clause.  Title II subjects States to private lawsuits if,

				 they fail to make reasonable modifications to fa-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				cilities, such as removing architectural … barriers. 42 U. S., C. §§12131(2), 12132.  Yet the statute is not limited to occasions when the failure to modify results, or will likely result, in an actual due process violation
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, the inability of a disabled person to participate in a judicial proceeding.  Indeed, liability is triggered if an inaccessible building results in a disabled person being subjected to discriminationa term that presumably encompasses any sort of inconvenience in accessing the facility, for whatever purpose.  §12132.

, and other cases in which we held that due process requires the State to waive filing fees for indigent litigants, is unavailing.  While these cases support the principle that the State must remove financial requirements that in fact prevent an individual from exercising his constitutional rights, they certainly do not support a statute that subjects a State to liability for failing to make a vast array of special accommodations, without regard for whether the failure to accommodate results in a constitutional wrong.

				In this respect, Title II is analogous to the Patent Remedy Act at issue in Florida Prepaid.
				  That statute subjected States to monetary liability for any act of patent infringement.  527 U. S., at 646647.  Thus, Congress did nothing to limit the Acts coverage to cases involving arguable [Due Process] violations, such as when the infringement was nonnegligent or uncompensated.  
				<em>
					Ibid.

				  Similarly here, Congress has authorized private damages suits against a State for merely maintaining a courthouse that is not readily accessible to the disabled, without regard to whether a disabled persons due process rights are ever violated.  Accordingly, even as applied to the access to the courts context, Title IIs indiscriminate scope offends [the congruence-and-proportionality] principle, particularly in light of the lack of record evidence showing that inaccessible courthouses cause actual Due Process violations.

However, one does not usually refer to the right to attend a judicial proceeding as access to [a] public servic[e].  Given the lack of any concern over courthouse accessibility issues in the legislative history, it is highly unlikely that this legislative finding obliquely refers to state violations of the due process rights of disabled persons to attend judicial proceedings.

).  However, this Courts precedents attest that Congress may not dispense with the required showing altogether simply because it purports to enforce due process rights.  See Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd. v. College Savings Bank,

						 Title IIs all-encompassing approach to regulating public services contrasts starkly with the more closely tailored laws we have upheld as legitimate prophylactic §5 legislation.

						 Raines is inapposite in any event.  The Court there considered the constitutionality of the Civil Rights Act of 1957a statute designed to enforce the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifteenth Amendment</a>whose narrowly tailored substantive provisions could unquestionably be applied to state actors (like the respondents therein).  362 U. S., at 25, 26.  The only question presented was whether the statute was facially invalid because it might be read to constrain nonstate actors as well.  Id., at 20.  The Court upheld the statute as applied to respondents and declined to entertain the facial challenge.  Id., at 2426.  The situation in this case is much different: The very question presented is whether Title IIs indiscriminate substantive provisions can constitutionally be applied to the petitioner State.  Raines thus provides no support for avoiding this question by conjuring up an imaginary statute with substantive provisions that might pass the congruence-and-proportionality test.

						 The majoritys invocation of Hibbs to justify Title IIs overbreadth is unpersuasive.  See ante, at 22, n. 24.  The Hibbs Court concluded that in light of the evidence before Congress the FMLAs 12-week family-leave provision was necessary to achiev[e] Congress remedial object.  538 U. S, at 748.  The Court found that the legislative record included not only evidence of state constitutional violations, but evidence that a provision merely enforcing the Equal Protection Clause would actually perpetuate the gender stereotypes Congress sought to eradicate because employers could simply eliminate family leave entirely.  Ibid.  Without comparable evidence of constitutional violations and the necessity of prophylactic measures, the Court has no basis on which to uphold Title IIs special-accommodation requirements.

				The first step is to identify with some precision the scope of the constitutional right at issue.

				</em>
				at 365.  This task was easy in 
				<em>
					Garrett, Hibbs, Kimel, 
				</em>
				and 
				<em>

				</em>
				 because the statutes in those cases sought to enforce only one constitutional right.  In 
				<em>
					Garrett
				</em>
				, for example, the statute addressed the equal protection right of disabled persons to be free from unconstitutional employment discrimination.  
				<em>
					Garrett, supra, 
				</em>
				at 365.  See also 
				<em>

				</em>
				, at 83 (right to be free from unconstitutional age discrimination in employment); 
				<em>
					City of Boerne, supra,
				</em>
				 at 529 (right of free exercise of religion).  The scope of that right, we explained, is quite limited; indeed, the Equal Protection Clause permits a State to classify on the basis of disability so long as it has a rational basis for doing so.

				In this case, the task of identifying the scope of the relevant constitutional protection is more difficult because Title II purports to enforce a panoply of constitutional rights of disabled persons: not only the equal protection right against irrational discrimination, but also certain rights protected by the Due Process Clause.

				Having traced the metes and bounds of the constitutional rights at issue, the next step in the congruence-and-proportionality inquiry requires us to examine whether Congress identified a history and pattern of violations of these constitutional rights by the States with respect to the disabled.  
				<em>
					Garrett, 
				</em>
				531 U. S., at 368.  This step is crucial to determining whether Title II is a legitimate attempt to remedy or prevent actual constitutional violations by the States or an illegitimate attempt to rewrite the constitutional provisions it purports to enforce.  Indeed, Congress §5 power is appropriately exercised 
				<em>
					only
				</em>
				 in response to state transgressions.  
				<em>

				Rather than limiting its discussion of constitutional violations to the due process rights on which it ultimately relies, the majority sets out on a wide-ranging account of societal discrimination against the disabled.  
				<em>

				, at 1215.  This digression recounts historical discrimination against the disabled through institutionalization laws, restrictions on marriage, voting, and public education, conditions in mental hospitals, and various other forms of unequal treatment in the administration of public programs and services.  Some of this evidence would be relevant if the Court were considering the constitutionality of the statute as a whole; but the Court rejects that approach in favor of a narrower as-applied inquiry.

				Lacking any real evidence that Congress was responding to actual due process violations, the majority relies primarily on three items to justify its decision: (1) a 1983 U. S. Civil Rights Commission Report showing that 76% of public services and programs housed in state-owned buildings were inaccessible to persons with disabilities, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1516; (2) testimony before a House subcommittee regarding the physical inaccessibility of local courthouses, 
				<em>

				, at 16; and (3) evidence submitted to Congress designated ADA task force that purportedly contains numerous examples of the exclusion of persons with disabilities from state judicial services and programs.  Ibid.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				On closer examination, however, the Civil Rights Commissions finding consists of a single conclusory sentence in its report, and it is far from clear that its finding even includes courthouses. The House subcommittee report, for its part, contains the testimony of two
				 witnesses, neither of whom reported being denied the right to be present at constitutionally protected court proceedings.

            </a>
				  Indeed, the witnesses testimony, like the U. S. Civil Rights Commission Report, concerns only physical barriers to access, and does not address whether States either provided means to overcome those barriers or alternative locations for proceedings involving disabled persons.  Cf., n. 4, 
				<em>

				Based on the majoritys description, 
				<em>
					ante,

				at 16, the report of the ADA Task Force on the Rights and Empowerment of Americans with Disabilities sounds promising.  But the report itself says nothing about any disabled person being denied access to court.  The Court thus apparently relies solely on a general citation to the Governments Lodging in 
				<em>
					Garrett
				</em>
				, O. T. 2000, No. 991240 which, amidst thousands of pages, contains only a few anecdotal handwritten reports of physically inaccessible courthouses, again with no mention of whether States provided alternate means of access.  This evidence, moreover, was submitted not to Congress, but only to the task force, which itself made no findings regarding disabled persons access to judicial proceedings.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Garrett

				Even if the anecdotal evidence and conclusory statements relied on by the majority could be properly considered, the mere existence of an architecturally inaccessible courthouse
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, one a disabled person cannot utilize without assistancedoes not state a constitutional violation.  A violation of due process occurs only when a person is actually denied the constitutional right to access a given  judicial proceeding.  We have never held that a person has a 
				<em>
					constitutional
				</em>
				 right to make his way into a courtroom without any external assistance.  Indeed, the fact that the State may need to assist an individual to attend a hearing has no bearing on whether the individual successfully exercises his due process right to be present at the proceeding.  Nor does an inaccessible courthouse violate the Equal Protection Clause, unless it is irrational for the State not to alter the courthouse to make it accessible.  But financial considerations almost always furnish a rational basis for a State to decline to make those alterations.  See 
				<em>
					Garrett, 
				</em>
				531 U. S.
				<em>
					, 
				</em>
				at 372 (noting that it would be constitutional for an employer to conserve scarce financial resources by hiring employees who can use existing facilities rather than making the facilities accessible to disabled employees).  Thus, evidence regarding inaccessible courthouses, because it is not evidence of constitutional violations, provides no basis to abrogate States sovereign immunity.

				The barren record here should likewise be fatal to the majoritys holding that Title II is valid legislation enforcing due process rights that involve access to the courts.

				Title II provides that no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/12132.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §12132</a>.  A disabled person is considered qualified if he meets the essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of the entitys services or participation in the entitys programs, 

The ADAs findings make clear that Congress believed it was attacking discrimination in all areas of public services, as well as the discriminatory effect of architectural, transportation, and communication barriers.  §§12101(a)(3), (a)(5).  In sum, Title II requires, on pain of money damages, special accommodations for disabled persons in virtually every interaction they have with the State.

Its provisions affect transportation, health, education, and recreation programs, among many others, all of which are accorded only rational-basis scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause.  A requirement of accommodation for the disabled at a state-owned amusement park or sports stadium, for example, bears no permissible prophylactic relationship to enabling disabled persons to exercise their fundamental constitutional rights.

).  I have grave doubts about importing an as applied approach into the §5 context.  While the majority is of course correct that this Court normally only considers the application of a statute to a particular case, the proper inquiry under 
				<em>
					City of Boerne 
				</em>
				and its progeny is somewhat different.  In applying the congruence-and-proportionality test, we ask whether Congress has attempted to statutorily redefine the constitutional rights protected by the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>.  This question can only be answered by measuring the breadth of a statutes coverage against the scope of the constitutional rights it purports to enforce and the record of violations it purports to remedy.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In conducting its as-applied analysis, however, the majority posits a hypothetical statute, never enacted by Congress, that applies only to courthouses.  The effect is to rig the congruence-and-proportionality test by artificially constricting the scope of the statute to closely mirror a recognized constitutional right.  But Title II is not susceptible of being carved up in this manner; it applies indiscriminately to all services, programs, or activities of any public entity.  Thus, the majoritys approach is not really an assessment of whether Title II is appropriate 
				<em>
					legislation
				</em>
				 at all, U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, §5 (emphasis added), but a test of whether the Court can conceive of a hypothetical statute narrowly tailored enough to constitute valid prophylactic legislation.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Our §5 precedents do not support this as-applied approach.  In each case, we measured the full breadth of the statute or relevant provision that Congress enacted against the scope of the constitutional right it purported to enforce.  If we had arbitrarily constricted the scope of the statutes to match the scope of a core constitutional right, those cases might have come out differently.  In 
				<em>
					Garrett
				</em>
				, for example, Title I might have been upheld as applied to irrational employment discrimination; or in 
				<em>
					Florida Prepaid

				, the Patent Remedy Act might have been upheld as applied to intentional, uncompensated patent infringements.  It is thus not surprising that the only authority cited by the majority is

				I fear that the Courts adoption of an as-applied approach eliminates any incentive for Congress to craft §5 legislation for the purpose of remedying or deterring actual constitutional violations.  Congress can now simply rely on the courts to sort out which hypothetical applications of an undifferentiated statute, such as Title II, may be enforced against the States.  All the while, States will be subjected to substantial litigation in a piecemeal attempt to vindicate their 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxi" class="subref" title="subref">Eleventh Amendment</a> rights.  The majoritys as-applied approach simply cannot be squared with either our recent precedent or the proper role of the Judiciary.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Even in the limited courthouse-access context, Title II does not properly abrogate state sovereign immunity.  As demonstrated in depth above, Congress utterly failed to identify any evidence that disabled persons were denied constitutionally protected access to judicial proceedings.  Without this predicate showing, Title II, even if we were to hypothesize that it applies only to courthouses, cannot be viewed as a congruent and proportional response to state constitutional violations.

				Moreover, even in the courthouse-access context, Title II requires substantially more than the Due Process Clause.  Title II subjects States to private lawsuits if,

				 they fail to make reasonable modifications to fa-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				cilities, such as removing architectural … barriers. 42 U. S., C. §§12131(2), 12132.  Yet the statute is not limited to occasions when the failure to modify results, or will likely result, in an actual due process violation
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, the inability of a disabled person to participate in a judicial proceeding.  Indeed, liability is triggered if an inaccessible building results in a disabled person being subjected to discriminationa term that presumably encompasses any sort of inconvenience in accessing the facility, for whatever purpose.  §12132.

, and other cases in which we held that due process requires the State to waive filing fees for indigent litigants, is unavailing.  While these cases support the principle that the State must remove financial requirements that in fact prevent an individual from exercising his constitutional rights, they certainly do not support a statute that subjects a State to liability for failing to make a vast array of special accommodations, without regard for whether the failure to accommodate results in a constitutional wrong.

				In this respect, Title II is analogous to the Patent Remedy Act at issue in Florida Prepaid.
				  That statute subjected States to monetary liability for any act of patent infringement.  527 U. S., at 646647.  Thus, Congress did nothing to limit the Acts coverage to cases involving arguable [Due Process] violations, such as when the infringement was nonnegligent or uncompensated.  
				<em>
					Ibid.

				  Similarly here, Congress has authorized private damages suits against a State for merely maintaining a courthouse that is not readily accessible to the disabled, without regard to whether a disabled persons due process rights are ever violated.  Accordingly, even as applied to the access to the courts context, Title IIs indiscriminate scope offends [the congruence-and-proportionality] principle, particularly in light of the lack of record evidence showing that inaccessible courthouses cause actual Due Process violations.

However, one does not usually refer to the right to attend a judicial proceeding as access to [a] public servic[e].  Given the lack of any concern over courthouse accessibility issues in the legislative history, it is highly unlikely that this legislative finding obliquely refers to state violations of the due process rights of disabled persons to attend judicial proceedings.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">736</a> (2003)
).  However, this Courts precedents attest that Congress may not dispense with the required showing altogether simply because it purports to enforce due process rights.  See Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd. v. College Savings Bank,

 (same with respect to Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA)).  As the foregoing discussion demonstrates, that is precisely what the Court has sanctioned here.  Because the record is utterly devoid of proof that Congress was responding to state violations of due process access-to-the-courts rights, this case is controlled by Florida Prepaid and City of Boerne, rather than Hibbs.

						 Title IIs all-encompassing approach to regulating public services contrasts starkly with the more closely tailored laws we have upheld as legitimate prophylactic §5 legislation.  In Hibbs, for example, the FMLA was narrowly targeted to remedy widespread gender discrimination in the availability of family leave.  538 U. S., at 738739 (distinguishing City of Boerne, Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/528/62" class="subref" title="subref">528 U. S. 62</a> (2000)
, and Garrett on this ground).  Similarly, in cases involving enforcement of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifteenth Amendment</a>, we upheld limited remedial scheme[s] that were narrowly tailored to address massive evidence of discrimination in voting.  Garrett, 531 U. S., at 373 (discussing South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/383/301" class="subref" title="subref">383 U. S. 301</a> (1966)
).  Unlike these statutes, Title IIs indiscriminate scope … is particularly incongruous in light of the scant support for the predicate unconstitutional conduct that Congress intended to remedy.  Florida Prepaid, 527 U. S., at 647.

						 Raines is inapposite in any event.  The Court there considered the constitutionality of the Civil Rights Act of 1957a statute designed to enforce the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifteenth Amendment</a>whose narrowly tailored substantive provisions could unquestionably be applied to state actors (like the respondents therein).  362 U. S., at 25, 26.  The only question presented was whether the statute was facially invalid because it might be read to constrain nonstate actors as well.  Id., at 20.  The Court upheld the statute as applied to respondents and declined to entertain the facial challenge.  Id., at 2426.  The situation in this case is much different: The very question presented is whether Title IIs indiscriminate substantive provisions can constitutionally be applied to the petitioner State.  Raines thus provides no support for avoiding this question by conjuring up an imaginary statute with substantive provisions that might pass the congruence-and-proportionality test.

						 The majoritys invocation of Hibbs to justify Title IIs overbreadth is unpersuasive.  See ante, at 22, n. 24.  The Hibbs Court concluded that in light of the evidence before Congress the FMLAs 12-week family-leave provision was necessary to achiev[e] Congress remedial object.  538 U. S, at 748.  The Court found that the legislative record included not only evidence of state constitutional violations, but evidence that a provision merely enforcing the Equal Protection Clause would actually perpetuate the gender stereotypes Congress sought to eradicate because employers could simply eliminate family leave entirely.  Ibid.  Without comparable evidence of constitutional violations and the necessity of prophylactic measures, the Court has no basis on which to uphold Title IIs special-accommodation requirements.

				The first step is to identify with some precision the scope of the constitutional right at issue.  
				<em>
					Garrett, supra, 
				</em>
				at 365.  This task was easy in 
				<em>
					Garrett, Hibbs, Kimel, 
				</em>
				and 
				<em>
					City of Boerne
				</em>
				 because the statutes in those cases sought to enforce only one constitutional right.  In 
				<em>
					Garrett
				</em>
				, for example, the statute addressed the equal protection right of disabled persons to be free from unconstitutional employment discrimination.  
				<em>
					Garrett, supra, 
				</em>
				at 365.  See also 
				<em>
					Hibbs, supra
				</em>

				</em>
				, at 83 (right to be free from unconstitutional age discrimination in employment); 
				<em>
					City of Boerne, supra,
				</em>
				 at 529 (right of free exercise of religion).  The scope of that right, we explained, is quite limited; indeed, the Equal Protection Clause permits a State to classify on the basis of disability so long as it has a rational basis for doing so.

				In this case, the task of identifying the scope of the relevant constitutional protection is more difficult because Title II purports to enforce a panoply of constitutional rights of disabled persons: not only the equal protection right against irrational discrimination, but also certain rights protected by the Due Process Clause.  
				<em>

				Having traced the metes and bounds of the constitutional rights at issue, the next step in the congruence-and-proportionality inquiry requires us to examine whether Congress identified a history and pattern of violations of these constitutional rights by the States with respect to the disabled.  
				<em>
					Garrett, 
				</em>
				531 U. S., at 368.  This step is crucial to determining whether Title II is a legitimate attempt to remedy or prevent actual constitutional violations by the States or an illegitimate attempt to rewrite the constitutional provisions it purports to enforce.  Indeed, Congress §5 power is appropriately exercised 
				<em>
					only
				</em>
				 in response to state transgressions.  
				<em>

				Rather than limiting its discussion of constitutional violations to the due process rights on which it ultimately relies, the majority sets out on a wide-ranging account of societal discrimination against the disabled.  
				<em>

				, at 1215.  This digression recounts historical discrimination against the disabled through institutionalization laws, restrictions on marriage, voting, and public education, conditions in mental hospitals, and various other forms of unequal treatment in the administration of public programs and services.  Some of this evidence would be relevant if the Court were considering the constitutionality of the statute as a whole; but the Court rejects that approach in favor of a narrower as-applied inquiry.

				Lacking any real evidence that Congress was responding to actual due process violations, the majority relies primarily on three items to justify its decision: (1) a 1983 U. S. Civil Rights Commission Report showing that 76% of public services and programs housed in state-owned buildings were inaccessible to persons with disabilities, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1516; (2) testimony before a House subcommittee regarding the physical inaccessibility of local courthouses, 
				<em>

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				On closer examination, however, the Civil Rights Commissions finding consists of a single conclusory sentence in its report, and it is far from clear that its finding even includes courthouses. The House subcommittee report, for its part, contains the testimony of two
				 witnesses, neither of whom reported being denied the right to be present at constitutionally protected court proceedings.

            </a>
				  Indeed, the witnesses testimony, like the U. S. Civil Rights Commission Report, concerns only physical barriers to access, and does not address whether States either provided means to overcome those barriers or alternative locations for proceedings involving disabled persons.  Cf., n. 4, 
				<em>

				<em>
					Garrett

				, O. T. 2000, No. 991240 which, amidst thousands of pages, contains only a few anecdotal handwritten reports of physically inaccessible courthouses, again with no mention of whether States provided alternate means of access.

				Even if the anecdotal evidence and conclusory statements relied on by the majority could be properly considered, the mere existence of an architecturally inaccessible courthouse
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, one a disabled person cannot utilize without assistancedoes not state a constitutional violation.  A violation of due process occurs only when a person is actually denied the constitutional right to access a given  judicial proceeding.  We have never held that a person has a 
				<em>
					constitutional
				</em>
				 right to make his way into a courtroom without any external assistance.  Indeed, the fact that the State may need to assist an individual to attend a hearing has no bearing on whether the individual successfully exercises his due process right to be present at the proceeding.  Nor does an inaccessible courthouse violate the Equal Protection Clause, unless it is irrational for the State not to alter the courthouse to make it accessible.  But financial considerations almost always furnish a rational basis for a State to decline to make those alterations.  See 
				<em>
					Garrett, 
				</em>
				531 U. S.
				<em>
					, 
				</em>
				at 372 (noting that it would be constitutional for an employer to conserve scarce financial resources by hiring employees who can use existing facilities rather than making the facilities accessible to disabled employees).  Thus, evidence regarding inaccessible courthouses, because it is not evidence of constitutional violations, provides no basis to abrogate States sovereign immunity.

				The barren record here should likewise be fatal to the majoritys holding that Title II is valid legislation enforcing due process rights that involve access to the courts.

				Title II provides that no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/12132.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §12132</a>.  A disabled person is considered qualified if he meets the essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of the entitys services or participation in the entitys programs, 

				  §12131(2) (emphasis added).  The ADAs findings make clear that Congress believed it was attacking discrimination in all areas of public services, as well as the discriminatory effect of architectural, transportation, and communication barriers.  §§12101(a)(3), (a)(5).  In sum, Title II requires, on pain of money damages, special accommodations for disabled persons in virtually every interaction they have with the State.

Its provisions affect transportation, health, education, and recreation programs, among many others, all of which are accorded only rational-basis scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause.  A requirement of accommodation for the disabled at a state-owned amusement park or sports stadium, for example, bears no permissible prophylactic relationship to enabling disabled persons to exercise their fundamental constitutional rights.

).  I have grave doubts about importing an as applied approach into the §5 context.  While the majority is of course correct that this Court normally only considers the application of a statute to a particular case, the proper inquiry under 
				<em>
					City of Boerne 
				</em>
				and its progeny is somewhat different.  In applying the congruence-and-proportionality test, we ask whether Congress has attempted to statutorily redefine the constitutional rights protected by the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>.  This question can only be answered by measuring the breadth of a statutes coverage against the scope of the constitutional rights it purports to enforce and the record of violations it purports to remedy.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In conducting its as-applied analysis, however, the majority posits a hypothetical statute, never enacted by Congress, that applies only to courthouses.  The effect is to rig the congruence-and-proportionality test by artificially constricting the scope of the statute to closely mirror a recognized constitutional right.  But Title II is not susceptible of being carved up in this manner; it applies indiscriminately to all services, programs, or activities of any public entity.  Thus, the majoritys approach is not really an assessment of whether Title II is appropriate 
				<em>
					legislation
				</em>
				 at all, U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, §5 (emphasis added), but a test of whether the Court can conceive of a hypothetical statute narrowly tailored enough to constitute valid prophylactic legislation.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Our §5 precedents do not support this as-applied approach.  In each case, we measured the full breadth of the statute or relevant provision that Congress enacted against the scope of the constitutional right it purported to enforce.  If we had arbitrarily constricted the scope of the statutes to match the scope of a core constitutional right, those cases might have come out differently.  In 
				<em>
					Garrett
				</em>
				, for example, Title I might have been upheld as applied to irrational employment discrimination; or in 
				<em>
					Florida Prepaid
				</em>
				, the Patent Remedy Act might have been upheld as applied to intentional, uncompensated patent infringements.  It is thus not surprising that the only authority cited by the majority is

				I fear that the Courts adoption of an as-applied approach eliminates any incentive for Congress to craft §5 legislation for the purpose of remedying or deterring actual constitutional violations.  Congress can now simply rely on the courts to sort out which hypothetical applications of an undifferentiated statute, such as Title II, may be enforced against the States.  All the while, States will be subjected to substantial litigation in a piecemeal attempt to vindicate their 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxi" class="subref" title="subref">Eleventh Amendment</a> rights.  The majoritys as-applied approach simply cannot be squared with either our recent precedent or the proper role of the Judiciary.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Even in the limited courthouse-access context, Title II does not properly abrogate state sovereign immunity.  As demonstrated in depth above, Congress utterly failed to identify any evidence that disabled persons were denied constitutionally protected access to judicial proceedings.  Without this predicate showing, Title II, even if we were to hypothesize that it applies only to courthouses, cannot be viewed as a congruent and proportional response to state constitutional violations.

				Moreover, even in the courthouse-access context, Title II requires substantially more than the Due Process Clause.  Title II subjects States to private lawsuits if, 
				<em>
					inter alia,
				</em>
				 they fail to make reasonable modifications to fa-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				cilities, such as removing architectural … barriers. 42 U. S., C. §§12131(2), 12132.  Yet the statute is not limited to occasions when the failure to modify results, or will likely result, in an actual due process violation
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, the inability of a disabled person to participate in a judicial proceeding.  Indeed, liability is triggered if an inaccessible building results in a disabled person being subjected to discriminationa term that presumably encompasses any sort of inconvenience in accessing the facility, for whatever purpose.  §12132.

, and other cases in which we held that due process requires the State to waive filing fees for indigent litigants, is unavailing.  While these cases support the principle that the State must remove financial requirements that in fact prevent an individual from exercising his constitutional rights, they certainly do not support a statute that subjects a State to liability for failing to make a vast array of special accommodations, without regard for whether the failure to accommodate results in a constitutional wrong.

				In this respect, Title II is analogous to the Patent Remedy Act at issue in Florida Prepaid.
				  That statute subjected States to monetary liability for any act of patent infringement.  527 U. S., at 646647.  Thus, Congress did nothing to limit the Acts coverage to cases involving arguable [Due Process] violations, such as when the infringement was nonnegligent or uncompensated.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  Similarly here, Congress has authorized private damages suits against a State for merely maintaining a courthouse that is not readily accessible to the disabled, without regard to whether a disabled persons due process rights are ever violated.  Accordingly, even as applied to the access to the courts context, Title IIs indiscriminate scope offends [the congruence-and-proportionality] principle, particularly in light of the lack of record evidence showing that inaccessible courthouses cause actual Due Process violations.

However, one does not usually refer to the right to attend a judicial proceeding as access to [a] public servic[e].  Given the lack of any concern over courthouse accessibility issues in the legislative history, it is highly unlikely that this legislative finding obliquely refers to state violations of the due process rights of disabled persons to attend judicial proceedings.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/527/627" class="subref" title="subref">527 U. S. 627</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">645</a>646 (1999)
 (invalidating Patent Remedy Act, which purported to enforce the Due Process Clause, because Congress failed to identify a record of constitutional violations); City of Boerne v. Flores, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/521/507" class="subref" title="subref">521 U. S. 507</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">530</a>531 (1997)
 (same with respect to Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA)).  As the foregoing discussion demonstrates, that is precisely what the Court has sanctioned here.  Because the record is utterly devoid of proof that Congress was responding to state violations of due process access-to-the-courts rights, this case is controlled by Florida Prepaid and City of Boerne, rather than Hibbs.

						 Title IIs all-encompassing approach to regulating public services contrasts starkly with the more closely tailored laws we have upheld as legitimate prophylactic §5 legislation.  In Hibbs, for example, the FMLA was narrowly targeted to remedy widespread gender discrimination in the availability of family leave.  538 U. S., at 738739 (distinguishing City of Boerne, Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/528/62" class="subref" title="subref">528 U. S. 62</a> (2000)
, and Garrett on this ground).  Similarly, in cases involving enforcement of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifteenth Amendment</a>, we upheld limited remedial scheme[s] that were narrowly tailored to address massive evidence of discrimination in voting.  Garrett, 531 U. S., at 373 (discussing South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/383/301" class="subref" title="subref">383 U. S. 301</a> (1966)

						 Raines is inapposite in any event.  The Court there considered the constitutionality of the Civil Rights Act of 1957a statute designed to enforce the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifteenth Amendment</a>whose narrowly tailored substantive provisions could unquestionably be applied to state actors (like the respondents therein).  362 U. S., at 25, 26.  The only question presented was whether the statute was facially invalid because it might be read to constrain nonstate actors as well.  Id., at 20.  The Court upheld the statute as applied to respondents and declined to entertain the facial challenge.  Id., at 2426.  The situation in this case is much different: The very question presented is whether Title IIs indiscriminate substantive provisions can constitutionally be applied to the petitioner State.  Raines thus provides no support for avoiding this question by conjuring up an imaginary statute with substantive provisions that might pass the congruence-and-proportionality test.

						 The majoritys invocation of Hibbs to justify Title IIs overbreadth is unpersuasive.  See ante, at 22, n. 24.  The Hibbs Court concluded that in light of the evidence before Congress the FMLAs 12-week family-leave provision was necessary to achiev[e] Congress remedial object.  538 U. S, at 748.  The Court found that the legislative record included not only evidence of state constitutional violations, but evidence that a provision merely enforcing the Equal Protection Clause would actually perpetuate the gender stereotypes Congress sought to eradicate because employers could simply eliminate family leave entirely.  Ibid.  Without comparable evidence of constitutional violations and the necessity of prophylactic measures, the Court has no basis on which to uphold Title IIs special-accommodation requirements.

				The first step is to identify with some precision the scope of the constitutional right at issue.  
				<em>

				</em>
				at 365.  This task was easy in 
				<em>
					Garrett, Hibbs, Kimel, 
				</em>
				and 
				<em>
					City of Boerne
				</em>
				 because the statutes in those cases sought to enforce only one constitutional right.  In 
				<em>
					Garrett
				</em>
				, for example, the statute addressed the equal protection right of disabled persons to be free from unconstitutional employment discrimination.  
				<em>
					Garrett, supra, 
				</em>
				at 365.  See also 
				<em>
					Hibbs, supra

				</em>
				, at 83 (right to be free from unconstitutional age discrimination in employment); 
				<em>
					City of Boerne, supra,
				</em>
				 at 529 (right of free exercise of religion).  The scope of that right, we explained, is quite limited; indeed, the Equal Protection Clause permits a State to classify on the basis of disability so long as it has a rational basis for doing so.

				In this case, the task of identifying the scope of the relevant constitutional protection is more difficult because Title II purports to enforce a panoply of constitutional rights of disabled persons: not only the equal protection right against irrational discrimination, but also certain rights protected by the Due Process Clause.  
				<em>

				<em>
					ante

				, at 19, the proper inquiry focuses on the scope of those due process rights.  The Court cites four access-to-the-courts rights that Title II purportedly enforces: (1) the right of the criminal defendant to be present at all critical stages of the trial,

				Having traced the metes and bounds of the constitutional rights at issue, the next step in the congruence-and-proportionality inquiry requires us to examine whether Congress identified a history and pattern of violations of these constitutional rights by the States with respect to the disabled.  
				<em>
					Garrett, 
				</em>
				531 U. S., at 368.  This step is crucial to determining whether Title II is a legitimate attempt to remedy or prevent actual constitutional violations by the States or an illegitimate attempt to rewrite the constitutional provisions it purports to enforce.  Indeed, Congress §5 power is appropriately exercised 
				<em>
					only
				</em>
				 in response to state transgressions.  
				<em>
					Ibid.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Rather than limiting its discussion of constitutional violations to the due process rights on which it ultimately relies, the majority sets out on a wide-ranging account of societal discrimination against the disabled.  
				<em>

				, at 1215.  This digression recounts historical discrimination against the disabled through institutionalization laws, restrictions on marriage, voting, and public education, conditions in mental hospitals, and various other forms of unequal treatment in the administration of public programs and services.  Some of this evidence would be relevant if the Court were considering the constitutionality of the statute as a whole; but the Court rejects that approach in favor of a narrower as-applied inquiry.

				Lacking any real evidence that Congress was responding to actual due process violations, the majority relies primarily on three items to justify its decision: (1) a 1983 U. S. Civil Rights Commission Report showing that 76% of public services and programs housed in state-owned buildings were inaccessible to persons with disabilities, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1516; (2) testimony before a House subcommittee regarding the physical inaccessibility of local courthouses,

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				On closer examination, however, the Civil Rights Commissions finding consists of a single conclusory sentence in its report, and it is far from clear that its finding even includes courthouses. The House subcommittee report, for its part, contains the testimony of two
				 witnesses, neither of whom reported being denied the right to be present at constitutionally protected court proceedings.

				  Indeed, the witnesses testimony, like the U. S. Civil Rights Commission Report, concerns only physical barriers to access, and does not address whether States either provided means to overcome those barriers or alternative locations for proceedings involving disabled persons.  Cf., n. 4,

				Based on the majoritys description, 
				<em>
					ante, 
				</em>
				at 16, the report of the ADA Task Force on the Rights and Empowerment of Americans with Disabilities sounds promising.  But the report itself says nothing about any disabled person being denied access to court.  The Court thus apparently relies solely on a general citation to the Governments Lodging in 
				<em>
					Garrett
				</em>
				, O. T. 2000, No. 991240 which, amidst thousands of pages, contains only a few anecdotal handwritten reports of physically inaccessible courthouses, again with no mention of whether States provided alternate means of access.  This evidence, moreover, was submitted not to Congress, but only to the task force, which itself made no findings regarding disabled persons access to judicial proceedings.  Cf. 
				<em>

				Even if the anecdotal evidence and conclusory statements relied on by the majority could be properly considered, the mere existence of an architecturally inaccessible courthouse
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, one a disabled person cannot utilize without assistancedoes not state a constitutional violation.  A violation of due process occurs only when a person is actually denied the constitutional right to access a given  judicial proceeding.  We have never held that a person has a 
				<em>
					constitutional
				</em>
				 right to make his way into a courtroom without any external assistance.  Indeed, the fact that the State may need to assist an individual to attend a hearing has no bearing on whether the individual successfully exercises his due process right to be present at the proceeding.  Nor does an inaccessible courthouse violate the Equal Protection Clause, unless it is irrational for the State not to alter the courthouse to make it accessible.  But financial considerations almost always furnish a rational basis for a State to decline to make those alterations.  See 
				<em>
					Garrett, 
				</em>
				531 U. S.
				<em>
					, 
				</em>
				at 372 (noting that it would be constitutional for an employer to conserve scarce financial resources by hiring employees who can use existing facilities rather than making the facilities accessible to disabled employees).  Thus, evidence regarding inaccessible courthouses, because it is not evidence of constitutional violations, provides no basis to abrogate States sovereign immunity.

				The barren record here should likewise be fatal to the majoritys holding that Title II is valid legislation enforcing due process rights that involve access to the courts.

				Title II provides that no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/12132.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §12132</a>.  A disabled person is considered qualified if he meets the essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of the entitys services or participation in the entitys programs, 

The ADAs findings make clear that Congress believed it was attacking discrimination in all areas of public services, as well as the discriminatory effect of architectural, transportation, and communication barriers.  §§12101(a)(3), (a)(5).  In sum, Title II requires, on pain of money damages, special accommodations for disabled persons in virtually every interaction they have with the State.

Like Title I, Title II may be laudable public policy, but it cannot be seriously disputed that it is also an attempt to legislatively redefine the States legal obligations under the

Its provisions affect transportation, health, education, and recreation programs, among many others, all of which are accorded only rational-basis scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause.  A requirement of accommodation for the disabled at a state-owned amusement park or sports stadium, for example, bears no permissible prophylactic relationship to enabling disabled persons to exercise their fundamental constitutional rights.

).  I have grave doubts about importing an as applied approach into the §5 context.  While the majority is of course correct that this Court normally only considers the application of a statute to a particular case, the proper inquiry under 
				<em>
					City of Boerne 
				</em>
				and its progeny is somewhat different.  In applying the congruence-and-proportionality test, we ask whether Congress has attempted to statutorily redefine the constitutional rights protected by the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>.  This question can only be answered by measuring the breadth of a statutes coverage against the scope of the constitutional rights it purports to enforce and the record of violations it purports to remedy.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In conducting its as-applied analysis, however, the majority posits a hypothetical statute, never enacted by Congress, that applies only to courthouses.  The effect is to rig the congruence-and-proportionality test by artificially constricting the scope of the statute to closely mirror a recognized constitutional right.  But Title II is not susceptible of being carved up in this manner; it applies indiscriminately to all services, programs, or activities of any public entity.  Thus, the majoritys approach is not really an assessment of whether Title II is appropriate 
				<em>
					legislation
				</em>
				 at all, U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, §5 (emphasis added), but a test of whether the Court can conceive of a hypothetical statute narrowly tailored enough to constitute valid prophylactic legislation.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Our §5 precedents do not support this as-applied approach.  In each case, we measured the full breadth of the statute or relevant provision that Congress enacted against the scope of the constitutional right it purported to enforce.  If we had arbitrarily constricted the scope of the statutes to match the scope of a core constitutional right, those cases might have come out differently.  In 
				<em>
					Garrett
				</em>
				, for example, Title I might have been upheld as applied to irrational employment discrimination; or in 
				<em>
					Florida Prepaid
				</em>
				, the Patent Remedy Act might have been upheld as applied to intentional, uncompensated patent infringements.  It is thus not surprising that the only authority cited by the majority is 
				<em>

				I fear that the Courts adoption of an as-applied approach eliminates any incentive for Congress to craft §5 legislation for the purpose of remedying or deterring actual constitutional violations.  Congress can now simply rely on the courts to sort out which hypothetical applications of an undifferentiated statute, such as Title II, may be enforced against the States.  All the while, States will be subjected to substantial litigation in a piecemeal attempt to vindicate their 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxi" class="subref" title="subref">Eleventh Amendment</a> rights.  The majoritys as-applied approach simply cannot be squared with either our recent precedent or the proper role of the Judiciary.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Even in the limited courthouse-access context, Title II does not properly abrogate state sovereign immunity.  As demonstrated in depth above, Congress utterly failed to identify any evidence that disabled persons were denied constitutionally protected access to judicial proceedings.  Without this predicate showing, Title II, even if we were to hypothesize that it applies only to courthouses, cannot be viewed as a congruent and proportional response to state constitutional violations.

				Moreover, even in the courthouse-access context, Title II requires substantially more than the Due Process Clause.  Title II subjects States to private lawsuits if, 
				<em>
					inter alia,
				</em>
				 they fail to make reasonable modifications to fa-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				cilities, such as removing architectural … barriers. 42 U. S., C. §§12131(2), 12132.  Yet the statute is not limited to occasions when the failure to modify results, or will likely result, in an actual due process violation
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, the inability of a disabled person to participate in a judicial proceeding.  Indeed, liability is triggered if an inaccessible building results in a disabled person being subjected to discriminationa term that presumably encompasses any sort of inconvenience in accessing the facility, for whatever purpose.  §12132.

, and other cases in which we held that due process requires the State to waive filing fees for indigent litigants, is unavailing.  While these cases support the principle that the State must remove financial requirements that in fact prevent an individual from exercising his constitutional rights, they certainly do not support a statute that subjects a State to liability for failing to make a vast array of special accommodations, without regard for whether the failure to accommodate results in a constitutional wrong.

				In this respect, Title II is analogous to the Patent Remedy Act at issue in Florida Prepaid.
				  That statute subjected States to monetary liability for any act of patent infringement.  527 U. S., at 646647.  Thus, Congress did nothing to limit the Acts coverage to cases involving arguable [Due Process] violations, such as when the infringement was nonnegligent or uncompensated.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  Similarly here, Congress has authorized private damages suits against a State for merely maintaining a courthouse that is not readily accessible to the disabled, without regard to whether a disabled persons due process rights are ever violated.  Accordingly, even as applied to the access to the courts context, Title IIs indiscriminate scope offends [the congruence-and-proportionality] principle, particularly in light of the lack of record evidence showing that inaccessible courthouses cause actual Due Process violations.

						 The majority rather peculiarly points to Congress finding that  discrimination against individuals with disabilities persists in such critical areas as access to public services  as evidence that Congress sought to vindicate the Due Process rights of disabled persons.  Ante, at 18 (quoting 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/12101.html#a_3" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §12101(a)(3)</a> (emphasis added by the Court)).  However, one does not usually refer to the right to attend a judicial proceeding as access to [a] public servic[e].  Given the lack of any concern over courthouse accessibility issues in the legislative history, it is highly unlikely that this legislative finding obliquely refers to state violations of the due process rights of disabled persons to attend judicial proceedings.

						 The Court correctly explains that  it [i]s easier for Congress to show a pattern of state constitutional violations  when it targets state action that triggers a higher level of constitutional scrutiny.  Ante, at 18 (quoting Nevada Dept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/538/721" class="subref" title="subref">538 U. S. 721</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">736</a> (2003)
).  However, this Courts precedents attest that Congress may not dispense with the required showing altogether simply because it purports to enforce due process rights.  See Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd. v. College Savings Bank, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/527/627" class="subref" title="subref">527 U. S. 627</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">645</a>646 (1999)
 (invalidating Patent Remedy Act, which purported to enforce the Due Process Clause, because Congress failed to identify a record of constitutional violations); City of Boerne v. Flores, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/521/507" class="subref" title="subref">521 U. S. 507</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">530</a>531 (1997)
 (same with respect to Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA)).  As the foregoing discussion demonstrates, that is precisely what the Court has sanctioned here.  Because the record is utterly devoid of proof that Congress was responding to state violations of due process access-to-the-courts rights, this case is controlled by Florida Prepaid and City of Boerne, rather than Hibbs.

						 Title IIs all-encompassing approach to regulating public services contrasts starkly with the more closely tailored laws we have upheld as legitimate prophylactic §5 legislation.  In Hibbs, for example, the FMLA was narrowly targeted to remedy widespread gender discrimination in the availability of family leave.  538 U. S., at 738739 (distinguishing City of Boerne, Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/528/62" class="subref" title="subref">528 U. S. 62</a> (2000)
, and Garrett on this ground).  Similarly, in cases involving enforcement of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifteenth Amendment</a>, we upheld limited remedial scheme[s] that were narrowly tailored to address massive evidence of discrimination in voting.  Garrett, 531 U. S., at 373 (discussing South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/383/301" class="subref" title="subref">383 U. S. 301</a> (1966)
).  Unlike these statutes, Title IIs indiscriminate scope … is particularly incongruous in light of the scant support for the predicate unconstitutional conduct that Congress intended to remedy.  Florida Prepaid, 527 U. S., at 647.

						 Raines is inapposite in any event.  The Court there considered the constitutionality of the Civil Rights Act of 1957a statute designed to enforce the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifteenth Amendment</a>whose narrowly tailored substantive provisions could unquestionably be applied to state actors (like the respondents therein).  362 U. S., at 25, 26.  The only question presented was whether the statute was facially invalid because it might be read to constrain nonstate actors as well.  Id., at 20.  The Court upheld the statute as applied to respondents and declined to entertain the facial challenge.  Id., at 2426.  The situation in this case is much different: The very question presented is whether Title IIs indiscriminate substantive provisions can constitutionally be applied to the petitioner State.  Raines thus provides no support for avoiding this question by conjuring up an imaginary statute with substantive provisions that might pass the congruence-and-proportionality test.

						 The majoritys invocation of Hibbs to justify Title IIs overbreadth is unpersuasive.  See ante, at 22, n. 24.  The Hibbs Court concluded that in light of the evidence before Congress the FMLAs 12-week family-leave provision was necessary to achiev[e] Congress remedial object.  538 U. S, at 748.  The Court found that the legislative record included not only evidence of state constitutional violations, but evidence that a provision merely enforcing the Equal Protection Clause would actually perpetuate the gender stereotypes Congress sought to eradicate because employers could simply eliminate family leave entirely.  Ibid.  Without comparable evidence of constitutional violations and the necessity of prophylactic measures, the Court has no basis on which to uphold Title IIs special-accommodation requirements.

				The first step is to identify with some precision the scope of the constitutional right at issue.

				at 365.  This task was easy in 
				<em>
					Garrett, Hibbs, Kimel,

				<em>

				</em>
				 because the statutes in those cases sought to enforce only one constitutional right.  In

				, for example, the statute addressed the equal protection right of disabled persons to be free from unconstitutional employment discrimination.  
				<em>
					Garrett, supra,

				at 365.  See also

				, at 83 (right to be free from unconstitutional age discrimination in employment); 
				<em>
					City of Boerne, supra,
				</em>
				 at 529 (right of free exercise of religion).  The scope of that right, we explained, is quite limited; indeed, the Equal Protection Clause permits a State to classify on the basis of disability so long as it has a rational basis for doing so.

				In this case, the task of identifying the scope of the relevant constitutional protection is more difficult because Title II purports to enforce a panoply of constitutional rights of disabled persons: not only the equal protection right against irrational discrimination, but also certain rights protected by the Due Process Clause.

				Having traced the metes and bounds of the constitutional rights at issue, the next step in the congruence-and-proportionality inquiry requires us to examine whether Congress identified a history and pattern of violations of these constitutional rights by the States with respect to the disabled.  
				<em>
					Garrett, 
				</em>
				531 U. S., at 368.  This step is crucial to determining whether Title II is a legitimate attempt to remedy or prevent actual constitutional violations by the States or an illegitimate attempt to rewrite the constitutional provisions it purports to enforce.  Indeed, Congress §5 power is appropriately exercised 
				<em>
					only
				</em>
				 in response to state transgressions.

				Rather than limiting its discussion of constitutional violations to the due process rights on which it ultimately relies, the majority sets out on a wide-ranging account of societal discrimination against the disabled.  
				<em>

				, at 1215.  This digression recounts historical discrimination against the disabled through institutionalization laws, restrictions on marriage, voting, and public education, conditions in mental hospitals, and various other forms of unequal treatment in the administration of public programs and services.  Some of this evidence would be relevant if the Court were considering the constitutionality of the statute as a whole; but the Court rejects that approach in favor of a narrower as-applied inquiry.

				Lacking any real evidence that Congress was responding to actual due process violations, the majority relies primarily on three items to justify its decision: (1) a 1983 U. S. Civil Rights Commission Report showing that 76% of public services and programs housed in state-owned buildings were inaccessible to persons with disabilities, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1516; (2) testimony before a House subcommittee regarding the physical inaccessibility of local courthouses, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16; and (3) evidence submitted to Congress designated ADA task force that purportedly contains numerous examples of the exclusion of persons with disabilities from state judicial services and programs.  Ibid.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				On closer examination, however, the Civil Rights Commissions finding consists of a single conclusory sentence in its report, and it is far from clear that its finding even includes courthouses. The House subcommittee report, for its part, contains the testimony of two
				 witnesses, neither of whom reported being denied the right to be present at constitutionally protected court proceedings.

				  Indeed, the witnesses testimony, like the U. S. Civil Rights Commission Report, concerns only physical barriers to access, and does not address whether States either provided means to overcome those barriers or alternative locations for proceedings involving disabled persons.  Cf., n. 4,

				Based on the majoritys description, 
				<em>
					ante, 
				</em>
				at 16, the report of the ADA Task Force on the Rights and Empowerment of Americans with Disabilities sounds promising.  But the report itself says nothing about any disabled person being denied access to court.  The Court thus apparently relies solely on a general citation to the Governments Lodging in 
				<em>
					Garrett
				</em>
				, O. T. 2000, No. 991240 which, amidst thousands of pages, contains only a few anecdotal handwritten reports of physically inaccessible courthouses, again with no mention of whether States provided alternate means of access.  This evidence, moreover, was submitted not to Congress, but only to the task force, which itself made no findings regarding disabled persons access to judicial proceedings.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Garrett

				Even if the anecdotal evidence and conclusory statements relied on by the majority could be properly considered, the mere existence of an architecturally inaccessible courthouse
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, one a disabled person cannot utilize without assistancedoes not state a constitutional violation.  A violation of due process occurs only when a person is actually denied the constitutional right to access a given  judicial proceeding.  We have never held that a person has a 
				<em>
					constitutional
				</em>
				 right to make his way into a courtroom without any external assistance.  Indeed, the fact that the State may need to assist an individual to attend a hearing has no bearing on whether the individual successfully exercises his due process right to be present at the proceeding.  Nor does an inaccessible courthouse violate the Equal Protection Clause, unless it is irrational for the State not to alter the courthouse to make it accessible.  But financial considerations almost always furnish a rational basis for a State to decline to make those alterations.  See 
				<em>
					Garrett, 
				</em>
				531 U. S.
				<em>
					, 
				</em>
				at 372 (noting that it would be constitutional for an employer to conserve scarce financial resources by hiring employees who can use existing facilities rather than making the facilities accessible to disabled employees).  Thus, evidence regarding inaccessible courthouses, because it is not evidence of constitutional violations, provides no basis to abrogate States sovereign immunity.

				The near-total lack of actual constitutional violations in the congressional record is reminiscent of

				The barren record here should likewise be fatal to the majoritys holding that Title II is valid legislation enforcing due process rights that involve access to the courts.  This conclusion gains even more support when Title IIs nonexistent record of constitutional violations is compared with legislation that we have sustained as valid §5 enforcement legislation.  See,

				Title II provides that no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/12132.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §12132</a>.  A disabled person is considered qualified if he meets the essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of the entitys services or participation in the entitys programs, 
				<em>
					with or without reasonable modifications to rules, policies, or practices, the removal of architectural, communication, or transportation barriers, or the provision of auxiliary aids and services.
				</em>
				  §12131(2) (emphasis added).  The ADAs findings make clear that Congress believed it was attacking discrimination in all areas of public services, as well as the discriminatory effect of architectural, transportation, and communication barriers.  §§12101(a)(3), (a)(5).  In sum, Title II requires, on pain of money damages, special accommodations for disabled persons in virtually every interaction they have with the State.

Like Title I, Title II may be laudable public policy, but it cannot be seriously disputed that it is also an attempt to legislatively redefine the States legal obligations under the

Its provisions affect transportation, health, education, and recreation programs, among many others, all of which are accorded only rational-basis scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause.  A requirement of accommodation for the disabled at a state-owned amusement park or sports stadium, for example, bears no permissible prophylactic relationship to enabling disabled persons to exercise their fundamental constitutional rights.

).  I have grave doubts about importing an as applied approach into the §5 context.  While the majority is of course correct that this Court normally only considers the application of a statute to a particular case, the proper inquiry under 
				<em>
					City of Boerne 
				</em>
				and its progeny is somewhat different.  In applying the congruence-and-proportionality test, we ask whether Congress has attempted to statutorily redefine the constitutional rights protected by the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>.  This question can only be answered by measuring the breadth of a statutes coverage against the scope of the constitutional rights it purports to enforce and the record of violations it purports to remedy.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In conducting its as-applied analysis, however, the majority posits a hypothetical statute, never enacted by Congress, that applies only to courthouses.  The effect is to rig the congruence-and-proportionality test by artificially constricting the scope of the statute to closely mirror a recognized constitutional right.  But Title II is not susceptible of being carved up in this manner; it applies indiscriminately to all services, programs, or activities of any public entity.  Thus, the majoritys approach is not really an assessment of whether Title II is appropriate 
				<em>
					legislation
				</em>
				 at all, U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, §5 (emphasis added), but a test of whether the Court can conceive of a hypothetical statute narrowly tailored enough to constitute valid prophylactic legislation.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Our §5 precedents do not support this as-applied approach.  In each case, we measured the full breadth of the statute or relevant provision that Congress enacted against the scope of the constitutional right it purported to enforce.  If we had arbitrarily constricted the scope of the statutes to match the scope of a core constitutional right, those cases might have come out differently.  In 
				<em>
					Garrett
				</em>
				, for example, Title I might have been upheld as applied to irrational employment discrimination; or in 
				<em>
					Florida Prepaid
				</em>
				, the Patent Remedy Act might have been upheld as applied to intentional, uncompensated patent infringements.  It is thus not surprising that the only authority cited by the majority is 
				<em>

				I fear that the Courts adoption of an as-applied approach eliminates any incentive for Congress to craft §5 legislation for the purpose of remedying or deterring actual constitutional violations.  Congress can now simply rely on the courts to sort out which hypothetical applications of an undifferentiated statute, such as Title II, may be enforced against the States.  All the while, States will be subjected to substantial litigation in a piecemeal attempt to vindicate their 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxi" class="subref" title="subref">Eleventh Amendment</a> rights.  The majoritys as-applied approach simply cannot be squared with either our recent precedent or the proper role of the Judiciary.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Even in the limited courthouse-access context, Title II does not properly abrogate state sovereign immunity.  As demonstrated in depth above, Congress utterly failed to identify any evidence that disabled persons were denied constitutionally protected access to judicial proceedings.  Without this predicate showing, Title II, even if we were to hypothesize that it applies only to courthouses, cannot be viewed as a congruent and proportional response to state constitutional violations.

				Moreover, even in the courthouse-access context, Title II requires substantially more than the Due Process Clause.  Title II subjects States to private lawsuits if, 
				<em>
					inter alia,

				 they fail to make reasonable modifications to fa-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				cilities, such as removing architectural … barriers. 42 U. S., C. §§12131(2), 12132.  Yet the statute is not limited to occasions when the failure to modify results, or will likely result, in an actual due process violation
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, the inability of a disabled person to participate in a judicial proceeding.  Indeed, liability is triggered if an inaccessible building results in a disabled person being subjected to discriminationa term that presumably encompasses any sort of inconvenience in accessing the facility, for whatever purpose.  §12132.

, and other cases in which we held that due process requires the State to waive filing fees for indigent litigants, is unavailing.  While these cases support the principle that the State must remove financial requirements that in fact prevent an individual from exercising his constitutional rights, they certainly do not support a statute that subjects a State to liability for failing to make a vast array of special accommodations, without regard for whether the failure to accommodate results in a constitutional wrong.

				In this respect, Title II is analogous to the Patent Remedy Act at issue in Florida Prepaid.
				  That statute subjected States to monetary liability for any act of patent infringement.  527 U. S., at 646647.  Thus, Congress did nothing to limit the Acts coverage to cases involving arguable [Due Process] violations, such as when the infringement was nonnegligent or uncompensated.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  Similarly here, Congress has authorized private damages suits against a State for merely maintaining a courthouse that is not readily accessible to the disabled, without regard to whether a disabled persons due process rights are ever violated.  Accordingly, even as applied to the access to the courts context, Title IIs indiscriminate scope offends [the congruence-and-proportionality] principle, particularly in light of the lack of record evidence showing that inaccessible courthouses cause actual Due Process violations.

						 The majority rather peculiarly points to Congress finding that  discrimination against individuals with disabilities persists in such critical areas as access to public services  as evidence that Congress sought to vindicate the Due Process rights of disabled persons.  Ante, at 18 (quoting 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/12101.html#a_3" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §12101(a)(3)</a> (emphasis added by the Court)).  However, one does not usually refer to the right to attend a judicial proceeding as access to [a] public servic[e].  Given the lack of any concern over courthouse accessibility issues in the legislative history, it is highly unlikely that this legislative finding obliquely refers to state violations of the due process rights of disabled persons to attend judicial proceedings.

						 The Court correctly explains that  it [i]s easier for Congress to show a pattern of state constitutional violations  when it targets state action that triggers a higher level of constitutional scrutiny.  Ante, at 18 (quoting Nevada Dept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">736</a> (2003)
).  However, this Courts precedents attest that Congress may not dispense with the required showing altogether simply because it purports to enforce due process rights.  See Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd. v. College Savings Bank, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/527/627" class="subref" title="subref">527 U. S. 627</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">645</a>646 (1999)
 (invalidating Patent Remedy Act, which purported to enforce the Due Process Clause, because Congress failed to identify a record of constitutional violations); City of Boerne v. Flores,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">530</a>531 (1997)
 (same with respect to Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA)).  As the foregoing discussion demonstrates, that is precisely what the Court has sanctioned here.  Because the record is utterly devoid of proof that Congress was responding to state violations of due process access-to-the-courts rights, this case is controlled by Florida Prepaid and City of Boerne, rather than Hibbs.

						 Title IIs all-encompassing approach to regulating public services contrasts starkly with the more closely tailored laws we have upheld as legitimate prophylactic §5 legislation.  In Hibbs, for example, the FMLA was narrowly targeted to remedy widespread gender discrimination in the availability of family leave.  538 U. S., at 738739 (distinguishing City of Boerne, Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/528/62" class="subref" title="subref">528 U. S. 62</a> (2000)
, and Garrett on this ground).  Similarly, in cases involving enforcement of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifteenth Amendment</a>, we upheld limited remedial scheme[s] that were narrowly tailored to address massive evidence of discrimination in voting.  Garrett, 531 U. S., at 373 (discussing South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/383/301" class="subref" title="subref">383 U. S. 301</a> (1966)
).  Unlike these statutes, Title IIs indiscriminate scope … is particularly incongruous in light of the scant support for the predicate unconstitutional conduct that Congress intended to remedy.  Florida Prepaid, 527 U. S., at 647.

						 Raines is inapposite in any event.  The Court there considered the constitutionality of the Civil Rights Act of 1957a statute designed to enforce the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifteenth Amendment</a>whose narrowly tailored substantive provisions could unquestionably be applied to state actors (like the respondents therein).  362 U. S., at 25, 26.  The only question presented was whether the statute was facially invalid because it might be read to constrain nonstate actors as well.  Id., at 20.  The Court upheld the statute as applied to respondents and declined to entertain the facial challenge.  Id., at 2426.  The situation in this case is much different: The very question presented is whether Title IIs indiscriminate substantive provisions can constitutionally be applied to the petitioner State.  Raines thus provides no support for avoiding this question by conjuring up an imaginary statute with substantive provisions that might pass the congruence-and-proportionality test.

						 The majoritys invocation of Hibbs to justify Title IIs overbreadth is unpersuasive.  See ante, at 22, n. 24.  The Hibbs Court concluded that in light of the evidence before Congress the FMLAs 12-week family-leave provision was necessary to achiev[e] Congress remedial object.  538 U. S, at 748.  The Court found that the legislative record included not only evidence of state constitutional violations, but evidence that a provision merely enforcing the Equal Protection Clause would actually perpetuate the gender stereotypes Congress sought to eradicate because employers could simply eliminate family leave entirely.  Ibid.  Without comparable evidence of constitutional violations and the necessity of prophylactic measures, the Court has no basis on which to uphold Title IIs special-accommodation requirements.

				The first step is to identify with some precision the scope of the constitutional right at issue.

				at 365.  This task was easy in 
				<em>
					Garrett, Hibbs, Kimel,

				<em>

				</em>
				 because the statutes in those cases sought to enforce only one constitutional right.  In

				, for example, the statute addressed the equal protection right of disabled persons to be free from unconstitutional employment discrimination.  
				<em>
					Garrett, supra,

				at 365.  See also 
				<em>

				, at 83 (right to be free from unconstitutional age discrimination in employment); 
				<em>
					City of Boerne, supra,
				</em>
				 at 529 (right of free exercise of religion).  The scope of that right, we explained, is quite limited; indeed, the Equal Protection Clause permits a State to classify on the basis of disability so long as it has a rational basis for doing so.

				In this case, the task of identifying the scope of the relevant constitutional protection is more difficult because Title II purports to enforce a panoply of constitutional rights of disabled persons: not only the equal protection right against irrational discrimination, but also certain rights protected by the Due Process Clause.

				Having traced the metes and bounds of the constitutional rights at issue, the next step in the congruence-and-proportionality inquiry requires us to examine whether Congress identified a history and pattern of violations of these constitutional rights by the States with respect to the disabled.  
				<em>
					Garrett, 
				</em>
				531 U. S., at 368.  This step is crucial to determining whether Title II is a legitimate attempt to remedy or prevent actual constitutional violations by the States or an illegitimate attempt to rewrite the constitutional provisions it purports to enforce.  Indeed, Congress §5 power is appropriately exercised 
				<em>
					only
				</em>
				 in response to state transgressions.

				Rather than limiting its discussion of constitutional violations to the due process rights on which it ultimately relies, the majority sets out on a wide-ranging account of societal discrimination against the disabled.

This digression recounts historical discrimination against the disabled through institutionalization laws, restrictions on marriage, voting, and public education, conditions in mental hospitals, and various other forms of unequal treatment in the administration of public programs and services.

				Lacking any real evidence that Congress was responding to actual due process violations, the majority relies primarily on three items to justify its decision: (1) a 1983 U. S. Civil Rights Commission Report showing that 76% of public services and programs housed in state-owned buildings were inaccessible to persons with disabilities, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1516; (2) testimony before a House subcommittee regarding the physical inaccessibility of local courthouses, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16; and (3) evidence submitted to Congress designated ADA task force that purportedly contains numerous examples of the exclusion of persons with disabilities from state judicial services and programs.  Ibid.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				On closer examination, however, the Civil Rights Commissions finding consists of a single conclusory sentence in its report, and it is far from clear that its finding even includes courthouses. The House subcommittee report, for its part, contains the testimony of two
				 witnesses, neither of whom reported being denied the right to be present at constitutionally protected court proceedings.

				  Indeed, the witnesses testimony, like the U. S. Civil Rights Commission Report, concerns only physical barriers to access, and does not address whether States either provided means to overcome those barriers or alternative locations for proceedings involving disabled persons.  Cf., n. 4,

				Based on the majoritys description, 
				<em>

				at 16, the report of the ADA Task Force on the Rights and Empowerment of Americans with Disabilities sounds promising.  But the report itself says nothing about any disabled person being denied access to court.  The Court thus apparently relies solely on a general citation to the Governments Lodging in 
				<em>
					Garrett
				</em>
				, O. T. 2000, No. 991240 which, amidst thousands of pages, contains only a few anecdotal handwritten reports of physically inaccessible courthouses, again with no mention of whether States provided alternate means of access.  This evidence, moreover, was submitted not to Congress, but only to the task force, which itself made no findings regarding disabled persons access to judicial proceedings.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Garrett

				Even if the anecdotal evidence and conclusory statements relied on by the majority could be properly considered, the mere existence of an architecturally inaccessible courthouse
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, one a disabled person cannot utilize without assistancedoes not state a constitutional violation.  A violation of due process occurs only when a person is actually denied the constitutional right to access a given  judicial proceeding.  We have never held that a person has a 
				<em>
					constitutional
				</em>
				 right to make his way into a courtroom without any external assistance.  Indeed, the fact that the State may need to assist an individual to attend a hearing has no bearing on whether the individual successfully exercises his due process right to be present at the proceeding.  Nor does an inaccessible courthouse violate the Equal Protection Clause, unless it is irrational for the State not to alter the courthouse to make it accessible.  But financial considerations almost always furnish a rational basis for a State to decline to make those alterations.  See 
				<em>
					Garrett, 
				</em>
				531 U. S.
				<em>
					, 
				</em>
				at 372 (noting that it would be constitutional for an employer to conserve scarce financial resources by hiring employees who can use existing facilities rather than making the facilities accessible to disabled employees).  Thus, evidence regarding inaccessible courthouses, because it is not evidence of constitutional violations, provides no basis to abrogate States sovereign immunity.

				The near-total lack of actual constitutional violations in the congressional record is reminiscent of

				The barren record here should likewise be fatal to the majoritys holding that Title II is valid legislation enforcing due process rights that involve access to the courts.  This conclusion gains even more support when Title IIs nonexistent record of constitutional violations is compared with legislation that we have sustained as valid §5 enforcement legislation.  See,

				Title II provides that no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/12132.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §12132</a>.  A disabled person is considered qualified if he meets the essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of the entitys services or participation in the entitys programs, 

				  §12131(2) (emphasis added).  The ADAs findings make clear that Congress believed it was attacking discrimination in all areas of public services, as well as the discriminatory effect of architectural, transportation, and communication barriers.  §§12101(a)(3), (a)(5).  In sum, Title II requires, on pain of money damages, special accommodations for disabled persons in virtually every interaction they have with the State.

Its provisions affect transportation, health, education, and recreation programs, among many others, all of which are accorded only rational-basis scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause.  A requirement of accommodation for the disabled at a state-owned amusement park or sports stadium, for example, bears no permissible prophylactic relationship to enabling disabled persons to exercise their fundamental constitutional rights.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">26</a> (1960)
).  I have grave doubts about importing an as applied approach into the §5 context.  While the majority is of course correct that this Court normally only considers the application of a statute to a particular case, the proper inquiry under 
				<em>
					City of Boerne 
				</em>
				and its progeny is somewhat different.  In applying the congruence-and-proportionality test, we ask whether Congress has attempted to statutorily redefine the constitutional rights protected by the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>.  This question can only be answered by measuring the breadth of a statutes coverage against the scope of the constitutional rights it purports to enforce and the record of violations it purports to remedy.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In conducting its as-applied analysis, however, the majority posits a hypothetical statute, never enacted by Congress, that applies only to courthouses.  The effect is to rig the congruence-and-proportionality test by artificially constricting the scope of the statute to closely mirror a recognized constitutional right.  But Title II is not susceptible of being carved up in this manner; it applies indiscriminately to all services, programs, or activities of any public entity.  Thus, the majoritys approach is not really an assessment of whether Title II is appropriate 
				<em>
					legislation
				</em>
				 at all, U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, §5 (emphasis added), but a test of whether the Court can conceive of a hypothetical statute narrowly tailored enough to constitute valid prophylactic legislation.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Our §5 precedents do not support this as-applied approach.  In each case, we measured the full breadth of the statute or relevant provision that Congress enacted against the scope of the constitutional right it purported to enforce.  If we had arbitrarily constricted the scope of the statutes to match the scope of a core constitutional right, those cases might have come out differently.  In 
				<em>
					Garrett
				</em>
				, for example, Title I might have been upheld as applied to irrational employment discrimination; or in 
				<em>
					Florida Prepaid
				</em>
				, the Patent Remedy Act might have been upheld as applied to intentional, uncompensated patent infringements.  It is thus not surprising that the only authority cited by the majority is 
				<em>

				I fear that the Courts adoption of an as-applied approach eliminates any incentive for Congress to craft §5 legislation for the purpose of remedying or deterring actual constitutional violations.  Congress can now simply rely on the courts to sort out which hypothetical applications of an undifferentiated statute, such as Title II, may be enforced against the States.  All the while, States will be subjected to substantial litigation in a piecemeal attempt to vindicate their 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxi" class="subref" title="subref">Eleventh Amendment</a> rights.  The majoritys as-applied approach simply cannot be squared with either our recent precedent or the proper role of the Judiciary.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Even in the limited courthouse-access context, Title II does not properly abrogate state sovereign immunity.  As demonstrated in depth above, Congress utterly failed to identify any evidence that disabled persons were denied constitutionally protected access to judicial proceedings.  Without this predicate showing, Title II, even if we were to hypothesize that it applies only to courthouses, cannot be viewed as a congruent and proportional response to state constitutional violations.

				Moreover, even in the courthouse-access context, Title II requires substantially more than the Due Process Clause.  Title II subjects States to private lawsuits if,

				 they fail to make reasonable modifications to fa-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				cilities, such as removing architectural … barriers. 42 U. S., C. §§12131(2), 12132.  Yet the statute is not limited to occasions when the failure to modify results, or will likely result, in an actual due process violation
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, the inability of a disabled person to participate in a judicial proceeding.  Indeed, liability is triggered if an inaccessible building results in a disabled person being subjected to discriminationa term that presumably encompasses any sort of inconvenience in accessing the facility, for whatever purpose.  §12132.

, and other cases in which we held that due process requires the State to waive filing fees for indigent litigants, is unavailing.  While these cases support the principle that the State must remove financial requirements that in fact prevent an individual from exercising his constitutional rights, they certainly do not support a statute that subjects a State to liability for failing to make a vast array of special accommodations, without regard for whether the failure to accommodate results in a constitutional wrong.

				In this respect, Title II is analogous to the Patent Remedy Act at issue in Florida Prepaid.
				  That statute subjected States to monetary liability for any act of patent infringement.  527 U. S., at 646647.  Thus, Congress did nothing to limit the Acts coverage to cases involving arguable [Due Process] violations, such as when the infringement was nonnegligent or uncompensated.  
				<em>
					Ibid.

				  Similarly here, Congress has authorized private damages suits against a State for merely maintaining a courthouse that is not readily accessible to the disabled, without regard to whether a disabled persons due process rights are ever violated.  Accordingly, even as applied to the access to the courts context, Title IIs indiscriminate scope offends [the congruence-and-proportionality] principle, particularly in light of the lack of record evidence showing that inaccessible courthouses cause actual Due Process violations.

The court conducted a preliminary hearing in the first-floor library to accommodate Lanes disability, App. to Pet. for Cert. 16, and later offered to move all further proceedings in the case to a handicapped-accessible courthouse in a nearby town.  In light of these facts, it can hardly be said that the State violated Lanes right to be present at his trial; indeed, it made affirmative attempts to secure that right.  Respondent Jones, a disabled court reporter, does not seriously contend that she suffered a constitutional injury.

						 The majority rather peculiarly points to Congress finding that  discrimination against individuals with disabilities persists in such critical areas as access to public services  as evidence that Congress sought to vindicate the Due Process rights of disabled persons.  Ante, at 18 (quoting

However, one does not usually refer to the right to attend a judicial proceeding as access to [a] public servic[e].  Given the lack of any concern over courthouse accessibility issues in the legislative history, it is highly unlikely that this legislative finding obliquely refers to state violations of the due process rights of disabled persons to attend judicial proceedings.

						 The Court correctly explains that  it [i]s easier for Congress to show a pattern of state constitutional violations  when it targets state action that triggers a higher level of constitutional scrutiny.  Ante, at 18 (quoting Nevada Dept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">736</a> (2003)
).  However, this Courts precedents attest that Congress may not dispense with the required showing altogether simply because it purports to enforce due process rights.  See Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd. v. College Savings Bank, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/527/627" class="subref" title="subref">527 U. S. 627</a>,

 (same with respect to Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA)).  As the foregoing discussion demonstrates, that is precisely what the Court has sanctioned here.  Because the record is utterly devoid of proof that Congress was responding to state violations of due process access-to-the-courts rights, this case is controlled by Florida Prepaid and City of Boerne, rather than Hibbs.

						 Title IIs all-encompassing approach to regulating public services contrasts starkly with the more closely tailored laws we have upheld as legitimate prophylactic §5 legislation.  In Hibbs, for example, the FMLA was narrowly targeted to remedy widespread gender discrimination in the availability of family leave.  538 U. S., at 738739 (distinguishing City of Boerne, Kimel v.

, and Garrett on this ground).  Similarly, in cases involving enforcement of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifteenth Amendment</a>, we upheld limited remedial scheme[s] that were narrowly tailored to address massive evidence of discrimination in voting.  Garrett, 531 U. S., at 373 (discussing South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/383/301" class="subref" title="subref">383 U. S. 301</a> (1966)

						 Raines is inapposite in any event.  The Court there considered the constitutionality of the Civil Rights Act of 1957a statute designed to enforce the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifteenth Amendment</a>whose narrowly tailored substantive provisions could unquestionably be applied to state actors (like the respondents therein).  362 U. S., at 25, 26.  The only question presented was whether the statute was facially invalid because it might be read to constrain nonstate actors as well.  Id., at 20.  The Court upheld the statute as applied to respondents and declined to entertain the facial challenge.  Id., at 2426.  The situation in this case is much different: The very question presented is whether Title IIs indiscriminate substantive provisions can constitutionally be applied to the petitioner State.  Raines thus provides no support for avoiding this question by conjuring up an imaginary statute with substantive provisions that might pass the congruence-and-proportionality test.

						 The majoritys invocation of Hibbs to justify Title IIs overbreadth is unpersuasive.  See ante, at 22, n. 24.  The Hibbs Court concluded that in light of the evidence before Congress the FMLAs 12-week family-leave provision was necessary to achiev[e] Congress remedial object.  538 U. S, at 748.  The Court found that the legislative record included not only evidence of state constitutional violations, but evidence that a provision merely enforcing the Equal Protection Clause would actually perpetuate the gender stereotypes Congress sought to eradicate because employers could simply eliminate family leave entirely.  Ibid.  Without comparable evidence of constitutional violations and the necessity of prophylactic measures, the Court has no basis on which to uphold Title IIs special-accommodation requirements.

				at 365.  This task was easy in 
				<em>
					Garrett, Hibbs, Kimel,

				 because the statutes in those cases sought to enforce only one constitutional right.  In

					Garrett, supra,

				<em>
					City of Boerne, supra,
				</em>
				 at 529 (right of free exercise of religion).  The scope of that right, we explained, is quite limited; indeed, the Equal Protection Clause permits a State to classify on the basis of disability so long as it has a rational basis for doing so.

				In this case, the task of identifying the scope of the relevant constitutional protection is more difficult because Title II purports to enforce a panoply of constitutional rights of disabled persons: not only the equal protection right against irrational discrimination, but also certain rights protected by the Due Process Clause.

				Having traced the metes and bounds of the constitutional rights at issue, the next step in the congruence-and-proportionality inquiry requires us to examine whether Congress identified a history and pattern of violations of these constitutional rights by the States with respect to the disabled.  
				<em>
					Garrett, 
				</em>
				531 U. S., at 368.  This step is crucial to determining whether Title II is a legitimate attempt to remedy or prevent actual constitutional violations by the States or an illegitimate attempt to rewrite the constitutional provisions it purports to enforce.  Indeed, Congress §5 power is appropriately exercised 
				<em>
					only
				</em>
				 in response to state transgressions.  
				<em>
					Ibid.

				Rather than limiting its discussion of constitutional violations to the due process rights on which it ultimately relies, the majority sets out on a wide-ranging account of societal discrimination against the disabled.  
				<em>
					Ante

				, at 1215.  This digression recounts historical discrimination against the disabled through institutionalization laws, restrictions on marriage, voting, and public education, conditions in mental hospitals, and various other forms of unequal treatment in the administration of public programs and services.  Some of this evidence would be relevant if the Court were considering the constitutionality of the statute as a whole; but the Court rejects that approach in favor of a narrower as-applied inquiry.

				Lacking any real evidence that Congress was responding to actual due process violations, the majority relies primarily on three items to justify its decision: (1) a 1983 U. S. Civil Rights Commission Report showing that 76% of public services and programs housed in state-owned buildings were inaccessible to persons with disabilities, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1516; (2) testimony before a House subcommittee regarding the physical inaccessibility of local courthouses, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16; and (3) evidence submitted to Congress designated ADA task force that purportedly contains numerous examples of the exclusion of persons with disabilities from state judicial services and programs.  Ibid.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				On closer examination, however, the Civil Rights Commissions finding consists of a single conclusory sentence in its report, and it is far from clear that its finding even includes courthouses. The House subcommittee report, for its part, contains the testimony of two
				 witnesses, neither of whom reported being denied the right to be present at constitutionally protected court proceedings.

				  Indeed, the witnesses testimony, like the U. S. Civil Rights Commission Report, concerns only physical barriers to access, and does not address whether States either provided means to overcome those barriers or alternative locations for proceedings involving disabled persons.  Cf., n. 4,

				Based on the majoritys description, 
				<em>

				at 16, the report of the ADA Task Force on the Rights and Empowerment of Americans with Disabilities sounds promising.  But the report itself says nothing about any disabled person being denied access to court.  The Court thus apparently relies solely on a general citation to the Governments Lodging in 
				<em>
					Garrett
				</em>
				, O. T. 2000, No. 991240 which, amidst thousands of pages, contains only a few anecdotal handwritten reports of physically inaccessible courthouses, again with no mention of whether States provided alternate means of access.  This evidence, moreover, was submitted not to Congress, but only to the task force, which itself made no findings regarding disabled persons access to judicial proceedings.  Cf. 
				<em>

				Even if the anecdotal evidence and conclusory statements relied on by the majority could be properly considered, the mere existence of an architecturally inaccessible courthouse
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, one a disabled person cannot utilize without assistancedoes not state a constitutional violation.  A violation of due process occurs only when a person is actually denied the constitutional right to access a given  judicial proceeding.  We have never held that a person has a 
				<em>
					constitutional
				</em>
				 right to make his way into a courtroom without any external assistance.  Indeed, the fact that the State may need to assist an individual to attend a hearing has no bearing on whether the individual successfully exercises his due process right to be present at the proceeding.  Nor does an inaccessible courthouse violate the Equal Protection Clause, unless it is irrational for the State not to alter the courthouse to make it accessible.  But financial considerations almost always furnish a rational basis for a State to decline to make those alterations.  See 
				<em>
					Garrett, 
				</em>
				531 U. S.
				<em>
					, 
				</em>
				at 372 (noting that it would be constitutional for an employer to conserve scarce financial resources by hiring employees who can use existing facilities rather than making the facilities accessible to disabled employees).  Thus, evidence regarding inaccessible courthouses, because it is not evidence of constitutional violations, provides no basis to abrogate States sovereign immunity.

				The near-total lack of actual constitutional violations in the congressional record is reminiscent of

				The barren record here should likewise be fatal to the majoritys holding that Title II is valid legislation enforcing due process rights that involve access to the courts.  This conclusion gains even more support when Title IIs nonexistent record of constitutional violations is compared with legislation that we have sustained as valid §5 enforcement legislation.  See,

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/12132.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §12132</a>.  A disabled person is considered qualified if he meets the essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of the entitys services or participation in the entitys programs, 

The ADAs findings make clear that Congress believed it was attacking discrimination in all areas of public services, as well as the discriminatory effect of architectural, transportation, and communication barriers.  §§12101(a)(3), (a)(5).

Its provisions affect transportation, health, education, and recreation programs, among many others, all of which are accorded only rational-basis scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause.  A requirement of accommodation for the disabled at a state-owned amusement park or sports stadium, for example, bears no permissible prophylactic relationship to enabling disabled persons to exercise their fundamental constitutional rights.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">26</a> (1960)
).  I have grave doubts about importing an as applied approach into the §5 context.  While the majority is of course correct that this Court normally only considers the application of a statute to a particular case, the proper inquiry under 
				<em>
					City of Boerne 
				</em>
				and its progeny is somewhat different.  In applying the congruence-and-proportionality test, we ask whether Congress has attempted to statutorily redefine the constitutional rights protected by the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>.  This question can only be answered by measuring the breadth of a statutes coverage against the scope of the constitutional rights it purports to enforce and the record of violations it purports to remedy.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In conducting its as-applied analysis, however, the majority posits a hypothetical statute, never enacted by Congress, that applies only to courthouses.  The effect is to rig the congruence-and-proportionality test by artificially constricting the scope of the statute to closely mirror a recognized constitutional right.  But Title II is not susceptible of being carved up in this manner; it applies indiscriminately to all services, programs, or activities of any public entity.  Thus, the majoritys approach is not really an assessment of whether Title II is appropriate 
				<em>
					legislation
				</em>
				 at all, U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, §5 (emphasis added), but a test of whether the Court can conceive of a hypothetical statute narrowly tailored enough to constitute valid prophylactic legislation.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Our §5 precedents do not support this as-applied approach.  In each case, we measured the full breadth of the statute or relevant provision that Congress enacted against the scope of the constitutional right it purported to enforce.  If we had arbitrarily constricted the scope of the statutes to match the scope of a core constitutional right, those cases might have come out differently.  In 
				<em>
					Garrett
				</em>
				, for example, Title I might have been upheld as applied to irrational employment discrimination; or in 
				<em>
					Florida Prepaid
				</em>
				, the Patent Remedy Act might have been upheld as applied to intentional, uncompensated patent infringements.  It is thus not surprising that the only authority cited by the majority is 
				<em>

				I fear that the Courts adoption of an as-applied approach eliminates any incentive for Congress to craft §5 legislation for the purpose of remedying or deterring actual constitutional violations.  Congress can now simply rely on the courts to sort out which hypothetical applications of an undifferentiated statute, such as Title II, may be enforced against the States.  All the while, States will be subjected to substantial litigation in a piecemeal attempt to vindicate their 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxi" class="subref" title="subref">Eleventh Amendment</a> rights.  The majoritys as-applied approach simply cannot be squared with either our recent precedent or the proper role of the Judiciary.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Even in the limited courthouse-access context, Title II does not properly abrogate state sovereign immunity.  As demonstrated in depth above, Congress utterly failed to identify any evidence that disabled persons were denied constitutionally protected access to judicial proceedings.  Without this predicate showing, Title II, even if we were to hypothesize that it applies only to courthouses, cannot be viewed as a congruent and proportional response to state constitutional violations.

				Moreover, even in the courthouse-access context, Title II requires substantially more than the Due Process Clause.  Title II subjects States to private lawsuits if,

				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				cilities, such as removing architectural … barriers. 42 U. S., C. §§12131(2), 12132.  Yet the statute is not limited to occasions when the failure to modify results, or will likely result, in an actual due process violation
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, the inability of a disabled person to participate in a judicial proceeding.  Indeed, liability is triggered if an inaccessible building results in a disabled person being subjected to discriminationa term that presumably encompasses any sort of inconvenience in accessing the facility, for whatever purpose.  §12132.

, and other cases in which we held that due process requires the State to waive filing fees for indigent litigants, is unavailing.  While these cases support the principle that the State must remove financial requirements that in fact prevent an individual from exercising his constitutional rights, they certainly do not support a statute that subjects a State to liability for failing to make a vast array of special accommodations, without regard for whether the failure to accommodate results in a constitutional wrong.

				In this respect, Title II is analogous to the Patent Remedy Act at issue in Florida Prepaid.
				  That statute subjected States to monetary liability for any act of patent infringement.  527 U. S., at 646647.  Thus, Congress did nothing to limit the Acts coverage to cases involving arguable [Due Process] violations, such as when the infringement was nonnegligent or uncompensated.  
				<em>

				  Similarly here, Congress has authorized private damages suits against a State for merely maintaining a courthouse that is not readily accessible to the disabled, without regard to whether a disabled persons due process rights are ever violated.  Accordingly, even as applied to the access to the courts context, Title IIs indiscriminate scope offends [the congruence-and-proportionality] principle, particularly in light of the lack of record evidence showing that inaccessible courthouses cause actual Due Process violations.

						 The majority obscures this fact by repeatedly referring to congressional findings of discrimination and unequal treatment.  Of course, generic findings of discrimination and unequal treatment vel non are insufficient to show a pattern of constitutional violations where rational-basis scrutiny applies.

						 Certainly, respondents Lane and Jones were not denied these constitutional rights.  The majority admits that Lane was able to attend the initial hearing of his criminal trial.  Ante, at 1.  Lane was arrested for failing to appear at his second hearing only after he refused assistance from officers dispatched by the court to help him to the courtroom.  Ante, at 2.  The court conducted a preliminary hearing in the first-floor library to accommodate Lanes disability, App. to Pet. for Cert. 16, and later offered to move all further proceedings in the case to a handicapped-accessible courthouse in a nearby town.  In light of these facts, it can hardly be said that the State violated Lanes right to be present at his trial; indeed, it made affirmative attempts to secure that right.  Respondent Jones, a disabled court reporter, does not seriously contend that she suffered a constitutional injury.

						 The balance of the Courts citations refer to cases arising after enactment of the ADA or do not contain findings of federal constitutional violations.  Ante, at 1415, n. 14 (citing Layton v. Elder, 143 F. 3d 469 (CA8 1998) (post-ADA case finding ADA violations only); Matthews v. Jefferson, 29 F. Supp. 2d 525 (WD Ark. 1998) (same); Galloway v. Superior Court, 816 F. Supp. 12 (DC 1993) (same); State v. Schaim, 65 Ohio St. 3d 51, 600 N. E. 2d 661 (1992) (remanded for hearing on constitutional issue); People v. Green, 561 N. Y. S. 2d 130 (County Ct. 1990) (finding violation of state constitution only); DeLong v. Brumbaugh, 703 F. Supp. 399 (WD Pa. 1989) (statute upheld against facial constitutional challenge; Rehabilitation Act of 1973 violations only); Pomerantz v. Los Angeles County, 674 F. 2d 1288 (CA9 1982) (Rehabilitation Act of 1973 claim; challenged jury-service statute later amended)).  Accordingly, they offer no support whatsoever for the notion that Title II is a valid response to documented constitutional violations.

						 The majority rather peculiarly points to Congress finding that  discrimination against individuals with disabilities persists in such critical areas as access to public services  as evidence that Congress sought to vindicate the Due Process rights of disabled persons.  Ante, at 18 (quoting 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/12101.html#a_3" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §12101(a)(3)</a> (emphasis added by the Court)).  However, one does not usually refer to the right to attend a judicial proceeding as access to [a] public servic[e].  Given the lack of any concern over courthouse accessibility issues in the legislative history, it is highly unlikely that this legislative finding obliquely refers to state violations of the due process rights of disabled persons to attend judicial proceedings.

						 The Court correctly explains that  it [i]s easier for Congress to show a pattern of state constitutional violations  when it targets state action that triggers a higher level of constitutional scrutiny.  Ante, at 18 (quoting Nevada Dept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/538/721" class="subref" title="subref">538 U. S. 721</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">736</a> (2003)
).  However, this Courts precedents attest that Congress may not dispense with the required showing altogether simply because it purports to enforce due process rights.  See Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd. v. College Savings Bank, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/527/627" class="subref" title="subref">527 U. S. 627</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">645</a>646 (1999)
 (invalidating Patent Remedy Act, which purported to enforce the Due Process Clause, because Congress failed to identify a record of constitutional violations); City of Boerne v. Flores,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">530</a>531 (1997)
 (same with respect to Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA)).  As the foregoing discussion demonstrates, that is precisely what the Court has sanctioned here.  Because the record is utterly devoid of proof that Congress was responding to state violations of due process access-to-the-courts rights, this case is controlled by Florida Prepaid and City of Boerne, rather than Hibbs.

						 Title IIs all-encompassing approach to regulating public services contrasts starkly with the more closely tailored laws we have upheld as legitimate prophylactic §5 legislation.  In Hibbs, for example, the FMLA was narrowly targeted to remedy widespread gender discrimination in the availability of family leave.  538 U. S., at 738739 (distinguishing City of Boerne, Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/528/62" class="subref" title="subref">528 U. S. 62</a> (2000)
, and Garrett on this ground).  Similarly, in cases involving enforcement of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifteenth Amendment</a>, we upheld limited remedial scheme[s] that were narrowly tailored to address massive evidence of discrimination in voting.  Garrett, 531 U. S., at 373 (discussing South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/383/301" class="subref" title="subref">383 U. S. 301</a> (1966)
).  Unlike these statutes, Title IIs indiscriminate scope … is particularly incongruous in light of the scant support for the predicate unconstitutional conduct that Congress intended to remedy.  Florida Prepaid, 527 U. S., at 647.

						 Raines is inapposite in any event.  The Court there considered the constitutionality of the Civil Rights Act of 1957a statute designed to enforce the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifteenth Amendment</a>whose narrowly tailored substantive provisions could unquestionably be applied to state actors (like the respondents therein).  362 U. S., at 25, 26.  The only question presented was whether the statute was facially invalid because it might be read to constrain nonstate actors as well.  Id., at 20.  The Court upheld the statute as applied to respondents and declined to entertain the facial challenge.  Id., at 2426.  The situation in this case is much different: The very question presented is whether Title IIs indiscriminate substantive provisions can constitutionally be applied to the petitioner State.  Raines thus provides no support for avoiding this question by conjuring up an imaginary statute with substantive provisions that might pass the congruence-and-proportionality test.

						 The majoritys invocation of Hibbs to justify Title IIs overbreadth is unpersuasive.  See ante, at 22, n. 24.  The Hibbs Court concluded that in light of the evidence before Congress the FMLAs 12-week family-leave provision was necessary to achiev[e] Congress remedial object.  538 U. S, at 748.  The Court found that the legislative record included not only evidence of state constitutional violations, but evidence that a provision merely enforcing the Equal Protection Clause would actually perpetuate the gender stereotypes Congress sought to eradicate because employers could simply eliminate family leave entirely.  Ibid.  Without comparable evidence of constitutional violations and the necessity of prophylactic measures, the Court has no basis on which to uphold Title IIs special-accommodation requirements.

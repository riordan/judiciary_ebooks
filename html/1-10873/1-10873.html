				Petitioners were tried, convicted, and sentenced on federal narcotics charges in the District Court of Guam, a territorial court with subject-matter jurisdiction over both federal-law and local-law causes.  The Ninth Circuit panel convened to hear their appeals included two judges from that court, both of whom are life-tenured Article III judges, and the Chief Judge of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands, an Article IV territorial-court judge appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate for a 10-year term.  Neither petitioner objected to the panels composition before the cases were submitted for decision, and neither sought rehearing to challenge the panels authority to decide their appeals after it affirmed their convictions.  However, each filed a certiorari petition claiming that the judgment is invalid because a non-Article III judge participated on the panel.

				(a) In light of the relevant statutory provisions and historical usage, it is evident that Congress did not contemplate the judges of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands to be district judges within the meaning of 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/292.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §292(a)</a>, which authorizes the assignment of one or more district judges within [a] circuit to sit on the court of appeals whenever the business of that court so requires.  As used throughout Title 28, district court means a  court of the United States  constituted by chapter five of this title.  §451.  Among other things, Chapter 5 creates a United States District Court for each judicial district, §132(a), exhaustively enumerates the districts so constituted, §133(a), and describes district judges as holding office during good behavior, §134(a).  Significantly, the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands is not one of the enumerated courts, nor is it even mentioned in Chapter 5.  See §133(a).  Because that courts judges are appointed for a term of years and may be removed by the President for cause, they also do not satisfy §134(a)s command for district judges to hold office during good behavior.  Although the Chief Judge of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands is literally a district judge of a court within the [Ninth] [C]ircuit, such a reading of §292(a) is so capacious that it would also justify the designation of district judges of any number of 
				<em>
					state
				</em>
				 courts within the Ninth Circuit.  Moreover, historically, the term United States District Court in Title 28 has ordinarily excluded Article IV territorial courts, even when their jurisdiction is similar to that of an Article III United States District Court.

				(b) The Governments three grounds for leaving the judgments below undisturbed are not persuasive.  First, this Courts precedents concerning alleged irregularities in the assignment of judges do not compel application here of the 
				<em>
					de facto
				</em>
				 officer doctrine, which confers validity upon acts performed by a person acting under the color of official title even though it is later discovered that the legality of that persons appointment to office is deficient,

				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/515/177" class="subref" title="subref">515 U. S. 177</a>.  Typically, the Court has found a judges actions to be valid 
				<em>
					de facto
				</em>
				 when there is a merely technical defect of statutory authority, 
				<em>
					McDowell
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/159/596" class="subref" title="subref">159 U. S. 596</a>, but not when, as here, there has been a violation of a statutory provision that embodies weighty congressional policy concerning the proper organization of the federal courts, see, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					American Constr. Co.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Jacksonville, T. &amp; K. W. R. Co.
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/148/372" class="subref" title="subref">148 U. S. 372</a>.  Second, for essentially the same reasons, it is inappropriate to accept the Governments invitation to assess the merits of petitioners convictions or whether the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings were impaired by the composition of the panel.  Third, the Governments argument that the presence of a quorum of two otherwise-qualified judges on the panel is sufficient to support the decision below is rejected for two reasons.  The federal quorum statute, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/46.html#d" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §46(d)</a>, has been on the books (in relevant part essentially unchanged) for over a century, yet this Court has never doubted its power to vacate a judgment entered by an improperly constituted court of appeals, even when there was a quorum of judges competent to consider the appeal.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g., United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					American-Foreign S. S. Corp.,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/363/685" class="subref" title="subref">363 U. S. 685</a>.  Moreover, the statute authorizing courts of appeals to sit in panels, §46(b), requires the inclusion of at least three judges in the first instance.  Although the two Article III judges who took part below would have constituted a quorum had the original panel been properly created, it is at least highly doubtful whether they had any authority to serve by themselves as a panel.  Thus, it is appropriate to return these cases to the Ninth Circuit for fresh consideration by a properly constituted panel.  Pp. 714.

				 petitioners appealed their convictions to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.  The panel convened to hear their appeals included the Chief Judge and a Senior Circuit Judge of the Ninth Circuit, both of whom are, of course, life-tenured Article III judges who serve during good Behaviour for compensation that may not be diminished while in office.  U. S. Const., Art. III, §1.  The third member of the panel was the Chief Judge of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands.

				The highly unusual presence of a non-Article III judge as a member of the Ninth Circuit panel occurred during special sittings in Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands.  When the Court of Appeals heard arguments in Guam, the Chief Judge of the Ninth Circuit invited the Chief Judge of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands to participate.  A judge of the District Court of Guam was similarly invited to participate in appeals heard while the Ninth Circuit sat in the Northern Mariana Islands.

				The panel affirmed petitioners convictions without dissent.  284 F. 3d 1086 (2002).  Neither Nguyen nor Phan objected to the composition of the panel before the cases were submitted for decision; neither petitioner sought rehearing after the Court of Appeals rendered judgment to challenge the panels authority to decide their appeals.  Each did, however, file a petition for certiorari raising the question whether the judgment of the Court of Appeals is invalid because of the participation of a non-Article III judge on the panel.  In accordance with this Courts Rule 10(a), we granted the writ, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/537/999" class="subref" title="subref">537 U. S. 999</a> (2002)

For the following reasons, we find these to be appropriate cases for the exercise of that power.

        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				We begin with the congressional grant of authority permitting, in certain circumstances, the designation of district judges to serve on the courts of appeals.  In relevant part, the designation statute authorizes the chief judge of a circuit to assign one or more district judges within the circuit to sit on the court of appeals whenever the business of that court so requires.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/292.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §292(a)</a>.  Section 292(a) itself does not explicitly define the district judges who may be assigned to the court of appeals.  However, as other provisions of law make perfectly clear, judges of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands are not district judges within the meaning of §292(a).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Outside of §292(a), Title 28 contains several particularly instructive provisions.  The term district court as used throughout Title 28 is defined to mean a  court of the United States  that is constituted by chapter five of this title.  §451.  Chapter 5 of Title 28 in turn creates a United States District Court for each judicial district.  §132(a) (There shall be in each judicial district a district court which shall be a court of record known as the United States District Court for the district).  And district judge[s] are established as the members of those courts.  §132(b) (Each district court shall consist of the district judge or judges for the district in regular active service).  The judicial districts constituted by Chapter 5 are then exhaustively enumerated.  §133(a) (The President shall appoint, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, district judges for the several judicial districts, as follows [listing districts]).  Lastly, Chapter 5 describes district judges as holding office during good behavior.  §134(a).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Taking these provisions together, §292(a) cannot be read to permit the designation to the court of appeals of a judge of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands.  Significantly, the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands is not one of the courts constituted by Chapter 5 of Title 28, nor is that court even mentioned within Chapter 5.
				<a name="ZO-7ref" href="#ZO-7" class="">

				</b>
                </sup>
            </a>
				  See §133(a).  Because the judges of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands are appointed for a term of years and may be removed by the President for cause, they also do not satisfy the command for district judges within the meaning of Title 28 to hold office during good behavior.  §134(a).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Solicitor General agrees these statutory provisions are best read together as not permitting the Chief Judge of the Northern Mariana Islands to sit by designation on the Ninth Circuit.  The Government maintains, however, that the erroneous designation in these cases was not plainly impermissible because Title 28 does not expressly forbid it or explicitly define the term district judge separately from the term district court.  This contention requires an excessively strained interpretation of the statute.  To be sure, a literal reading of the words district judges in isolation from the rest of the statute might arguably justify assigning the Chief Judge of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands for service on the Court of Appeals, for he is called a district judge of a court within the [Ninth] [C]ircuit.  But a literal reading of that sort is so capacious that it would also justify the designation of district judges of any number of 
				<em>
					state
				</em>
				 courts within the Ninth Circuit.

				  The statute cannot plausibly be interpreted to authorize the improper panel assignment in these cases.

 (It must be admitted that the words United States District Court were not accurately used … [to refer to] the United States Court in the Indian Territory).  Construing the relevant statutory provisions together with further aid from historical usage, it is evident that Congress did not contemplate the judges of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands to be district judges within the meaning of §292(a).  It necessarily follows that the appointment of one member of the panel deciding petitioners appeals was unauthorized.

				Although the Solicitor General concedes that the panel of the Court of Appeals was improperly constituted, the Government advances three grounds on which the judgments below may rest undisturbed.  Two of the grounds on which we are urged to affirm concern petitioners failure to object to the panels composition in the Court of Appeals.  Relying on the so-called 
				<em>
					de facto
				</em>
				 officer doctrine, the Government contends petitioners failure to challenge the panels composition at the earliest practicable moment completely forecloses relief in this Court.  The Government also contends that petitioners do not meet the requirements for relief under plain-error review.  The presence of a quorum of two otherwise-qualified judges on the Court of Appeals panel is invoked as the third ground sufficient to support the decision below.  We do not find these contentions persuasive.

				  Section 292(a) does not permit any assignment to service on the courts of appeals of a district judge who does not enjoy the protections set forth in Article III.  Congress decision to preserve the Article III character of the courts of appeals is more than a trivial concern, cf.

 (plurality opinion), and is entitled to respect.  The Chief Judge of the Northern Mariana Islands did not purport to have all the powers attached to the position of an Article III judge, 
				<em>
					McDowell
				</em>
				, 159 U. S., at 601, nor was the Chief Judge of the Ninth Circuit otherwise permitted by §292(a) to designate him for service on an Article III court.  Accordingly, his participation contravened the statutory requirements set by Congress for the composition of the federal courts of appeals.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				For essentially the same reasons, we think it inappropriate to accept the Governments invitation to assess the merits of petitioners convictions or whether the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings were impaired by the composition of the panel.  It is true, as the Government observes, that a failure to object to trial error ordinarily limits an appellate court to review for plain error.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2111.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2111</a>; Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 52(b).  But to ignore the violation of the designation statute in these cases would incorrectly suggest that some action (or inaction) on petitioners part could create authority Congress has quite carefully withheld.  Even if the parties had 
				<em>
					expressly
				</em>
				 stipulated to the participation of a non-Article III judge in the consideration of their appeals, no matter how distinguished and well qualified the judge might be, such a stipulation would not have cured the plain defect in the composition of the panel.

				More fundamentally, our enforcement of §292(a)s outer bounds is not driven so much by concern for the validity of petitioners convictions at trial but for the validity of the composition of the Court of Appeals.  As a general rule, federal courts may not use their supervisory powers to circumvent the obligation to assess trial errors for their prejudicial effect.  See

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">254</a>255 (1988)
.  Because the error in these cases involves a violation of a statutory provision that embodies a strong policy concerning the proper administration of judicial business, however, our exercise of supervisory power is not inconsistent with that general rule.

				<em>

				, but it is less clear whether the quorum statute offers postjudgment absolution for the participation of a judge who was not otherwise competent to be part of the panel under §292(a).  Thus, although the two Article III judges who took part in the decision of petitioners appeals would have constituted a quorum if the original panel had been properly created, it is at least highly doubtful whether they had any authority to serve by themselves as a panel.  In light of that doubt, it is appropriate to return these cases to the Ninth Circuit for fresh consideration of petitioners appeals by a properly constituted panel organized comformably to the requirements of the statute.

				 petitioners appealed their convictions to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.  The panel convened to hear their appeals included the Chief Judge and a Senior Circuit Judge of the Ninth Circuit, both of whom are, of course, life-tenured Article III judges who serve during good Behaviour for compensation that may not be diminished while in office.  U. S. Const., Art. III, §1.  The third member of the panel was the Chief Judge of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands.

				The highly unusual presence of a non-Article III judge as a member of the Ninth Circuit panel occurred during special sittings in Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands.

        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				We begin with the congressional grant of authority permitting, in certain circumstances, the designation of district judges to serve on the courts of appeals.  In relevant part, the designation statute authorizes the chief judge of a circuit to assign one or more district judges within the circuit to sit on the court of appeals whenever the business of that court so requires.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/292.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §292(a)</a>.  Section 292(a) itself does not explicitly define the district judges who may be assigned to the court of appeals.  However, as other provisions of law make perfectly clear, judges of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands are not district judges within the meaning of §292(a).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Outside of §292(a), Title 28 contains several particularly instructive provisions.  The term district court as used throughout Title 28 is defined to mean a  court of the United States  that is constituted by chapter five of this title.  §451.  Chapter 5 of Title 28 in turn creates a United States District Court for each judicial district.  §132(a) (There shall be in each judicial district a district court which shall be a court of record known as the United States District Court for the district).  And district judge[s] are established as the members of those courts.  §132(b) (Each district court shall consist of the district judge or judges for the district in regular active service).  The judicial districts constituted by Chapter 5 are then exhaustively enumerated.  §133(a) (The President shall appoint, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, district judges for the several judicial districts, as follows [listing districts]).  Lastly, Chapter 5 describes district judges as holding office during good behavior.  §134(a).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Taking these provisions together, §292(a) cannot be read to permit the designation to the court of appeals of a judge of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands.  Significantly, the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands is not one of the courts constituted by Chapter 5 of Title 28, nor is that court even mentioned within Chapter 5.

                </sup>
            </a>
				  See §133(a).  Because the judges of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands are appointed for a term of years and may be removed by the President for cause, they also do not satisfy the command for district judges within the meaning of Title 28 to hold office during good behavior.  §134(a).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Solicitor General agrees these statutory provisions are best read together as not permitting the Chief Judge of the Northern Mariana Islands to sit by designation on the Ninth Circuit.  The Government maintains, however, that the erroneous designation in these cases was not plainly impermissible because Title 28 does not expressly forbid it or explicitly define the term district judge separately from the term district court.  This contention requires an excessively strained interpretation of the statute.  To be sure, a literal reading of the words district judges in isolation from the rest of the statute might arguably justify assigning the Chief Judge of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands for service on the Court of Appeals, for he is called a district judge of a court within the [Ninth] [C]ircuit.  But a literal reading of that sort is so capacious that it would also justify the designation of district judges of any number of 
				<em>
					state
				</em>
				 courts within the Ninth Circuit.

				  The statute cannot plausibly be interpreted to authorize the improper panel assignment in these cases.

 (It must be admitted that the words United States District Court were not accurately used … [to refer to] the United States Court in the Indian Territory).  Construing the relevant statutory provisions together with further aid from historical usage, it is evident that Congress did not contemplate the judges of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands to be district judges within the meaning of §292(a).  It necessarily follows that the appointment of one member of the panel deciding petitioners appeals was unauthorized.

				Although the Solicitor General concedes that the panel of the Court of Appeals was improperly constituted, the Government advances three grounds on which the judgments below may rest undisturbed.  Two of the grounds on which we are urged to affirm concern petitioners failure to object to the panels composition in the Court of Appeals.  Relying on the so-called 
				<em>
					de facto
				</em>
				 officer doctrine, the Government contends petitioners failure to challenge the panels composition at the earliest practicable moment completely forecloses relief in this Court.  The Government also contends that petitioners do not meet the requirements for relief under plain-error review.  The presence of a quorum of two otherwise-qualified judges on the Court of Appeals panel is invoked as the third ground sufficient to support the decision below.  We do not find these contentions persuasive.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The 
				<em>
					de facto

				 officer doctrine, we have explained, confers validity upon acts performed by a person acting under the color of official title even though it is later discovered that the legality of that persons appointment or election to office is deficient.

				<em>
					McDowell
				</em>
				, 159 U. S., at 601, nor was the Chief Judge of the Ninth Circuit otherwise permitted by §292(a) to designate him for service on an Article III court.  Accordingly, his participation contravened the statutory requirements set by Congress for the composition of the federal courts of appeals.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				For essentially the same reasons, we think it inappropriate to accept the Governments invitation to assess the merits of petitioners convictions or whether the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings were impaired by the composition of the panel.  It is true, as the Government observes, that a failure to object to trial error ordinarily limits an appellate court to review for plain error.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2111.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2111</a>; Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 52(b).  But to ignore the violation of the designation statute in these cases would incorrectly suggest that some action (or inaction) on petitioners part could create authority Congress has quite carefully withheld.  Even if the parties had 
				<em>
					expressly

				<em>
					ibid.
				</em>
				, but it is less clear whether the quorum statute offers postjudgment absolution for the participation of a judge who was not otherwise competent to be part of the panel under §292(a).  Thus, although the two Article III judges who took part in the decision of petitioners appeals would have constituted a quorum if the original panel had been properly created, it is at least highly doubtful whether they had any authority to serve by themselves as a panel.  In light of that doubt, it is appropriate to return these cases to the Ninth Circuit for fresh consideration of petitioners appeals by a properly constituted panel organized comformably to the requirements of the statute.

Neither Nguyen nor Phan objected to the composition of the panel before the cases were submitted for decision; neither petitioner sought rehearing after the Court of Appeals rendered judgment to challenge the panels authority to decide their appeals.  Each did, however, file a petition for certiorari raising the question whether the judgment of the Court of Appeals is invalid because of the participation of a non-Article III judge on the panel.  In accordance with this Courts Rule 10(a), we granted the writ,

				We begin with the congressional grant of authority permitting, in certain circumstances, the designation of district judges to serve on the courts of appeals.  In relevant part, the designation statute authorizes the chief judge of a circuit to assign one or more district judges within the circuit to sit on the court of appeals whenever the business of that court so requires.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/292.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §292(a)</a>.  Section 292(a) itself does not explicitly define the district judges who may be assigned to the court of appeals.  However, as other provisions of law make perfectly clear, judges of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands are not district judges within the meaning of §292(a).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Outside of §292(a), Title 28 contains several particularly instructive provisions.  The term district court as used throughout Title 28 is defined to mean a  court of the United States  that is constituted by chapter five of this title.  §451.  Chapter 5 of Title 28 in turn creates a United States District Court for each judicial district.  §132(a) (There shall be in each judicial district a district court which shall be a court of record known as the United States District Court for the district).  And district judge[s] are established as the members of those courts.  §132(b) (Each district court shall consist of the district judge or judges for the district in regular active service).  The judicial districts constituted by Chapter 5 are then exhaustively enumerated.  §133(a) (The President shall appoint, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, district judges for the several judicial districts, as follows [listing districts]).  Lastly, Chapter 5 describes district judges as holding office during good behavior.  §134(a).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Taking these provisions together, §292(a) cannot be read to permit the designation to the court of appeals of a judge of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands.  Significantly, the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands is not one of the courts constituted by Chapter 5 of Title 28, nor is that court even mentioned within Chapter 5.

            </a>
				  See §133(a).  Because the judges of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands are appointed for a term of years and may be removed by the President for cause, they also do not satisfy the command for district judges within the meaning of Title 28 to hold office during good behavior.  §134(a).

				The Solicitor General agrees these statutory provisions are best read together as not permitting the Chief Judge of the Northern Mariana Islands to sit by designation on the Ninth Circuit.  The Government maintains, however, that the erroneous designation in these cases was not plainly impermissible because Title 28 does not expressly forbid it or explicitly define the term district judge separately from the term district court.  This contention requires an excessively strained interpretation of the statute.  To be sure, a literal reading of the words district judges in isolation from the rest of the statute might arguably justify assigning the Chief Judge of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands for service on the Court of Appeals, for he is called a district judge of a court within the [Ninth] [C]ircuit.  But a literal reading of that sort is so capacious that it would also justify the designation of district judges of any number of 
				<em>
					state
				</em>
				 courts within the Ninth Circuit.

 (It must be admitted that the words United States District Court were not accurately used … [to refer to] the United States Court in the Indian Territory).  Construing the relevant statutory provisions together with further aid from historical usage, it is evident that Congress did not contemplate the judges of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands to be district judges within the meaning of §292(a).  It necessarily follows that the appointment of one member of the panel deciding petitioners appeals was unauthorized.

				Although the Solicitor General concedes that the panel of the Court of Appeals was improperly constituted, the Government advances three grounds on which the judgments below may rest undisturbed.  Two of the grounds on which we are urged to affirm concern petitioners failure to object to the panels composition in the Court of Appeals.  Relying on the so-called 
				<em>
					de facto
				</em>
				 officer doctrine, the Government contends petitioners failure to challenge the panels composition at the earliest practicable moment completely forecloses relief in this Court.  The Government also contends that petitioners do not meet the requirements for relief under plain-error review.  The presence of a quorum of two otherwise-qualified judges on the Court of Appeals panel is invoked as the third ground sufficient to support the decision below.  We do not find these contentions persuasive.

				The

				  Section 292(a) does not permit any assignment to service on the courts of appeals of a district judge who does not enjoy the protections set forth in Article III.  Congress decision to preserve the Article III character of the courts of appeals is more than a trivial concern, cf.

 (plurality opinion), and is entitled to respect.  The Chief Judge of the Northern Mariana Islands did not purport to have all the powers attached to the position of an Article III judge, 
				<em>
					McDowell
				</em>
				, 159 U. S., at 601, nor was the Chief Judge of the Ninth Circuit otherwise permitted by §292(a) to designate him for service on an Article III court.  Accordingly, his participation contravened the statutory requirements set by Congress for the composition of the federal courts of appeals.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				For essentially the same reasons, we think it inappropriate to accept the Governments invitation to assess the merits of petitioners convictions or whether the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings were impaired by the composition of the panel.  It is true, as the Government observes, that a failure to object to trial error ordinarily limits an appellate court to review for plain error.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2111.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2111</a>; Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 52(b).  But to ignore the violation of the designation statute in these cases would incorrectly suggest that some action (or inaction) on petitioners part could create authority Congress has quite carefully withheld.  Even if the parties had 
				<em>
					expressly
				</em>
				 stipulated to the participation of a non-Article III judge in the consideration of their appeals, no matter how distinguished and well qualified the judge might be, such a stipulation would not have cured the plain defect in the composition of the panel.

				More fundamentally, our enforcement of §292(a)s outer bounds is not driven so much by concern for the validity of petitioners convictions at trial but for the validity of the composition of the Court of Appeals.  As a general rule, federal courts may not use their supervisory powers to circumvent the obligation to assess trial errors for their prejudicial effect.  See

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">254</a>255 (1988)
.  Because the error in these cases involves a violation of a statutory provision that embodies a strong policy concerning the proper administration of judicial business, however, our exercise of supervisory power is not inconsistent with that general rule.

The panel convened to hear their appeals included the Chief Judge and a Senior Circuit Judge of the Ninth Circuit, both of whom are, of course, life-tenured Article III judges who serve during good Behaviour for compensation that may not be diminished while in office.  U. S. Const., Art. III, §1.  The third member of the panel was the Chief Judge of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands.

				The highly unusual presence of a non-Article III judge as a member of the Ninth Circuit panel occurred during special sittings in Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands.

        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				We begin with the congressional grant of authority permitting, in certain circumstances, the designation of district judges to serve on the courts of appeals.  In relevant part, the designation statute authorizes the chief judge of a circuit to assign one or more district judges within the circuit to sit on the court of appeals whenever the business of that court so requires.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/292.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §292(a)</a>.  Section 292(a) itself does not explicitly define the district judges who may be assigned to the court of appeals.  However, as other provisions of law make perfectly clear, judges of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands are not district judges within the meaning of §292(a).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Outside of §292(a), Title 28 contains several particularly instructive provisions.  The term district court as used throughout Title 28 is defined to mean a  court of the United States  that is constituted by chapter five of this title.  §451.  Chapter 5 of Title 28 in turn creates a United States District Court for each judicial district.  §132(a) (There shall be in each judicial district a district court which shall be a court of record known as the United States District Court for the district).  And district judge[s] are established as the members of those courts.  §132(b) (Each district court shall consist of the district judge or judges for the district in regular active service).  The judicial districts constituted by Chapter 5 are then exhaustively enumerated.  §133(a) (The President shall appoint, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, district judges for the several judicial districts, as follows [listing districts]).  Lastly, Chapter 5 describes district judges as holding office during good behavior.  §134(a).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Taking these provisions together, §292(a) cannot be read to permit the designation to the court of appeals of a judge of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands.  Significantly, the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands is not one of the courts constituted by Chapter 5 of Title 28, nor is that court even mentioned within Chapter 5.

                </sup>
            </a>
				  See §133(a).  Because the judges of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands are appointed for a term of years and may be removed by the President for cause, they also do not satisfy the command for district judges within the meaning of Title 28 to hold office during good behavior.  §134(a).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Solicitor General agrees these statutory provisions are best read together as not permitting the Chief Judge of the Northern Mariana Islands to sit by designation on the Ninth Circuit.  The Government maintains, however, that the erroneous designation in these cases was not plainly impermissible because Title 28 does not expressly forbid it or explicitly define the term district judge separately from the term district court.  This contention requires an excessively strained interpretation of the statute.  To be sure, a literal reading of the words district judges in isolation from the rest of the statute might arguably justify assigning the Chief Judge of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands for service on the Court of Appeals, for he is called a district judge of a court within the [Ninth] [C]ircuit.  But a literal reading of that sort is so capacious that it would also justify the designation of district judges of any number of 
				<em>
					state
				</em>
				 courts within the Ninth Circuit.

 (It must be admitted that the words United States District Court were not accurately used … [to refer to] the United States Court in the Indian Territory).  Construing the relevant statutory provisions together with further aid from historical usage, it is evident that Congress did not contemplate the judges of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands to be district judges within the meaning of §292(a).  It necessarily follows that the appointment of one member of the panel deciding petitioners appeals was unauthorized.

				Although the Solicitor General concedes that the panel of the Court of Appeals was improperly constituted, the Government advances three grounds on which the judgments below may rest undisturbed.  Two of the grounds on which we are urged to affirm concern petitioners failure to object to the panels composition in the Court of Appeals.  Relying on the so-called 
				<em>
					de facto

				 officer doctrine, the Government contends petitioners failure to challenge the panels composition at the earliest practicable moment completely forecloses relief in this Court.  The Government also contends that petitioners do not meet the requirements for relief under plain-error review.  The presence of a quorum of two otherwise-qualified judges on the Court of Appeals panel is invoked as the third ground sufficient to support the decision below.  We do not find these contentions persuasive.

				  Section 292(a) does not permit any assignment to service on the courts of appeals of a district judge who does not enjoy the protections set forth in Article III.  Congress decision to preserve the Article III character of the courts of appeals is more than a trivial concern, cf.

 (plurality opinion), and is entitled to respect.  The Chief Judge of the Northern Mariana Islands did not purport to have all the powers attached to the position of an Article III judge, 
				<em>
					McDowell
				</em>
				, 159 U. S., at 601, nor was the Chief Judge of the Ninth Circuit otherwise permitted by §292(a) to designate him for service on an Article III court.  Accordingly, his participation contravened the statutory requirements set by Congress for the composition of the federal courts of appeals.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				For essentially the same reasons, we think it inappropriate to accept the Governments invitation to assess the merits of petitioners convictions or whether the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings were impaired by the composition of the panel.  It is true, as the Government observes, that a failure to object to trial error ordinarily limits an appellate court to review for plain error.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2111.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2111</a>; Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 52(b).  But to ignore the violation of the designation statute in these cases would incorrectly suggest that some action (or inaction) on petitioners part could create authority Congress has quite carefully withheld.  Even if the parties had 
				<em>
					expressly
				</em>
				 stipulated to the participation of a non-Article III judge in the consideration of their appeals, no matter how distinguished and well qualified the judge might be, such a stipulation would not have cured the plain defect in the composition of the panel.

				More fundamentally, our enforcement of §292(a)s outer bounds is not driven so much by concern for the validity of petitioners convictions at trial but for the validity of the composition of the Court of Appeals.  As a general rule, federal courts may not use their supervisory powers to circumvent the obligation to assess trial errors for their prejudicial effect.  See

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">254</a>255 (1988)
.  Because the error in these cases involves a violation of a statutory provision that embodies a strong policy concerning the proper administration of judicial business, however, our exercise of supervisory power is not inconsistent with that general rule.

				<em>

				, but it is less clear whether the quorum statute offers postjudgment absolution for the participation of a judge who was not otherwise competent to be part of the panel under §292(a).  Thus, although the two Article III judges who took part in the decision of petitioners appeals would have constituted a quorum if the original panel had been properly created, it is at least highly doubtful whether they had any authority to serve by themselves as a panel.  In light of that doubt, it is appropriate to return these cases to the Ninth Circuit for fresh consideration of petitioners appeals by a properly constituted panel organized comformably to the requirements of the statute.

The panel convened to hear their appeals included the Chief Judge and a Senior Circuit Judge of the Ninth Circuit, both of whom are, of course, life-tenured Article III judges who serve during good Behaviour for compensation that may not be diminished while in office.  U. S. Const., Art. III, §1.  The third member of the panel was the Chief Judge of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands.

				The highly unusual presence of a non-Article III judge as a member of the Ninth Circuit panel occurred during special sittings in Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands.

				We begin with the congressional grant of authority permitting, in certain circumstances, the designation of district judges to serve on the courts of appeals.  In relevant part, the designation statute authorizes the chief judge of a circuit to assign one or more district judges within the circuit to sit on the court of appeals whenever the business of that court so requires.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/292.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §292(a)</a>.  Section 292(a) itself does not explicitly define the district judges who may be assigned to the court of appeals.  However, as other provisions of law make perfectly clear, judges of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands are not district judges within the meaning of §292(a).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Outside of §292(a), Title 28 contains several particularly instructive provisions.  The term district court as used throughout Title 28 is defined to mean a  court of the United States  that is constituted by chapter five of this title.  §451.  Chapter 5 of Title 28 in turn creates a United States District Court for each judicial district.  §132(a) (There shall be in each judicial district a district court which shall be a court of record known as the United States District Court for the district).  And district judge[s] are established as the members of those courts.  §132(b) (Each district court shall consist of the district judge or judges for the district in regular active service).  The judicial districts constituted by Chapter 5 are then exhaustively enumerated.  §133(a) (The President shall appoint, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, district judges for the several judicial districts, as follows [listing districts]).  Lastly, Chapter 5 describes district judges as holding office during good behavior.  §134(a).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Taking these provisions together, §292(a) cannot be read to permit the designation to the court of appeals of a judge of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands.  Significantly, the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands is not one of the courts constituted by Chapter 5 of Title 28, nor is that court even mentioned within Chapter 5.

                </sup>
            </a>
				  See §133(a).  Because the judges of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands are appointed for a term of years and may be removed by the President for cause, they also do not satisfy the command for district judges within the meaning of Title 28 to hold office during good behavior.  §134(a).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Solicitor General agrees these statutory provisions are best read together as not permitting the Chief Judge of the Northern Mariana Islands to sit by designation on the Ninth Circuit.  The Government maintains, however, that the erroneous designation in these cases was not plainly impermissible because Title 28 does not expressly forbid it or explicitly define the term district judge separately from the term district court.  This contention requires an excessively strained interpretation of the statute.  To be sure, a literal reading of the words district judges in isolation from the rest of the statute might arguably justify assigning the Chief Judge of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands for service on the Court of Appeals, for he is called a district judge of a court within the [Ninth] [C]ircuit.  But a literal reading of that sort is so capacious that it would also justify the designation of district judges of any number of 
				<em>
					state
				</em>
				 courts within the Ninth Circuit.

				  The statute cannot plausibly be interpreted to authorize the improper panel assignment in these cases.

 (It must be admitted that the words United States District Court were not accurately used … [to refer to] the United States Court in the Indian Territory).  Construing the relevant statutory provisions together with further aid from historical usage, it is evident that Congress did not contemplate the judges of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands to be district judges within the meaning of §292(a).  It necessarily follows that the appointment of one member of the panel deciding petitioners appeals was unauthorized.

				Although the Solicitor General concedes that the panel of the Court of Appeals was improperly constituted, the Government advances three grounds on which the judgments below may rest undisturbed.  Two of the grounds on which we are urged to affirm concern petitioners failure to object to the panels composition in the Court of Appeals.  Relying on the so-called 
				<em>
					de facto
				</em>
				 officer doctrine, the Government contends petitioners failure to challenge the panels composition at the earliest practicable moment completely forecloses relief in this Court.  The Government also contends that petitioners do not meet the requirements for relief under plain-error review.  The presence of a quorum of two otherwise-qualified judges on the Court of Appeals panel is invoked as the third ground sufficient to support the decision below.  We do not find these contentions persuasive.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The 
				<em>
					de facto

				 officer doctrine, we have explained, confers validity upon acts performed by a person acting under the color of official title even though it is later discovered that the legality of that persons appointment or election to office is deficient.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				For essentially the same reasons, we think it inappropriate to accept the Governments invitation to assess the merits of petitioners convictions or whether the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings were impaired by the composition of the panel.  It is true, as the Government observes, that a failure to object to trial error ordinarily limits an appellate court to review for plain error.  See

				More fundamentally, our enforcement of §292(a)s outer bounds is not driven so much by concern for the validity of petitioners convictions at trial but for the validity of the composition of the Court of Appeals.

				<em>
					Murray

				 v.

				, 35 F. 3d 45, 47 (1994).  It is clear that the statute was not intended to preclude disposition by a panel of two judges in the event that one member of a three-judge panel to which the appeal is assigned becomes unable to participate, 
				<em>
					ibid.
				</em>
				, but it is less clear whether the quorum statute offers postjudgment absolution for the participation of a judge who was not otherwise competent to be part of the panel under §292(a).  Thus, although the two Article III judges who took part in the decision of petitioners appeals would have constituted a quorum if the original panel had been properly created, it is at least highly doubtful whether they had any authority to serve by themselves as a panel.  In light of that doubt, it is appropriate to return these cases to the Ninth Circuit for fresh consideration of petitioners appeals by a properly constituted panel organized comformably to the requirements of the statute.

See also id., at 691 (Harlan, J., dissenting) (The statute need hardly be read, as the Court now holds it should be, as saying that a case in an en banc court shall be heard and determined by the active circuit judges).

				It was undoubtedly a mistake, for the reasons stated by the Court,

To that extent, I agree with the Courts opinion.

In both cases, this Court considered an Act of Congress providing that  no judge before whom a cause or question may have been tried or heard in a district court … shall sit on the trial or hearing of such cause or question in the Circuit Court of Appeals.   228 U. S., at 649; 148 U. S., at 387.  This Court held that, when a district judge sat in contravention of that comprehensive and inflexible prohibition, 228 U.

				But these cases do not control here because, as the Court fails to note, both cases predate our adoption of the standard for plain-error review in 
				<em>
					Atkinson
				</em>
				 in 1936, and Congress codification of that standard in Rule 52(b) in 1944.  This, and not some broader principle, explains the Courts failure in those cases to apply our modern plain-error analysis.  The Court has no such excuse.  The cases can also easily be distinguished from this one on the facts: They held only that courts constituted in violation of the 
				<em>
					express prohibitions
				</em>
				 of [a] statute lack the authority to act.  
				<em>
					Cramp
				</em>
				, 228 U. S., at 650 (emphasis added).  In contrast, the Ninth Circuit panel in this case did not run afoul of any comprehensive and inflexible statutory prohibition.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  Rather, the error must be deduced by negative implication, from a series of statutes that describe the proper use of district judges in panels of the Courts of Appeals.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 57.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court also says that to ignore the violation of the designation statute in these cases would incorrectly suggest that some action (or inaction) on petitioners part could create authority Congress has quite carefully withheld.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 11.  But proper affirmance of petitioners convictions on the ground that the error did not affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings would not so suggest.  The Solicitor General has conceded the error, and the Courts opinion properly makes clear to the Courts of Appeals that Chief Judge Munsons participation constituted plain error.  Indeed, the Court unwittingly explains why its own holding is mistaken: By ignoring the limits that Congress has imposed on appellate courts discretion via Rule 52(b), the Court create[s] for itself and exercises authority [that] Congress has quite carefully withheld.  Ibid.

				On this record, there is no basis for concluding that the error seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.  No miscarriage of justice will result from deciding not to notice the plain error here.  Accordingly, I would proceed to address petitioners constitutional claims.  Petitioners argue that the designation of a non-Article III judge to sit on theNinth Circuit panel violated the Appointments Clause, U. S. Const., Art. II, §2, cl. 2, and the structural guarantees embodied in Article III.  I would decline to address the first question because it was neither raised nor decided below, and [was] not presented in the petition for certiorari.  Blessing

In that apartment, agents also discovered drug paraphernalia, nearly a hundred little plastic zip lock bags, and $6,000 in cash.  Id., at 1088, 1091.


All three members of the Ninth Circuit panel agreed that petitioners challengesthat the District Court abused its discretion in admitting certain evidence, and that the evidence was insufficient to support the convictionslacked merit.  Judge Goodwin, writing for the court, explained that petitioners evidentiary challenges were overstate[d], and that the District Court clearly performed the necessary analysis.  Id., at 1090.  With respect to petitioners sufficiency of the evidence argument, the judges were also unanimous [t]here was plenty of evidence, id., at 1091, and abundant facts, id., at 1090, in support of petitioners convictions.

				This mandatory inquiry confirms that no miscarriage of justice would result if petitioners convictions were affirmed.  Petitioners make no claim that Chief Judge Munson was biased or incompetent.  His character and abilities as a jurist, peculiarly experienced in adjudicating matters arising within the United States Territories, stands unimpeached.  It is therefore difficult to understand how fairness or the public reputation of the judicial process is advanced by allowing criminal defendants, whose convictions are supported by  overwhelming  evidence,

				It was undoubtedly a mistake, for the reasons stated by the Court,

To that extent, I agree with the Courts opinion.  But I do not agree that that error is a valid basis for vacating petitioners convictions, because even assuming that the error affected petitioners substantial rights, it simply did not seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.

				Petitioners knew of the composition of the panel of the Court of Appeals more than a week before the case was orally argued.  App. 7, 912.  They made no objection then or later in that court, preferring to wait until the panel had decided against them on the merits to raise it.  The Court first concedes, as it must, that a failure to object to error limits an appellate court to review for plain error.

				This mandatory inquiry confirms that no miscarriage of justice would result if petitioners convictions were affirmed.  Petitioners make no claim that Chief Judge Munson was biased or incompetent.  His character and abilities as a jurist, peculiarly experienced in adjudicating matters arising within the United States Territories, stands unimpeached.  It is therefore difficult to understand how fairness or the public reputation of the judicial process is advanced by allowing criminal defendants, whose convictions are supported by  overwhelming  evidence, 
				<em>
					Cotton

				, 
				<em>

				The Court proffers several justifications for ignoring our controlling precedents, none of which is persuasive.  First, the Courts reliance on 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					American-Foreign S. S. Corp.,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/363/685" class="subref" title="subref">363 U. S. 685</a> (1960)
, is misplaced.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 10, n. 11, 12, 13.  In that case, Circuit Judge Medina retired three months after the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit granted a petition for rehearing en banc, but before the court issued its en banc decision.  363 U. S., at 686687.  He nonetheless participated in consideration of the case and subsequently joined the en banc decision.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 687.  This Court vacated the judgment because, under the relevant statute, a court in banc could consist only of active circuit judges.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 685 (quoting 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/46.html#c" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §46(c)</a> (internal quotation marks omitted)).

        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>

				 does not speak to the situation here because the petitioner in that case did not forfeit the error.  Forfeiture is  the failure to make timely assertion of the right before a tribunal having jurisdiction to determine it.   
				<em>
					Johnson
				</em>
				, 520 U. S., at 465 (quoting 
				<em>
					Olano
				</em>
				, 507 U. S., at 731).  The petitioner in 
				<em>
					American-Foreign
				</em>
				 did not so fail.  Rather, it objected at the earliest possible moment: immediately after the Court of Appeals issued an en banc decision that Judge Medina joined.  It did not know that Judge Medina would retire or then participate in the en banc decision until after the case was briefed and submitted; it availed itself of the earliest opportunity to object to this error by filing a motion for further rehearing en banc.  Petitioner did not forfeit the error, so Rule 52(b) did not apply.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				That is not the case here.  Petitioners Nguyen and Phan learned before oral argument that Chief Judge Munson was a member of their Court of Appeals panel.  They nonetheless failed to object at oral argument or in a petition for rehearing en banc.  This forfeiture requires us to apply the 
				<em>
					Olano
				</em>
				 test faithfully.

				The Court also relies mistakenly on 
				<em>
					William Cramp &amp; Sons Ship &amp; Engine Building Co.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					International Curtiss Marine Turbine Co.
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/228/645" class="subref" title="subref">228 U. S. 645</a> (1913)

				 v.

				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/148/372" class="subref" title="subref">148 U. S. 372</a> (1893)
.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 810, and n. 11.  In both cases, this Court considered an Act of Congress providing that  no judge before whom a cause or question may have been tried or heard in a district court … shall sit on the trial or hearing of such cause or question in the Circuit Court of Appeals.   228 U. S., at 649; 148 U. S., at 387.  This Court held that, when a district judge sat in contravention of that comprehensive and inflexible prohibition, 228 U. S., at 650, the court of appeals was statutorily unable to act.  See also 
				<em>
					American Construction
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 387.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				But these cases do not control here because, as the Court fails to note, both cases predate our adoption of the standard for plain-error review in 
				<em>
					Atkinson
				</em>
				 in 1936, and Congress codification of that standard in Rule 52(b) in 1944.  This, and not some broader principle, explains the Courts failure in those cases to apply our modern plain-error analysis.  The Court has no such excuse.  The cases can also easily be distinguished from this one on the facts: They held only that courts constituted in violation of the 
				<em>
					express prohibitions
				</em>
				 of [a] statute lack the authority to act.  
				<em>
					Cramp
				</em>
				, 228 U. S., at 650 (emphasis added).  In contrast, the Ninth Circuit panel in this case did not run afoul of any comprehensive and inflexible statutory prohibition.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  Rather, the error must be deduced by negative implication, from a series of statutes that describe the proper use of district judges in panels of the Courts of Appeals.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 57.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court also says that to ignore the violation of the designation statute in these cases would incorrectly suggest that some action (or inaction) on petitioners part could create authority Congress has quite carefully withheld.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 11.  But proper affirmance of petitioners convictions on the ground that the error did not affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings would not so suggest.  The Solicitor General has conceded the error, and the Courts opinion properly makes clear to the Courts of Appeals that Chief Judge Munsons participation constituted plain error.  Indeed, the Court unwittingly explains why its own holding is mistaken: By ignoring the limits that Congress has imposed on appellate courts discretion via Rule 52(b), the Court create[s] for itself and exercises authority [that] Congress has quite carefully withheld.  Ibid.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				
				On this record, there is no basis for concluding that the error seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.  No miscarriage of justice will result from deciding not to notice the plain error here.  Accordingly, I would proceed to address petitioners constitutional claims.  Petitioners argue that the designation of a non-Article III judge to sit on theNinth Circuit panel violated the Appointments Clause, U. S. Const., Art. II, §2, cl. 2, and the structural guarantees embodied in Article III.  I would decline to address the first question because it was neither raised nor decided below, and [was] not presented in the petition for certiorari.  Blessing

				Petitioners second constitutional claim, like their statutory one, is subject to plain-error review.  No procedural principle is more familiar to this Court than that a constitutional right may be forfeited in criminal as well as civil cases by the failure to make timely assertion of the right before a tribunal having jurisdiction to determine it.

				This mandatory inquiry confirms that no miscarriage of justice would result if petitioners convictions were affirmed.  Petitioners make no claim that Chief Judge Munson was biased or incompetent.  His character and abilities as a jurist, peculiarly experienced in adjudicating matters arising within the United States Territories, stands unimpeached.  It is therefore difficult to understand how fairness or the public reputation of the judicial process is advanced by allowing criminal defendants, whose convictions are supported by  overwhelming  evidence,

				The Court proffers several justifications for ignoring our controlling precedents, none of which is persuasive.  First, the Courts reliance on 
				<em>

				 v. 
				<em>
					American-Foreign S. S. Corp.,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/363/685" class="subref" title="subref">363 U. S. 685</a> (1960)

				<em>

				, at 10, n. 11, 12, 13.  In that case, Circuit Judge Medina retired three months after the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit granted a petition for rehearing en banc, but before the court issued its en banc decision.  363 U. S., at 686687.  He nonetheless participated in consideration of the case and subsequently joined the en banc decision.  
				<em>
					Id.,

				 at 687.  This Court vacated the judgment because, under the relevant statute, a court in banc could consist only of active circuit judges.

				, 520 U. S., at 465 (quoting

				<em>
					American-Foreign
				</em>
				 did not so fail.  Rather, it objected at the earliest possible moment: immediately after the Court of Appeals issued an en banc decision that Judge Medina joined.  It did not know that Judge Medina would retire or then participate in the en banc decision until after the case was briefed and submitted; it availed itself of the earliest opportunity to object to this error by filing a motion for further rehearing en banc.  Petitioner did not forfeit the error, so Rule 52(b) did not apply.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				That is not the case here.  Petitioners Nguyen and Phan learned before oral argument that Chief Judge Munson was a member of their Court of Appeals panel.  They nonetheless failed to object at oral argument or in a petition for rehearing en banc.  This forfeiture requires us to apply the

				, at 810, and n. 11.  In both cases, this Court considered an Act of Congress providing that  no judge before whom a cause or question may have been tried or heard in a district court … shall sit on the trial or hearing of such cause or question in the Circuit Court of Appeals.   228 U. S., at 649; 148 U. S., at 387.  This Court held that, when a district judge sat in contravention of that comprehensive and inflexible prohibition, 228 U.

				But these cases do not control here because, as the Court fails to note, both cases predate our adoption of the standard for plain-error review in 
				<em>
					Atkinson
				</em>
				 in 1936, and Congress codification of that standard in Rule 52(b) in 1944.  This, and not some broader principle, explains the Courts failure in those cases to apply our modern plain-error analysis.  The Court has no such excuse.  The cases can also easily be distinguished from this one on the facts: They held only that courts constituted in violation of the 
				<em>
					express prohibitions
				</em>
				 of [a] statute lack the authority to act.  
				<em>
					Cramp
				</em>
				, 228 U. S., at 650 (emphasis added).  In contrast, the Ninth Circuit panel in this case did not run afoul of any comprehensive and inflexible statutory prohibition.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  Rather, the error must be deduced by negative implication, from a series of statutes that describe the proper use of district judges in panels of the Courts of Appeals.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 57.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court also says that to ignore the violation of the designation statute in these cases would incorrectly suggest that some action (or inaction) on petitioners part could create authority Congress has quite carefully withheld.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 11.  But proper affirmance of petitioners convictions on the ground that the error did not affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings would not so suggest.  The Solicitor General has conceded the error, and the Courts opinion properly makes clear to the Courts of Appeals that Chief Judge Munsons participation constituted plain error.  Indeed, the Court unwittingly explains why its own holding is mistaken: By ignoring the limits that Congress has imposed on appellate courts discretion via Rule 52(b), the Court create[s] for itself and exercises authority [that] Congress has quite carefully withheld.  Ibid.

				On this record, there is no basis for concluding that the error seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.  No miscarriage of justice will result from deciding not to notice the plain error here.  Accordingly, I would proceed to address petitioners constitutional claims.  Petitioners argue that the designation of a non-Article III judge to sit on theNinth Circuit panel violated the Appointments Clause, U. S. Const., Art. II, §2, cl. 2, and the structural guarantees embodied in Article III.  I would decline to address the first question because it was neither raised nor decided below, and [was] not presented in the petition for certiorari.  Blessing

				Petitioners second constitutional claim, like their statutory one, is subject to plain-error review.  No procedural principle is more familiar to this Court than that a constitutional right may be forfeited in criminal as well as civil cases by the failure to make timely assertion of the right before a tribunal having jurisdiction to determine it.

				But these cases do not control here because, as the Court fails to note, both cases predate our adoption of the standard for plain-error review in 
				<em>
					Atkinson
				</em>
				 in 1936, and Congress codification of that standard in Rule 52(b) in 1944.  This, and not some broader principle, explains the Courts failure in those cases to apply our modern plain-error analysis.  The Court has no such excuse.  The cases can also easily be distinguished from this one on the facts: They held only that courts constituted in violation of the 
				<em>
					express prohibitions
				</em>
				 of [a] statute lack the authority to act.  
				<em>
					Cramp
				</em>
				, 228 U. S., at 650 (emphasis added).  In contrast, the Ninth Circuit panel in this case did not run afoul of any comprehensive and inflexible statutory prohibition.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  Rather, the error must be deduced by negative implication, from a series of statutes that describe the proper use of district judges in panels of the Courts of Appeals.  See 
				<em>

				</em>
				, at 57.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court also says that to ignore the violation of the designation statute in these cases would incorrectly suggest that some action (or inaction) on petitioners part could create authority Congress has quite carefully withheld.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 11.  But proper affirmance of petitioners convictions on the ground that the error did not affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings would not so suggest.  The Solicitor General has conceded the error, and the Courts opinion properly makes clear to the Courts of Appeals that Chief Judge Munsons participation constituted plain error.  Indeed, the Court unwittingly explains why its own holding is mistaken: By ignoring the limits that Congress has imposed on appellate courts discretion via Rule 52(b), the Court create[s] for itself and exercises authority [that] Congress has quite carefully withheld.  Ibid.

				On this record, there is no basis for concluding that the error seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.  No miscarriage of justice will result from deciding not to notice the plain error here.  Accordingly, I would proceed to address petitioners constitutional claims.  Petitioners argue that the designation of a non-Article III judge to sit on theNinth Circuit panel violated the Appointments Clause, U. S. Const., Art. II, §2, cl. 2, and the structural guarantees embodied in Article III.  I would decline to address the first question because it was neither raised nor decided below, and [was] not presented in the petition for certiorari.  Blessing

Judge Goodwin, writing for the court, explained that petitioners evidentiary challenges were overstate[d], and that the District Court clearly performed the necessary analysis.  Id., at 1090.  With respect to petitioners sufficiency of the evidence argument, the judges were also unanimous [t]here was plenty of evidence, id., at 1091, and abundant facts, id., at 1090, in support of petitioners convictions.

In that apartment, agents also discovered drug paraphernalia, nearly a hundred little plastic zip lock bags, and $6,000 in cash.  Id., at 1088, 1091.


All three members of the Ninth Circuit panel agreed that petitioners challengesthat the District Court abused its discretion in admitting certain evidence, and that the evidence was insufficient to support the convictionslacked merit.  Judge Goodwin, writing for the court, explained that petitioners evidentiary challenges were overstate[d], and that the District Court clearly performed the necessary analysis.  Id., at 1090.  With respect to petitioners sufficiency of the evidence argument, the judges were also unanimous [t]here was plenty of evidence, id., at 1091, and abundant facts, id., at 1090, in support of petitioners convictions.

				It was undoubtedly a mistake, for the reasons stated by the Court,

To that extent, I agree with the Courts opinion.

				This mandatory inquiry confirms that no miscarriage of justice would result if petitioners convictions were affirmed.  Petitioners make no claim that Chief Judge Munson was biased or incompetent.  His character and abilities as a jurist, peculiarly experienced in adjudicating matters arising within the United States Territories, stands unimpeached.  It is therefore difficult to understand how fairness or the public reputation of the judicial process is advanced by allowing criminal defendants, whose convictions are supported by  overwhelming  evidence, 
				<em>
					Cotton

				, 
				<em>

				The Court proffers several justifications for ignoring our controlling precedents, none of which is persuasive.  First, the Courts reliance on

            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/363/685" class="subref" title="subref">363 U. S. 685</a> (1960)

				<em>

				, at 10, n. 11, 12, 13.  In that case, Circuit Judge Medina retired three months after the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit granted a petition for rehearing en banc, but before the court issued its en banc decision.  363 U. S., at 686687.  He nonetheless participated in consideration of the case and subsequently joined the en banc decision.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 687.  This Court vacated the judgment because, under the relevant statute, a court in banc could consist only of active circuit judges.

				<em>
					American-Foreign
				</em>
				 did not so fail.  Rather, it objected at the earliest possible moment: immediately after the Court of Appeals issued an en banc decision that Judge Medina joined.  It did not know that Judge Medina would retire or then participate in the en banc decision until after the case was briefed and submitted; it availed itself of the earliest opportunity to object to this error by filing a motion for further rehearing en banc.  Petitioner did not forfeit the error, so Rule 52(b) did not apply.

				That is not the case here.  Petitioners Nguyen and Phan learned before oral argument that Chief Judge Munson was a member of their Court of Appeals panel.  They nonetheless failed to object at oral argument or in a petition for rehearing en banc.  This forfeiture requires us to apply the

To that extent, I agree with the Courts opinion.

				Petitioners knew of the composition of the panel of the Court of Appeals more than a week before the case was orally argued.  App. 7, 912.  They made no objection then or later in that court, preferring to wait until the panel had decided against them on the merits to raise it.  The Court first concedes, as it must, that a failure to object to error limits an appellate court to review for plain error.

				This mandatory inquiry confirms that no miscarriage of justice would result if petitioners convictions were affirmed.  Petitioners make no claim that Chief Judge Munson was biased or incompetent.  His character and abilities as a jurist, peculiarly experienced in adjudicating matters arising within the United States Territories, stands unimpeached.  It is therefore difficult to understand how fairness or the public reputation of the judicial process is advanced by allowing criminal defendants, whose convictions are supported by  overwhelming  evidence, 
				<em>
					Cotton

				, 
				<em>

				The Court proffers several justifications for ignoring our controlling precedents, none of which is persuasive.  First, the Courts reliance on 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					American-Foreign S. S. Corp.,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/363/685" class="subref" title="subref">363 U. S. 685</a> (1960)
, is misplaced.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 10, n. 11, 12, 13.  In that case, Circuit Judge Medina retired three months after the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit granted a petition for rehearing en banc, but before the court issued its en banc decision.  363 U. S., at 686687.  He nonetheless participated in consideration of the case and subsequently joined the en banc decision.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 687.  This Court vacated the judgment because, under the relevant statute, a court in banc could consist only of active circuit judges.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 685 (quoting 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/46.html#c" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §46(c)</a> (internal quotation marks omitted)).

            <em>

				 does not speak to the situation here because the petitioner in that case did not forfeit the error.  Forfeiture is  the failure to make timely assertion of the right before a tribunal having jurisdiction to determine it.   
				<em>
					Johnson
				</em>
				, 520 U. S., at 465 (quoting 
				<em>
					Olano
				</em>
				, 507 U. S., at 731).  The petitioner in 
				<em>
					American-Foreign
				</em>
				 did not so fail.  Rather, it objected at the earliest possible moment: immediately after the Court of Appeals issued an en banc decision that Judge Medina joined.  It did not know that Judge Medina would retire or then participate in the en banc decision until after the case was briefed and submitted; it availed itself of the earliest opportunity to object to this error by filing a motion for further rehearing en banc.  Petitioner did not forfeit the error, so Rule 52(b) did not apply.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				That is not the case here.  Petitioners Nguyen and Phan learned before oral argument that Chief Judge Munson was a member of their Court of Appeals panel.  They nonetheless failed to object at oral argument or in a petition for rehearing en banc.  This forfeiture requires us to apply the 
				<em>
					Olano
				</em>
				 test faithfully.

				The Court also relies mistakenly on 
				<em>
					William Cramp &amp; Sons Ship &amp; Engine Building Co.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					International Curtiss Marine Turbine Co.
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/228/645" class="subref" title="subref">228 U. S. 645</a> (1913)

.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 810, and n. 11.  In both cases, this Court considered an Act of Congress providing that  no judge before whom a cause or question may have been tried or heard in a district court … shall sit on the trial or hearing of such cause or question in the Circuit Court of Appeals.   228 U. S., at 649; 148 U. S., at 387.  This Court held that, when a district judge sat in contravention of that comprehensive and inflexible prohibition, 228 U. S., at 650, the court of appeals was statutorily unable to act.  See also 
				<em>
					American Construction
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 387.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				But these cases do not control here because, as the Court fails to note, both cases predate our adoption of the standard for plain-error review in 
				<em>
					Atkinson
				</em>
				 in 1936, and Congress codification of that standard in Rule 52(b) in 1944.  This, and not some broader principle, explains the Courts failure in those cases to apply our modern plain-error analysis.  The Court has no such excuse.  The cases can also easily be distinguished from this one on the facts: They held only that courts constituted in violation of the 
				<em>
					express prohibitions
				</em>
				 of [a] statute lack the authority to act.  
				<em>
					Cramp
				</em>
				, 228 U. S., at 650 (emphasis added).  In contrast, the Ninth Circuit panel in this case did not run afoul of any comprehensive and inflexible statutory prohibition.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  Rather, the error must be deduced by negative implication, from a series of statutes that describe the proper use of district judges in panels of the Courts of Appeals.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 57.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court also says that to ignore the violation of the designation statute in these cases would incorrectly suggest that some action (or inaction) on petitioners part could create authority Congress has quite carefully withheld.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 11.  But proper affirmance of petitioners convictions on the ground that the error did not affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings would not so suggest.  The Solicitor General has conceded the error, and the Courts opinion properly makes clear to the Courts of Appeals that Chief Judge Munsons participation constituted plain error.  Indeed, the Court unwittingly explains why its own holding is mistaken: By ignoring the limits that Congress has imposed on appellate courts discretion via Rule 52(b), the Court create[s] for itself and exercises authority [that] Congress has quite carefully withheld.  Ibid.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				
				On this record, there is no basis for concluding that the error seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.  No miscarriage of justice will result from deciding not to notice the plain error here.  Accordingly, I would proceed to address petitioners constitutional claims.  Petitioners argue that the designation of a non-Article III judge to sit on theNinth Circuit panel violated the Appointments Clause, U. S. Const., Art. II, §2, cl. 2, and the structural guarantees embodied in Article III.  I would decline to address the first question because it was neither raised nor decided below, and [was] not presented in the petition for certiorari.  Blessing

				Petitioners second constitutional claim, like their statutory one, is subject to plain-error review.  No procedural principle is more familiar to this Court than that a constitutional right may be forfeited in criminal as well as civil cases by the failure to make timely assertion of the right before a tribunal having jurisdiction to determine it.

It did not know that Judge Medina would retire or then participate in the en banc decision until after the case was briefed and submitted; it availed itself of the earliest opportunity to object to this error by filing a motion for further rehearing en banc.  Petitioner did not forfeit the error, so Rule 52(b) did not apply.

In both cases, this Court considered an Act of Congress providing that  no judge before whom a cause or question may have been tried or heard in a district court … shall sit on the trial or hearing of such cause or question in the Circuit Court of Appeals.   228 U. S., at 649; 148 U. S., at 387.  This Court held that, when a district judge sat in contravention of that comprehensive and inflexible prohibition, 228 U.

				But these cases do not control here because, as the Court fails to note, both cases predate our adoption of the standard for plain-error review in 
				<em>
					Atkinson
				</em>
				 in 1936, and Congress codification of that standard in Rule 52(b) in 1944.  This, and not some broader principle, explains the Courts failure in those cases to apply our modern plain-error analysis.  The Court has no such excuse.  The cases can also easily be distinguished from this one on the facts: They held only that courts constituted in violation of the 
				<em>
					express prohibitions
				</em>
				 of [a] statute lack the authority to act.  
				<em>
					Cramp
				</em>
				, 228 U. S., at 650 (emphasis added).  In contrast, the Ninth Circuit panel in this case did not run afoul of any comprehensive and inflexible statutory prohibition.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  Rather, the error must be deduced by negative implication, from a series of statutes that describe the proper use of district judges in panels of the Courts of Appeals.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 57.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court also says that to ignore the violation of the designation statute in these cases would incorrectly suggest that some action (or inaction) on petitioners part could create authority Congress has quite carefully withheld.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 11.  But proper affirmance of petitioners convictions on the ground that the error did not affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings would not so suggest.  The Solicitor General has conceded the error, and the Courts opinion properly makes clear to the Courts of Appeals that Chief Judge Munsons participation constituted plain error.  Indeed, the Court unwittingly explains why its own holding is mistaken: By ignoring the limits that Congress has imposed on appellate courts discretion via Rule 52(b), the Court create[s] for itself and exercises authority [that] Congress has quite carefully withheld.  Ibid.

				On this record, there is no basis for concluding that the error seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.  No miscarriage of justice will result from deciding not to notice the plain error here.  Accordingly, I would proceed to address petitioners constitutional claims.  Petitioners argue that the designation of a non-Article III judge to sit on theNinth Circuit panel violated the Appointments Clause, U. S. Const., Art. II, §2, cl. 2, and the structural guarantees embodied in Article III.  I would decline to address the first question because it was neither raised nor decided below, and [was] not presented in the petition for certiorari.  Blessing

				On this record, there is no basis for concluding that the error seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.

Petitioners argue that the designation of a non-Article III judge to sit on theNinth Circuit panel violated the Appointments Clause, U. S. Const., Art.

All three members of the Ninth Circuit panel agreed that petitioners challengesthat the District Court abused its discretion in admitting certain evidence, and that the evidence was insufficient to support the convictionslacked merit.  Judge Goodwin, writing for the court, explained that petitioners evidentiary challenges were overstate[d], and that the District Court clearly performed the necessary analysis.  Id., at 1090.  With respect to petitioners sufficiency of the evidence argument, the judges were also unanimous [t]here was plenty of evidence, id., at 1091, and abundant facts, id., at 1090, in support of petitioners convictions.

				This mandatory inquiry confirms that no miscarriage of justice would result if petitioners convictions were affirmed.  Petitioners make no claim that Chief Judge Munson was biased or incompetent.  His character and abilities as a jurist, peculiarly experienced in adjudicating matters arising within the United States Territories, stands unimpeached.  It is therefore difficult to understand how fairness or the public reputation of the judicial process is advanced by allowing criminal defendants, whose convictions are supported by  overwhelming  evidence,

Indeed, the Court unwittingly explains why its own holding is mistaken: By ignoring the limits that Congress has imposed on appellate courts discretion via Rule 52(b), the Court create[s] for itself and exercises authority [that] Congress has quite carefully withheld.  Ibid.

				On this record, there is no basis for concluding that the error seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.  No miscarriage of justice will result from deciding not to notice the plain error here.  Accordingly, I would proceed to address petitioners constitutional claims.  Petitioners argue that the designation of a non-Article III judge to sit on theNinth Circuit panel violated the Appointments Clause, U. S. Const., Art. II, §2, cl. 2, and the structural guarantees embodied in Article III.  I would decline to address the first question because it was neither raised nor decided below, and [was] not presented in the petition for certiorari.  Blessing

				Petitioners second constitutional claim, like their statutory one, is subject to plain-error review.  No procedural principle is more familiar to this Court than that a constitutional right may be forfeited in criminal as well as civil cases by the failure to make timely assertion of the right before a tribunal having jurisdiction to determine it.

						* Drug enforcement agents seized 443.8 grams of methamphetamine in a package that was mailed to Phan and opened in Nguyens apartment.  284 F. 3d 1086, 10871088 (CA9 2002).  In that apartment, agents also discovered drug paraphernalia, nearly a hundred little plastic zip lock bags, and $6,000 in cash.  Id., at 1088, 1091.


All three members of the Ninth Circuit panel agreed that petitioners challengesthat the District Court abused its discretion in admitting certain evidence, and that the evidence was insufficient to support the convictionslacked merit.  Judge Goodwin, writing for the court, explained that petitioners evidentiary challenges were overstate[d], and that the District Court clearly performed the necessary analysis.  Id., at 1090.  With respect to petitioners sufficiency of the evidence argument, the judges were also unanimous [t]here was plenty of evidence, id., at 1091, and abundant facts, id., at 1090, in support of petitioners convictions.

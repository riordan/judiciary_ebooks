				The State of Washington established the Promise Scholarship Program to assist academically gifted students with postsecondary education expenses.  In accordance with the State Constitution, students may not use the scholarship at an institution where they are pursuing a degree in devotional theology.  We hold that such an exclusion from an otherwise inclusive aid program does not violate the Free Exercise Clause of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Washington State Legislature found that [s]tudents who work hard … and successfully complete high school with high academic marks may not have the financial ability to attend college because they cannot obtain financial aid or the financial aid is insufficient.  Wash. Rev. Code §28B.119.005 (Supp. 2004).  In 1999, to assist these high-achieving students, the legislature created the Promise Scholarship Program, which provides a scholarship, renewable for one year, to eligible students for postsecondary education expenses.  Students may spend their funds on any education-related expense, including room and board.  The scholarships are funded through the States general fund, and their amount varies each year depending on the annual appropriation, which is evenly prorated among the eligible students.  Wash. Admin. Code §25080050(2) (2003).  The scholarship was worth $1,125 for academic year 19992000 and $1,542 for 20002001.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				To be eligible for the scholarship, a student must meet academic, income, and enrollment requirements.  A student must graduate from a Washington public or private high school and either graduate in the top 15% of his graduating class, or attain on the first attempt a cumulative score of 1,200 or better on the Scholastic Assessment Test I or a score of 27 or better on the American College Test. 
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				§§25080020(12)(a)(d).  The students family income must be less than 135% of the States median.  §25080020(12)(e).  Finally, the student must enroll at least half time in an eligible postsecondary institution in the state of Washington, and may not pursue a degree in theology at that institution while receiving the scholarship.  §§25080020(12)(f)(g); see also Wash. Rev. Code §28B.10.814 (1997) (No aid shall be awarded to any student who is pursuing a degree in theology).  Private institutions, including those religiously affiliated, qualify as eligible postsecondary institution[s] if they are accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting body.  See Wash. Admin. Code §25080020(13).  A degree in theology is not defined in the statute, but, as both parties concede, the statute simply codifies the States constitutional prohibition on providing funds to students to pursue degrees that are devotional in nature or designed to induce religious faith.  Brief for Petitioners 6; Brief for Respondent 8; see also Wash. Const., Art. I, §11.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				A student who applies for the scholarship and meets the academic and income requirements is notified that he is eligible for the scholarship if he meets the enrollment requirements.  
				<em>
					E.g.
				</em>
				, App. 95.  Once the student enrolls at an eligible institution, the institution must certify that the student is enrolled at least half time and that the student is not pursuing a degree in devotional theology.  The institution, rather than the State, determines whether the students major is devotional.

				Respondent, Joshua Davey, was awarded a Promise Scholarship, and chose to attend Northwest College.  Northwest is a private, Christian college affiliated with the Assemblies of God denomination, and is an eligible institution under the Promise Scholarship Program.  Davey had planned for many years to attend a Bible college and to prepare [himself] through that college training for a lifetime of ministry, specifically as a church pastor.  App. 40.  To that end, when he enrolled in Northwest College, he decided to pursue a double major in pastoral ministries and business management/administration.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 43.  There is no dispute that the pastoral ministries degree is devotional and therefore excluded under the Promise Scholarship Program.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				At the beginning of the 19992000 academic year, Davey met with Northwests director of financial aid.  He learned for the first time at this meeting that he could not use his scholarship to pursue a devotional theology degree.  He was informed that to receive the funds appropriated for his use, he must certify in writing that he was not pursuing such a degree at Northwest.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/1983.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §1983</a> against various state officials (hereinafter State) in the District Court for the Western District of Washington to enjoin the State from refusing to award the scholarship solely because a student is pursuing a devotional theology degree, and for damages.  He argued the denial of his scholarship based on his decision to pursue a theology degree violated,

				, the Free Exercise, Establishment, and Free Speech Clauses of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>, as incorporated by the

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>.  After the District Court denied Daveys request for a preliminary injunction, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.  The District Court rejected Daveys constitutional claims and granted summary judgment in favor of the State.

				A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed.  299 F. 3d 748 (2002).  The court concluded that the State had singled out religion for unfavorable treatment and thus under our decision in

, the States exclusion of theology majors must be narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling state interest.  299 F. 3d, at 757758.  Finding that the States own antiestablishment concerns were not compelling, the court declared Washingtons Promise Scholarship Program unconstitutional.  
				<em>

				The Religion Clauses of the

            <em>

            </a>
				  We reject his claim of presumptive unconstitutionality, however; to do otherwise would extend the 
				<em>
					Lukumi
				</em>
				 line of cases well beyond not only their facts but their reasoning.  In 
				<em>
					Lukumi
				</em>
				, the city of Hialeah made it a crime to engage in certain kinds of animal slaughter.  We found that the law sought to suppress ritualistic animal sacrifices of the Santeria religion.  508 U. S., at 535.  In the present case, the States disfavor of religion (if it can be called that) is of a far milder kind.   It imposes neither criminal nor civil sanctions on any type of religious service or rite.  It does not deny to ministers the right to participate in the political affairs of the community.  See

				<span class="smallcaps">

				<em>
					ibid
				</em>
				.  But training for religious professions and training for secular professions are not fungible.  Training someone to lead a congregation is an essentially religious endeavor.  Indeed, majoring in devotional theology is akin to a religious calling as well as an academic pursuit.  See 
				<em>
					Calvary Bible Presbyterian Church

				<em>

				, 72 Wash. 2d 912, 919, 436 P. 2d 189, 193 (1967) (holding public funds may not be expended for that category of instruction that resembles worship and manifests a devotion to religion and religious principles in thought, feeling, belief, and conduct); App. 40 (Davey stating his religious beliefs [were] the only reason for [him] to seek a college degree).  And the subject of religion is one in which both the United States and state constitutions embody distinct viewsin favor of free exercise, but opposed to establishmentthat find no counterpart with respect to other callings or professions.  That a State would deal differently with religious education for the ministry than with education for other callings is a 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				product of these views, not evidence of hostility toward religion.

				Even though the differently worded Washington Constitution draws a more stringent line than that drawn by the United States Constitution, the interest it seeks to further is scarcely novel.  In fact, we can think of few areas in which a States antiestablishment interests come more into play.

				Without a presumption of unconstitutionality, Daveys claim must fail.  The States interest in not funding the pursuit of devotional degrees is substantial and the exclusion of such funding places a relatively minor burden on Promise Scholars.  If any room exists between the two Religion Clauses, it must be here.  We need not venture further into this difficult area in order to uphold the Promise Scholarship Program as currently operated by the State of Washington.

						 The relevant provision of the Washington Constitution, Art. I, §11, states:


Religious Freedom.  Absolute freedom of conscience in all matters of religious sentiment, belief and worship, shall be guaranteed to every individual, and no one shall be molested or disturbed in person or property on account of religion; but the liberty of conscience hereby secured shall not be so construed as to excuse acts of licentiousness or justify practices inconsistent with the peace and safety of the state.  No public money or property shall be appropriated for or applied to any religious worship, exercise or instruction, or the support of any religious establishment.

						 Davey, relying on Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/515/819" class="subref" title="subref">515 U. S. 819</a> (1995)
, contends that the Promise Scholarship Program is an unconstitutional viewpoint restriction on speech.  But the Promise Scholarship Program is not a forum for speech.  The purpose of the Promise Scholarship Program is to assist students from low- and middle-income families with the cost of postsecondary education, not to  encourage a diversity of views from private speakers.   United States v. American Library Assn., Inc.,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">206</a> (2003)
 (plurality opinion) (quoting Rosenberger, supra, at 834).  Our cases dealing with speech forums are simply inapplicable.  See American Library Assn., supra; Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense &amp; Ed. Fund, Inc.,

.


Davey also argues that the Equal Protection Clause protects against discrimination on the basis of religion.  Because we hold, infra, at ___, that the program is not a violation of the Free Exercise Clause, however, we apply rational-basis scrutiny to his equal protection claims.  Johnson v. Robison, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/415/361" class="subref" title="subref">415 U. S. 361</a>, n. 14 (1974); see also McDaniel v. Paty,

 (reviewing religious discrimination claim under the Free Exercise Clause).  For the reasons stated herein, the program passes such review.

						 Justice Scalia notes that the States philosophical preference to protect individual conscience is potentially without limit, see post, at 5; however, the only interest at issue here is the States interest in not funding the religious training of clergy.

In its stead, the Virginia Bill for Religious Liberty, which was originally written by Thomas Jefferson, was enacted.  This bill guaranteed that no man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place, or ministry whatsoever.  A Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom, reprinted in 2 Papers of Thomas Jefferson 546 (J.

						 The amici contend that Washingtons Constitution was born of religious bigotry because it contains a so-called Blaine Amendment, which has been linked with anti-Catholicism.  See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 23, n. 5; Brief for Becket Fund for Religious Liberty et al. as Amici Curiae; see also Mitchell v. Helms,

 (plurality opinion).  As the State notes and Davey does not dispute, however, the provision in question is not a Blaine Amendment.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 5; see Reply Brief for Petitioners 67.  The enabling Act of 1889, which authorized the drafting of the Washington Constitution, required the state constitution to include a provision for the establishment and maintenance of systems of public schools, which shall be … free from sectarian control.  Act of Feb. 22, 1889, ch. 180, §4, ¶Fourth, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">25</a>Stat.
676.  This provision was included in Article IX, §4, of the Washington Constitution (All schools maintained and supported wholly or in part by the public funds shall be forever free from sectarian control or influence), and is not at issue in this case.  Neither Davey nor amici have established a credible connection between the Blaine Amendment and Article I, §11, the relevant constitutional provision.  Accordingly, the Blaine Amendments history is simply not before us.

Seattle, 120 Wash. 2d 203, 223229, 840 P. 2d 174, 186188 (1992) (rejecting standard in Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v Smith,

				The State of Washington established the Promise Scholarship Program to assist academically gifted students with postsecondary education expenses.  In accordance with the State Constitution, students may not use the scholarship at an institution where they are pursuing a degree in devotional theology.  We hold that such an exclusion from an otherwise inclusive aid program does not violate the Free Exercise Clause of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Washington State Legislature found that [s]tudents who work hard … and successfully complete high school with high academic marks may not have the financial ability to attend college because they cannot obtain financial aid or the financial aid is insufficient.  Wash. Rev. Code §28B.119.005 (Supp. 2004).  In 1999, to assist these high-achieving students, the legislature created the Promise Scholarship Program, which provides a scholarship, renewable for one year, to eligible students for postsecondary education expenses.  Students may spend their funds on any education-related expense, including room and board.  The scholarships are funded through the States general fund, and their amount varies each year depending on the annual appropriation, which is evenly prorated among the eligible students.  Wash. Admin. Code §25080050(2) (2003).  The scholarship was worth $1,125 for academic year 19992000 and $1,542 for 20002001.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				To be eligible for the scholarship, a student must meet academic, income, and enrollment requirements.  A student must graduate from a Washington public or private high school and either graduate in the top 15% of his graduating class, or attain on the first attempt a cumulative score of 1,200 or better on the Scholastic Assessment Test I or a score of 27 or better on the American College Test. 
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				§§25080020(12)(a)(d).  The students family income must be less than 135% of the States median.  §25080020(12)(e).  Finally, the student must enroll at least half time in an eligible postsecondary institution in the state of Washington, and may not pursue a degree in theology at that institution while receiving the scholarship.  §§25080020(12)(f)(g); see also Wash. Rev. Code §28B.10.814 (1997) (No aid shall be awarded to any student who is pursuing a degree in theology).  Private institutions, including those religiously affiliated, qualify as eligible postsecondary institution[s] if they are accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting body.  See Wash. Admin. Code §25080020(13).  A degree in theology is not defined in the statute, but, as both parties concede, the statute simply codifies the States constitutional prohibition on providing funds to students to pursue degrees that are devotional in nature or designed to induce religious faith.  Brief for Petitioners 6; Brief for Respondent 8; see also Wash. Const., Art. I, §11.

				A student who applies for the scholarship and meets the academic and income requirements is notified that he is eligible for the scholarship if he meets the enrollment requirements.

Once the student enrolls at an eligible institution, the institution must certify that the student is enrolled at least half time and that the student is not pursuing a degree in devotional theology.

				Respondent, Joshua Davey, was awarded a Promise Scholarship, and chose to attend Northwest College.  Northwest is a private, Christian college affiliated with the Assemblies of God denomination, and is an eligible institution under the Promise Scholarship Program.  Davey had planned for many years to attend a Bible college and to prepare [himself] through that college training for a lifetime of ministry, specifically as a church pastor.  App. 40.  To that end, when he enrolled in Northwest College, he decided to pursue a double major in pastoral ministries and business management/administration.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 43.  There is no dispute that the pastoral ministries degree is devotional and therefore excluded under the Promise Scholarship Program.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				At the beginning of the 19992000 academic year, Davey met with Northwests director of financial aid.  He learned for the first time at this meeting that he could not use his scholarship to pursue a devotional theology degree.  He was informed that to receive the funds appropriated for his use, he must certify in writing that he was not pursuing such a degree at Northwest.

C. §1983</a> against various state officials (hereinafter State) in the District Court for the Western District of Washington to enjoin the State from refusing to award the scholarship solely because a student is pursuing a devotional theology degree, and for damages.  He argued the denial of his scholarship based on his decision to pursue a theology degree violated,

				, the Free Exercise, Establishment, and Free Speech Clauses of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>, as incorporated by the

, the States exclusion of theology majors must be narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling state interest.  299 F. 3d, at 757758.  Finding that the States own antiestablishment concerns were not compelling, the court declared Washingtons Promise Scholarship Program unconstitutional.

				  We reject his claim of presumptive unconstitutionality, however; to do otherwise would extend the

				</em>
				, the city of Hialeah made it a crime to engage in certain kinds of animal slaughter.  We found that the law sought to suppress ritualistic animal sacrifices of the Santeria religion.  508 U. S., at 535.  In the present case, the States disfavor of religion (if it can be called that) is of a far milder kind.   It imposes neither criminal nor civil sanctions on any type of religious service or rite.  It does not deny to ministers the right to participate in the political affairs of the community.  See

And the subject of religion is one in which both the United States and state constitutions embody distinct viewsin favor of free exercise, but opposed to establishmentthat find no counterpart with respect to other callings or professions.  That a State would deal differently with religious education for the ministry than with education for other callings is a

				Even though the differently worded Washington Constitution draws a more stringent line than that drawn by the United States Constitution, the interest it seeks to further is scarcely novel.  In fact, we can think of few areas in which a States antiestablishment interests come more into play.

				Without a presumption of unconstitutionality, Daveys claim must fail.

We need not venture further into this difficult area in order to uphold the Promise Scholarship Program as currently operated by the State of Washington.

, contends that the Promise Scholarship Program is an unconstitutional viewpoint restriction on speech.  But the Promise Scholarship Program is not a forum for speech.  The purpose of the Promise Scholarship Program is to assist students from low- and middle-income families with the cost of postsecondary education, not to  encourage a diversity of views from private speakers.   United States v.

Davey also argues that the Equal Protection Clause protects against discrimination on the basis of religion.  Because we hold, infra, at ___, that the program is not a violation of the Free Exercise Clause, however, we apply rational-basis scrutiny to his equal protection claims.  Johnson v. Robison,

The enabling Act of 1889, which authorized the drafting of the Washington Constitution, required the state constitution to include a provision for the establishment and maintenance of systems of public schools, which shall be … free from sectarian control.  Act of Feb. 22, 1889, ch. 180, §4, ¶Fourth, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">25</a>Stat.
676.  This provision was included in Article IX, §4, of the Washington Constitution (All schools maintained and supported wholly or in part by the public funds shall be forever free from sectarian control or influence), and is not at issue in this case.  Neither Davey nor amici have established a credible connection between the Blaine Amendment and Article I, §11, the relevant constitutional provision.  Accordingly, the Blaine Amendments history is simply not before us.

				The State of Washington established the Promise Scholarship Program to assist academically gifted students with postsecondary education expenses.  In accordance with the State Constitution, students may not use the scholarship at an institution where they are pursuing a degree in devotional theology.  We hold that such an exclusion from an otherwise inclusive aid program does not violate the Free Exercise Clause of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Washington State Legislature found that [s]tudents who work hard … and successfully complete high school with high academic marks may not have the financial ability to attend college because they cannot obtain financial aid or the financial aid is insufficient.  Wash. Rev. Code §28B.119.005 (Supp. 2004).  In 1999, to assist these high-achieving students, the legislature created the Promise Scholarship Program, which provides a scholarship, renewable for one year, to eligible students for postsecondary education expenses.  Students may spend their funds on any education-related expense, including room and board.  The scholarships are funded through the States general fund, and their amount varies each year depending on the annual appropriation, which is evenly prorated among the eligible students.  Wash. Admin. Code §25080050(2) (2003).  The scholarship was worth $1,125 for academic year 19992000 and $1,542 for 20002001.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				To be eligible for the scholarship, a student must meet academic, income, and enrollment requirements.  A student must graduate from a Washington public or private high school and either graduate in the top 15% of his graduating class, or attain on the first attempt a cumulative score of 1,200 or better on the Scholastic Assessment Test I or a score of 27 or better on the American College Test. 
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				§§25080020(12)(a)(d).  The students family income must be less than 135% of the States median.  §25080020(12)(e).  Finally, the student must enroll at least half time in an eligible postsecondary institution in the state of Washington, and may not pursue a degree in theology at that institution while receiving the scholarship.  §§25080020(12)(f)(g); see also Wash. Rev. Code §28B.10.814 (1997) (No aid shall be awarded to any student who is pursuing a degree in theology).  Private institutions, including those religiously affiliated, qualify as eligible postsecondary institution[s] if they are accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting body.  See Wash. Admin. Code §25080020(13).  A degree in theology is not defined in the statute, but, as both parties concede, the statute simply codifies the States constitutional prohibition on providing funds to students to pursue degrees that are devotional in nature or designed to induce religious faith.  Brief for Petitioners 6; Brief for Respondent 8; see also Wash. Const., Art. I, §11.

				A student who applies for the scholarship and meets the academic and income requirements is notified that he is eligible for the scholarship if he meets the enrollment requirements.  
				<em>

Once the student enrolls at an eligible institution, the institution must certify that the student is enrolled at least half time and that the student is not pursuing a degree in devotional theology.

				Respondent, Joshua Davey, was awarded a Promise Scholarship, and chose to attend Northwest College.  Northwest is a private, Christian college affiliated with the Assemblies of God denomination, and is an eligible institution under the Promise Scholarship Program.  Davey had planned for many years to attend a Bible college and to prepare [himself] through that college training for a lifetime of ministry, specifically as a church pastor.  App. 40.  To that end, when he enrolled in Northwest College, he decided to pursue a double major in pastoral ministries and business management/administration.

				At the beginning of the 19992000 academic year, Davey met with Northwests director of financial aid.  He learned for the first time at this meeting that he could not use his scholarship to pursue a devotional theology degree.  He was informed that to receive the funds appropriated for his use, he must certify in writing that he was not pursuing such a degree at Northwest.

And the subject of religion is one in which both the United States and state constitutions embody distinct viewsin favor of free exercise, but opposed to establishmentthat find no counterpart with respect to other callings or professions.  That a State would deal differently with religious education for the ministry than with education for other callings is a

, contends that the Promise Scholarship Program is an unconstitutional viewpoint restriction on speech.  But the Promise Scholarship Program is not a forum for speech.  The purpose of the Promise Scholarship Program is to assist students from low- and middle-income families with the cost of postsecondary education, not to  encourage a diversity of views from private speakers.   United States v. American Library Assn., Inc.,

Davey also argues that the Equal Protection Clause protects against discrimination on the basis of religion.  Because we hold, infra, at ___, that the program is not a violation of the Free Exercise Clause, however, we apply rational-basis scrutiny to his equal protection claims.  Johnson v. Robison,

The enabling Act of 1889, which authorized the drafting of the Washington Constitution, required the state constitution to include a provision for the establishment and maintenance of systems of public schools, which shall be … free from sectarian control.  Act of Feb. 22, 1889, ch. 180, §4, ¶Fourth,

676.  This provision was included in Article IX, §4, of the Washington Constitution (All schools maintained and supported wholly or in part by the public funds shall be forever free from sectarian control or influence), and is not at issue in this case.  Neither Davey nor amici have established a credible connection between the Blaine Amendment and Article I, §11, the relevant constitutional provision.  Accordingly, the Blaine Amendments history is simply not before us.

				The State of Washington established the Promise Scholarship Program to assist academically gifted students with postsecondary education expenses.  In accordance with the State Constitution, students may not use the scholarship at an institution where they are pursuing a degree in devotional theology.  We hold that such an exclusion from an otherwise inclusive aid program does not violate the Free Exercise Clause of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Washington State Legislature found that [s]tudents who work hard … and successfully complete high school with high academic marks may not have the financial ability to attend college because they cannot obtain financial aid or the financial aid is insufficient.  Wash. Rev. Code §28B.119.005 (Supp. 2004).  In 1999, to assist these high-achieving students, the legislature created the Promise Scholarship Program, which provides a scholarship, renewable for one year, to eligible students for postsecondary education expenses.  Students may spend their funds on any education-related expense, including room and board.  The scholarships are funded through the States general fund, and their amount varies each year depending on the annual appropriation, which is evenly prorated among the eligible students.  Wash. Admin. Code §25080050(2) (2003).  The scholarship was worth $1,125 for academic year 19992000 and $1,542 for 20002001.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				To be eligible for the scholarship, a student must meet academic, income, and enrollment requirements.  A student must graduate from a Washington public or private high school and either graduate in the top 15% of his graduating class, or attain on the first attempt a cumulative score of 1,200 or better on the Scholastic Assessment Test I or a score of 27 or better on the American College Test. 
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				§§25080020(12)(a)(d).  The students family income must be less than 135% of the States median.  §25080020(12)(e).  Finally, the student must enroll at least half time in an eligible postsecondary institution in the state of Washington, and may not pursue a degree in theology at that institution while receiving the scholarship.  §§25080020(12)(f)(g); see also Wash. Rev. Code §28B.10.814 (1997) (No aid shall be awarded to any student who is pursuing a degree in theology).  Private institutions, including those religiously affiliated, qualify as eligible postsecondary institution[s] if they are accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting body.  See Wash. Admin. Code §25080020(13).  A degree in theology is not defined in the statute, but, as both parties concede, the statute simply codifies the States constitutional prohibition on providing funds to students to pursue degrees that are devotional in nature or designed to induce religious faith.  Brief for Petitioners 6; Brief for Respondent 8; see also Wash. Const., Art. I, §11.

				A student who applies for the scholarship and meets the academic and income requirements is notified that he is eligible for the scholarship if he meets the enrollment requirements.

Once the student enrolls at an eligible institution, the institution must certify that the student is enrolled at least half time and that the student is not pursuing a degree in devotional theology.

				Respondent, Joshua Davey, was awarded a Promise Scholarship, and chose to attend Northwest College.  Northwest is a private, Christian college affiliated with the Assemblies of God denomination, and is an eligible institution under the Promise Scholarship Program.  Davey had planned for many years to attend a Bible college and to prepare [himself] through that college training for a lifetime of ministry, specifically as a church pastor.  App. 40.  To that end, when he enrolled in Northwest College, he decided to pursue a double major in pastoral ministries and business management/administration.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 43.  There is no dispute that the pastoral ministries degree is devotional and therefore excluded under the Promise Scholarship Program.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				At the beginning of the 19992000 academic year, Davey met with Northwests director of financial aid.  He learned for the first time at this meeting that he could not use his scholarship to pursue a devotional theology degree.  He was informed that to receive the funds appropriated for his use, he must certify in writing that he was not pursuing such a degree at Northwest.

He argued the denial of his scholarship based on his decision to pursue a theology degree violated,

, the States exclusion of theology majors must be narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling state interest.  299 F. 3d, at 757758.  Finding that the States own antiestablishment concerns were not compelling, the court declared Washingtons Promise Scholarship Program unconstitutional.

				, the city of Hialeah made it a crime to engage in certain kinds of animal slaughter.  We found that the law sought to suppress ritualistic animal sacrifices of the Santeria religion.  508 U. S., at 535.  In the present case, the States disfavor of religion (if it can be called that) is of a far milder kind.   It imposes neither criminal nor civil sanctions on any type of religious service or rite.  It does not deny to ministers the right to participate in the political affairs of the community.  See

And the subject of religion is one in which both the United States and state constitutions embody distinct viewsin favor of free exercise, but opposed to establishmentthat find no counterpart with respect to other callings or professions.  That a State would deal differently with religious education for the ministry than with education for other callings is a

				Without a presumption of unconstitutionality, Daveys claim must fail.

We need not venture further into this difficult area in order to uphold the Promise Scholarship Program as currently operated by the State of Washington.

, contends that the Promise Scholarship Program is an unconstitutional viewpoint restriction on speech.  But the Promise Scholarship Program is not a forum for speech.  The purpose of the Promise Scholarship Program is to assist students from low- and middle-income families with the cost of postsecondary education, not to  encourage a diversity of views from private speakers.   United States v. American Library Assn., Inc.,

Davey also argues that the Equal Protection Clause protects against discrimination on the basis of religion.  Because we hold, infra, at ___, that the program is not a violation of the Free Exercise Clause, however, we apply rational-basis scrutiny to his equal protection claims.  Johnson v. Robison,

						 Justice Scalia notes that the States philosophical preference to protect individual conscience is potentially without limit, see post, at 5; however, the only interest at issue here is the States interest in not funding the religious training of clergy.

						 The amici contend that Washingtons Constitution was born of religious bigotry because it contains a so-called Blaine Amendment, which has been linked with anti-Catholicism.

The enabling Act of 1889, which authorized the drafting of the Washington Constitution, required the state constitution to include a provision for the establishment and maintenance of systems of public schools, which shall be … free from sectarian control.  Act of Feb. 22, 1889, ch. 180, §4, ¶Fourth, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">25</a>Stat.
676.  This provision was included in Article IX, §4, of the Washington Constitution (All schools maintained and supported wholly or in part by the public funds shall be forever free from sectarian control or influence), and is not at issue in this case.  Neither Davey nor amici have established a credible connection between the Blaine Amendment and Article I, §11, the relevant constitutional provision.  Accordingly, the Blaine Amendments history is simply not before us.

				The State of Washington established the Promise Scholarship Program to assist academically gifted students with postsecondary education expenses.  In accordance with the State Constitution, students may not use the scholarship at an institution where they are pursuing a degree in devotional theology.  We hold that such an exclusion from an otherwise inclusive aid program does not violate the Free Exercise Clause of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Washington State Legislature found that [s]tudents who work hard … and successfully complete high school with high academic marks may not have the financial ability to attend college because they cannot obtain financial aid or the financial aid is insufficient.  Wash. Rev. Code §28B.119.005 (Supp. 2004).  In 1999, to assist these high-achieving students, the legislature created the Promise Scholarship Program, which provides a scholarship, renewable for one year, to eligible students for postsecondary education expenses.  Students may spend their funds on any education-related expense, including room and board.  The scholarships are funded through the States general fund, and their amount varies each year depending on the annual appropriation, which is evenly prorated among the eligible students.  Wash. Admin. Code §25080050(2) (2003).  The scholarship was worth $1,125 for academic year 19992000 and $1,542 for 20002001.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				To be eligible for the scholarship, a student must meet academic, income, and enrollment requirements.  A student must graduate from a Washington public or private high school and either graduate in the top 15% of his graduating class, or attain on the first attempt a cumulative score of 1,200 or better on the Scholastic Assessment Test I or a score of 27 or better on the American College Test. 
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				§§25080020(12)(a)(d).  The students family income must be less than 135% of the States median.  §25080020(12)(e).  Finally, the student must enroll at least half time in an eligible postsecondary institution in the state of Washington, and may not pursue a degree in theology at that institution while receiving the scholarship.  §§25080020(12)(f)(g); see also Wash. Rev. Code §28B.10.814 (1997) (No aid shall be awarded to any student who is pursuing a degree in theology).  Private institutions, including those religiously affiliated, qualify as eligible postsecondary institution[s] if they are accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting body.  See Wash. Admin. Code §25080020(13).  A degree in theology is not defined in the statute, but, as both parties concede, the statute simply codifies the States constitutional prohibition on providing funds to students to pursue degrees that are devotional in nature or designed to induce religious faith.  Brief for Petitioners 6; Brief for Respondent 8; see also Wash. Const., Art. I, §11.

				A student who applies for the scholarship and meets the academic and income requirements is notified that he is eligible for the scholarship if he meets the enrollment requirements.

Once the student enrolls at an eligible institution, the institution must certify that the student is enrolled at least half time and that the student is not pursuing a degree in devotional theology.

				Respondent, Joshua Davey, was awarded a Promise Scholarship, and chose to attend Northwest College.  Northwest is a private, Christian college affiliated with the Assemblies of God denomination, and is an eligible institution under the Promise Scholarship Program.  Davey had planned for many years to attend a Bible college and to prepare [himself] through that college training for a lifetime of ministry, specifically as a church pastor.  App. 40.  To that end, when he enrolled in Northwest College, he decided to pursue a double major in pastoral ministries and business management/administration.

				At the beginning of the 19992000 academic year, Davey met with Northwests director of financial aid.  He learned for the first time at this meeting that he could not use his scholarship to pursue a devotional theology degree.  He was informed that to receive the funds appropriated for his use, he must certify in writing that he was not pursuing such a degree at Northwest.

He argued the denial of his scholarship based on his decision to pursue a theology degree violated,

And the subject of religion is one in which both the United States and state constitutions embody distinct viewsin favor of free exercise, but opposed to establishmentthat find no counterpart with respect to other callings or professions.  That a State would deal differently with religious education for the ministry than with education for other callings is a

We need not venture further into this difficult area in order to uphold the Promise Scholarship Program as currently operated by the State of Washington.

, contends that the Promise Scholarship Program is an unconstitutional viewpoint restriction on speech.  But the Promise Scholarship Program is not a forum for speech.  The purpose of the Promise Scholarship Program is to assist students from low- and middle-income families with the cost of postsecondary education, not to  encourage a diversity of views from private speakers.   United States v. American Library Assn., Inc.,

Davey also argues that the Equal Protection Clause protects against discrimination on the basis of religion.  Because we hold, infra, at ___, that the program is not a violation of the Free Exercise Clause, however, we apply rational-basis scrutiny to his equal protection claims.  Johnson v. Robison,

						 The amici contend that Washingtons Constitution was born of religious bigotry because it contains a so-called Blaine Amendment, which has been linked with anti-Catholicism.

The enabling Act of 1889, which authorized the drafting of the Washington Constitution, required the state constitution to include a provision for the establishment and maintenance of systems of public schools, which shall be … free from sectarian control.  Act of Feb. 22, 1889, ch. 180, §4, ¶Fourth, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">25</a>Stat.
676.  This provision was included in Article IX, §4, of the Washington Constitution (All schools maintained and supported wholly or in part by the public funds shall be forever free from sectarian control or influence), and is not at issue in this case.  Neither Davey nor amici have established a credible connection between the Blaine Amendment and Article I, §11, the relevant constitutional provision.  Accordingly, the Blaine Amendments history is simply not before us.

        <p class="bodytext">
				Petitioner Textron Lycoming Reciprocating Engine Division (Textron) and respondentsan international union and one of its locals (hereinafter Union), which represented approximately 500 Textron employeeswere parties to a collective-bargaining agreement that prohibited the Union from striking for any reason and required Textron to notify the Union before entering into any agreement to subcontract out work that would otherwise be performed by Union members.  After Textron announced plans to subcontract out enough work to cause roughly one-half of the Union members to lose their jobs, the Union filed the present complaint, which, 
				<em>
					inter alia
				</em>
				, alleged that Textron had fraudulently induced the Union to sign the collective-bargaining agreement, and sought damages and a declaratory judgment that the agreement was voidable at the Unions option.  The complaint invoked §301(a) of the Labor Management Relations Act as the basis of federal subject-matter jurisdiction, but did not allege that either party had ever violated the terms of the collective-bargaining agreement.  The District Court dismissed the complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, concluding that the cause of action alleged did not come within §301(a).  The Third Circuit reversed.
			</p>
        <p class="SYLCTE">
            <em>
					Held:
				</em>
				 Because the Unions complaint alleges no violation of the collective-bargaining agreement, neither this Court nor the federal courts below have subject-matter jurisdiction under §301(a), which confers jurisdiction only over [s]uits for violation of contracts.  While a federal court may, in the course of resolving a dispute concerning alleged violation of a collective-bargaining agreement, adjudicate the affirmative defense that the contract was invalid, see 
				<em>
					Kaiser Steel Corp.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Mullins,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/455/72" class="subref" title="subref">455 U. S. 72</a>, it has no jurisdiction to resolve such a contention independently of, rather than ancillary to, its power to adjudicate [s]uits for violation of contracts.  Here, since the Union neither alleges that Textron has violated the contract, nor seeks declaratory relief from its own alleged violation, §301(a) jurisdiction does not lie.  The Unions reliance upon the fact that it seeks a declaration of voidability under the federal Declaratory Judgment Act rests on several less than certain assumptions,

S. 667</a>, distinguished, but is in any event inadequate because there is no indication that either party has any interest in the contracts voidability, and hence no case or controversy on this issue giving the Union access to federal courts.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/518/651" class="subref" title="subref">518 U. S. 651</a>, ___ (1996); §2244(b).  An individual seeking to file a second or successive application must move in the appropriate court of appeals for an order directing the district court to consider his application.  §2244(b)(3)(A).  The court of appeals then has 30 days to decide whether to grant the authorization to file.  §2244(b)(3)(D).  A court of appeals decision whether to grant authorization to file a second or successive application shall not be appealable and shall not be the subject of a petition for rehearing or for a writ of certiorari.  §2244(b)(3)(E).  
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				If the Court of Appeals in this case had granted respondent leave to file a second or successive application, then we would be without jurisdiction to consider the States petition and would have to dismiss the writ.  This is not, however, what the Court of Appeals did.  The Court of Appeals held that the §2244(b) restrictions simply do not apply to respondents 
				<em>
					Ford
				</em>
				 claim, and that there was accordingly no need for him to apply for authorization to file a second or successive petition.  We conclude today that the Court of Appeals reached the correct result in this case, and that we therefore have jurisdiction to consider the States petition.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Section 2244(b) provides:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				(b)(1) A claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application under section 2254 that was presented in a prior application shall be dismissed.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				(2) A claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application under section 2254 that was not presented in a prior application shall be dismissed unless
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

  
				    
				
				    
				(A) the applicant shows that the claim relies on a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable;  or

        <p class="bodytext">
				

  
				    
				
				    
				(B)(i) the factual predicate for the claim could not have been discovered previously through the exercise of due diligence;  and

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				
				    
				
				    
				(ii) the facts underlying the claim, if proven and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that, but for constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
If respondents current request for relief is a second or successive application, then it plainly should have been dismissed.  The 
				<em>
					Ford
				</em>
				 claim had previously been presented in the 1993 petition, and would therefore be subject to dismissal under (b)(1)(A).  Even if we were to consider the 
				<em>
					Ford
				</em>
				 claim to be newly presented in the 1997 petition, it does not fit within either of (b)(2)(B)s exceptions, and dismissal would still be required. 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The State contends that because respondent has already had one fully-litigated habeas petition, the plain meaning of §2244(b) as amended requires his new petition to be treated as successive.  Brief for Petitioner 12.  Under that reading of the statute, respondent is entitled to only one merits judgment on his federal habeas claims.  Because respondent has already presented a petition to the District Court, and the District Court and the Court of Appeals have acted on that petition, §2244(b) must apply to any subsequent request for federal habeas relief.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				But the only claim on which respondent now seeks relief is the 
				<em>
					Ford
				</em>
				 claim that he presented to the District Court, along with a series of other claims, in 1993.  The District Court, acting for the first time on the merits of any of respondents claims for federal habeas relief, dismissed the 
				<em>
					Ford
				</em>
				 claim as premature, but resolved all of respondents other claims, granting relief on one.  The Court of Appeals subsequently reversed the District Courts grant of relief.  At that point it became clear that respondent would have no federal habeas relief for his conviction or his death sentence, and the Arizona Supreme Court issued a warrant for his execution.  His claim then unquestionably ripe, respondent moved in the state courts for a determination of his competency to be executed.  Those courts concluded that he was competent, and respondent moved in the federal district court for review of the state courts determination.  
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				This may have been the second time that respondent had asked the federal courts to provide relief on his 
				<em>
					Ford
				</em>
				 claim, but this does not mean that there were two separate applications, the second of which was necessarily subject to §2244(b).  There was only one application for habeas relief, and the District Court ruled (or should have ruled) on each claim at the time it became ripe.  Respondent was entitled to an adjudication of all of the claims presented in his earlier, undoubtedly reviewable, application for federal habeas relief.  The Court of Appeals was therefore correct in holding that respondent was not required to get authorization to file a second or successive application before his 
				<em>
					Ford
				</em>
				 claim could be heard.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				If the States interpretation of second or successive were correct, the implications for habeas practice would be far-reaching and seemingly perverse.  In 
				<em>
					Picard
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Connor
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/404/270" class="subref" title="subref">404 U. S. 270</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">275</a> (1971)

        <p class="bodytext">
				It has been settled since 
				<em>
					Ex Parte Royall

				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/117/241" class="subref" title="subref">117 U. S. 241</a> (1886)
, that a state prisoner must normally exhaust available state judicial remedies before a federal court will entertain his petition for 
				<em>
					habeas
				</em>
            <em>
					corpus

				. . . .  The exhaustion-of-state-remedies doctrine, now codified in the federal habeas statute, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2254.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §§2254(b)</a> and (c), reflects a policy of federalstate comity. . . .  It follows, of course, that once the federal claim has been fairly presented to the state courts, the exhaustion requirement is satisfied.

Later, in 
				<em>
					Rose

				 v. 
				<em>
					Lundy
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/455/509" class="subref" title="subref">455 U. S. 509</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">522</a> (1982)
, we went further and held that a district court must dismiss habeas petitions containing both unexhausted and exhausted claims.  But none of our cases expounding this doctrine have ever suggested that a prisoner whose habeas petition was dismissed for failure to exhaust state remedies, and who then did exhaust those remedies and returned to federal court, was by such action filing a successive petition.  A court where such a petition was filed could adjudicate these claims under the same standard as would govern those made in any other first petition.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We believe that respondents 
				<em>
					Ford
				</em>
				 claim herepreviously dismissed as prematureshould be treated in the same manner as the claim of a petitioner who returns to a federal habeas court after exhausting state remedies.  True, the cases are not identical; respondents 
				<em>
					Ford
				</em>
				 claim was dismissed as premature, not because he had not exhausted state remedies, but because his execution was not imminent and therefore his competency to be executed could not be determined at that time.  But in both situations, the habeas petitioner does not receive an adjudication of his claim.  To hold otherwise would mean that a dismissal of a first habeas petition for technical procedural reasons would bar the prisoner from ever obtaining federal habeas review.  See,

				<em>

				The State places great reliance on our decision in 
				<em>
					Felker
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Turpin
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/518/651" class="subref" title="subref">518 U. S. 651</a> (1996)
, but we think that reliance is misplaced.  In 
				<em>
					Felker
				</em>
				 we stated that the new restrictions on successive petitions constitute a modified res judicata rule, a restraint on what used to be called in habeas corpus practice abuse of the writ.   518 U. S., at 664.  It is certain that respondents 
				<em>
					Ford
				</em>
				 claim would not be barred under any form of res judicata.  Respondent brought his claim in a timely fashion, and it has not been ripe for resolution until now.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Thus, respondents 
				<em>
					Ford
				</em>
				 claim was not a second or successive petition under §2244(b) and we have jurisdiction to review the judgment of the Court of Appeals on the States petition for certiorari.  But for the same reasons that we find we have jurisdiction, we hold that the Court of Appeals was correct in deciding that respondent was entitled to a hearing on the merits of his 
				<em>

				In March 1993 respondent filed a fourth habeas petition in federal court.  In addition to raising other claims, respondent also asserted that he was incompetent to be executed.  Counsel for the State urged the District Court to dismiss respondents 
				<em>
					Ford
				</em>
				 claim as premature.  The court did so but granted the writ on other grounds.  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the District Courts granting of the writ but explained that its instruction to enter judgment denying the petition was not intended to affect any later litigation of the

				On remand to the District Court, respondent, fearing that the newly enacted Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) might foreclose review of his 
				<em>
					Ford
				</em>
				 claim, moved the court to reopen his earlier petition.  In March 1997 the District Court denied the motion and reassured respondent that it had  no intention of treating the [

The Arizona Supreme Court rejected his appeal of that decision.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Respondent then moved in the Federal District Court to reopen his

The District Court agreed with petitioner, ruling on May 16, 1997, that it did not have jurisdiction over the claim.  Respondent then moved in the Court of Appeals for permission to file a successive habeas corpus application.  §2244(b)(3).

				The Court of Appeals stayed respondents execution so that it could consider his request.

An individual seeking to file a second or successive application must move in the appropriate court of appeals for an order directing the district court to consider his application.  §2244(b)(3)(A).  The court of appeals then has 30 days to decide whether to grant the authorization to file.  §2244(b)(3)(D).  A court of appeals decision whether to grant authorization to file a second or successive application shall not be appealable and shall not be the subject of a petition for rehearing or for a writ of certiorari.  §2244(b)(3)(E).

				On remand to the District Court, respondent, fearing that the newly enacted Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) might foreclose review of his

				Before reaching the question presented, however, we must first decide whether we have jurisdiction over this case.  In AEDPA, Congress established a gatekeeping mechanism for the consideration of second or successive habeas corpus applications in the federal courts.   
				<em>
					Felker 
				</em>
				v
				<em>
					. Turpin
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/518/651" class="subref" title="subref">518 U. S. 651</a>, ___ (1996); §2244(b).  An individual seeking to file a second or successive application must move in the appropriate court of appeals for an order directing the district court to consider his application.  §2244(b)(3)(A).  The court of appeals then has 30 days to decide whether to grant the authorization to file.  §2244(b)(3)(D).  A court of appeals decision whether to grant authorization to file a second or successive application shall not be appealable and shall not be the subject of a petition for rehearing or for a writ of certiorari.  §2244(b)(3)(E).  
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				If the Court of Appeals in this case had granted respondent leave to file a second or successive application, then we would be without jurisdiction to consider the States petition and would have to dismiss the writ.  This is not, however, what the Court of Appeals did.  The Court of Appeals held that the §2244(b) restrictions simply do not apply to respondents 
				<em>
					Ford
				</em>
				 claim, and that there was accordingly no need for him to apply for authorization to file a second or successive petition.  We conclude today that the Court of Appeals reached the correct result in this case, and that we therefore have jurisdiction to consider the States petition.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Section 2244(b) provides:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				(b)(1) A claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application under section 2254 that was presented in a prior application shall be dismissed.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				(2) A claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application under section 2254 that was not presented in a prior application shall be dismissed unless
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">

        <p class="bodytext">
				

  
				    
				
				    
				(B)(i) the factual predicate for the claim could not have been discovered previously through the exercise of due diligence;  and

				(ii) the facts underlying the claim, if proven and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that, but for constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
If respondents current request for relief is a second or successive application, then it plainly should have been dismissed.  The 
				<em>
					Ford
				</em>
				 claim had previously been presented in the 1993 petition, and would therefore be subject to dismissal under (b)(1)(A).  Even if we were to consider the 
				<em>
					Ford
				</em>
				 claim to be newly presented in the 1997 petition, it does not fit within either of (b)(2)(B)s exceptions, and dismissal would still be required. 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The State contends that because respondent has already had one fully-litigated habeas petition, the plain meaning of §2244(b) as amended requires his new petition to be treated as successive.  Brief for Petitioner 12.  Under that reading of the statute, respondent is entitled to only one merits judgment on his federal habeas claims.  Because respondent has already presented a petition to the District Court, and the District Court and the Court of Appeals have acted on that petition, §2244(b) must apply to any subsequent request for federal habeas relief.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				But the only claim on which respondent now seeks relief is the 
				<em>
					Ford
				</em>
				 claim that he presented to the District Court, along with a series of other claims, in 1993.  The District Court, acting for the first time on the merits of any of respondents claims for federal habeas relief, dismissed the 
				<em>
					Ford
				</em>
				 claim as premature, but resolved all of respondents other claims, granting relief on one.  The Court of Appeals subsequently reversed the District Courts grant of relief.  At that point it became clear that respondent would have no federal habeas relief for his conviction or his death sentence, and the Arizona Supreme Court issued a warrant for his execution.  His claim then unquestionably ripe, respondent moved in the state courts for a determination of his competency to be executed.  Those courts concluded that he was competent, and respondent moved in the federal district court for review of the state courts determination.  
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				This may have been the second time that respondent had asked the federal courts to provide relief on his 
				<em>
					Ford
				</em>
				 claim, but this does not mean that there were two separate applications, the second of which was necessarily subject to §2244(b).  There was only one application for habeas relief, and the District Court ruled (or should have ruled) on each claim at the time it became ripe.  Respondent was entitled to an adjudication of all of the claims presented in his earlier, undoubtedly reviewable, application for federal habeas relief.  The Court of Appeals was therefore correct in holding that respondent was not required to get authorization to file a second or successive application before his 
				<em>
					Ford
				</em>
				 claim could be heard.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				If the States interpretation of second or successive were correct, the implications for habeas practice would be far-reaching and seemingly perverse.  In 
				<em>
					Picard
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Connor
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/404/270" class="subref" title="subref">404 U. S. 270</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">275</a> (1971)

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/117/241" class="subref" title="subref">117 U. S. 241</a> (1886)

				<em>
					habeas

            <em>

				. . . .  The exhaustion-of-state-remedies doctrine, now codified in the federal habeas statute,

It follows, of course, that once the federal claim has been fairly presented to the state courts, the exhaustion requirement is satisfied.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
Later, in 
				<em>

				 v. 
				<em>
					Lundy
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/455/509" class="subref" title="subref">455 U. S. 509</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">522</a> (1982)
, we went further and held that a district court must dismiss habeas petitions containing both unexhausted and exhausted claims.  But none of our cases expounding this doctrine have ever suggested that a prisoner whose habeas petition was dismissed for failure to exhaust state remedies, and who then did exhaust those remedies and returned to federal court, was by such action filing a successive petition.  A court where such a petition was filed could adjudicate these claims under the same standard as would govern those made in any other first petition.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We believe that respondents 
				<em>
					Ford
				</em>
				 claim herepreviously dismissed as prematureshould be treated in the same manner as the claim of a petitioner who returns to a federal habeas court after exhausting state remedies.  True, the cases are not identical; respondents 
				<em>
					Ford
				</em>
				 claim was dismissed as premature, not because he had not exhausted state remedies, but because his execution was not imminent and therefore his competency to be executed could not be determined at that time.  But in both situations, the habeas petitioner does not receive an adjudication of his claim.  To hold otherwise would mean that a dismissal of a first habeas petition for technical procedural reasons would bar the prisoner from ever obtaining federal habeas review.  See,

				The Court of Appeals stayed respondents execution so that it could consider his request.  It later held that §2244(b) did not apply to a petition that raises only a competency to be executed claim and that respondent did not, therefore, need authorization to file the petition in the District Court.  It accordingly transferred the petition that had been presented to a member of that court back to the District Court.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/518/651" class="subref" title="subref">518 U. S. 651</a>, ___ (1996); §2244(b).  An individual seeking to file a second or successive application must move in the appropriate court of appeals for an order directing the district court to consider his application.  §2244(b)(3)(A).  The court of appeals then has 30 days to decide whether to grant the authorization to file.  §2244(b)(3)(D).  A court of appeals decision whether to grant authorization to file a second or successive application shall not be appealable and shall not be the subject of a petition for rehearing or for a writ of certiorari.  §2244(b)(3)(E).  
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				If the Court of Appeals in this case had granted respondent leave to file a second or successive application, then we would be without jurisdiction to consider the States petition and would have to dismiss the writ.  This is not, however, what the Court of Appeals did.  The Court of Appeals held that the §2244(b) restrictions simply do not apply to respondents 
				<em>
					Ford
				</em>
				 claim, and that there was accordingly no need for him to apply for authorization to file a second or successive petition.  We conclude today that the Court of Appeals reached the correct result in this case, and that we therefore have jurisdiction to consider the States petition.

				Section 2244(b) provides:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				(b)(1) A claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application under section 2254 that was presented in a prior application shall be dismissed.
			</p>

				(2) A claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application under section 2254 that was not presented in a prior application shall be dismissed unless

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
If respondents current request for relief is a second or successive application, then it plainly should have been dismissed.  The 
				<em>
					Ford
				</em>
				 claim had previously been presented in the 1993 petition, and would therefore be subject to dismissal under (b)(1)(A).  Even if we were to consider the 
				<em>
					Ford
				</em>
				 claim to be newly presented in the 1997 petition, it does not fit within either of (b)(2)(B)s exceptions, and dismissal would still be required. 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The State contends that because respondent has already had one fully-litigated habeas petition, the plain meaning of §2244(b) as amended requires his new petition to be treated as successive.  Brief for Petitioner 12.  Under that reading of the statute, respondent is entitled to only one merits judgment on his federal habeas claims.  Because respondent has already presented a petition to the District Court, and the District Court and the Court of Appeals have acted on that petition, §2244(b) must apply to any subsequent request for federal habeas relief.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				But the only claim on which respondent now seeks relief is the 
				<em>
					Ford
				</em>
				 claim that he presented to the District Court, along with a series of other claims, in 1993.  The District Court, acting for the first time on the merits of any of respondents claims for federal habeas relief, dismissed the 
				<em>
					Ford
				</em>
				 claim as premature, but resolved all of respondents other claims, granting relief on one.  The Court of Appeals subsequently reversed the District Courts grant of relief.  At that point it became clear that respondent would have no federal habeas relief for his conviction or his death sentence, and the Arizona Supreme Court issued a warrant for his execution.  His claim then unquestionably ripe, respondent moved in the state courts for a determination of his competency to be executed.  Those courts concluded that he was competent, and respondent moved in the federal district court for review of the state courts determination.  
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				This may have been the second time that respondent had asked the federal courts to provide relief on his 
				<em>
					Ford
				</em>
				 claim, but this does not mean that there were two separate applications, the second of which was necessarily subject to §2244(b).  There was only one application for habeas relief, and the District Court ruled (or should have ruled) on each claim at the time it became ripe.  Respondent was entitled to an adjudication of all of the claims presented in his earlier, undoubtedly reviewable, application for federal habeas relief.  The Court of Appeals was therefore correct in holding that respondent was not required to get authorization to file a second or successive application before his 
				<em>
					Ford
				</em>
				 claim could be heard.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				If the States interpretation of second or successive were correct, the implications for habeas practice would be far-reaching and seemingly perverse.  In

				<em>
					Connor

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/117/241" class="subref" title="subref">117 U. S. 241</a> (1886)

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">522</a> (1982)
, we went further and held that a district court must dismiss habeas petitions containing both unexhausted and exhausted claims.  But none of our cases expounding this doctrine have ever suggested that a prisoner whose habeas petition was dismissed for failure to exhaust state remedies, and who then did exhaust those remedies and returned to federal court, was by such action filing a successive petition.  A court where such a petition was filed could adjudicate these claims under the same standard as would govern those made in any other first petition.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We believe that respondents 
				<em>
					Ford
				</em>
				 claim herepreviously dismissed as prematureshould be treated in the same manner as the claim of a petitioner who returns to a federal habeas court after exhausting state remedies.  True, the cases are not identical; respondents 
				<em>
					Ford
				</em>
				 claim was dismissed as premature, not because he had not exhausted state remedies, but because his execution was not imminent and therefore his competency to be executed could not be determined at that time.  But in both situations, the habeas petitioner does not receive an adjudication of his claim.  To hold otherwise would mean that a dismissal of a first habeas petition for technical procedural reasons would bar the prisoner from ever obtaining federal habeas review.  See,

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/518/651" class="subref" title="subref">518 U. S. 651</a> (1996)

				<em>
					Felker
				</em>
				 we stated that the new restrictions on successive petitions constitute a modified res judicata rule, a restraint on what used to be called in habeas corpus practice abuse of the writ.   518 U. S., at 664.  It is certain that respondents

				 claim would not be barred under any form of res judicata.  Respondent brought his claim in a timely fashion, and it has not been ripe for resolution until now.

				Respondent received a full hearing on his competency-to-be-executed claim in state court.  The state court appointed experts and held a 4-day evidentiary hearing, after which it found respondent aware that he is to be punished for the crime of murder and … aware that the impending punishment for that crime is death … .  App. 172.  Respondent appealed this determination to the Supreme Court of Arizona, which accepted jurisdiction and denied relief.  He sought certiorari of that denial in this Court, which also denied relief.  To say that it is perverse to deny respondent a second round of time-consuming lower-federal-court review of his conviction and sentencebecause that means forgoing lower-federal-court review of a competency-to-be-executed claim that arises only after he has already sought federal habeas on other issuesis to say that state-court determinations must always be reviewable, not merely by this Court, but by federal district courts.  That is indeed the principle that this Courts imaginative habeas-corpus jurisprudence had established, but it is not a principle of natural law.  Lest we forget, Congress did not even have to create inferior federal courts, U. S. Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 9; Art. III, §1, let alone invest them with plenary habeas jurisdiction over state convictions.  And for much of our history, as

				It is axiomatic that the power to award the writ [of habeas corpus] by any of the courts of the United States, must be given by written law.  
				<em>
					Ex parte Bollman,
				</em>
				 4 Cranch 75, 94 (1807) (Marshall, C. J.).  And it is impossible to conceive of language that more clearly precludes respondents renewed competency-to-be-executed claim than the written law before us here: a claim 
				<em>
					presented
				</em>
				 in a second or successive habeas corpus application … that was 
				<em>
					presented
				</em>
				 in a prior application shall be dismissed.  
28 U. S. C. A. §2244(b)(1) (Supp. 1997) (emphasis added).  The Court today flouts the unmistakable language of the statute to avoid what it calls a perverse result.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 6.  There is nothing perverse about the result that the statute commands, except that it contradicts pre-existing judge-made law, which it was precisely the purpose of the statute to change.

				Respondent received a full hearing on his competency-to-be-executed claim in state court.  The state court appointed experts and held a 4-day evidentiary hearing, after which it found respondent aware that he is to be punished for the crime of murder and … aware that the impending punishment for that crime is death … .  App. 172.  Respondent appealed this determination to the Supreme Court of Arizona, which accepted jurisdiction and denied relief.  He sought certiorari of that denial in this Court, which also denied relief.  To say that it is perverse to deny respondent a second round of time-consuming lower-federal-court review of his conviction and sentencebecause that means forgoing lower-federal-court review of a competency-to-be-executed claim that arises only after he has already sought federal habeas on other issuesis to say that state-court determinations must always be reviewable, not merely by this Court, but by federal district courts.  That is indeed the principle that this Courts imaginative habeas-corpus jurisprudence had established, but it is not a principle of natural law.  Lest we forget, Congress did not even have to create inferior federal courts, U. S. Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 9; Art. III, §1, let alone invest them with plenary habeas jurisdiction over state convictions.  And for much of our history, as

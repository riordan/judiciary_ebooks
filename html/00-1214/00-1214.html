				Defendant-respondent Shelton represented himself in an Alabama Circuit Court criminal trial.  The court repeatedly warned Shelton about the problems self-representation entailed, but at no time offered him assistance of counsel at state expense.  He was convicted of misdemeanor assault and sentenced to a 30-day jail term, which the trial court immediately suspended, placing Shelton on two years unsupervised probation.  The Alabama Supreme Court reversed Sheltons suspended jail sentence, reasoning that this Courts decisions in

				(1) The 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> does not permit activation of a suspended sentence upon an indigent defendants violation of the terms of his probation where the State did not provide him counsel during the prosecution of the offense for which he is imprisoned.  A suspended sentence is a prison term imposed for the offense of conviction.  Once the prison term is triggered, the defendant is incarcerated not for the probation violation, but for the underlying offense.  The uncounseled conviction at that point result[s] in imprisonment,

				<em>

				<em>
					Argersinger
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Scott
				</em>
				, does not allow.  P. 6.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				
				    
				(2) The Court rejects the first of two grounds on which 
				<em>
					amicus
				</em>
				 resists this reasoning, 
				<em>
					i.e.,
				</em>
            <em>
					amicus
				</em>
				 attempt to align this case with 
				<em>
					Nichols
				</em>
				 and with 
				<em>
					Gagnon
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Scarpelli,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/411/778" class="subref" title="subref">411 U. S. 778</a>.  Those decisions do not stand for the broad proposition that sequential proceedings must be analyzed separately for 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> purposes, with the right to state-appointed counsel triggered only in proceedings that result in 
				<em>
					immediate
				</em>
				 actual imprisonment.  The dispositive factor in 
				<em>
					Gagnon
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Nichols
				</em>
				 was not whether incarceration occurred immediately or only after some delay.  Rather, the critical point was that the defendant had a recognized right to counsel when adjudicated guilty of the felony for which he was imprisoned.  See 
				<em>
					Nichols
				</em>
				, 511 U. S., at 743, n. 9.  Here, revocation of probation would trigger a prison term imposed for a misdemeanor of which Shelton was found guilty without the aid of counsel, not for a felony conviction for which the right to counsel is unquestioned.  See 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 747; 
				<em>
					Gagnon
				</em>
				, 411 U. S, at 789.  Far from supporting 
				<em>
					amicus
				</em>
				 position, 
				<em>
					Gagnon
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Nichols
				</em>
				 simply highlight that the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> inquiry trains on the stage of the proceedings corresponding to Sheltons Circuit Court trial, where his guilt was adjudicated, eligibility for imprisonment established, and prison sentence determined.  
				<em>
					Nichols
				</em>
				 is further distinguishable because the Court there applied a less exacting standard allowing a trial court, once guilt has been established, to increase the defendants sentence based simply on 
				<em>
					evidence
				</em>
				 of the underlying conduct that gave rise to his previous conviction, 511 U. S., at 748, even if he had never been charged with that conduct, 
				<em>
					Williams
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					New York,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/337/241" class="subref" title="subref">337 U. S. 241</a>, and even if he had been acquitted of a misdemeanor with the aid of appointed counsel, 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Watts,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/519/148" class="subref" title="subref">519 U. S. 148</a>.  That relaxed standard has no application here, where the question is whether the defendant may be jailed absent a conviction credited as reliable because the defendant had access to counsel.  Pp. 69.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				
				    
				(3) Also unpersuasive is 
				<em>
					amicus
				</em>
				 contention that practical considerations weigh against extension of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> appointed-counsel right to a defendant in Sheltons situation.  Based on figures suggesting that conditional sentences are commonly imposed but rarely activated, 
				<em>
					amicus
				</em>
				 argues that the appropriate rule would permit imposition of a suspended sentence on an uncounseled defendant and require appointment of counsel, if at all, only at the probation revocation stage, when incarceration is imminent.  That regime would unduly reduce the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a>s domain.  In Alabama, the probation revocation hearing is an informal proceeding, at which the defendant has no right to counsel, and the court no obligation to observe customary rules of evidence.  More significant, the defendant may not challenge the validity or reliability of the underlying conviction.  A hearing so timed and structured cannot compensate for the absence of trial counsel and thereby bring Sheltons sentence within constitutional bounds.  Nor does this Court agree with 
				<em>
					amicus 
				</em>
				that its holding will substantially limit the States ability to impose probation.  Most jurisdictions already provide a state-law right to appointed counsel more generous than that afforded by the Federal Constitution, while simultaneously preserving the option of probationary punishment.  See 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 748749, n. 12.  Even if 
				<em>
					amicus
				</em>
				 is correct that some States cannot afford the costs of the Courts rule, those jurisdictions have recourse to the option of pretrial probation, whereby the prosecutor and defendant agree to the defendants participation in a pretrial rehabilitation program, which includes conditions typical of post-trial probation, and the adjudication of guilt and imposition of sentence for the underlying offense occur only if the defendant breaches those conditions.  This system reserves the appointed-counsel requirement for the few cases in which incarceration proves necessary, see 
				<em>
					Gagnon
				</em>
				, 411 U. S., at 784, while respecting the constitutional imperative that no person be imprisoned unless he was represented by counsel, 
				<em>
					Argersinger
				</em>
				, 407 U. S., at 37.  Pp. 916.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				(c) The Court does not rule on Alabamas argument that, although the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> bars 
				<em>
					activation
				</em>
				 of a suspended sentence for an uncounseled conviction, the Constitution does not prohibit, as a method of effectuating probationary punishment, the 
				<em>
					imposition 
				</em>
				of a suspended sentence that can never be enforced.  There is not so much as a hint in the Alabama Supreme Courts decision that Sheltons probation term is separable from the prison term to which it was tethered.  Absent any prior presentation of the novel position the State now takes, this Court resists passing on it in the first instance.  It is for the State Supreme Court to consider before this Court does whether the suspended sentence alone is invalid, leaving Sheltons probation term freestanding and independently effective.  See

				Defendant-respondent LeReed Shelton, convicted of third-degree assault, was sentenced to a jail term of 30 days, which the trial court immediately suspended, placing Shelton on probation for two years.  The question presented is whether the

				After representing himself at a bench trial in the District Court of Etowah County, Alabama, Shelton was convicted of third-degree assault, a class A misdemeanor carrying a maximum punishment of one year imprisonment and a $2000 fine, Ala. Code §§13A622, 13A57(a)(1), 13A512(a)(1) (1994).  He invoked his right to a new trial before a jury in Circuit Court, Ala. Code §121271 (1995), where he again appeared without a lawyer and was again convicted.  The court repeatedly warned Shelton about the problems self-representation entailed, see App. 9, but at no time offered him assistance of counsel at state expense.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The Circuit Court sentenced Shelton to serve 30 days in the county prison.  As authorized by Alabama law, however, Ala. Code §152250 (1995), the court suspended that sentence and placed Shelton on two years unsupervised probation, conditioned on his payment of court costs, a $500 fine, reparations of $25, and restitution in the amount of $516.69.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Shelton appealed his conviction and sentence on 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> grounds, and the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed.

				  That court initially held that an indigent defendant who receives a suspended prison sentence has a constitutional right to state-appointed counsel and remanded for a determination whether Shelton had made a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of his right.  App. 7.  When the case returned from remand, however, the appeals court reversed course: A suspended sentence, the court concluded, does not trigger the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> right to appointed counsel unless there is evidence in the record that the [defendant] has actually been deprived of liberty.

				The Supreme Court of Alabama reversed the Court of Criminal Appeals in relevant part.  Referring to this Courts decisions in 
				<em>
					Argersinger
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Scott
				</em>
				, the Alabama Supreme Court reasoned that a defendant may not be sentenced to a term of imprisonment absent provision of counsel.  App. 37.  In the Alabama high courts view, a suspended sentence constitutes a term of imprisonment within the meaning of 
				<em>
					Argersinger
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Scott
				</em>
				 even though incarceration is not immediate or inevitable.  And because the State is constitutionally barred from activating the conditional sentence, the Alabama court concluded,  the threat itself is hollow and should be considered a nullity.   
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				 (quoting 
				<em>
					United States 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					Reilley
				</em>
				, 948 F. 2d 648, 654 (CA10 1991)).  Accordingly, the court affirmed Sheltons conviction and the monetary portion of his punishment, but invalidated that aspect of his sentence imposing 30 days of suspended jail time.  App. 40.  By reversing Sheltons suspended sentence, the State informs us, the court also vacated the two-year term of probation.  See Brief for Petitioner 6.

				Applying the actual imprisonment rule to the case before us, we take up first the question we asked 
				<em>
					amicus
				</em>
				 to address: Where the State provides no counsel to an indigent defendant, does the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> permit activation of a suspended sentence upon the defendants violation of the terms of probation?  We conclude that it does not.  A suspended sentence is a prison term imposed for the offense of conviction.  Once the prison term is triggered, the defendant is incarcerated not for the probation violation, but for the underlying offense.  The uncounseled conviction at that point result[s] in imprisonment, 
				<em>
					Nichols
				</em>
				, 511 U. S., at 746; it end[s] up in the actual deprivation of a persons liberty, 
				<em>
					Argersinger
				</em>
				, 407 U. S., at 40.  This is precisely what the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a>, as interpreted in 
				<em>
					Argersinger
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Scott
				</em>
				, does not allow.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>

				 resists this reasoning primarily on two grounds.  First, he attempts to align this case with our decisions in 
				<em>
					Nichols

				 and 
				<em>
					Gagnon
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Scarpelli,

				<em>
					Amicus Curiae
				</em>
				 by Invitation of the Court 1118 (hereinafter Fried Brief).  We conclude that Sheltons case is not properly bracketed with those dispositions.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>
					Nichols
				</em>
				 presented the question whether the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> barred consideration of a defendants prior uncounseled misdemeanor conviction in determining his sentence for a subsequent felony offense.  511 U. S., at 740.  Nichols pleaded guilty to federal felony drug charges.  Several years earlier, unrepresented by counsel, he was fined but not incarcerated for the state misdemeanor of driving under the influence (DUI).  Including the DUI conviction in the federal Sentencing Guidelines calculation allowed the trial court to impose a sentence for the felony drug conviction 25 months longer than if the misdemeanor conviction had not been considered.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 741.  We upheld this result, concluding that an uncounseled misdemeanor conviction, valid under 
				<em>
					Scott
				</em>
				 because no prison term was imposed, is also valid when used to enhance punishment at a subsequent conviction.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 749.  In 
				<em>
					Gagnon
				</em>
				, the question was whether the defendant, who was placed on probation pursuant to a suspended sentence for armed robbery, had a due process right to representation by appointed counsel at a probation revocation hearing.  411 U. S., at 783.  We held that counsel was not invariably required in parole or probation revocation proceedings; we directed, instead, a case-by-case approach turning on the character of the issues involved.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 788791.

				Considered together, 
				<em>
					amicus
				</em>
				 contends, 
				<em>
					Nichols
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Gagnon
				</em>
				 establish this principle: Sequential proceedings must be analyzed separately for 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> purposes, Fried Brief 1118, and only those proceedings result[ing] in 
				<em>
					immediate
				</em>
				 actual imprisonment trigger the right to state-appointed counsel, 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 13 (emphasis added).  Thus, the defendant in 
				<em>
					Nichols
				</em>
				 had no right to appointed counsel in the DUI proceeding because he was not immediately imprisoned at the conclusion of that proceeding.  The uncounseled DUI, valid when imposed, did not later become invalid because it was used to enhance the length of imprisonment that followed a separate and subsequent felony proceeding.  Just so here, 
				<em>
					amicus
				</em>
				 contends: Shelton had no right to appointed counsel in the Circuit Court because he was not incarcerated immediately after trial; his conviction and suspended sentence were thus valid and could serve as proper predicates for actual imprisonment at a later hearing to revoke his probation.  See Fried Brief 14, 2324.

        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>
					Gagnon
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Nichols
				</em>
				 do not stand for the broad proposition 
				<em>
					amicus
				</em>
				 would extract from them.  The dispositive factor in those cases was not whether incarceration occurred immediately or only after some delay.  Rather, the critical point was that the defendant had a recognized right to counsel when adjudicated guilty of the felony offense for which he was imprisoned.  See 
				<em>
					Nichols
				</em>
				, 511 U. S., at 743, n. 9 (absent waiver, right to appointed counsel in felony cases is absolute).  Unlike this case, in which revocation of probation would trigger a prison term imposed for a misdemeanor of which Shelton was found guilty without the aid of counsel, the sentences imposed in 
				<em>
					Nichols
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Gagnon
				</em>
				 were for felony convictionsa federal drug conviction in 
				<em>
					Nichols
				</em>
				, and a state armed robbery conviction in 
				<em>
					Gagnon
				</em>
				for which the right to counsel is unquestioned.  See 
				<em>
					Nichols
				</em>
				, 511 U. S., at 747 (relevant sentencing provisions punished only the last offense committed by the defendant, and did not constitute or change the penalty imposed for the earlier uncounseled misdemeanor); 
				<em>
					Gagnon
				</em>
				, 411 U. S, at 789 (distinguishing the right of an accused to counsel in a criminal prosecution from the more limited due process right of one who is a probationer or parolee only because he has been convicted of a crime).

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Thus, neither 
				<em>
					Nichols
				</em>
				 nor 
				<em>

				 altered or diminished 
				<em>

				</em>
				s command that no person may be imprisoned 
				<em>

				<em>

				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Nichols
				</em>
				 simply highlight that the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> inquiry trains on the stage of the proceedings corresponding to Sheltons Cir-

            <em>

				 is further distinguishable for the related reason that the Court there applied a less exacting standard consistent with the traditional understanding of the sentencing process.  511 U. S., at 747.  Once guilt has been established, we noted in 
				<em>
					Nichols
				</em>
				, sentencing courts may take into account not only a defendants prior convictions, but . . . also [his] past criminal behavior, even if no conviction resulted from that behavior.  
				<em>

				.  Thus, in accord with due process, Nichols could have been sentenced more severely based simply on

				 argues that a rule requiring appointed counsel in every case involving a suspended sentence would unduly hamper the States attempts to impose effective probationary punishment.  A more workable solution, he contends, would permit imposition of a suspended sentence on an uncounseled defendant and require appointment of counsel, if at all, only at the probation revocation stage, when incarceration is imminent.

				More significant, the sole issue at the hearingapart from determinations about the necessity of confinement, see Ala. Code §152254(d)(4) (1975)is whether the defendant breached the terms of probation.  See

				We think it plain that a hearing so timed and structured cannot compensate for the absence of trial counsel, for it does not even address the key 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> inquiry: whether the adjudication of guilt corresponding to the prison sentence is sufficiently reliable to permit incarceration.

        <p class="bodytext">
				In a variation on 
				<em>

				</em>
				 position, the dissent would limit review in this case to the question whether the

				Severing the analysis in this manner makes little sense.  One cannot assess the constitutionality of imposing a suspended sentence while simultaneously walling off the procedures that will precede its activation.

				There is not so much as a hint, however, in the decision of the Supreme Court of Alabama, that Sheltons probation term is separable from the prison term to which it was tethered.  Absent any prior presentation of the position the State now takes,

				 we resist passing on it in the first instance.  Our resistance to acting as a court of first view instead of one of review is heightened by the Alabama Attorney Generals acknowledgment at oral argument that he did not know of any State that imposes, postconviction, on a par with a fine, a term of probation unattached to a suspended sentence.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 8.  The novelty of the States current position is further marked by the unqualified statement in Alabamas opening brief that, [b]y reversing Sheltons suspended sentence, the [Supreme Court of Alabama] correspond-

						 In any event, the dissent is simply incorrect that our decision today effectively deprive[s] the State of th[e] option of placing an uncounseled defendant on probation, with incarceration conditioned on a guilty verdict following a trial de novo.  Post, at 4.  That option is the functional equivalent of pretrial probation, as to which we entertain no constitutional doubt.  See infra, at 1516, and n. 12.  


Regarding the dissents suggestion that other means of retesting (with assistance of counsel) the validity of the original conviction might suffice, post, at 5, n. 3, we doubt that providing counsel after the critical guilt adjudication stage [would] be of much help to a defendant, for the die is usually cast when judgment is entered on an uncounseled trial record.  Argersinger, 407 U. S., at 41 (Burger, C. J., concurring in result).  A large number of misdemeanor convictions take place in police or justice courts which are not courts of record.  Without a drastic change in the procedures of these courts, there would be no way for the defendant to demonstrate error in the original proceeding or reconstruct evidence lost in the intervening period.  Nichols, 511 U. S., at 748.  But we need not here decide whether or what procedural safeguards short of complete retrial at the probation revocation stage could satisfy the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a>, post, at 5; the minimal procedures Alabama does provide are plainly insufficient.

						Charging that we have miraculously divined how the Alabama justices would resolve a constitutional question, post, at 2, the dissent forgets that this case is here on writ of certiorari to the Alabama Supreme Court.  That court ruled in the decision under review that Sheltons sentence violates the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a>.  The Alabama Supreme Court has thus already spoken on the issue we now address, and in doing so expressed not the slightest hint that revocation-stage proceduresreal or imaginarywould affect the constitutional calculus.

						That ten States in this majority do not provide counsel to every defendant who receives a suspended sentence hardly supports the dissents dire predictions about the practical consequences of todays decision, see post, at 58, and n. 4.  The circumstances in which those States currently allow prosecution of misdemeanors without appointed counsel are quite narrow.  In Pennsylvania, for example, all defendants charged with misdemeanors enjoy a right to counsel regardless of the sentence imposed, Pa. Rule Crim. Proc. 122(B) (2002); only those charged with summary offenses (violations not technically considered crimes and punishable by no more than 90 days imprisonment, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. §106(c)(2) (1998)) may receive a suspended sentence uncounseled.  Pa. Rule Crim. Proc. 122(A) (2002); Commonwealth v. Thomas, 510 Pa. 106, 111, n. 7, 507 A. 2d 57, 59, n. 7 (1986).  (Typical summary offenses in Pennsylvania include the failure to return a library book within 30 days, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. §6708 (1998), and fishing on a Sunday, 30 Pa. Cons. Stat. §2104 (1998)).  Gaps in the misdemeanor defendants right to appointed counsel in other States that extend protection beyond the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> are similarly slight.  See, e.g., S. D. Codified Laws §§23A406.1, 2262(2) (1998) (defendant charged with misdemeanor enjoys absolute right to appointed counsel unless offense punishable by no more than 30 days imprisonment); Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann. §26.04(b)(3) (Supp. 2002) (counsel must be appointed to all misdemeanor defendants exceptthose tried before a judge who knows sentence will not includeimprisonment).  


More typical of the situation that results in a suspended sentence, we think, is a case like Sheltonsa prosecution before a jury for third-degree assault, arising out of a fistfight that followed a minor traffic accident, see App. 15, n. 2.  Far from quite irrelevant, post, at 6, that 34 States already provide an attorney in this situation strongly suggests that the added requirement of providing counsel routinely in suspended sentence cases will not prove unduly onerous.

        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-11" href="#ZO-11ref">

						 Because this device is conditioned on the defendants consent, it does not raise the question whether imposition of probation alone so restrains a defendants liberty as to require provision of appointed counsel.  See Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers as Amicus Curiae 8; cf. Brief for Respondent 1316.

						There is thus only one significant difference between pretrial probation and the sensible option urged by the dissent, i.e., complete retrial of the misdemeanor violation with assistance of counsel upon a defendants violation of probation terms, post, at 4.  Pretrial probation is substantially less expensive: It permits incarceration after a single trial, whereas the dissents regime requires twoone (without counsel) to place the defendant on probation, and a second (with counsel) to trigger imprisonment.

						 Not until its Reply Brief did the State convey that, as it comprehends Argersinger and Scott, there is no possibility that Sheltons suspended sentence will be activated if he violates the terms of his probation.  Reply Brief 9.  Before the Supreme Court of Alabama, the States position coincided with the position now argued by amicus.  See States Brief and Argument on Petition for Writ of Certiorari to the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals, p. 31, and States Brief and Argument in Support of its Application for Rehearing, in No. 1990031 (Ala.

				After representing himself at a bench trial in the District Court of Etowah County, Alabama, Shelton was convicted of third-degree assault, a class A misdemeanor carrying a maximum punishment of one year imprisonment and a $2000 fine, Ala. Code §§13A622, 13A57(a)(1), 13A512(a)(1) (1994).  He invoked his right to a new trial before a jury in Circuit Court, Ala. Code §121271 (1995), where he again appeared without a lawyer and was again convicted.  The court repeatedly warned Shelton about the problems self-representation entailed, see App. 9, but at no time offered him assistance of counsel at state expense.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The Circuit Court sentenced Shelton to serve 30 days in the county prison.  As authorized by Alabama law, however, Ala. Code §152250 (1995), the court suspended that sentence and placed Shelton on two years unsupervised probation, conditioned on his payment of court costs, a $500 fine, reparations of $25, and restitution in the amount of $516.69.

				  That court initially held that an indigent defendant who receives a suspended prison sentence has a constitutional right to state-appointed counsel and remanded for a determination whether Shelton had made a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of his right.  App. 7.  When the case returned from remand, however, the appeals court reversed course: A suspended sentence, the court concluded, does not trigger the

				The Supreme Court of Alabama reversed the Court of Criminal Appeals in relevant part.  Referring to this Courts decisions in 
				<em>
					Argersinger
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Scott
				</em>
				, the Alabama Supreme Court reasoned that a defendant may not be sentenced to a term of imprisonment absent provision of counsel.  App. 37.  In the Alabama high courts view, a suspended sentence constitutes a term of imprisonment within the meaning of 
				<em>
					Argersinger
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Scott
				</em>
				 even though incarceration is not immediate or inevitable.  And because the State is constitutionally barred from activating the conditional sentence, the Alabama court concluded,  the threat itself is hollow and should be considered a nullity. 

				<em>

				</em>
				v. 
				<em>

				, 948 F. 2d 648, 654 (CA10 1991)).  Accordingly, the court affirmed Sheltons conviction and the monetary portion of his punishment, but invalidated that aspect of his sentence imposing 30 days of suspended jail time.  App. 40.  By reversing Sheltons suspended sentence, the State informs us, the court also vacated the two-year term of probation.  See Brief for Petitioner 6.

				Applying the actual imprisonment rule to the case before us, we take up first the question we asked 
				<em>
					amicus
				</em>
				 to address: Where the State provides no counsel to an indigent defendant, does the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> permit activation of a suspended sentence upon the defendants violation of the terms of probation?  We conclude that it does not.  A suspended sentence is a prison term imposed for the offense of conviction.  Once the prison term is triggered, the defendant is incarcerated not for the probation violation, but for the underlying offense.  The uncounseled conviction at that point result[s] in imprisonment, 
				<em>
					Nichols
				</em>
				, 511 U. S., at 746; it end[s] up in the actual deprivation of a persons liberty, 
				<em>
					Argersinger
				</em>
				, 407 U. S., at 40.  This is precisely what the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a>, as interpreted in 
				<em>
					Argersinger
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Scott
				</em>
				, does not allow.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>
					Amicus

				 resists this reasoning primarily on two grounds.  First, he attempts to align this case with our decisions in 
				<em>
					Nichols

				<em>
					Gagnon
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Scarpelli,

				<em>
					Amicus Curiae
				</em>
				 by Invitation of the Court 1118 (hereinafter Fried Brief).  We conclude that Sheltons case is not properly bracketed with those dispositions.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>
					Nichols
				</em>
				 presented the question whether the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> barred consideration of a defendants prior uncounseled misdemeanor conviction in determining his sentence for a subsequent felony offense.  511 U. S., at 740.  Nichols pleaded guilty to federal felony drug charges.  Several years earlier, unrepresented by counsel, he was fined but not incarcerated for the state misdemeanor of driving under the influence (DUI).  Including the DUI conviction in the federal Sentencing Guidelines calculation allowed the trial court to impose a sentence for the felony drug conviction 25 months longer than if the misdemeanor conviction had not been considered.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 741.  We upheld this result, concluding that an uncounseled misdemeanor conviction, valid under 
				<em>
					Scott
				</em>
				 because no prison term was imposed, is also valid when used to enhance punishment at a subsequent conviction.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 749.  In 
				<em>
					Gagnon
				</em>
				, the question was whether the defendant, who was placed on probation pursuant to a suspended sentence for armed robbery, had a due process right to representation by appointed counsel at a probation revocation hearing.  411 U. S., at 783.  We held that counsel was not invariably required in parole or probation revocation proceedings; we directed, instead, a case-by-case approach turning on the character of the issues involved.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 788791.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Considered together, 
				<em>
					amicus
				</em>
				 contends, 
				<em>
					Nichols
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Gagnon
				</em>
				 establish this principle: Sequential proceedings must be analyzed separately for 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> purposes, Fried Brief 1118, and only those proceedings result[ing] in 
				<em>
					immediate
				</em>
				 actual imprisonment trigger the right to state-appointed counsel, 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 13 (emphasis added).  Thus, the defendant in 
				<em>
					Nichols
				</em>
				 had no right to appointed counsel in the DUI proceeding because he was not immediately imprisoned at the conclusion of that proceeding.  The uncounseled DUI, valid when imposed, did not later become invalid because it was used to enhance the length of imprisonment that followed a separate and subsequent felony proceeding.  Just so here, 
				<em>
					amicus
				</em>
				 contends: Shelton had no right to appointed counsel in the Circuit Court because he was not incarcerated immediately after trial; his conviction and suspended sentence were thus valid and could serve as proper predicates for actual imprisonment at a later hearing to revoke his probation.  See Fried Brief 14, 2324.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>
					Gagnon
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Nichols
				</em>
				 do not stand for the broad proposition 
				<em>
					amicus
				</em>
				 would extract from them.  The dispositive factor in those cases was not whether incarceration occurred immediately or only after some delay.  Rather, the critical point was that the defendant had a recognized right to counsel when adjudicated guilty of the felony offense for which he was imprisoned.  See 
				<em>
					Nichols
				</em>
				, 511 U. S., at 743, n. 9 (absent waiver, right to appointed counsel in felony cases is absolute).  Unlike this case, in which revocation of probation would trigger a prison term imposed for a misdemeanor of which Shelton was found guilty without the aid of counsel, the sentences imposed in 
				<em>
					Nichols
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Gagnon
				</em>
				 were for felony convictionsa federal drug conviction in 
				<em>
					Nichols
				</em>
				, and a state armed robbery conviction in 
				<em>
					Gagnon
				</em>
				for which the right to counsel is unquestioned.  See 
				<em>
					Nichols
				</em>
				, 511 U. S., at 747 (relevant sentencing provisions punished only the last offense committed by the defendant, and did not constitute or change the penalty imposed for the earlier uncounseled misdemeanor); 
				<em>
					Gagnon
				</em>
				, 411 U. S, at 789 (distinguishing the right of an accused to counsel in a criminal prosecution from the more limited due process right of one who is a probationer or parolee only because he has been convicted of a crime).  
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Thus, neither 
				<em>
					Nichols
				</em>
				 nor 
				<em>
					Gagnon
				</em>
				 altered or diminished 
				<em>
					Argersinger
				</em>
				s command that no person may be imprisoned 
				<em>
					for any offense
				</em>
				 . . . unless he was represented by counsel at his trial, 407 U. S., at 37 (emphasis added).  Far from supporting 
				<em>

				 position, 
				<em>
					Gagnon
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Nichols
				</em>
				 simply highlight that the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> inquiry trains on the stage of the proceedings corresponding to Sheltons Cir-

        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>
					&lt;fs fs="11"&gt;Nichols

				 is further distinguishable for the related reason that the Court there applied a less exacting standard consistent with the traditional understanding of the sentencing process.  511 U. S., at 747.  Once guilt has been established, we noted in 
				<em>
					Nichols
				</em>
				, sentencing courts may take into account not only a defendants prior convictions, but . . . also [his] past criminal behavior, even if no conviction resulted from that behavior.  
				<em>

				.  Thus, in accord with due process, Nichols could have been sentenced more severely based simply on 
				<em>
					evidence
				</em>
				 of the underlying conduct that gave rise to his previous conviction, 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 748 (emphasis added), even if he had never been charged with that conduct,

				Severing the analysis in this manner makes little sense.  One cannot assess the constitutionality of imposing a suspended sentence while simultaneously walling off the procedures that will precede its activation.  The dissent imagines a set of safeguards Alabama might provide at the probation revocation stage sufficient to cure its failure to appoint counsel prior to sentencing, including, perhaps, complete retrial of the misdemeanor violation with assistance of counsel,

Our resistance to acting as a court of first view instead of one of review is heightened by the Alabama Attorney Generals acknowledgment at oral argument that he did not know of any State that imposes, postconviction, on a par with a fine, a term of probation unattached to a suspended sentence.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 8.  The novelty of the States current position is further marked by the unqualified statement in Alabamas opening brief that, [b]y reversing Sheltons suspended sentence, the [Supreme Court of Alabama] correspond-

						 In any event, the dissent is simply incorrect that our decision today effectively deprive[s] the State of th[e] option of placing an uncounseled defendant on probation, with incarceration conditioned on a guilty verdict following a trial de novo.  Post, at 4.  That option is the functional equivalent of pretrial probation, as to which we entertain no constitutional doubt.  See infra, at 1516, and n. 12.  


Regarding the dissents suggestion that other means of retesting (with assistance of counsel) the validity of the original conviction might suffice, post, at 5, n. 3, we doubt that providing counsel after the critical guilt adjudication stage [would] be of much help to a defendant, for the die is usually cast when judgment is entered on an uncounseled trial record.  Argersinger, 407 U. S., at 41 (Burger, C. J., concurring in result).  A large number of misdemeanor convictions take place in police or justice courts which are not courts of record.  Without a drastic change in the procedures of these courts, there would be no way for the defendant to demonstrate error in the original proceeding or reconstruct evidence lost in the intervening period.  Nichols, 511 U. S., at 748.  But we need not here decide whether or what procedural safeguards short of complete retrial at the probation revocation stage could satisfy the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a>, post, at 5; the minimal procedures Alabama does provide are plainly insufficient.

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a>.

						That ten States in this majority do not provide counsel to every defendant who receives a suspended sentence hardly supports the dissents dire predictions about the practical consequences of todays decision, see post, at 58, and n. 4.  The circumstances in which those States currently allow prosecution of misdemeanors without appointed counsel are quite narrow.  In Pennsylvania, for example, all defendants charged with misdemeanors enjoy a right to counsel regardless of the sentence imposed, Pa. Rule Crim. Proc. 122(B) (2002); only those charged with summary offenses (violations not technically considered crimes and punishable by no more than 90 days imprisonment, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. §106(c)(2) (1998)) may receive a suspended sentence uncounseled.  Pa. Rule Crim. Proc. 122(A) (2002); Commonwealth v. Thomas, 510 Pa. 106, 111, n. 7, 507 A. 2d 57, 59, n. 7 (1986).  (Typical summary offenses in Pennsylvania include the failure to return a library book within 30 days, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. §6708 (1998), and fishing on a Sunday, 30 Pa. Cons. Stat. §2104 (1998)).  Gaps in the misdemeanor defendants right to appointed counsel in other States that extend protection beyond the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> are similarly slight.  See, e.g., S. D. Codified Laws §§23A406.1, 2262(2) (1998) (defendant charged with misdemeanor enjoys absolute right to appointed counsel unless offense punishable by no more than 30 days imprisonment); Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann. §26.04(b)(3) (Supp. 2002) (counsel must be appointed to all misdemeanor defendants exceptthose tried before a judge who knows sentence will not includeimprisonment).  


More typical of the situation that results in a suspended sentence, we think, is a case like Sheltonsa prosecution before a jury for third-degree assault, arising out of a fistfight that followed a minor traffic accident, see App. 15, n. 2.  Far from quite irrelevant, post, at 6, that 34 States already provide an attorney in this situation strongly suggests that the added requirement of providing counsel routinely in suspended sentence cases will not prove unduly onerous.

						 Because this device is conditioned on the defendants consent, it does not raise the question whether imposition of probation alone so restrains a defendants liberty as to require provision of appointed counsel.  See Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers as Amicus Curiae 8; cf. Brief for Respondent 1316.

						There is thus only one significant difference between pretrial probation and the sensible option urged by the dissent, i.e., complete retrial of the misdemeanor violation with assistance of counsel upon a defendants violation of probation terms, post, at 4.  Pretrial probation is substantially less expensive: It permits incarceration after a single trial, whereas the dissents regime requires twoone (without counsel) to place the defendant on probation, and a second (with counsel) to trigger imprisonment.

						 Not until its Reply Brief did the State convey that, as it comprehends Argersinger and Scott, there is no possibility that Sheltons suspended sentence will be activated if he violates the terms of his probation.  Reply Brief 9.  Before the Supreme Court of Alabama, the States position coincided with the position now argued by amicus.  See States Brief and Argument on Petition for Writ of Certiorari to the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals, p. 31, and States Brief and Argument in Support of its Application for Rehearing, in No. 1990031 (Ala.

				Defendant-respondent LeReed Shelton, convicted of third-degree assault, was sentenced to a jail term of 30 days, which the trial court immediately suspended, placing Shelton on probation for two years.  The question presented is whether the

				<em>

				 and

				After representing himself at a bench trial in the District Court of Etowah County, Alabama, Shelton was convicted of third-degree assault, a class A misdemeanor carrying a maximum punishment of one year imprisonment and a $2000 fine, Ala. Code §§13A622, 13A57(a)(1), 13A512(a)(1) (1994).  He invoked his right to a new trial before a jury in Circuit Court, Ala. Code §121271 (1995), where he again appeared without a lawyer and was again convicted.  The court repeatedly warned Shelton about the problems self-representation entailed, see App. 9, but at no time offered him assistance of counsel at state expense.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The Circuit Court sentenced Shelton to serve 30 days in the county prison.  As authorized by Alabama law, however, Ala. Code §152250 (1995), the court suspended that sentence and placed Shelton on two years unsupervised probation, conditioned on his payment of court costs, a $500 fine, reparations of $25, and restitution in the amount of $516.69.

				Shelton appealed his conviction and sentence on

				  That court initially held that an indigent defendant who receives a suspended prison sentence has a constitutional right to state-appointed counsel and remanded for a determination whether Shelton had made a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of his right.  App. 7.  When the case returned from remand, however, the appeals court reversed course: A suspended sentence, the court concluded, does not trigger the

				The Supreme Court of Alabama reversed the Court of Criminal Appeals in relevant part.  Referring to this Courts decisions in 
				<em>
					Argersinger
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Scott
				</em>
				, the Alabama Supreme Court reasoned that a defendant may not be sentenced to a term of imprisonment absent provision of counsel.  App. 37.  In the Alabama high courts view, a suspended sentence constitutes a term of imprisonment within the meaning of 
				<em>
					Argersinger
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Scott
				</em>
				 even though incarceration is not immediate or inevitable.  And because the State is constitutionally barred from activating the conditional sentence, the Alabama court concluded,  the threat itself is hollow and should be considered a nullity.   
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				 (quoting 
				<em>
					United States 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					Reilley
				</em>
				, 948 F. 2d 648, 654 (CA10 1991)).  Accordingly, the court affirmed Sheltons conviction and the monetary portion of his punishment, but invalidated that aspect of his sentence imposing 30 days of suspended jail time.  App. 40.  By reversing Sheltons suspended sentence, the State informs us, the court also vacated the two-year term of probation.  See Brief for Petitioner 6.

				Applying the actual imprisonment rule to the case before us, we take up first the question we asked 
				<em>
					amicus
				</em>
				 to address: Where the State provides no counsel to an indigent defendant, does the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> permit activation of a suspended sentence upon the defendants violation of the terms of probation?  We conclude that it does not.  A suspended sentence is a prison term imposed for the offense of conviction.  Once the prison term is triggered, the defendant is incarcerated not for the probation violation, but for the underlying offense.  The uncounseled conviction at that point result[s] in imprisonment, 
				<em>
					Nichols
				</em>
				, 511 U. S., at 746; it end[s] up in the actual deprivation of a persons liberty, 
				<em>
					Argersinger
				</em>
				, 407 U. S., at 40.  This is precisely what the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a>, as interpreted in 
				<em>
					Argersinger
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Scott
				</em>
				, does not allow.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>
					Amicus
				</em>
				 resists this reasoning primarily on two grounds.  First, he attempts to align this case with our decisions in 
				<em>
					Nichols
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Gagnon
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Scarpelli,

.  See Brief for 
				<em>
					Amicus Curiae
				</em>
				 by Invitation of the Court 1118 (hereinafter Fried Brief).  We conclude that Sheltons case is not properly bracketed with those dispositions.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>
					Nichols
				</em>
				 presented the question whether the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> barred consideration of a defendants prior uncounseled misdemeanor conviction in determining his sentence for a subsequent felony offense.  511 U. S., at 740.  Nichols pleaded guilty to federal felony drug charges.  Several years earlier, unrepresented by counsel, he was fined but not incarcerated for the state misdemeanor of driving under the influence (DUI).  Including the DUI conviction in the federal Sentencing Guidelines calculation allowed the trial court to impose a sentence for the felony drug conviction 25 months longer than if the misdemeanor conviction had not been considered.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 741.  We upheld this result, concluding that an uncounseled misdemeanor conviction, valid under 
				<em>
					Scott
				</em>
				 because no prison term was imposed, is also valid when used to enhance punishment at a subsequent conviction.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 749.  In 
				<em>
					Gagnon
				</em>
				, the question was whether the defendant, who was placed on probation pursuant to a suspended sentence for armed robbery, had a due process right to representation by appointed counsel at a probation revocation hearing.  411 U. S., at 783.  We held that counsel was not invariably required in parole or probation revocation proceedings; we directed, instead, a case-by-case approach turning on the character of the issues involved.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 788791.   
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Considered together, 
				<em>
					amicus
				</em>
				 contends, 
				<em>
					Nichols
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Gagnon
				</em>
				 establish this principle: Sequential proceedings must be analyzed separately for 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> purposes, Fried Brief 1118, and only those proceedings result[ing] in 
				<em>
					immediate
				</em>
				 actual imprisonment trigger the right to state-appointed counsel, 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 13 (emphasis added).  Thus, the defendant in 
				<em>
					Nichols
				</em>
				 had no right to appointed counsel in the DUI proceeding because he was not immediately imprisoned at the conclusion of that proceeding.  The uncounseled DUI, valid when imposed, did not later become invalid because it was used to enhance the length of imprisonment that followed a separate and subsequent felony proceeding.  Just so here, 
				<em>
					amicus
				</em>
				 contends: Shelton had no right to appointed counsel in the Circuit Court because he was not incarcerated immediately after trial; his conviction and suspended sentence were thus valid and could serve as proper predicates for actual imprisonment at a later hearing to revoke his probation.  See Fried Brief 14, 2324.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>
					Gagnon
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Nichols
				</em>
				 do not stand for the broad proposition 
				<em>
					amicus
				</em>
				 would extract from them.  The dispositive factor in those cases was not whether incarceration occurred immediately or only after some delay.  Rather, the critical point was that the defendant had a recognized right to counsel when adjudicated guilty of the felony offense for which he was imprisoned.  See 
				<em>
					Nichols
				</em>
				, 511 U. S., at 743, n. 9 (absent waiver, right to appointed counsel in felony cases is absolute).  Unlike this case, in which revocation of probation would trigger a prison term imposed for a misdemeanor of which Shelton was found guilty without the aid of counsel, the sentences imposed in 
				<em>
					Nichols
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Gagnon
				</em>
				 were for felony convictionsa federal drug conviction in 
				<em>
					Nichols
				</em>
				, and a state armed robbery conviction in 
				<em>
					Gagnon
				</em>
				for which the right to counsel is unquestioned.  See 
				<em>
					Nichols
				</em>
				, 511 U. S., at 747 (relevant sentencing provisions punished only the last offense committed by the defendant, and did not constitute or change the penalty imposed for the earlier uncounseled misdemeanor); 
				<em>
					Gagnon
				</em>
				, 411 U. S, at 789 (distinguishing the right of an accused to counsel in a criminal prosecution from the more limited due process right of one who is a probationer or parolee only because he has been convicted of a crime).  
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Thus, neither 
				<em>
					Nichols
				</em>
				 nor 
				<em>
					Gagnon
				</em>
				 altered or diminished 
				<em>
					Argersinger
				</em>
				s command that no person may be imprisoned 
				<em>
					for any offense
				</em>
				 . . . unless he was represented by counsel at his trial, 407 U. S., at 37 (emphasis added).  Far from supporting 
				<em>

				<em>
					Gagnon
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Nichols
				</em>
				 simply highlight that the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> inquiry trains on the stage of the proceedings corresponding to Sheltons Cir-

        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>
					&lt;fs fs="11"&gt;Nichols

				 is further distinguishable for the related reason that the Court there applied a less exacting standard consistent with the traditional understanding of the sentencing process.  511 U. S., at 747.  Once guilt has been established, we noted in 
				<em>

				, sentencing courts may take into account not only a defendants prior convictions, but . . . also [his] past criminal behavior, even if no conviction resulted from that behavior.

				Severing the analysis in this manner makes little sense.  One cannot assess the constitutionality of imposing a suspended sentence while simultaneously walling off the procedures that will precede its activation.

				Moreover, even if

Our resistance to acting as a court of first view instead of one of review is heightened by the Alabama Attorney Generals acknowledgment at oral argument that he did not know of any State that imposes, postconviction, on a par with a fine, a term of probation unattached to a suspended sentence.

The novelty of the States current position is further marked by the unqualified statement in Alabamas opening brief that, [b]y reversing Sheltons suspended sentence, the [Supreme Court of Alabama] correspond-

						 In any event, the dissent is simply incorrect that our decision today effectively deprive[s] the State of th[e] option of placing an uncounseled defendant on probation, with incarceration conditioned on a guilty verdict following a trial de novo.  Post, at 4.  That option is the functional equivalent of pretrial probation, as to which we entertain no constitutional doubt.  See infra, at 1516, and n. 12.  


Regarding the dissents suggestion that other means of retesting (with assistance of counsel) the validity of the original conviction might suffice, post, at 5, n. 3, we doubt that providing counsel after the critical guilt adjudication stage [would] be of much help to a defendant, for the die is usually cast when judgment is entered on an uncounseled trial record.  Argersinger, 407 U. S., at 41 (Burger, C. J., concurring in result).  A large number of misdemeanor convictions take place in police or justice courts which are not courts of record.  Without a drastic change in the procedures of these courts, there would be no way for the defendant to demonstrate error in the original proceeding or reconstruct evidence lost in the intervening period.  Nichols, 511 U. S., at 748.  But we need not here decide whether or what procedural safeguards short of complete retrial at the probation revocation stage could satisfy the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a>, post, at 5; the minimal procedures Alabama does provide are plainly insufficient.

						That ten States in this majority do not provide counsel to every defendant who receives a suspended sentence hardly supports the dissents dire predictions about the practical consequences of todays decision, see post, at 58, and n. 4.  The circumstances in which those States currently allow prosecution of misdemeanors without appointed counsel are quite narrow.  In Pennsylvania, for example, all defendants charged with misdemeanors enjoy a right to counsel regardless of the sentence imposed, Pa. Rule Crim. Proc. 122(B) (2002); only those charged with summary offenses (violations not technically considered crimes and punishable by no more than 90 days imprisonment, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. §106(c)(2) (1998)) may receive a suspended sentence uncounseled.  Pa. Rule Crim. Proc. 122(A) (2002); Commonwealth v. Thomas, 510 Pa. 106, 111, n. 7, 507 A. 2d 57, 59, n. 7 (1986).  (Typical summary offenses in Pennsylvania include the failure to return a library book within 30 days, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. §6708 (1998), and fishing on a Sunday, 30 Pa. Cons. Stat. §2104 (1998)).  Gaps in the misdemeanor defendants right to appointed counsel in other States that extend protection beyond the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> are similarly slight.  See, e.g., S. D. Codified Laws §§23A406.1, 2262(2) (1998) (defendant charged with misdemeanor enjoys absolute right to appointed counsel unless offense punishable by no more than 30 days imprisonment); Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann. §26.04(b)(3) (Supp. 2002) (counsel must be appointed to all misdemeanor defendants exceptthose tried before a judge who knows sentence will not includeimprisonment).  


More typical of the situation that results in a suspended sentence, we think, is a case like Sheltonsa prosecution before a jury for third-degree assault, arising out of a fistfight that followed a minor traffic accident, see App. 15, n. 2.  Far from quite irrelevant, post, at 6, that 34 States already provide an attorney in this situation strongly suggests that the added requirement of providing counsel routinely in suspended sentence cases will not prove unduly onerous.

						 Because this device is conditioned on the defendants consent, it does not raise the question whether imposition of probation alone so restrains a defendants liberty as to require provision of appointed counsel.  See Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers as Amicus Curiae 8; cf. Brief for Respondent 1316.

						There is thus only one significant difference between pretrial probation and the sensible option urged by the dissent, i.e., complete retrial of the misdemeanor violation with assistance of counsel upon a defendants violation of probation terms, post, at 4.  Pretrial probation is substantially less expensive: It permits incarceration after a single trial, whereas the dissents regime requires twoone (without counsel) to place the defendant on probation, and a second (with counsel) to trigger imprisonment.

						 Not until its Reply Brief did the State convey that, as it comprehends Argersinger and Scott, there is no possibility that Sheltons suspended sentence will be activated if he violates the terms of his probation.  Reply Brief 9.  Before the Supreme Court of Alabama, the States position coincided with the position now argued by amicus.  See States Brief and Argument on Petition for Writ of Certiorari to the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals, p. 31, and States Brief and Argument in Support of its Application for Rehearing, in No. 1990031 (Ala.

				Defendant-respondent LeReed Shelton, convicted of third-degree assault, was sentenced to a jail term of 30 days, which the trial court immediately suspended, placing Shelton on probation for two years.  The question presented is whether the

				<em>

				After representing himself at a bench trial in the District Court of Etowah County, Alabama, Shelton was convicted of third-degree assault, a class A misdemeanor carrying a maximum punishment of one year imprisonment and a $2000 fine, Ala. Code §§13A622, 13A57(a)(1), 13A512(a)(1) (1994).  He invoked his right to a new trial before a jury in Circuit Court, Ala. Code §121271 (1995), where he again appeared without a lawyer and was again convicted.  The court repeatedly warned Shelton about the problems self-representation entailed, see App. 9, but at no time offered him assistance of counsel at state expense.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The Circuit Court sentenced Shelton to serve 30 days in the county prison.  As authorized by Alabama law, however, Ala. Code §152250 (1995), the court suspended that sentence and placed Shelton on two years unsupervised probation, conditioned on his payment of court costs, a $500 fine, reparations of $25, and restitution in the amount of $516.69.

				  That court initially held that an indigent defendant who receives a suspended prison sentence has a constitutional right to state-appointed counsel and remanded for a determination whether Shelton had made a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of his right.  App. 7.  When the case returned from remand, however, the appeals court reversed course: A suspended sentence, the court concluded, does not trigger the

				The Supreme Court of Alabama reversed the Court of Criminal Appeals in relevant part.  Referring to this Courts decisions in 
				<em>
					Argersinger
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Scott
				</em>
				, the Alabama Supreme Court reasoned that a defendant may not be sentenced to a term of imprisonment absent provision of counsel.  App. 37.  In the Alabama high courts view, a suspended sentence constitutes a term of imprisonment within the meaning of 
				<em>
					Argersinger
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Scott
				</em>
				 even though incarceration is not immediate or inevitable.  And because the State is constitutionally barred from activating the conditional sentence, the Alabama court concluded,  the threat itself is hollow and should be considered a nullity.   
				<em>

				</em>
				 (quoting 
				<em>
					United States 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					Reilley

				, 948 F. 2d 648, 654 (CA10 1991)).  Accordingly, the court affirmed Sheltons conviction and the monetary portion of his punishment, but invalidated that aspect of his sentence imposing 30 days of suspended jail time.  App. 40.  By reversing Sheltons suspended sentence, the State informs us, the court also vacated the two-year term of probation.  See Brief for Petitioner 6.

				Applying the actual imprisonment rule to the case before us, we take up first the question we asked 
				<em>
					amicus
				</em>
				 to address: Where the State provides no counsel to an indigent defendant, does the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> permit activation of a suspended sentence upon the defendants violation of the terms of probation?  We conclude that it does not.  A suspended sentence is a prison term imposed for the offense of conviction.  Once the prison term is triggered, the defendant is incarcerated not for the probation violation, but for the underlying offense.  The uncounseled conviction at that point result[s] in imprisonment,

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> barred consideration of a defendants prior uncounseled misdemeanor conviction in determining his sentence for a subsequent felony offense.  511 U. S., at 740.  Nichols pleaded guilty to federal felony drug charges.  Several years earlier, unrepresented by counsel, he was fined but not incarcerated for the state misdemeanor of driving under the influence (DUI).  Including the DUI conviction in the federal Sentencing Guidelines calculation allowed the trial court to impose a sentence for the felony drug conviction 25 months longer than if the misdemeanor conviction had not been considered.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 741.  We upheld this result, concluding that an uncounseled misdemeanor conviction, valid under 
				<em>
					Scott
				</em>
				 because no prison term was imposed, is also valid when used to enhance punishment at a subsequent conviction.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 749.  In 
				<em>
					Gagnon
				</em>
				, the question was whether the defendant, who was placed on probation pursuant to a suspended sentence for armed robbery, had a due process right to representation by appointed counsel at a probation revocation hearing.  411 U. S., at 783.  We held that counsel was not invariably required in parole or probation revocation proceedings; we directed, instead, a case-by-case approach turning on the character of the issues involved.

Just so here, 
				<em>

Rather, the critical point was that the defendant had a recognized right to counsel when adjudicated guilty of the felony offense for which he was imprisoned.  See 
				<em>
					Nichols
				</em>
				, 511 U. S., at 743, n. 9 (absent waiver, right to appointed counsel in felony cases is absolute).  Unlike this case, in which revocation of probation would trigger a prison term imposed for a misdemeanor of which Shelton was found guilty without the aid of counsel, the sentences imposed in 
				<em>
					Nichols
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Gagnon
				</em>
				 were for felony convictionsa federal drug conviction in 
				<em>

				</em>

				</em>
				for which the right to counsel is unquestioned.  See

				, 411 U. S, at 789 (distinguishing the right of an accused to counsel in a criminal prosecution from the more limited due process right of one who is a probationer or parolee only because he has been convicted of a crime).

						 In any event, the dissent is simply incorrect that our decision today effectively deprive[s] the State of th[e] option of placing an uncounseled defendant on probation, with incarceration conditioned on a guilty verdict following a trial de novo.  Post, at 4.  That option is the functional equivalent of pretrial probation, as to which we entertain no constitutional doubt.  See infra, at 1516, and n. 12.  


Regarding the dissents suggestion that other means of retesting (with assistance of counsel) the validity of the original conviction might suffice, post, at 5, n. 3, we doubt that providing counsel after the critical guilt adjudication stage [would] be of much help to a defendant, for the die is usually cast when judgment is entered on an uncounseled trial record.  Argersinger, 407 U. S., at 41 (Burger, C. J., concurring in result).  A large number of misdemeanor convictions take place in police or justice courts which are not courts of record.  Without a drastic change in the procedures of these courts, there would be no way for the defendant to demonstrate error in the original proceeding or reconstruct evidence lost in the intervening period.  Nichols, 511 U. S., at 748.  But we need not here decide whether or what procedural safeguards short of complete retrial at the probation revocation stage could satisfy the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a>, post, at 5; the minimal procedures Alabama does provide are plainly insufficient.

						Charging that we have miraculously divined how the Alabama justices would resolve a constitutional question, post, at 2, the dissent forgets that this case is here on writ of certiorari to the Alabama Supreme Court.  That court ruled in the decision under review that Sheltons sentence violates the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a>.  The Alabama Supreme Court has thus already spoken on the issue we now address, and in doing so expressed not the slightest hint that revocation-stage proceduresreal or imaginarywould affect the constitutional calculus.

						That ten States in this majority do not provide counsel to every defendant who receives a suspended sentence hardly supports the dissents dire predictions about the practical consequences of todays decision, see post, at 58, and n. 4.  The circumstances in which those States currently allow prosecution of misdemeanors without appointed counsel are quite narrow.  In Pennsylvania, for example, all defendants charged with misdemeanors enjoy a right to counsel regardless of the sentence imposed, Pa. Rule Crim. Proc. 122(B) (2002); only those charged with summary offenses (violations not technically considered crimes and punishable by no more than 90 days imprisonment, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. §106(c)(2) (1998)) may receive a suspended sentence uncounseled.  Pa. Rule Crim. Proc. 122(A) (2002); Commonwealth v. Thomas, 510 Pa. 106, 111, n. 7, 507 A. 2d 57, 59, n. 7 (1986).  (Typical summary offenses in Pennsylvania include the failure to return a library book within 30 days, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. §6708 (1998), and fishing on a Sunday, 30 Pa. Cons. Stat. §2104 (1998)).  Gaps in the misdemeanor defendants right to appointed counsel in other States that extend protection beyond the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> are similarly slight.  See, e.g., S. D. Codified Laws §§23A406.1, 2262(2) (1998) (defendant charged with misdemeanor enjoys absolute right to appointed counsel unless offense punishable by no more than 30 days imprisonment); Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann. §26.04(b)(3) (Supp. 2002) (counsel must be appointed to all misdemeanor defendants exceptthose tried before a judge who knows sentence will not includeimprisonment).  


More typical of the situation that results in a suspended sentence, we think, is a case like Sheltonsa prosecution before a jury for third-degree assault, arising out of a fistfight that followed a minor traffic accident, see App. 15, n. 2.  Far from quite irrelevant, post, at 6, that 34 States already provide an attorney in this situation strongly suggests that the added requirement of providing counsel routinely in suspended sentence cases will not prove unduly onerous.

						 Because this device is conditioned on the defendants consent, it does not raise the question whether imposition of probation alone so restrains a defendants liberty as to require provision of appointed counsel.  See Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers as Amicus Curiae 8; cf. Brief for Respondent 1316.

						There is thus only one significant difference between pretrial probation and the sensible option urged by the dissent, i.e., complete retrial of the misdemeanor violation with assistance of counsel upon a defendants violation of probation terms, post, at 4.  Pretrial probation is substantially less expensive: It permits incarceration after a single trial, whereas the dissents regime requires twoone (without counsel) to place the defendant on probation, and a second (with counsel) to trigger imprisonment.

						 Not until its Reply Brief did the State convey that, as it comprehends Argersinger and Scott, there is no possibility that Sheltons suspended sentence will be activated if he violates the terms of his probation.  Reply Brief 9.  Before the Supreme Court of Alabama, the States position coincided with the position now argued by amicus.  See States Brief and Argument on Petition for Writ of Certiorari to the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals, p. 31, and States Brief and Argument in Support of its Application for Rehearing, in No. 1990031 (Ala.

				Defendant-respondent LeReed Shelton, convicted of third-degree assault, was sentenced to a jail term of 30 days, which the trial court immediately suspended, placing Shelton on probation for two years.  The question presented is whether the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> right to appointed counsel, as delineated in 
				<em>

				</em>
				 and

				, applies to a defendant in Sheltons situation.  We hold that a suspended sentence that may end up in the actual deprivation of a persons liberty may not be imposed unless the defendant was accorded the guiding hand of counsel in the prosecution for the crime charged.

				After representing himself at a bench trial in the District Court of Etowah County, Alabama, Shelton was convicted of third-degree assault, a class A misdemeanor carrying a maximum punishment of one year imprisonment and a $2000 fine, Ala. Code §§13A622, 13A57(a)(1), 13A512(a)(1) (1994).  He invoked his right to a new trial before a jury in Circuit Court, Ala. Code §121271 (1995), where he again appeared without a lawyer and was again convicted.  The court repeatedly warned Shelton about the problems self-representation entailed, see App. 9, but at no time offered him assistance of counsel at state expense.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The Circuit Court sentenced Shelton to serve 30 days in the county prison.  As authorized by Alabama law, however, Ala. Code §152250 (1995), the court suspended that sentence and placed Shelton on two years unsupervised probation, conditioned on his payment of court costs, a $500 fine, reparations of $25, and restitution in the amount of $516.69.

				Shelton appealed his conviction and sentence on

				  That court initially held that an indigent defendant who receives a suspended prison sentence has a constitutional right to state-appointed counsel and remanded for a determination whether Shelton had made a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of his right.  App. 7.  When the case returned from remand, however, the appeals court reversed course: A suspended sentence, the court concluded, does not trigger the

				The Supreme Court of Alabama reversed the Court of Criminal Appeals in relevant part.  Referring to this Courts decisions in 
				<em>
					Argersinger
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Scott
				</em>
				, the Alabama Supreme Court reasoned that a defendant may not be sentenced to a term of imprisonment absent provision of counsel.  App. 37.  In the Alabama high courts view, a suspended sentence constitutes a term of imprisonment within the meaning of 
				<em>
					Argersinger
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Scott
				</em>
				 even though incarceration is not immediate or inevitable.  And because the State is constitutionally barred from activating the conditional sentence, the Alabama court concluded,  the threat itself is hollow and should be considered a nullity.   
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				 (quoting 
				<em>
					United States 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					Reilley
				</em>
				, 948 F. 2d 648, 654 (CA10 1991)).  Accordingly, the court affirmed Sheltons conviction and the monetary portion of his punishment, but invalidated that aspect of his sentence imposing 30 days of suspended jail time.  App. 40.  By reversing Sheltons suspended sentence, the State informs us, the court also vacated the two-year term of probation.  See Brief for Petitioner 6.

				Applying the actual imprisonment rule to the case before us, we take up first the question we asked 
				<em>
					amicus
				</em>
				 to address: Where the State provides no counsel to an indigent defendant, does the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> permit activation of a suspended sentence upon the defendants violation of the terms of probation?  We conclude that it does not.  A suspended sentence is a prison term imposed for the offense of conviction.  Once the prison term is triggered, the defendant is incarcerated not for the probation violation, but for the underlying offense.  The uncounseled conviction at that point result[s] in imprisonment, 
				<em>
					Nichols
				</em>
				, 511 U. S., at 746; it end[s] up in the actual deprivation of a persons liberty, 
				<em>

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a>, as interpreted in 
				<em>
					Argersinger
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>

            <em>
					Nichols
				</em>
				 presented the question whether the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> barred consideration of a defendants prior uncounseled misdemeanor conviction in determining his sentence for a subsequent felony offense.  511 U. S., at 740.  Nichols pleaded guilty to federal felony drug charges.  Several years earlier, unrepresented by counsel, he was fined but not incarcerated for the state misdemeanor of driving under the influence (DUI).  Including the DUI conviction in the federal Sentencing Guidelines calculation allowed the trial court to impose a sentence for the felony drug conviction 25 months longer than if the misdemeanor conviction had not been considered.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 741.  We upheld this result, concluding that an uncounseled misdemeanor conviction, valid under 
				<em>
					Scott
				</em>
				 because no prison term was imposed, is also valid when used to enhance punishment at a subsequent conviction.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 749.  In 
				<em>
					Gagnon
				</em>
				, the question was whether the defendant, who was placed on probation pursuant to a suspended sentence for armed robbery, had a due process right to representation by appointed counsel at a probation revocation hearing.  411 U. S., at 783.  We held that counsel was not invariably required in parole or probation revocation proceedings; we directed, instead, a case-by-case approach turning on the character of the issues involved.

				Considered together, 
				<em>
					amicus

				 contends, 
				<em>
					Nichols

				 and 
				<em>

				 establish this principle: Sequential proceedings must be analyzed separately for 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> purposes, Fried Brief 1118, and only those proceedings result[ing] in 
				<em>

				 actual imprisonment trigger the right to state-appointed counsel, 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 13 (emphasis added).  Thus, the defendant in 
				<em>
					Nichols
				</em>
				 had no right to appointed counsel in the DUI proceeding because he was not immediately imprisoned at the conclusion of that proceeding.  The uncounseled DUI, valid when imposed, did not later become invalid because it was used to enhance the length of imprisonment that followed a separate and subsequent felony proceeding.  Just so here, 
				<em>
					amicus
				</em>
				 contends: Shelton had no right to appointed counsel in the Circuit Court because he was not incarcerated immediately after trial; his conviction and suspended sentence were thus valid and could serve as proper predicates for actual imprisonment at a later hearing to revoke his probation.  See Fried Brief 14, 2324.

        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>
					Gagnon
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Nichols
				</em>
				 do not stand for the broad proposition 
				<em>
					amicus
				</em>
				 would extract from them.  The dispositive factor in those cases was not whether incarceration occurred immediately or only after some delay.  Rather, the critical point was that the defendant had a recognized right to counsel when adjudicated guilty of the felony offense for which he was imprisoned.  See 
				<em>
					Nichols
				</em>
				, 511 U. S., at 743, n. 9 (absent waiver, right to appointed counsel in felony cases is absolute).  Unlike this case, in which revocation of probation would trigger a prison term imposed for a misdemeanor of which Shelton was found guilty without the aid of counsel, the sentences imposed in 
				<em>
					Nichols
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Gagnon
				</em>
				 were for felony convictionsa federal drug conviction in 
				<em>
					Nichols
				</em>
				, and a state armed robbery conviction in 
				<em>
					Gagnon
				</em>
				for which the right to counsel is unquestioned.  See 
				<em>
					Nichols
				</em>
				, 511 U. S., at 747 (relevant sentencing provisions punished only the last offense committed by the defendant, and did not constitute or change the penalty imposed for the earlier uncounseled misdemeanor); 
				<em>
					Gagnon
				</em>
				, 411 U. S, at 789 (distinguishing the right of an accused to counsel in a criminal prosecution from the more limited due process right of one who is a probationer or parolee only because he has been convicted of a crime).

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Thus, neither 
				<em>
					Nichols
				</em>
				 nor

				 altered or diminished 
				<em>

				</em>
				s command that no person may be imprisoned

				<em>

				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Nichols
				</em>
				 simply highlight that the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> inquiry trains on the stage of the proceedings corresponding to Sheltons Cir-

            <em>

				 is further distinguishable for the related reason that the Court there applied a less exacting standard consistent with the traditional understanding of the sentencing process.  511 U. S., at 747.  Once guilt has been established, we noted in 
				<em>

				More significant, the sole issue at the hearingapart from determinations about the necessity of confinement, see Ala. Code §152254(d)(4) (1975)is whether the defendant breached the terms of probation.  See

				We think it plain that a hearing so timed and structured cannot compensate for the absence of trial counsel, for it does not even address the key 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> inquiry: whether the adjudication of guilt corresponding to the prison sentence is sufficiently reliable to permit incarceration.

        <p class="bodytext">
				In a variation on 
				<em>

				</em>
				 position, the dissent would limit review in this case to the question whether the

				Severing the analysis in this manner makes little sense.  One cannot assess the constitutionality of imposing a suspended sentence while simultaneously walling off the procedures that will precede its activation.

				There is not so much as a hint, however, in the decision of the Supreme Court of Alabama, that Sheltons probation term is separable from the prison term to which it was tethered.  Absent any prior presentation of the position the State now takes,

				 we resist passing on it in the first instance.  Our resistance to acting as a court of first view instead of one of review is heightened by the Alabama Attorney Generals acknowledgment at oral argument that he did not know of any State that imposes, postconviction, on a par with a fine, a term of probation unattached to a suspended sentence.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 8.  The novelty of the States current position is further marked by the unqualified statement in Alabamas opening brief that, [b]y reversing Sheltons suspended sentence, the [Supreme Court of Alabama] correspond-

				In short, Alabama has developed its position late in this litigation and before the wrong forum.  It is for the Alabama Supreme Court to consider before this Court does whether the suspended sentence alone is invalid, leaving Sheltons probation term freestanding and independently effective.

 (We are, of course, bound to accept the interpretation of [the States] law by the highest court of the State.).  We confine our review to the ruling the Alabama Supreme Court made in the case as presented to it: [A] defendant who receives a suspended or probated sentence

						  Shelton also appealed on a number of state-law grounds.  The Court of Criminal Appeals rejected all but one of those challenges, concluding that most had been procedurally defaulted in the trial court.  See App. 1425.  On one such challenge, the court remanded for further proceedings, id., at 23, but affirmed after the trial court ruled against Shelton on remand, id., at 29.

						 Justice Maddox dissented, stating that Shelton was not constitutionally entitled to counsel because he received only a suspended sentence and was not incarcerated.  App. 41.

						 In any event, the dissent is simply incorrect that our decision today effectively deprive[s] the State of th[e] option of placing an uncounseled defendant on probation, with incarceration conditioned on a guilty verdict following a trial de novo.  Post, at 4.  That option is the functional equivalent of pretrial probation, as to which we entertain no constitutional doubt.  See infra, at 1516, and n. 12.  


Regarding the dissents suggestion that other means of retesting (with assistance of counsel) the validity of the original conviction might suffice, post, at 5, n. 3, we doubt that providing counsel after the critical guilt adjudication stage [would] be of much help to a defendant, for the die is usually cast when judgment is entered on an uncounseled trial record.  Argersinger, 407 U. S., at 41 (Burger, C. J., concurring in result).  A large number of misdemeanor convictions take place in police or justice courts which are not courts of record.  Without a drastic change in the procedures of these courts, there would be no way for the defendant to demonstrate error in the original proceeding or reconstruct evidence lost in the intervening period.  Nichols, 511 U. S., at 748.  But we need not here decide whether or what procedural safeguards short of complete retrial at the probation revocation stage could satisfy the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a>, post, at 5; the minimal procedures Alabama does provide are plainly insufficient.

						Charging that we have miraculously divined how the Alabama justices would resolve a constitutional question, post, at 2, the dissent forgets that this case is here on writ of certiorari to the Alabama Supreme Court.  That court ruled in the decision under review that Sheltons sentence violates the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a>.  The Alabama Supreme Court has thus already spoken on the issue we now address, and in doing so expressed not the slightest hint that revocation-stage proceduresreal or imaginarywould affect the constitutional calculus.

						That ten States in this majority do not provide counsel to every defendant who receives a suspended sentence hardly supports the dissents dire predictions about the practical consequences of todays decision, see post, at 58, and n. 4.  The circumstances in which those States currently allow prosecution of misdemeanors without appointed counsel are quite narrow.  In Pennsylvania, for example, all defendants charged with misdemeanors enjoy a right to counsel regardless of the sentence imposed, Pa. Rule Crim. Proc. 122(B) (2002); only those charged with summary offenses (violations not technically considered crimes and punishable by no more than 90 days imprisonment, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. §106(c)(2) (1998)) may receive a suspended sentence uncounseled.  Pa. Rule Crim. Proc. 122(A) (2002); Commonwealth v. Thomas, 510 Pa. 106, 111, n. 7, 507 A. 2d 57, 59, n. 7 (1986).  (Typical summary offenses in Pennsylvania include the failure to return a library book within 30 days, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. §6708 (1998), and fishing on a Sunday, 30 Pa. Cons. Stat. §2104 (1998)).  Gaps in the misdemeanor defendants right to appointed counsel in other States that extend protection beyond the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> are similarly slight.  See, e.g., S. D. Codified Laws §§23A406.1, 2262(2) (1998) (defendant charged with misdemeanor enjoys absolute right to appointed counsel unless offense punishable by no more than 30 days imprisonment); Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann. §26.04(b)(3) (Supp. 2002) (counsel must be appointed to all misdemeanor defendants exceptthose tried before a judge who knows sentence will not includeimprisonment).  


More typical of the situation that results in a suspended sentence, we think, is a case like Sheltonsa prosecution before a jury for third-degree assault, arising out of a fistfight that followed a minor traffic accident, see App. 15, n. 2.  Far from quite irrelevant, post, at 6, that 34 States already provide an attorney in this situation strongly suggests that the added requirement of providing counsel routinely in suspended sentence cases will not prove unduly onerous.

						 Because this device is conditioned on the defendants consent, it does not raise the question whether imposition of probation alone so restrains a defendants liberty as to require provision of appointed counsel.  See Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers as Amicus Curiae 8; cf. Brief for Respondent 1316.

						There is thus only one significant difference between pretrial probation and the sensible option urged by the dissent, i.e., complete retrial of the misdemeanor violation with assistance of counsel upon a defendants violation of probation terms, post, at 4.  Pretrial probation is substantially less expensive: It permits incarceration after a single trial, whereas the dissents regime requires twoone (without counsel) to place the defendant on probation, and a second (with counsel) to trigger imprisonment.

						 Not until its Reply Brief did the State convey that, as it comprehends Argersinger and Scott, there is no possibility that Sheltons suspended sentence will be activated if he violates the terms of his probation.  Reply Brief 9.  Before the Supreme Court of Alabama, the States position coincided with the position now argued by amicus.  See States Brief and Argument on Petition for Writ of Certiorari to the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals, p. 31, and States Brief and Argument in Support of its Application for Rehearing, in No. 1990031 (Ala. Sup. Ct.), p. 32.

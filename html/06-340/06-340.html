        <h4 class="sylctb">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit</h4>
        <hr>
        <div class="opiniondates">No. 06340.Argued April 17, 2007Decided June 25, 2007*</div>
        <hr>
        <p class="bodytext">Under the Clean Water Act (CWA), petitioner Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) initially administers each States National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permitting program, but CWA §402(b) provides that the EPA shall approve transfer of permitting authority to a State upon application and a showing that the State has met nine specified criteria.  Section 7(a)(2) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) requires federal agencies to consult with agencies designated by the Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior to insure that a proposed agency action is unlikely to jeopardize an endangered or threatened species.  The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) administer the ESA.  Once a consultation process is complete, a written biological opinion is issued, which may suggest alternative actions to protect a jeopardized species or its critical habitat.  When Arizona officials sought EPA authorization to administer the States NPDES program, the EPA initiated consultation with the FWS to determine whether the transfer would adversely affect any listed species.  The FWS regional office wanted potential impacts taken into account, but the EPA disagreed, finding that §402(b)s mandatory nature stripped it of authority to disapprove a transfer based on any other considerations.  The dispute was referred to the agencies national offices for resolution.  The FWSs biological opinion concluded that the requested transfer would not jeopardize listed species.  The EPA concluded that Arizona had met each of §402(b)s nine criteria and approved the transfer, noting that the biological opinion had concluded the consultation required by ESA §7(a)(2).  Respondents sought review in the Ninth Circuit, petitioner National Association of Home Builders intervened, and part of respondent Defenders of Wildlifes separate action was consolidated with the suit.  The court held that the EPAs transfer approval was arbitrary and capricious because the EPA had relied on contradictory positions regarding its §7(a)(2) responsibilities during the administrative process.  Rather than remanding the case for the agency to explain its decision, however, the court reviewed the EPAs substantive construction of the statutes.  It did not dispute that Arizona had met CWA §402(b)s nine criteria, but nevertheless concluded that ESA §7(a)(2) required the EPA to determine whether its transfer decision would jeopardize listed species, in effect adding a tenth criterion.  The court dismissed the argument that the EPAs approval was not subject to §7(a)(2) because it was not a discretionary action under 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a>, §7(a)(2)s interpretative regulation.  The court thus vacated the EPAs transfer decision.</p>
        <p class="SYLCTE">Held:</p>
        <p class="SYLCTF">    1. The Ninth Circuits determination that the EPAs action was arbitrary and capricious is not fairly supported by the record.  This Court will not vacate an agencys decision under the arbitrary and capricious standard unless the agency relied on factors which Congress had not intended it to consider, entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.  <em>Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc.</em> v. <em>State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co.</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/463/29" class="subref" title="subref">463 U. S. 29</a>
            <em>.</em>  Here, the Ninth Circuit concluded that the EPAs decision was internally inconsistent in its statements during the review process.  Federal courts ordinarily are empowered to review only an agencys <em>final</em> action, and the fact that a local agency representatives preliminary determination is later overruled at a higher agency level does not render the decisionmaking process arbitrary and capricious.  The EPAs final approval notice stating that §7(a)(2)s required consultation process had been concluded may be inconsistent with its previously expressed positionand position in this litigationthat §7(a)(2)s consultation requirement is not triggered by a §402 transfer application, but that is not the type of error requiring a remand.  By the time the statement was issued, the EPA and FWS had already consulted, and the question whether that consultation had been <em>required </em>was not germane to the final agency decision.  Thus, this Court need not further delay the permitting authority transfer by remanding to the agency for clarification.  Respondents suggest that the EPA nullified their right to participate in the application proceedings by altering its legal position during the pendency of the transfer decision and its associated litigation, but they do not suggest that they were deprived of their right to comment during the comment period made available under the EPAs regulations.  Pp. 1014.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    2. Because §7(a)(2)s no-jeopardy duty covers only discretionary agency actions, it does not attach to actions (like the NPDES permitting transfer authorization) that an agency is <em>required</em> by statute to undertake once certain specified triggering events have occurred.  Pp. 1425.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">        (a) At first glance the legislative commands here are irreconcilable.  Section 402(b)s shall approve language is mandatory and its list exclusive; if the nine specified criteria are satisfied, the EPA does not have the discretion to deny a transfer application.  Section 7(a)(2)s similarly imperative language would literally add a tenth criterion to §402(b).  Pp. 1415.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">        (b) While a later enacted statute (such as the ESA) can sometimes operate to amend or even repeal an earlier statutory provision (such as the CWA), repeals by implication are not favored and will not be presumed unless the legislatures intention to repeal [is] clear and manifest.  <em>Watt</em> v. <em>Alaska</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/451/259" class="subref" title="subref">451 U. S. 259</a>.  Statutory repeal will not be inferred unless the later statute  expressly contradict[s] the original act  or such a construction  is absolutely necessary [to give the later statutes words] any meaning at all.    <em>Traynor</em> v. <em>Turnage</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/485/535" class="subref" title="subref">485 U. S. 535</a>.  Otherwise, a statute dealing with a narrow, precise, and specific subject is not submerged by a later enacted statute covering a more generalized spectrum.  <em>Radzanower</em> v. <em>Touche Ross &amp; Co.</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/426/148" class="subref" title="subref">426 U. S. 148</a>.  The Ninth Circuits reading of §7(a)(2) would effectively repeal §402(b)s mandate that the EPA shall issue a permit whenever all nine exclusive statutory prerequisites are met.  Section 402(b) does not just set <em>minimum</em> requirements; it affirmatively mandates a transfers approval, thus operating as a ceiling as well as a floor.  By adding an additional criterion, the Ninth Circuit raises that floor and alters the statutes command.  Read broadly, the Ninth Circuits construction would also partially override every federal statute mandating agency action by subjecting such action to the further condition that it not jeopardize listed species.  Pp. 1517.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">        (c) Title 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a>, promulgated by the NMFS and FWS and applying §7(a)(2) to all actions in which there is <em>discretionary</em> Federal involvement or control (emphasis added), harmonizes the CWA and ESA by giving effect to the ESAs no-jeopardy mandate whenever an agency has discretion to do so, but not when the agency is forbidden from considering such extrastatutory factors.  The Court owes some degree of deference to the Secretarys reasonable interpretation of the ESA, <em>Babbitt</em> v. <em>Sweet Home Chapter, Communities for Great Ore.</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/515/687" class="subref" title="subref">515 U. S. 687</a>.  Deference is not due if Congress has made its intent clear in the statutory text, <em>Chevron U. S. A. Inc.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/467/837" class="subref" title="subref">467 U. S. 837</a>, but if the statute is silent or ambiguous … the question … is whether the agencys answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute, <em>id.</em>, at 843.  Because the meaningor ambiguityof certain words or phrases may only become evident … in context, <em>FDA</em> v. <em>Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/529/120" class="subref" title="subref">529 U. S. 120</a>, §7(a)(2) must be read against the statutory backdrop of the many mandatory agency directives whose operation it would implicitly abrogate or repeal were it construed as broadly as the Ninth Circuit did below.  Such a reading leaves a fundamental ambiguity.  An agency cannot simultaneously obey the differing mandates of ESA §7(a)(2) and CWA §402(b), and consequently the statutory languageread in light of the canon against implied repealsdoes not itself provide clear guidance as to which command must give way.  Thus, it is appropriate to look to the implementing agencys expert interpretation, which harmonizes the statutes by applying §7(a)(2) to guide agencies existing discretionary authority, but not reading it to override express statutory mandates.  This interpretation is reasonable in light of the statutes text and the overall statutory scheme and is therefore entitled to <em>Chevron </em>deference.  The regulations focus on discretionary actions accords with the commonsense conclusion that, when an agency is <em>required </em>to do something by statute, it simply lacks the power to insure that such action will not jeopardize listed species.  The basic principle of <em>Department of Transportation</em> v. <em>Public Citizen</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/541/752" class="subref" title="subref">541 U. S. 752</a>that an agency cannot be considered the legal cause of an action that it has no statutory discretion <em>not </em>to take, <em>id.</em>,<em></em>at 770supports the reasonableness of the FWSs interpretation.  Pp. 1722.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">        (d) Respondents contrary position is not supported by<em> TVA</em> v. <em>Hill</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/437/153" class="subref" title="subref">437 U. S. 153</a>, which had no occasion to answer the question presented in these cases.  Pp. 2224.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">        (e) Also unavailing is the argument that EPAs decision to transfer NPDES permitting authority to Arizona represented a discretionary agency action.  While the EPA may exercise some judgment in determining whether a State has shown that it can carry out §402(b)s enumerated criteria, the statute clearly does not grant it the discretion to add another entirely separate prerequisite to that list.  Nothing in §402(b) authorizes the EPA to consider the protection of listed species as an end in itself when evaluating a transfer application.  And to the extent that some of §402(b)s criteria may result in environmental benefits to marine species, Arizona has satisfied each of those criteria.  Respondents argument has also been disclaimed by the FWS and the NMFS, the agencies primarily charged with administering §7(a)(2) and the drafters of the regulations implementing that section.

            <span class="smallcaps">Justice Alito</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    These cases concern the interplay between two federal environmental statutes.  Section 402(b) of the Clean Water Act requires that the Environmental Protection Agency transfer certain permitting powers to state authorities upon an application and a showing that nine specified criteria have been met.  Section 7(a)(2) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 provides that a federal agency must consult with agencies designated by the Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior in order to insure that any action authorized, funded, or carried out by such agency … is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species.  The question presented is whether §7(a)(2) effectively operates as a tenth criterion on which the transfer of permitting power under the first statute must be conditioned.  We conclude that it does not.  The transfer of permitting authority to state authoritieswho will exercise that authority under continuing federal oversight to ensure compliance with relevant mandates of the Endangered Species Act and other federal environmental protection statuteswas proper.  We therefore reverse the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</p>

However, the FWS office was concerned that the transfer could result in the issuance of more discharge permits, which would lead to more development, which in turn could have an indirect adverse effect on the habitat of certain upland species, such as the cactus ferruginous pygmy-owl and the Pima pineapple cactus.  Specifically, the FWS feared that, because §7(a)(2)s consultation requirement does not apply to permitting decisions by state<em></em>authorities,<a name="ZO-4ref" href="#ZO-4" class="">

                </sup>
            </a> the transfer of authority would empower Arizona officials to issue individual permits without considering and mitigating their indirect impact on these upland species.  <em>Id.,</em> at 565566.  The FWS regional office therefore urged that, in considering the proposed transfer of permitting authority, those involved in the consultation process should take these potential indirect impacts into account.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The EPA disagreed, maintaining that its approval action, which is an administrative transfer of authority, [would not be] the cause of future non-discharge-related impacts on endangered species from projects requiring State NPDES permits.  <em>Id.,</em> at 564.  As a factual matter, the EPA believed that the link between the transfer of permitting authority and the potential harm that could result from increased development was too attenuated.  <em>Id.</em>, at 654.  And as a legal matter, the EPA concluded that the mandatory nature of CWA §402(b)which directs that the EPA shall approve a transfer request if that sections nine statutory criteria are metstripped it of authority to disapprove a transfer based on any other considerations.  <em>Id.</em>, at 654655.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Pursuant to procedures set forth in a memorandum of understanding between the agencies, the dispute was referred to the agencies national offices for resolution.  In December 2002, the FWS issued its biological opinion, which concluded that the requested transfer would not cause jeopardy to listed species.  The opinion reasoned that the loss of section 7-related conservation benefits . . . is not an indirect effect of the authorization action, <em>id.,</em> at 117, because</p>
        <p class="bodytext">loss of any conservation benefit is not caused by EPAs decision to approve the State of Arizonas program.  Rather, the absence of the section 7 process that exists with respect to Federal NPDES permits reflects Congress decision to grant States the right to administer these programs under state law provided the States program meets the requirements of [§]402(b) of the Clean Water Act.  <em>Id.,</em> at 114.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In addition, the FWS opined that the EPAs continuing oversight of Arizonas permitting program, along with other statutory protections, would adequately protect listed species and their habitats following the transfer.  <em>Id.</em>, at 101107.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The EPA concluded that Arizona had met each of the nine statutory criteria listed in §402(b) and approved the transfer of permitting authority.  In the notice announcing the approval of the transfer, the EPA noted that the issuance of the FWSs biological opinion had conclude[d] the consultation process required by ESA section 7(a)(2) and reflects the [FWS] agreement with EPA that the approval of the State program meets the substantive requirements of the ESA.  <em>Id.,</em> at 73.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">2</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    On April 2, 2003, respondents filed a petition in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit seeking review of the transfer pursuant to 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1369.html#b_1_D" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §1369(b)(1)(D)</a>, which allows private parties to seek direct review of the EPAs determinations regarding state permitting programs in the federal courts of appeals.  The court granted petitioner National Association of Homebuilders leave to intervene as a respondent in that case.  Respondent Defenders of Wildlife also filed a separate action in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, alleging, among other things, that the biological opinion issued by the FWS in support of the proposed transfer did not comply with the ESAs standards.  The District Court severed that claim and transferred it to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which consolidated the case with the suit challenging the EPA transfer.  See 420 F. 3d 946 (2005).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    A divided panel of the Ninth Circuit held that the EPAs approval of the transfer was arbitrary and capricious because the EPA relied during the administrative proceedings on legally contradictory positions regarding its section 7 obligations.  <em>Id.,</em> at 959.  The court concluded that the EPA fail[ed] to understand its own authority under section 7(a)(2) to act on behalf of listed species and their habitat, <em>id.</em>, at 977, because the two propositions that underlie the EPAs actionthat (1) it must, under the [ESA], consult concerning transfers of CWA permitting authority, but (2) it is not permitted, as a matter of law, to take into account the impact on listed species in making the transfer decisioncannot both be true, <em>id.</em>, at 961.  The court therefore concluded that it was required to remand to the agency for a plausible explanation of its decision, based on a single, coherent interpretation of the statute.  <em>Id.</em>, at 962.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The panel majority, however, did not follow this course of action.  Rather, the panel went on to review the EPAs substantive construction of the statutes at issue and held that the ESA granted the EPA both the power and the duty to determine whether its transfer decision would jeopardize threatened or endangered species.  The panel did not dispute that Arizona had met the nine criteria set forth in §402(b) of the CWA, but the panel nevertheless concluded that §7(a)(2) of the ESA provided an affirmative grant of authority to attend to [the] protection of listed species, <em>id.</em>, at 965, in effect adding a tenth criterion to those specified in §402(b).  The panel dismissed the argument that the EPAs approval of the transfer application was not subject to §7(a)(2) because it was not a discretionary action within the meaning of 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a> (interpreting §7(a)(2) to apply only to agency actions in which there is discretionary Federal involvement and control).  420 F. 3d, at 967969.  It viewed the FWSs regulation as merely coterminous with the express statutory language encompassing all agency actions that are  authorized, funded, or carried out  by the agency.  <em>Id.</em>, at 969 (quoting 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#a_2" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(a)(2)</a>).  On these grounds, the court granted the petition and vacated the EPAs transfer decision.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In dissent, Judge Thompson explained that the transfer decision was not a discretionary action under 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a> because [t]he Clean Water Act, by its very terms, permits the EPA to consider only the nine specified factors.  If a states proposed permitting program meets the enumerated requirements, he reasoned, the EPA administrator shall approve the program.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1342.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §1342(b)</a>.  This [c]ongressional directive does not permit the EPA to impose additional conditions.  420 F. 3d, at 980.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Ninth Circuit denied rehearing and rehearing en banc.  450 F. 3d 394 (2006). <em></em>Writing for the six judges who dissented from the denial of rehearing en banc, Judge Kozinski disagreed with the panels conclusion that the EPAs analysis was so internally inconsistent as to be arbitrary and capricious.  He further noted that, if the panel was correct on this point, the proper resolution would have been to remand to the EPA for further explanation.  <em>Id.,</em> at 396398.  On the statutory question, Judge Kozinski echoed Judge Thompsons conclusion that once the nine criteria set forth in §402(b) of the CWA are satisfied, a transfer is mandatory and nondiscretionary.  <em>Id.</em>, at 397399.  He rejected the panel majoritys broad construction of ESA §7(a)(2), concluding that [i]f the ESA were as powerful as the majority contends, it would modify not only the EPAs obligation under the CWA, but <em>every</em> categorical mandate applicable to <em>every </em>federal agency.  <em>Id.</em>, at 399, n. 4.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Ninth Circuits construction of §7(a)(2) is at odds with that of other Courts of Appeals.  Compare 420 F. 3d 946 (case below), with <em>Platte River Whooping Crane Critical Habitat Maintenance Trust</em> v. <em>FERC</em>, 962 F. 2d 27, 3334 (CADC 1992), and <em>American Forest &amp; Paper Association</em> v. <em>EPA</em>, 137 F. 3d 291, 298299 (CA5 1998).  We granted certiorari to resolve this conflict, 549 U. S. ___ (2007), and we now reverse.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">II</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Before addressing this question of statutory interpretation, however, we first consider whether the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the EPAs transfer decision was arbitrary and capricious because, in that courts words, the agencies involved in the decision relied … on legally contradictory positions regarding [their] section 7 obligations.  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06340, at 23.  </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    As an initial matter, we note that if the EPAs action was arbitrary and capricious, as the Ninth Circuit held, the proper course would have been to remand to the agency for clarification of its reasons.  See <em>Gonzales</em> v. <em>Thomas</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/547/183" class="subref" title="subref">547 U. S. 183</a> (2006)
<em>(per curiam)</em>.  Indeed, the court below expressly recognized that this finding required it to remand to the agency for a plausible explanation of its decision, based on a single, coherent interpretation of the statute.  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06340, at 28.  But the Ninth Circuit did not take this course; instead, it jumped ahead to resolve the merits of the dispute.  In so doing, it erroneously deprived the agency of its usual administrative avenue for explaining and reconciling the arguably contradictory rationales that sometimes appear in the course of lengthy and complex administrative decisions.  We need not examine this question further, however, because we conclude that the Ninth Circuits determination that the EPAs action was arbitrary and capricious is not fairly supported by the record.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Review under the arbitrary and capricious standard is deferential; we will not vacate an agencys decision unless it</p>
        <p class="bodytext">has relied on factors which Congress had not intended it to consider, entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.  <em>Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">286</a> (1974)
).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court of Appeals concluded that the EPAs decision was internally inconsistent because, in its view, the agency statedboth during preliminary review of Arizonas transfer application and in the Federal Register notice memorializing its final actionthat section 7 requires consultation regarding the effect of a permitting transfer on listed species.  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06340, at 23.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    With regard to the various statements made by the involved agencies regional offices during the early stages of consideration, the only inconsistency respondents can point to is the fact that the agencies changed their mindssomething that, as long as the proper procedures were followed, they were fully entitled to do.  The federal courts ordinarily are empowered to review only an agencys <em>final</em> action, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/5/704.html" class="subref" title="subref">5 U. S. C. §704</a>, and the fact that a preliminary determination by a local agency representative is later overruled at a higher level within the agency does not render the decisionmaking process arbitrary and capricious.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Respondents also point to the final Federal Register notice memorializing the EPAs approval of Arizonas transfer application.  This notice stated that the FWSs issuance of its biological opinion had conclude[d] the consultation process required by ESA section 7(a)(2).  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06340, at 73.  Respondents contend that this statement is inconsistent with the EPAs previously expressed positionand their position throughout this litigationthat §7(a)(2)s consultation requirement is not triggered by a transfer application under §402 of the CWA.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    We are not persuaded that this statement constitutes the type of error that requires a remand.  By the time the Federal Register statement was issued, the EPA had already consulted with the FWS about the Arizona application, and the question whether that consultation had been <em>required</em>, as opposed to voluntarily undertaken by the agency, was simply not germane to the final agency transfer decision.  The Federal Register statement, in short, was dictum, and it had no bearing on the final agency action that respondents challenge.  Mindful of Congress admonition that in reviewing agency action, due account shall be taken of the rule of prejudicial error, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/5/706.html" class="subref" title="subref">5 U. S. C. §706</a>, we do not believe that this stray statement, which could have had no effect on the underlying agency action being challenged, requires that we further delay the transfer of permitting authority to Arizona by remanding to the agency for clarification.  See also <em>PDK Labs., Inc. </em>v. <em>United States Drug Enforcement Admin.</em>, 362 F. 3d 786, 799 (CADC 2004) (In administrative law, as in federal civil and criminal litigation, there is a harmless error rule).<a name="ZO-5ref" href="#ZO-5" class="">

        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    We further disagree with respondents suggestion that, by allegedly altering its legal position while the Arizona transfer decision and its associated litigation was pending, the EPA is effectively nullifying respondents rights to participate in administrative proceedings concerning Arizonas application, and particularly respondents rights under EPAs own regulations to comment on NPDES transfer applications.  Brief for Respondents 28 (citing 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/40/123" class="subref" title="subref">40 CFR §123.61</a>(b); emphasis deleted).  Consistent with EPA regulations, the agency made available a comment period of not less than 45 days during which interested members of the public [could] express their views on the State program.  §123.61(a)(1).  Respondents do not suggest that they were deprived of their right to comment during this period.<a name="ZO-6ref" href="#ZO-6" class="">

        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Respondents also contend that if the case were remanded to the EPA, they would raise additional challengesincluding, for example, a challenge to the EPAs provision of financial assistance to Arizona for the administration of its NPDES program.  However, as explained below, any such agency action is separate and independent of the agencys decision to authorize the transfer of permitting authority pursuant to §402(b).  See n. 11, <em>infra</em>.  We express no opinion as to the viability of a separate administrative or legal challenge to such actions.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">III</p>
        <p class="opcentered">A</p>
        <p class="bodytext">We turn now to the substantive statutory question raised by the petitions, a question that requires us to mediate a clash of seemingly categoricaland, at first glance, irreconcilablelegislative commands.  Section 402(b) of the CWA provides, without qualification, that the EPA shall approve a transfer application unless it determines that the State lacks adequate authority to perform the nine functions specified in the section.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1342.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §1342(b)</a>.  By its terms, the statutory language is mandatory and the list exclusive; if the nine specified criteria are satisfied, the EPA does not have the discretion to deny a transfer application.

Neither respondents nor the Ninth Circuit has ever disputed that Arizona satisfied each of these nine criteria.  See 420 F. 3d, at 963, n. 11; Brief for Respondents 19, n. 8.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The language of §7(a)(2) of the ESA is similarly imperative: it provides that [e]ach Federal agency shall, in consultation with and with the assistance of the Secretary, insure that any action authorized, funded, or carried out by such agency . . . is not likely to jeopardize endangered or threatened species or their habitats.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#a_2" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(a)(2)</a>.  This mandate is to be carried out through consultation and may require the agency to adopt an alternative course of action.  As the author of the panel opinion below recognized, applying this language literally would <em>ad[d]</em> one [additional] requirement to the list of considerations under the Clean Water Act permitting transfer provision.  450 F. 3d, at 404, n. 2 (Berzon, J., concurring in denial of rehearing en banc) (emphasis in original).  That is, it would effectively repeal the mandatory and exclusive list of criteria set forth in §402(b), and replace it with a new, expanded list that includes §7(a)(2)s no-jeopardy requirement.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    Here, reading §7(a)(2) as the Court of Appeals did would effectively repeal §402(b)s statutory mandate by engrafting a tenth criterion onto the CWA.<a name="ZO-7ref" href="#ZO-7" class="">

Thus, §402(b) does not just set forth <em>minimum</em> requirements for the transfer of permitting authority; it affirmatively mandates that the transfer shall be approved if the specified criteria are met.  The provision operates as a ceiling as well as a floor.  By adding an additional criterion, the Ninth Circuits construction of §7(a)(2) raises that floor and alters §402(b)s statutory command.<a name="ZO-8ref" href="#ZO-8" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    The Ninth Circuits reading of §7(a)(2) would not only abrogate §402(b)s statutory mandate, but also result in the implicit repeal of many additional otherwise categorical statutory commands.  Section 7(a)(2) by its terms applies to any action authorized, funded, or carried out by a federal agencycovering, in effect, almost anything that an agency might do.  Reading the provision broadly would thus partially override every federal statute mandating agency action by subjecting such action to the further condition that it pose no jeopardy to endangered species.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Platte River Whooping Crane Critical Habitat Maintenance Trust</em> v. <em>FERC</em>, 962 F. 2d, at 3334 (considering whether §7(a)(2) overrides the Federal Power Acts prohibition on amending annual power licenses).  While the language of §7(a)(2) does not explicitly repeal any provision of the CWA (or any other statute), reading it for all that it might be worth runs foursquare into our presumption against implied repeals.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">C</p>
        <p class="opcentered">1</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The agencies charged with implementing the ESA have attempted to resolve this tension through regulations implementing §7(a)(2).  The NMFS and FWS, acting jointly on behalf of the Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior and following notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures, have promulgated a regulation stating that Section 7 and the requirements of this part apply to all actions in which there is <em>discretionary</em> Federal involvement or control.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a> (emphasis added).  Pursuant to this regulation, §7(a)(2) would not be read as impliedly repealing nondiscretionary statutory mandates, even when they might result in some agency action.  Rather, the ESAs requirements would come into play only when an action results from the exercise of agency discretion.  This interpretation harmonizes the statutes by giving effect to the ESAs no-jeopardy mandate whenever an agency has discretion to do so, but not when the agency is forbidden from considering such extrastatutory factors.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    We have recognized that [t]he latitude the ESA gives the Secretary in enforcing the statute, together with the degree of regulatory expertise necessary to its enforcement, establishes that we owe some degree of deference to the Secretarys reasonable interpretation of the statutory scheme.  <em>Babbitt</em> v. <em>Sweet Home Chapter, Communities for Great Ore.</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    We must therefore read §7(a)(2) of the ESA against the statutory backdrop of the many mandatory agency directives whose operation it would implicitly abrogate or repeal if it were construed as broadly as the Ninth Circuit did below.  When §7(a)(2) is read this way, we are left with a fundamental ambiguity that is not resolved by the statutory text.  An agency cannot simultaneously obey the differing mandates set forth in §7(a)(2) of the ESA and §402(b) of the CWA, and consequently the statutory languageread in light of the canon against implied repealsdoes not itself provide clear guidance as to which command must give way.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In this situation, it is appropriate to look to the implementing agencys expert interpretation, which cabins §7(a)(2)s application to actions in which there is discretionary Federal involvement or control.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a>.  This reading harmonizes the statutes by applying §7(a)(2) to guide agencies existing discretionary authority, but not reading it to override express statutory mandates.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">2</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    We conclude that this interpretation is reasonable in light of the statutes text and the overall statutory scheme, and that it is therefore entitled to deference under <em>Chevron</em>.  Section 7(a)(2) requires that an agency insure that the actions it authorizes, funds, or carries out are not likely to jeopardize listed species or their habitats.  To insure somethingas the court below recognizedmeans  [t]o make certain, to secure, to guarantee (some thing, event, etc.).   420 F. 3d, at 963 (quoting 7 Oxford English Dictionary 1059 (2d ed. 1989)).  The regulations focus on discretionary actions accords with the commonsense conclusion that, when an agency is <em>required </em>to do something by statute, it simply lacks the power to insure that such action will not jeopardize endangered species.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This reasoning is supported by our decision in <em>Department of Transportation</em> v. <em>Public Citizen</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/541/752" class="subref" title="subref">541 U. S. 752</a> (2004)
.  That case concerned safety regulations that were promulgated by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) and had the effect of triggering a Presidential directive allowing Mexican trucks to ply their trade on United States roads.  The Court held that the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) did not require the agency to assess the environmental effects of allowing the trucks entry because the legally relevant cause of the entry of the Mexican trucks is <em>not </em>FMCSAs action, but instead the actions of the President in lifting the moratorium and those of Congress in granting the President this authority while simultaneously limiting FMCSAs discretion.  <em>Id.</em>,<em></em>at 769 (emphasis in original).  The Court concluded that where an agency has no ability to prevent a certain effect due to its limited statutory authority over the relevant actions, the agency cannot be considered a legally relevant cause of the effect.  <em>Id.</em>,<em></em>at 770.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    We do not suggest that <em>Public Citizen </em>controls the outcome here; §7(a)(2), unlike NEPA, imposes a substantive (and not just a procedural) statutory requirement, and these cases involve agency action more directly related to environmental concerns than the FMCSAs truck safety regulations.  But the basic principle announced in <em>Public Citizen</em>that an agency cannot be considered the legal cause of an action that it has no statutory discretion <em>not </em>to takesupports the reasonableness of the FWSs interpretation of §7(a)(2) as reaching only discretionary agency actions.

        <p class="opcentered">3</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The court below simply disregarded §402.03s interpretation of the ESAs reach, dismissing the regulations reference to discretionary … involvement  as merely congruent with the statutory reference to actions authorized, funded, or carried out by the agency.  420 F. 3d, 968.  But this reading cannot be right.  Agency discretion presumes that an agency can exercise judgment in connection with a particular action.  See <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc.</em> v. <em>Volpe</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/401/402" class="subref" title="subref">401 U. S. 402</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">415</a>416 (1971)
; see also Random House Dictionary of the English Language 411 (unabridged ed. 1967) (discretion defined as the power or right to decide or act according to ones own judgment; freedom of judgment or choice).  As the mandatory language of §402(b) itself illustrates, not every action authorized, funded, or carried out by a federal agency is a product of that agencys exercise of discretion.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The dissents interpretation of §402.03 is similarly implausible.  The dissent would read the regulation as simply clarifying that discretionary agency actions are included within the scope of §7(a)(2), but not confining the statutes reach to such actions.  See <em>post</em>, at 711.  But this reading would render the regulation entirely superfluous.  Nothing in either §7(a)(2) or the other agency regulations interpreting that section, see §402.02, suggests that discretionary actions are <em>excluded</em> from the scope of the ESA, and there is thus no need for a separate regulation to bring them within the statutes scope.  On the dissents reading, §402.03s reference to discretionary federal involvement is mere surplusage, and we have cautioned against reading a text in a way that makes part of it redundant.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>TRW Inc.</em> v. <em>Andrews</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/534/19" class="subref" title="subref">534 U. S. 19</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">31</a> (2001)
.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This history of the regulation also supports the reading  to which we defer today.  As the dissent itself points out, the proposed version of §402.03 initially stated that Section 7 and the requirements of this Part apply to <em>all actions in which there is Federal involvement or control</em>, 
48Fed. Reg.
29999 (1983) (emphasis added); the Secretary of the Interior modified this language to provide (as adopted in the Final Rule now at issue) that the statuory requirements apply to all actions in which there is <em>discretionary</em> Federal involvement or control, 
51Fed. Reg.
19958 (1986) (emphasis added).  The dissents reading would  rob the word discretionary of any effect, and substitute the earlier, proposed version of the regulation for the text that was actually adopted.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In short, we read §402.03 to mean what it says: that §7(a)(2)s no-jeopardy duty covers only discretionary agency actions and does not attach to actions (like the NPDES permitting transfer authorization) that an agency is <em>required</em> by statute to undertake once certain specified triggering events have occurred.  This reading not only is reasonable, inasmuch as it gives effect to the ESAs provision, but also comports with the canon against implied repeals because it stays §7(a)(2)s mandate where it would effectively override otherwise mandatory statutory duties.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    Respondents argue that our opinion in <em>TVA</em> v. <em>Hill</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/437/153" class="subref" title="subref">437 U. S. 153</a> (1978)
, supports their contrary position.  In that case, we held that the ESA prohibited the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) from putting into operation the Tellico Damdespite the fact that the agency had already spent over $100 million on the nearly completed projectbecause doing so would have threatened the critical habitat of the endangered snail darter.  In language on which respondents rely, the Court concluded that the ordinary meaning of §7 of the ESA contained no exemptions and reflected a conscious decision by Congress to give endangered species priority over the primary missions of federal agencies.  <em>Id.</em>, at 173, 185, 188.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>TVA </em>v. <em>Hill</em>, however, had no occasion to answer the question presented in these cases.  That case was decided almost a decade before the adoption in 1986 of the regulations contained in 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a>.  And in any event, the construction project at issue in <em>TVA </em>v. <em>Hill</em>, while expensive, was also discretionary.  The TVA argued that by continuing to make lump-sum appropriations to the TVA, some of which were informally earmarked for the Tellico Dam project, Congress had implicitly repealed §7s no-jeopardy requirement as it applied to that project.  See 437 U. S., at 189193.  The Court rejected this argument, concluding that [t]he Appropriations Acts did not themselves identify the projects for which the sums had been appropriated and that reports by congressional committees allegedly directing the TVA to complete the project lacked the force of law.  <em>Id.</em>, at 189, n. 35.  Central to the Courts decision was the conclusion that Congress did not <em>mandate</em> that the TVA put the dam into operation; there was no statutory command to that effect; and there was therefore no basis for contending that applying the ESAs no-jeopardy requirement would implicitly repeal another affirmative congressional directive.<a name="ZO-9ref" href="#ZO-9" class="">

            <em>TVA </em>v. <em>Hill</em> thus supports the position, expressed in §402.03, that the ESAs no-jeopardy mandate applies to every <em>discretionary</em> agency actionregardless of the expense or burden its application might impose.  But that case did not speak to the question whether §7(a)(2) applies to <em>non</em>-discretionary actions, like the one at issue here.  The regulation set forth in 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a> addressed that question, and we defer to its reasonable interpretation.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">IV</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Finally, respondents and their <em>amici</em> argue that, even if §7(a)(2) is read to apply only to discretionary agency actions, the decision to transfer NPDES permitting authority to Arizona represented such an exercise of discretion.  They contend that the EPAs decision to authorize a transfer is not entirely mechanical; that it involves some exercise of judgment as to whether a State has met the criteria set forth in §402(b); and that these criteria incorporate references to wildlife conservation that bring consideration of §7(a)(2)s no-jeopardy mandate properly within the agencys discretion.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The argument is unavailing.  While the EPA may exercise some judgment in determining whether a State has demonstrated that it has the authority to carry out §402(b)s enumerated statutory criteria, the statute clearly does not grant it the discretion to add another entirely separate prerequisite to that list.  Nothing in the text of §402(b) authorizes the EPA to consider the protection of threatened or endangered species as an end in itself when evaluating a transfer application.  And to the extent that some of the §402(b) criteria may result in environmental benefits to marine species,<a name="ZO-10ref" href="#ZO-10" class="">

            </a> there is no dispute that Arizona has satisfied each of those statutory criteria.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Respondents argument has been disclaimed not only by the EPA, but also by the FWS and the NMFS, the two agencies primarily charged with administering §7(a)(2) and the drafters of the regulations implementing that section. Each agency recently issued a formal letter concluding that the authorization of an NPDES permitting transfer is not the kind of discretionary agency action that is covered by §402.03.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06549, at 103a116a.  An agencys interpretation of the meaning of its own regulations is entitled to deference unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation, <em>Auer</em> v. <em>Robbins</em>,

Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and these cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>

In response, both the FWS and the NMFS confirmed their understanding that there is no need to conduct Section 7 consultations on proposed actions to approve State NPDES programs because such actions are not the cause of any impact on listed species and do not constitute discretionary federal agency actions to which Section 7 applies.  Id., at 107a; see also id., at 116a (NMFS concur[s] with EPAs conclusion that EPA is not required to engage in section 7 consultation on applications to approve State programs in situations under Section 402(b) of the CWA).

For example, it suggests that the EPA could condition transfers of permitting authority on the States acceptance of additional continuing oversight by the EPA (presumably beyond that oversight already contemplated by the CWAs statutory language).  Post, at 1719.  But such a take-it-or-leave-it approach, no less than a straightforward rejection of a transfer application, would impose conditions on an NPDES transfer beyond those set forth in §402(b), and thus alter the CWAs statutory command.

However, assuming this is true, any such funding decision is a separate agency action that is outside the scope of this lawsuit.  Respondents also point to the fact that, following the transfer of permitting authority, the EPA will retain oversight authority over the state permitting process, including the power to object to proposed permits.  But the fact that the EPA may exercise discretionary oversight authoritywhich may trigger §7(a)(2)s consultation and no-jeopardy obligationsafter the transfer does not mean that the decision authorizing the transfer is itself discretionary.

            <span class="smallcaps">Justice Alito</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    These cases concern the interplay between two federal environmental statutes.  Section 402(b) of the Clean Water Act requires that the Environmental Protection Agency transfer certain permitting powers to state authorities upon an application and a showing that nine specified criteria have been met.  Section 7(a)(2) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 provides that a federal agency must consult with agencies designated by the Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior in order to insure that any action authorized, funded, or carried out by such agency … is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species.  The question presented is whether §7(a)(2) effectively operates as a tenth criterion on which the transfer of permitting power under the first statute must be conditioned.  We conclude that it does not.  The transfer of permitting authority to state authoritieswho will exercise that authority under continuing federal oversight to ensure compliance with relevant mandates of the Endangered Species Act and other federal environmental protection statuteswas proper.  We therefore reverse the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</p>

            <em>et seq.</em>, is intended to protect and conserve endangered and threatened species and their habitats.  Section 4 of the ESA directs the Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior to list threatened and endangered species and to designate their critical habitats.  §1533.  The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) administers the ESA with respect to species under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Interior, while the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) administers the ESA with respect to species under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Commerce.

        <p class="bodytext">    Section 7 of the ESA prescribes the steps that federal agencies must take to ensure that their actions do not jeopardize endangered wildlife and flora.  Section 7(a)(2) provides that [e]ach Federal agency shall, in consultation with and with the assistance of the Secretary [of Commerce or the Interior], insure that any action authorized, funded, or carried out by such agency (hereinafter in this section referred to as an agency action) is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species.

        <p class="bodytext">    Once the consultation process contemplated by §7(a)(2) has been completed, the Secretary is required to give the agency a written biological opinion setting forth the Secretarys opinion, and a summary of the information on which the opinion is based, detailing how the agency action affects the species or its critical habitat.  §1536(b)(3)(A); see also 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.14</a>(h).  If the Secretary concludes that the agency action would place the listed species in jeopardy or adversely modify its critical habitat, the Secretary shall suggest those reasonable and prudent alternatives which he believes would not violate [§7(a)(2)] and can be taken by the Federal agency … in implementing the agency action.  16 U.

        <p class="bodytext">    In February 2002, Arizona officials applied for EPA authorization to administer that States NPDES program.<a name="ZO-3ref" href="#ZO-3" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>3</b>
                </sup>
            </a>  The EPA initiated consultation with the FWS to determine whether the transfer of permitting authority would adversely affect any listed species.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The FWS regional office concluded that the transfer of authority would not cause any direct impact on water quality that would adversely affect listed species.  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06340, p. 564.  However, the FWS office was concerned that the transfer could result in the issuance of more discharge permits, which would lead to more development, which in turn could have an indirect adverse effect on the habitat of certain upland species, such as the cactus ferruginous pygmy-owl and the Pima pineapple cactus.  Specifically, the FWS feared that, because §7(a)(2)s consultation requirement does not apply to permitting decisions by state<em></em>authorities,<a name="ZO-4ref" href="#ZO-4" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>4</b>
                </sup>
            </a> the transfer of authority would empower Arizona officials to issue individual permits without considering and mitigating their indirect impact on these upland species.  <em>Id.,</em> at 565566.  The FWS regional office therefore urged that, in considering the proposed transfer of permitting authority, those involved in the consultation process should take these potential indirect impacts into account.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The EPA disagreed, maintaining that its approval action, which is an administrative transfer of authority, [would not be] the cause of future non-discharge-related impacts on endangered species from projects requiring State NPDES permits.  <em>Id.,</em> at 564.  As a factual matter, the EPA believed that the link between the transfer of permitting authority and the potential harm that could result from increased development was too attenuated.  <em>Id.</em>, at 654.  And as a legal matter, the EPA concluded that the mandatory nature of CWA §402(b)which directs that the EPA shall approve a transfer request if that sections nine statutory criteria are metstripped it of authority to disapprove a transfer based on any other considerations.  <em>Id.</em>, at 654655.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Pursuant to procedures set forth in a memorandum of understanding between the agencies, the dispute was referred to the agencies national offices for resolution.  In December 2002, the FWS issued its biological opinion, which concluded that the requested transfer would not cause jeopardy to listed species.  The opinion reasoned that the loss of section 7-related conservation benefits . . . is not an indirect effect of the authorization action, <em>id.,</em> at 117, because</p>
        <p class="bodytext">loss of any conservation benefit is not caused by EPAs decision to approve the State of Arizonas program.  Rather, the absence of the section 7 process that exists with respect to Federal NPDES permits reflects Congress decision to grant States the right to administer these programs under state law provided the States program meets the requirements of [§]402(b) of the Clean Water Act.  <em>Id.,</em> at 114.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In addition, the FWS opined that the EPAs continuing oversight of Arizonas permitting program, along with other statutory protections, would adequately protect listed species and their habitats following the transfer.  <em>Id.</em>, at 101107.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The EPA concluded that Arizona had met each of the nine statutory criteria listed in §402(b) and approved the transfer of permitting authority.  In the notice announcing the approval of the transfer, the EPA noted that the issuance of the FWSs biological opinion had conclude[d] the consultation process required by ESA section 7(a)(2) and reflects the [FWS] agreement with EPA that the approval of the State program meets the substantive requirements of the ESA.  <em>Id.,</em> at 73.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">2</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    On April 2, 2003, respondents filed a petition in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit seeking review of the transfer pursuant to 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1369.html#b_1_D" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §1369(b)(1)(D)</a>, which allows private parties to seek direct review of the EPAs determinations regarding state permitting programs in the federal courts of appeals.  The court granted petitioner National Association of Homebuilders leave to intervene as a respondent in that case.  Respondent Defenders of Wildlife also filed a separate action in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, alleging, among other things, that the biological opinion issued by the FWS in support of the proposed transfer did not comply with the ESAs standards.  The District Court severed that claim and transferred it to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which consolidated the case with the suit challenging the EPA transfer.  See 420 F. 3d 946 (2005).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    A divided panel of the Ninth Circuit held that the EPAs approval of the transfer was arbitrary and capricious because the EPA relied during the administrative proceedings on legally contradictory positions regarding its section 7 obligations.  <em>Id.,</em> at 959.  The court concluded that the EPA fail[ed] to understand its own authority under section 7(a)(2) to act on behalf of listed species and their habitat, <em>id.</em>, at 977, because the two propositions that underlie the EPAs actionthat (1) it must, under the [ESA], consult concerning transfers of CWA permitting authority, but (2) it is not permitted, as a matter of law, to take into account the impact on listed species in making the transfer decisioncannot both be true, <em>id.</em>, at 961.  The court therefore concluded that it was required to remand to the agency for a plausible explanation of its decision, based on a single, coherent interpretation of the statute.  <em>Id.</em>, at 962.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The panel majority, however, did not follow this course of action.  Rather, the panel went on to review the EPAs substantive construction of the statutes at issue and held that the ESA granted the EPA both the power and the duty to determine whether its transfer decision would jeopardize threatened or endangered species.  The panel did not dispute that Arizona had met the nine criteria set forth in §402(b) of the CWA, but the panel nevertheless concluded that §7(a)(2) of the ESA provided an affirmative grant of authority to attend to [the] protection of listed species, <em>id.</em>, at 965, in effect adding a tenth criterion to those specified in §402(b).  The panel dismissed the argument that the EPAs approval of the transfer application was not subject to §7(a)(2) because it was not a discretionary action within the meaning of 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a> (interpreting §7(a)(2) to apply only to agency actions in which there is discretionary Federal involvement and control).  420 F. 3d, at 967969.  It viewed the FWSs regulation as merely coterminous with the express statutory language encompassing all agency actions that are  authorized, funded, or carried out  by the agency.  <em>Id.</em>, at 969 (quoting 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#a_2" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(a)(2)</a>).  On these grounds, the court granted the petition and vacated the EPAs transfer decision.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In dissent, Judge Thompson explained that the transfer decision was not a discretionary action under 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a> because [t]he Clean Water Act, by its very terms, permits the EPA to consider only the nine specified factors.  If a states proposed permitting program meets the enumerated requirements, he reasoned, the EPA administrator shall approve the program.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1342.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §1342(b)</a>.  This [c]ongressional directive does not permit the EPA to impose additional conditions.  420 F. 3d, at 980.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Ninth Circuit denied rehearing and rehearing en banc.  450 F. 3d 394 (2006). <em></em>Writing for the six judges who dissented from the denial of rehearing en banc, Judge Kozinski disagreed with the panels conclusion that the EPAs analysis was so internally inconsistent as to be arbitrary and capricious.  He further noted that, if the panel was correct on this point, the proper resolution would have been to remand to the EPA for further explanation.  <em>Id.,</em> at 396398.  On the statutory question, Judge Kozinski echoed Judge Thompsons conclusion that once the nine criteria set forth in §402(b) of the CWA are satisfied, a transfer is mandatory and nondiscretionary.  <em>Id.</em>, at 397399.  He rejected the panel majoritys broad construction of ESA §7(a)(2), concluding that [i]f the ESA were as powerful as the majority contends, it would modify not only the EPAs obligation under the CWA, but <em>every</em> categorical mandate applicable to <em>every </em>federal agency.  <em>Id.</em>, at 399, n. 4.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Ninth Circuits construction of §7(a)(2) is at odds with that of other Courts of Appeals.  Compare 420 F. 3d 946 (case below), with <em>Platte River Whooping Crane Critical Habitat Maintenance Trust</em> v. <em>FERC</em>, 962 F. 2d 27, 3334 (CADC 1992), and <em>American Forest &amp; Paper Association</em> v. <em>EPA</em>, 137 F. 3d 291, 298299 (CA5 1998).  We granted certiorari to resolve this conflict, 549 U. S. ___ (2007), and we now reverse.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">II</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Before addressing this question of statutory interpretation, however, we first consider whether the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the EPAs transfer decision was arbitrary and capricious because, in that courts words, the agencies involved in the decision relied … on legally contradictory positions regarding [their] section 7 obligations.  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06340, at 23.  </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    As an initial matter, we note that if the EPAs action was arbitrary and capricious, as the Ninth Circuit held, the proper course would have been to remand to the agency for clarification of its reasons.  See <em>Gonzales</em> v. <em>Thomas</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/547/183" class="subref" title="subref">547 U. S. 183</a> (2006)
<em>(per curiam)</em>.  Indeed, the court below expressly recognized that this finding required it to remand to the agency for a plausible explanation of its decision, based on a single, coherent interpretation of the statute.  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06340, at 28.  But the Ninth Circuit did not take this course; instead, it jumped ahead to resolve the merits of the dispute.  In so doing, it erroneously deprived the agency of its usual administrative avenue for explaining and reconciling the arguably contradictory rationales that sometimes appear in the course of lengthy and complex administrative decisions.  We need not examine this question further, however, because we conclude that the Ninth Circuits determination that the EPAs action was arbitrary and capricious is not fairly supported by the record.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Review under the arbitrary and capricious standard is deferential; we will not vacate an agencys decision unless it</p>
        <p class="bodytext">has relied on factors which Congress had not intended it to consider, entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.  <em>Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

We will, however, uphold a decision of less than ideal clarity if the agencys path may reasonably be discerned.   <em>Ibid.</em> (quoting <em>Bowman Transp., Inc.</em> v. <em>Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc.</em>,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">286</a> (1974)
).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court of Appeals concluded that the EPAs decision was internally inconsistent because, in its view, the agency statedboth during preliminary review of Arizonas transfer application and in the Federal Register notice memorializing its final actionthat section 7 requires consultation regarding the effect of a permitting transfer on listed species.  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06340, at 23.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    With regard to the various statements made by the involved agencies regional offices during the early stages of consideration, the only inconsistency respondents can point to is the fact that the agencies changed their mindssomething that, as long as the proper procedures were followed, they were fully entitled to do.  The federal courts ordinarily are empowered to review only an agencys <em>final</em> action, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/5/704.html" class="subref" title="subref">5 U. S. C. §704</a>, and the fact that a preliminary determination by a local agency representative is later overruled at a higher level within the agency does not render the decisionmaking process arbitrary and capricious.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Respondents also point to the final Federal Register notice memorializing the EPAs approval of Arizonas transfer application.  This notice stated that the FWSs issuance of its biological opinion had conclude[d] the consultation process required by ESA section 7(a)(2).  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06340, at 73.  Respondents contend that this statement is inconsistent with the EPAs previously expressed positionand their position throughout this litigationthat §7(a)(2)s consultation requirement is not triggered by a transfer application under §402 of the CWA.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    We are not persuaded that this statement constitutes the type of error that requires a remand.  By the time the Federal Register statement was issued, the EPA had already consulted with the FWS about the Arizona application, and the question whether that consultation had been <em>required</em>, as opposed to voluntarily undertaken by the agency, was simply not germane to the final agency transfer decision.  The Federal Register statement, in short, was dictum, and it had no bearing on the final agency action that respondents challenge.  Mindful of Congress admonition that in reviewing agency action, due account shall be taken of the rule of prejudicial error, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/5/706.html" class="subref" title="subref">5 U. S. C. §706</a>, we do not believe that this stray statement, which could have had no effect on the underlying agency action being challenged, requires that we further delay the transfer of permitting authority to Arizona by remanding to the agency for clarification.  See also <em>PDK Labs., Inc. </em>v. <em>United States Drug Enforcement Admin.</em>, 362 F. 3d 786, 799 (CADC 2004) (In administrative law, as in federal civil and criminal litigation, there is a harmless error rule).<a name="ZO-5ref" href="#ZO-5" class="">

        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    We further disagree with respondents suggestion that, by allegedly altering its legal position while the Arizona transfer decision and its associated litigation was pending, the EPA is effectively nullifying respondents rights to participate in administrative proceedings concerning Arizonas application, and particularly respondents rights under EPAs own regulations to comment on NPDES transfer applications.  Brief for Respondents 28 (citing 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/40/123" class="subref" title="subref">40 CFR §123.61</a>(b); emphasis deleted).  Consistent with EPA regulations, the agency made available a comment period of not less than 45 days during which interested members of the public [could] express their views on the State program.  §123.61(a)(1).  Respondents do not suggest that they were deprived of their right to comment during this period.<a name="ZO-6ref" href="#ZO-6" class="">

        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Respondents also contend that if the case were remanded to the EPA, they would raise additional challengesincluding, for example, a challenge to the EPAs provision of financial assistance to Arizona for the administration of its NPDES program.  However, as explained below, any such agency action is separate and independent of the agencys decision to authorize the transfer of permitting authority pursuant to §402(b).  See n. 11, <em>infra</em>.  We express no opinion as to the viability of a separate administrative or legal challenge to such actions.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">We turn now to the substantive statutory question raised by the petitions, a question that requires us to mediate a clash of seemingly categoricaland, at first glance, irreconcilablelegislative commands.  Section 402(b) of the CWA provides, without qualification, that the EPA shall approve a transfer application unless it determines that the State lacks adequate authority to perform the nine functions specified in the section.

        <p class="bodytext">    Here, reading §7(a)(2) as the Court of Appeals did would effectively repeal §402(b)s statutory mandate by engrafting a tenth criterion onto the CWA.<a name="ZO-7ref" href="#ZO-7" class="">

            </a>  Section 402(b) of the CWA commands that the EPA shall issue a permit whenever all nine exclusive statutory prerequisites are met.  Thus, §402(b) does not just set forth <em>minimum</em> requirements for the transfer of permitting authority; it affirmatively mandates that the transfer shall be approved if the specified criteria are met.  The provision operates as a ceiling as well as a floor.  By adding an additional criterion, the Ninth Circuits construction of §7(a)(2) raises that floor and alters §402(b)s statutory command.<a name="ZO-8ref" href="#ZO-8" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    The Ninth Circuits reading of §7(a)(2) would not only abrogate §402(b)s statutory mandate, but also result in the implicit repeal of many additional otherwise categorical statutory commands.  Section 7(a)(2) by its terms applies to any action authorized, funded, or carried out by a federal agencycovering, in effect, almost anything that an agency might do.  Reading the provision broadly would thus partially override every federal statute mandating agency action by subjecting such action to the further condition that it pose no jeopardy to endangered species.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Platte River Whooping Crane Critical Habitat Maintenance Trust</em> v. <em>FERC</em>, 962 F. 2d, at 3334 (considering whether §7(a)(2) overrides the Federal Power Acts prohibition on amending annual power licenses).  While the language of §7(a)(2) does not explicitly repeal any provision of the CWA (or any other statute), reading it for all that it might be worth runs foursquare into our presumption against implied repeals.</p>

        <p class="opcentered">1</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The agencies charged with implementing the ESA have attempted to resolve this tension through regulations implementing §7(a)(2).  The NMFS and FWS, acting jointly on behalf of the Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior and following notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures, have promulgated a regulation stating that Section 7 and the requirements of this part apply to all actions in which there is <em>discretionary</em> Federal involvement or control.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a> (emphasis added).  Pursuant to this regulation, §7(a)(2) would not be read as impliedly repealing nondiscretionary statutory mandates, even when they might result in some agency action.  Rather, the ESAs requirements would come into play only when an action results from the exercise of agency discretion.  This interpretation harmonizes the statutes by giving effect to the ESAs no-jeopardy mandate whenever an agency has discretion to do so, but not when the agency is forbidden from considering such extrastatutory factors.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    We have recognized that [t]he latitude the ESA gives the Secretary in enforcing the statute, together with the degree of regulatory expertise necessary to its enforcement, establishes that we owe some degree of deference to the Secretarys reasonable interpretation of the statutory scheme.  <em>Babbitt</em> v. <em>Sweet Home Chapter, Communities for Great Ore.</em>,

.  Rather, [t]he meaningor ambiguityof certain words or phrases may only become evident when placed in context… .  It is a fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.   <em>Id.,</em> at 132133 (quoting <em>Davis</em> v. <em>Michigan Dept. of Treasury</em>,

).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    We must therefore read §7(a)(2) of the ESA against the statutory backdrop of the many mandatory agency directives whose operation it would implicitly abrogate or repeal if it were construed as broadly as the Ninth Circuit did below.  When §7(a)(2) is read this way, we are left with a fundamental ambiguity that is not resolved by the statutory text.  An agency cannot simultaneously obey the differing mandates set forth in §7(a)(2) of the ESA and §402(b) of the CWA, and consequently the statutory languageread in light of the canon against implied repealsdoes not itself provide clear guidance as to which command must give way.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In this situation, it is appropriate to look to the implementing agencys expert interpretation, which cabins §7(a)(2)s application to actions in which there is discretionary Federal involvement or control.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a>.  This reading harmonizes the statutes by applying §7(a)(2) to guide agencies existing discretionary authority, but not reading it to override express statutory mandates.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">2</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    We conclude that this interpretation is reasonable in light of the statutes text and the overall statutory scheme, and that it is therefore entitled to deference under <em>Chevron</em>.  Section 7(a)(2) requires that an agency insure that the actions it authorizes, funds, or carries out are not likely to jeopardize listed species or their habitats.  To insure somethingas the court below recognizedmeans  [t]o make certain, to secure, to guarantee (some thing, event, etc.).   420 F. 3d, at 963 (quoting 7 Oxford English Dictionary 1059 (2d ed. 1989)).  The regulations focus on discretionary actions accords with the commonsense conclusion that, when an agency is <em>required </em>to do something by statute, it simply lacks the power to insure that such action will not jeopardize endangered species.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This reasoning is supported by our decision in <em>Department of Transportation</em> v. <em>Public Citizen</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/541/752" class="subref" title="subref">541 U. S. 752</a> (2004)
.  That case concerned safety regulations that were promulgated by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) and had the effect of triggering a Presidential directive allowing Mexican trucks to ply their trade on United States roads.  The Court held that the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) did not require the agency to assess the environmental effects of allowing the trucks entry because the legally relevant cause of the entry of the Mexican trucks is <em>not </em>FMCSAs action, but instead the actions of the President in lifting the moratorium and those of Congress in granting the President this authority while simultaneously limiting FMCSAs discretion.  <em>Id.</em>,<em></em>at 769 (emphasis in original).  The Court concluded that where an agency has no ability to prevent a certain effect due to its limited statutory authority over the relevant actions, the agency cannot be considered a legally relevant cause of the effect.  <em>Id.</em>,<em></em>at 770.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    We do not suggest that <em>Public Citizen </em>controls the outcome here; §7(a)(2), unlike NEPA, imposes a substantive (and not just a procedural) statutory requirement, and these cases involve agency action more directly related to environmental concerns than the FMCSAs truck safety regulations.  But the basic principle announced in <em>Public Citizen</em>that an agency cannot be considered the legal cause of an action that it has no statutory discretion <em>not </em>to takesupports the reasonableness of the FWSs interpretation of §7(a)(2) as reaching only discretionary agency actions.

        <p class="opcentered">3</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The court below simply disregarded §402.03s interpretation of the ESAs reach, dismissing the regulations reference to discretionary … involvement  as merely congruent with the statutory reference to actions authorized, funded, or carried out by the agency.  420 F. 3d, 968.  But this reading cannot be right.  Agency discretion presumes that an agency can exercise judgment in connection with a particular action.  See <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc.</em> v. <em>Volpe</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/401/402" class="subref" title="subref">401 U. S. 402</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">415</a>416 (1971)
; see also Random House Dictionary of the English Language 411 (unabridged ed. 1967) (discretion defined as the power or right to decide or act according to ones own judgment; freedom of judgment or choice).  As the mandatory language of §402(b) itself illustrates, not every action authorized, funded, or carried out by a federal agency is a product of that agencys exercise of discretion.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The dissents interpretation of §402.03 is similarly implausible.  The dissent would read the regulation as simply clarifying that discretionary agency actions are included within the scope of §7(a)(2), but not confining the statutes reach to such actions.  See <em>post</em>, at 711.  But this reading would render the regulation entirely superfluous.  Nothing in either §7(a)(2) or the other agency regulations interpreting that section, see §402.02, suggests that discretionary actions are <em>excluded</em> from the scope of the ESA, and there is thus no need for a separate regulation to bring them within the statutes scope.  On the dissents reading, §402.03s reference to discretionary federal involvement is mere surplusage, and we have cautioned against reading a text in a way that makes part of it redundant.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>TRW Inc.</em> v. <em>Andrews</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/534/19" class="subref" title="subref">534 U. S. 19</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">31</a> (2001)
.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This history of the regulation also supports the reading  to which we defer today.  As the dissent itself points out, the proposed version of §402.03 initially stated that Section 7 and the requirements of this Part apply to <em>all actions in which there is Federal involvement or control</em>, 
48Fed. Reg.
29999 (1983) (emphasis added); the Secretary of the Interior modified this language to provide (as adopted in the Final Rule now at issue) that the statuory requirements apply to all actions in which there is <em>discretionary</em> Federal involvement or control, 
51Fed. Reg.
19958 (1986) (emphasis added).  The dissents reading would  rob the word discretionary of any effect, and substitute the earlier, proposed version of the regulation for the text that was actually adopted.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In short, we read §402.03 to mean what it says: that §7(a)(2)s no-jeopardy duty covers only discretionary agency actions and does not attach to actions (like the NPDES permitting transfer authorization) that an agency is <em>required</em> by statute to undertake once certain specified triggering events have occurred.  This reading not only is reasonable, inasmuch as it gives effect to the ESAs provision, but also comports with the canon against implied repeals because it stays §7(a)(2)s mandate where it would effectively override otherwise mandatory statutory duties.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    Respondents argue that our opinion in <em>TVA</em> v. <em>Hill</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/437/153" class="subref" title="subref">437 U. S. 153</a> (1978)
, supports their contrary position.  In that case, we held that the ESA prohibited the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) from putting into operation the Tellico Damdespite the fact that the agency had already spent over $100 million on the nearly completed projectbecause doing so would have threatened the critical habitat of the endangered snail darter.  In language on which respondents rely, the Court concluded that the ordinary meaning of §7 of the ESA contained no exemptions and reflected a conscious decision by Congress to give endangered species priority over the primary missions of federal agencies.  <em>Id.</em>, at 173, 185, 188.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>TVA </em>v. <em>Hill</em>, however, had no occasion to answer the question presented in these cases.  That case was decided almost a decade before the adoption in 1986 of the regulations contained in 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a>.  And in any event, the construction project at issue in <em>TVA </em>v. <em>Hill</em>, while expensive, was also discretionary.  The TVA argued that by continuing to make lump-sum appropriations to the TVA, some of which were informally earmarked for the Tellico Dam project, Congress had implicitly repealed §7s no-jeopardy requirement as it applied to that project.  See 437 U. S., at 189193.  The Court rejected this argument, concluding that [t]he Appropriations Acts did not themselves identify the projects for which the sums had been appropriated and that reports by congressional committees allegedly directing the TVA to complete the project lacked the force of law.  <em>Id.</em>, at 189, n. 35.  Central to the Courts decision was the conclusion that Congress did not <em>mandate</em> that the TVA put the dam into operation; there was no statutory command to that effect; and there was therefore no basis for contending that applying the ESAs no-jeopardy requirement would implicitly repeal another affirmative congressional directive.<a name="ZO-9ref" href="#ZO-9" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>TVA </em>v. <em>Hill</em> thus supports the position, expressed in §402.03, that the ESAs no-jeopardy mandate applies to every <em>discretionary</em> agency actionregardless of the expense or burden its application might impose.  But that case did not speak to the question whether §7(a)(2) applies to <em>non</em>-discretionary actions, like the one at issue here.  The regulation set forth in 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a> addressed that question, and we defer to its reasonable interpretation.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">IV</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Finally, respondents and their <em>amici</em> argue that, even if §7(a)(2) is read to apply only to discretionary agency actions, the decision to transfer NPDES permitting authority to Arizona represented such an exercise of discretion.  They contend that the EPAs decision to authorize a transfer is not entirely mechanical; that it involves some exercise of judgment as to whether a State has met the criteria set forth in §402(b); and that these criteria incorporate references to wildlife conservation that bring consideration of §7(a)(2)s no-jeopardy mandate properly within the agencys discretion.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The argument is unavailing.  While the EPA may exercise some judgment in determining whether a State has demonstrated that it has the authority to carry out §402(b)s enumerated statutory criteria, the statute clearly does not grant it the discretion to add another entirely separate prerequisite to that list.  Nothing in the text of §402(b) authorizes the EPA to consider the protection of threatened or endangered species as an end in itself when evaluating a transfer application.  And to the extent that some of the §402(b) criteria may result in environmental benefits to marine species,<a name="ZO-10ref" href="#ZO-10" class="">

            </a> there is no dispute that Arizona has satisfied each of those statutory criteria.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Respondents argument has been disclaimed not only by the EPA, but also by the FWS and the NMFS, the two agencies primarily charged with administering §7(a)(2) and the drafters of the regulations implementing that section. Each agency recently issued a formal letter concluding that the authorization of an NPDES permitting transfer is not the kind of discretionary agency action that is covered by §402.03.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06549, at 103a116a.  An agencys interpretation of the meaning of its own regulations is entitled to deference unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation, <em>Auer</em> v. <em>Robbins</em>,

Following the issuance of the panels opinion below, the EPAin connection with the State of Alaskas pending application for transfer of NPDES permitting authorityrequested confirmation from the FWS and NMFS of the EPAs position that the no-jeopardy and consultation duties of ESA Section 7(a)(2) do not apply to approval of a States application to administer the NPDES program, in the apparent hope that obtaining those agencies views in advance of processing Alaskas application may avoid a repetition of the confusion that occurred during the Arizona permitting process.  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06549, at 96a, 95a.  In response, both the FWS and the NMFS confirmed their understanding that there is no need to conduct Section 7 consultations on proposed actions to approve State NPDES programs because such actions are not the cause of any impact on listed species and do not constitute discretionary federal agency actions to which Section 7 applies.  Id., at 107a; see also id., at 116a (NMFS concur[s] with EPAs conclusion that EPA is not required to engage in section 7 consultation on applications to approve State programs in situations under Section 402(b) of the CWA).

For example, it suggests that the EPA could condition transfers of permitting authority on the States acceptance of additional continuing oversight by the EPA (presumably beyond that oversight already contemplated by the CWAs statutory language).  Post, at 1719.  But such a take-it-or-leave-it approach, no less than a straightforward rejection of a transfer application, would impose conditions on an NPDES transfer beyond those set forth in §402(b), and thus alter the CWAs statutory command.

        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-10" href="#ZO-10ref">10</a> For example, §402(b) requires the EPA to consider whether the State has the legal authority to enforce applicable water quality standardssome of which, in turn, are informed by the judgment of the EPAs Administrator.

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-11" href="#ZO-11ref">11</a> Respondents also contend that the EPA has taken, or will take, other discretionary actions apart from the transfer authorization that implicate the ESA.  For example, they argue that the EPAs alleged provision of funding to Arizona for the administration of its clean water programs is the kind of discretionary agency action that is subject to §7(a)(2).  However, assuming this is true, any such funding decision is a separate agency action that is outside the scope of this lawsuit.  Respondents also point to the fact that, following the transfer of permitting authority, the EPA will retain oversight authority over the state permitting process, including the power to object to proposed permits.  But the fact that the EPA may exercise discretionary oversight authoritywhich may trigger §7(a)(2)s consultation and no-jeopardy obligationsafter the transfer does not mean that the decision authorizing the transfer is itself discretionary.

            <span class="smallcaps">Justice Alito</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    These cases concern the interplay between two federal environmental statutes.  Section 402(b) of the Clean Water Act requires that the Environmental Protection Agency transfer certain permitting powers to state authorities upon an application and a showing that nine specified criteria have been met.  Section 7(a)(2) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 provides that a federal agency must consult with agencies designated by the Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior in order to insure that any action authorized, funded, or carried out by such agency … is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species.  The question presented is whether §7(a)(2) effectively operates as a tenth criterion on which the transfer of permitting power under the first statute must be conditioned.  We conclude that it does not.  The transfer of permitting authority to state authoritieswho will exercise that authority under continuing federal oversight to ensure compliance with relevant mandates of the Endangered Species Act and other federal environmental protection statuteswas proper.  We therefore reverse the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</p>

            </a>  The EPA initiated consultation with the FWS to determine whether the transfer of permitting authority would adversely affect any listed species.</p>

App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06340, p. 564.  However, the FWS office was concerned that the transfer could result in the issuance of more discharge permits, which would lead to more development, which in turn could have an indirect adverse effect on the habitat of certain upland species, such as the cactus ferruginous pygmy-owl and the Pima pineapple cactus.  Specifically, the FWS feared that, because §7(a)(2)s consultation requirement does not apply to permitting decisions by state<em></em>authorities,<a name="ZO-4ref" href="#ZO-4" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>4</b>
                </sup>
            </a> the transfer of authority would empower Arizona officials to issue individual permits without considering and mitigating their indirect impact on these upland species.  <em>Id.,</em> at 565566.  The FWS regional office therefore urged that, in considering the proposed transfer of permitting authority, those involved in the consultation process should take these potential indirect impacts into account.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The EPA disagreed, maintaining that its approval action, which is an administrative transfer of authority, [would not be] the cause of future non-discharge-related impacts on endangered species from projects requiring State NPDES permits.  <em>Id.,</em> at 564.  As a factual matter, the EPA believed that the link between the transfer of permitting authority and the potential harm that could result from increased development was too attenuated.  <em>Id.</em>, at 654.  And as a legal matter, the EPA concluded that the mandatory nature of CWA §402(b)which directs that the EPA shall approve a transfer request if that sections nine statutory criteria are metstripped it of authority to disapprove a transfer based on any other considerations.  <em>Id.</em>, at 654655.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Pursuant to procedures set forth in a memorandum of understanding between the agencies, the dispute was referred to the agencies national offices for resolution.  In December 2002, the FWS issued its biological opinion, which concluded that the requested transfer would not cause jeopardy to listed species.  The opinion reasoned that the loss of section 7-related conservation benefits . . . is not an indirect effect of the authorization action, <em>id.,</em> at 117, because</p>
        <p class="bodytext">loss of any conservation benefit is not caused by EPAs decision to approve the State of Arizonas program.  Rather, the absence of the section 7 process that exists with respect to Federal NPDES permits reflects Congress decision to grant States the right to administer these programs under state law provided the States program meets the requirements of [§]402(b) of the Clean Water Act.  <em>Id.,</em> at 114.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In addition, the FWS opined that the EPAs continuing oversight of Arizonas permitting program, along with other statutory protections, would adequately protect listed species and their habitats following the transfer.  <em>Id.</em>, at 101107.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The EPA concluded that Arizona had met each of the nine statutory criteria listed in §402(b) and approved the transfer of permitting authority.  In the notice announcing the approval of the transfer, the EPA noted that the issuance of the FWSs biological opinion had conclude[d] the consultation process required by ESA section 7(a)(2) and reflects the [FWS] agreement with EPA that the approval of the State program meets the substantive requirements of the ESA.  <em>Id.,</em> at 73.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">2</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    On April 2, 2003, respondents filed a petition in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit seeking review of the transfer pursuant to 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1369.html#b_1_D" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §1369(b)(1)(D)</a>, which allows private parties to seek direct review of the EPAs determinations regarding state permitting programs in the federal courts of appeals.  The court granted petitioner National Association of Homebuilders leave to intervene as a respondent in that case.  Respondent Defenders of Wildlife also filed a separate action in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, alleging, among other things, that the biological opinion issued by the FWS in support of the proposed transfer did not comply with the ESAs standards.  The District Court severed that claim and transferred it to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which consolidated the case with the suit challenging the EPA transfer.  See 420 F. 3d 946 (2005).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    A divided panel of the Ninth Circuit held that the EPAs approval of the transfer was arbitrary and capricious because the EPA relied during the administrative proceedings on legally contradictory positions regarding its section 7 obligations.  <em>Id.,</em> at 959.  The court concluded that the EPA fail[ed] to understand its own authority under section 7(a)(2) to act on behalf of listed species and their habitat, <em>id.</em>, at 977, because the two propositions that underlie the EPAs actionthat (1) it must, under the [ESA], consult concerning transfers of CWA permitting authority, but (2) it is not permitted, as a matter of law, to take into account the impact on listed species in making the transfer decisioncannot both be true, <em>id.</em>, at 961.  The court therefore concluded that it was required to remand to the agency for a plausible explanation of its decision, based on a single, coherent interpretation of the statute.  <em>Id.</em>, at 962.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The panel majority, however, did not follow this course of action.  Rather, the panel went on to review the EPAs substantive construction of the statutes at issue and held that the ESA granted the EPA both the power and the duty to determine whether its transfer decision would jeopardize threatened or endangered species.  The panel did not dispute that Arizona had met the nine criteria set forth in §402(b) of the CWA, but the panel nevertheless concluded that §7(a)(2) of the ESA provided an affirmative grant of authority to attend to [the] protection of listed species, <em>id.</em>, at 965, in effect adding a tenth criterion to those specified in §402(b).  The panel dismissed the argument that the EPAs approval of the transfer application was not subject to §7(a)(2) because it was not a discretionary action within the meaning of 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a> (interpreting §7(a)(2) to apply only to agency actions in which there is discretionary Federal involvement and control).  420 F. 3d, at 967969.  It viewed the FWSs regulation as merely coterminous with the express statutory language encompassing all agency actions that are  authorized, funded, or carried out  by the agency.  <em>Id.</em>, at 969 (quoting 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#a_2" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(a)(2)</a>).  On these grounds, the court granted the petition and vacated the EPAs transfer decision.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In dissent, Judge Thompson explained that the transfer decision was not a discretionary action under 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a> because [t]he Clean Water Act, by its very terms, permits the EPA to consider only the nine specified factors.  If a states proposed permitting program meets the enumerated requirements, he reasoned, the EPA administrator shall approve the program.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1342.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §1342(b)</a>.  This [c]ongressional directive does not permit the EPA to impose additional conditions.  420 F. 3d, at 980.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Ninth Circuit denied rehearing and rehearing en banc.  450 F. 3d 394 (2006). <em></em>Writing for the six judges who dissented from the denial of rehearing en banc, Judge Kozinski disagreed with the panels conclusion that the EPAs analysis was so internally inconsistent as to be arbitrary and capricious.  He further noted that, if the panel was correct on this point, the proper resolution would have been to remand to the EPA for further explanation.  <em>Id.,</em> at 396398.  On the statutory question, Judge Kozinski echoed Judge Thompsons conclusion that once the nine criteria set forth in §402(b) of the CWA are satisfied, a transfer is mandatory and nondiscretionary.  <em>Id.</em>, at 397399.  He rejected the panel majoritys broad construction of ESA §7(a)(2), concluding that [i]f the ESA were as powerful as the majority contends, it would modify not only the EPAs obligation under the CWA, but <em>every</em> categorical mandate applicable to <em>every </em>federal agency.  <em>Id.</em>, at 399, n. 4.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Ninth Circuits construction of §7(a)(2) is at odds with that of other Courts of Appeals.  Compare 420 F. 3d 946 (case below), with <em>Platte River Whooping Crane Critical Habitat Maintenance Trust</em> v. <em>FERC</em>, 962 F. 2d 27, 3334 (CADC 1992), and <em>American Forest &amp; Paper Association</em> v. <em>EPA</em>, 137 F. 3d 291, 298299 (CA5 1998).

        <p class="opcentered">II</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Before addressing this question of statutory interpretation, however, we first consider whether the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the EPAs transfer decision was arbitrary and capricious because, in that courts words, the agencies involved in the decision relied … on legally contradictory positions regarding [their] section 7 obligations.  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06340, at 23.  </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    As an initial matter, we note that if the EPAs action was arbitrary and capricious, as the Ninth Circuit held, the proper course would have been to remand to the agency for clarification of its reasons.  See <em>Gonzales</em> v. <em>Thomas</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/547/183" class="subref" title="subref">547 U. S. 183</a> (2006)
<em>(per curiam)</em>.  Indeed, the court below expressly recognized that this finding required it to remand to the agency for a plausible explanation of its decision, based on a single, coherent interpretation of the statute.  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06340, at 28.  But the Ninth Circuit did not take this course; instead, it jumped ahead to resolve the merits of the dispute.  In so doing, it erroneously deprived the agency of its usual administrative avenue for explaining and reconciling the arguably contradictory rationales that sometimes appear in the course of lengthy and complex administrative decisions.  We need not examine this question further, however, because we conclude that the Ninth Circuits determination that the EPAs action was arbitrary and capricious is not fairly supported by the record.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Review under the arbitrary and capricious standard is deferential; we will not vacate an agencys decision unless it</p>

).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court of Appeals concluded that the EPAs decision was internally inconsistent because, in its view, the agency statedboth during preliminary review of Arizonas transfer application and in the Federal Register notice memorializing its final actionthat section 7 requires consultation regarding the effect of a permitting transfer on listed species.  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06340, at 23.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    With regard to the various statements made by the involved agencies regional offices during the early stages of consideration, the only inconsistency respondents can point to is the fact that the agencies changed their mindssomething that, as long as the proper procedures were followed, they were fully entitled to do.  The federal courts ordinarily are empowered to review only an agencys <em>final</em> action, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/5/704.html" class="subref" title="subref">5 U. S. C. §704</a>, and the fact that a preliminary determination by a local agency representative is later overruled at a higher level within the agency does not render the decisionmaking process arbitrary and capricious.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Respondents also point to the final Federal Register notice memorializing the EPAs approval of Arizonas transfer application.  This notice stated that the FWSs issuance of its biological opinion had conclude[d] the consultation process required by ESA section 7(a)(2).  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06340, at 73.  Respondents contend that this statement is inconsistent with the EPAs previously expressed positionand their position throughout this litigationthat §7(a)(2)s consultation requirement is not triggered by a transfer application under §402 of the CWA.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    We are not persuaded that this statement constitutes the type of error that requires a remand.  By the time the Federal Register statement was issued, the EPA had already consulted with the FWS about the Arizona application, and the question whether that consultation had been <em>required</em>, as opposed to voluntarily undertaken by the agency, was simply not germane to the final agency transfer decision.  The Federal Register statement, in short, was dictum, and it had no bearing on the final agency action that respondents challenge.  Mindful of Congress admonition that in reviewing agency action, due account shall be taken of the rule of prejudicial error, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/5/706.html" class="subref" title="subref">5 U. S. C. §706</a>, we do not believe that this stray statement, which could have had no effect on the underlying agency action being challenged, requires that we further delay the transfer of permitting authority to Arizona by remanding to the agency for clarification.  See also <em>PDK Labs., Inc. </em>v. <em>United States Drug Enforcement Admin.</em>, 362 F. 3d 786, 799 (CADC 2004) (In administrative law, as in federal civil and criminal litigation, there is a harmless error rule).<a name="ZO-5ref" href="#ZO-5" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    We further disagree with respondents suggestion that, by allegedly altering its legal position while the Arizona transfer decision and its associated litigation was pending, the EPA is effectively nullifying respondents rights to participate in administrative proceedings concerning Arizonas application, and particularly respondents rights under EPAs own regulations to comment on NPDES transfer applications.  Brief for Respondents 28 (citing 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/40/123" class="subref" title="subref">40 CFR §123.61</a>(b); emphasis deleted).  Consistent with EPA regulations, the agency made available a comment period of not less than 45 days during which interested members of the public [could] express their views on the State program.  §123.61(a)(1).  Respondents do not suggest that they were deprived of their right to comment during this period.<a name="ZO-6ref" href="#ZO-6" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    Respondents also contend that if the case were remanded to the EPA, they would raise additional challengesincluding, for example, a challenge to the EPAs provision of financial assistance to Arizona for the administration of its NPDES program.  However, as explained below, any such agency action is separate and independent of the agencys decision to authorize the transfer of permitting authority pursuant to §402(b).  See n. 11, <em>infra</em>.  We express no opinion as to the viability of a separate administrative or legal challenge to such actions.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">We turn now to the substantive statutory question raised by the petitions, a question that requires us to mediate a clash of seemingly categoricaland, at first glance, irreconcilablelegislative commands.  Section 402(b) of the CWA provides, without qualification, that the EPA shall approve a transfer application unless it determines that the State lacks adequate authority to perform the nine functions specified in the section.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1342.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §1342(b)</a>.  By its terms, the statutory language is mandatory and the list exclusive; if the nine specified criteria are satisfied, the EPA does not have the discretion to deny a transfer application.  Cf. <em>Lopez</em> v. <em>Davis</em>,

Neither respondents nor the Ninth Circuit has ever disputed that Arizona satisfied each of these nine criteria.  See 420 F. 3d, at 963, n. 11; Brief for Respondents 19, n. 8.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The language of §7(a)(2) of the ESA is similarly imperative: it provides that [e]ach Federal agency shall, in consultation with and with the assistance of the Secretary, insure that any action authorized, funded, or carried out by such agency . . . is not likely to jeopardize endangered or threatened species or their habitats.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#a_2" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(a)(2)</a>.  This mandate is to be carried out through consultation and may require the agency to adopt an alternative course of action.  As the author of the panel opinion below recognized, applying this language literally would <em>ad[d]</em> one [additional] requirement to the list of considerations under the Clean Water Act permitting transfer provision.  450 F. 3d, at 404, n. 2 (Berzon, J., concurring in denial of rehearing en banc) (emphasis in original).  That is, it would effectively repeal the mandatory and exclusive list of criteria set forth in §402(b), and replace it with a new, expanded list that includes §7(a)(2)s no-jeopardy requirement.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    Here, reading §7(a)(2) as the Court of Appeals did would effectively repeal §402(b)s statutory mandate by engrafting a tenth criterion onto the CWA.<a name="ZO-7ref" href="#ZO-7" class="">

            </a>  Section 402(b) of the CWA commands that the EPA shall issue a permit whenever all nine exclusive statutory prerequisites are met.  Thus, §402(b) does not just set forth <em>minimum</em> requirements for the transfer of permitting authority; it affirmatively mandates that the transfer shall be approved if the specified criteria are met.  The provision operates as a ceiling as well as a floor.  By adding an additional criterion, the Ninth Circuits construction of §7(a)(2) raises that floor and alters §402(b)s statutory command.<a name="ZO-8ref" href="#ZO-8" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    The Ninth Circuits reading of §7(a)(2) would not only abrogate §402(b)s statutory mandate, but also result in the implicit repeal of many additional otherwise categorical statutory commands.  Section 7(a)(2) by its terms applies to any action authorized, funded, or carried out by a federal agencycovering, in effect, almost anything that an agency might do.  Reading the provision broadly would thus partially override every federal statute mandating agency action by subjecting such action to the further condition that it pose no jeopardy to endangered species.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Platte River Whooping Crane Critical Habitat Maintenance Trust</em> v. <em>FERC</em>, 962 F. 2d, at 3334 (considering whether §7(a)(2) overrides the Federal Power Acts prohibition on amending annual power licenses).  While the language of §7(a)(2) does not explicitly repeal any provision of the CWA (or any other statute), reading it for all that it might be worth runs foursquare into our presumption against implied repeals.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">C</p>
        <p class="opcentered">1</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The agencies charged with implementing the ESA have attempted to resolve this tension through regulations implementing §7(a)(2).  The NMFS and FWS, acting jointly on behalf of the Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior and following notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures, have promulgated a regulation stating that Section 7 and the requirements of this part apply to all actions in which there is <em>discretionary</em> Federal involvement or control.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a> (emphasis added).  Pursuant to this regulation, §7(a)(2) would not be read as impliedly repealing nondiscretionary statutory mandates, even when they might result in some agency action.  Rather, the ESAs requirements would come into play only when an action results from the exercise of agency discretion.  This interpretation harmonizes the statutes by giving effect to the ESAs no-jeopardy mandate whenever an agency has discretion to do so, but not when the agency is forbidden from considering such extrastatutory factors.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    We have recognized that [t]he latitude the ESA gives the Secretary in enforcing the statute, together with the degree of regulatory expertise necessary to its enforcement, establishes that we owe some degree of deference to the Secretarys reasonable interpretation of the statutory scheme.  <em>Babbitt</em> v. <em>Sweet Home Chapter, Communities for Great Ore.</em>,

.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">If the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress… . [However,] if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the question for the court is whether the agencys answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.  <em>Id.</em>, at 842843 (footnotes omitted).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In making the threshold determination under <em>Chevron</em>, a reviewing court should not confine itself to examining a particular statutory provision in isolation.  <em>FDA</em> v. <em>Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.</em>,

.  Rather, [t]he meaningor ambiguityof certain words or phrases may only become evident when placed in context… .  It is a fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.   <em>Id.,</em> at 132133 (quoting <em>Davis</em> v. <em>Michigan Dept. of Treasury</em>,

).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    We must therefore read §7(a)(2) of the ESA against the statutory backdrop of the many mandatory agency directives whose operation it would implicitly abrogate or repeal if it were construed as broadly as the Ninth Circuit did below.  When §7(a)(2) is read this way, we are left with a fundamental ambiguity that is not resolved by the statutory text.  An agency cannot simultaneously obey the differing mandates set forth in §7(a)(2) of the ESA and §402(b) of the CWA, and consequently the statutory languageread in light of the canon against implied repealsdoes not itself provide clear guidance as to which command must give way.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In this situation, it is appropriate to look to the implementing agencys expert interpretation, which cabins §7(a)(2)s application to actions in which there is discretionary Federal involvement or control.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a>.  This reading harmonizes the statutes by applying §7(a)(2) to guide agencies existing discretionary authority, but not reading it to override express statutory mandates.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">2</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    We conclude that this interpretation is reasonable in light of the statutes text and the overall statutory scheme, and that it is therefore entitled to deference under <em>Chevron</em>.  Section 7(a)(2) requires that an agency insure that the actions it authorizes, funds, or carries out are not likely to jeopardize listed species or their habitats.  To insure somethingas the court below recognizedmeans  [t]o make certain, to secure, to guarantee (some thing, event, etc.).   420 F. 3d, at 963 (quoting 7 Oxford English Dictionary 1059 (2d ed. 1989)).  The regulations focus on discretionary actions accords with the commonsense conclusion that, when an agency is <em>required </em>to do something by statute, it simply lacks the power to insure that such action will not jeopardize endangered species.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This reasoning is supported by our decision in <em>Department of Transportation</em> v. <em>Public Citizen</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/541/752" class="subref" title="subref">541 U. S. 752</a> (2004)
.  That case concerned safety regulations that were promulgated by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) and had the effect of triggering a Presidential directive allowing Mexican trucks to ply their trade on United States roads.  The Court held that the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) did not require the agency to assess the environmental effects of allowing the trucks entry because the legally relevant cause of the entry of the Mexican trucks is <em>not </em>FMCSAs action, but instead the actions of the President in lifting the moratorium and those of Congress in granting the President this authority while simultaneously limiting FMCSAs discretion.  <em>Id.</em>,<em></em>at 769 (emphasis in original).  The Court concluded that where an agency has no ability to prevent a certain effect due to its limited statutory authority over the relevant actions, the agency cannot be considered a legally relevant cause of the effect.  <em>Id.</em>,<em></em>at 770.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    We do not suggest that <em>Public Citizen </em>controls the outcome here; §7(a)(2), unlike NEPA, imposes a substantive (and not just a procedural) statutory requirement, and these cases involve agency action more directly related to environmental concerns than the FMCSAs truck safety regulations.  But the basic principle announced in <em>Public Citizen</em>that an agency cannot be considered the legal cause of an action that it has no statutory discretion <em>not </em>to takesupports the reasonableness of the FWSs interpretation of §7(a)(2) as reaching only discretionary agency actions.

        <p class="opcentered">3</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The court below simply disregarded §402.03s interpretation of the ESAs reach, dismissing the regulations reference to discretionary … involvement  as merely congruent with the statutory reference to actions authorized, funded, or carried out by the agency.  420 F. 3d, 968.  But this reading cannot be right.  Agency discretion presumes that an agency can exercise judgment in connection with a particular action.  See <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc.</em> v. <em>Volpe</em>,

; see also Random House Dictionary of the English Language 411 (unabridged ed. 1967) (discretion defined as the power or right to decide or act according to ones own judgment; freedom of judgment or choice).  As the mandatory language of §402(b) itself illustrates, not every action authorized, funded, or carried out by a federal agency is a product of that agencys exercise of discretion.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The dissents interpretation of §402.03 is similarly implausible.  The dissent would read the regulation as simply clarifying that discretionary agency actions are included within the scope of §7(a)(2), but not confining the statutes reach to such actions.  See <em>post</em>, at 711.  But this reading would render the regulation entirely superfluous.  Nothing in either §7(a)(2) or the other agency regulations interpreting that section, see §402.02, suggests that discretionary actions are <em>excluded</em> from the scope of the ESA, and there is thus no need for a separate regulation to bring them within the statutes scope.  On the dissents reading, §402.03s reference to discretionary federal involvement is mere surplusage, and we have cautioned against reading a text in a way that makes part of it redundant.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>TRW Inc.</em> v. <em>Andrews</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    This history of the regulation also supports the reading  to which we defer today.

29999 (1983) (emphasis added); the Secretary of the Interior modified this language to provide (as adopted in the Final Rule now at issue) that the statuory requirements apply to all actions in which there is <em>discretionary</em> Federal involvement or control, 
51Fed. Reg.
19958 (1986) (emphasis added).  The dissents reading would  rob the word discretionary of any effect, and substitute the earlier, proposed version of the regulation for the text that was actually adopted.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In short, we read §402.03 to mean what it says: that §7(a)(2)s no-jeopardy duty covers only discretionary agency actions and does not attach to actions (like the NPDES permitting transfer authorization) that an agency is <em>required</em> by statute to undertake once certain specified triggering events have occurred.  This reading not only is reasonable, inasmuch as it gives effect to the ESAs provision, but also comports with the canon against implied repeals because it stays §7(a)(2)s mandate where it would effectively override otherwise mandatory statutory duties.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    Respondents argue that our opinion in <em>TVA</em> v. <em>Hill</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/437/153" class="subref" title="subref">437 U. S. 153</a> (1978)
, supports their contrary position.  In that case, we held that the ESA prohibited the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) from putting into operation the Tellico Damdespite the fact that the agency had already spent over $100 million on the nearly completed projectbecause doing so would have threatened the critical habitat of the endangered snail darter.  In language on which respondents rely, the Court concluded that the ordinary meaning of §7 of the ESA contained no exemptions and reflected a conscious decision by Congress to give endangered species priority over the primary missions of federal agencies.  <em>Id.</em>, at 173, 185, 188.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>TVA </em>v. <em>Hill</em>, however, had no occasion to answer the question presented in these cases.  That case was decided almost a decade before the adoption in 1986 of the regulations contained in 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a>.  And in any event, the construction project at issue in <em>TVA </em>v. <em>Hill</em>, while expensive, was also discretionary.  The TVA argued that by continuing to make lump-sum appropriations to the TVA, some of which were informally earmarked for the Tellico Dam project, Congress had implicitly repealed §7s no-jeopardy requirement as it applied to that project.  See 437 U. S., at 189193.  The Court rejected this argument, concluding that [t]he Appropriations Acts did not themselves identify the projects for which the sums had been appropriated and that reports by congressional committees allegedly directing the TVA to complete the project lacked the force of law.  <em>Id.</em>, at 189, n. 35.  Central to the Courts decision was the conclusion that Congress did not <em>mandate</em> that the TVA put the dam into operation; there was no statutory command to that effect; and there was therefore no basis for contending that applying the ESAs no-jeopardy requirement would implicitly repeal another affirmative congressional directive.<a name="ZO-9ref" href="#ZO-9" class="">

            <em>TVA </em>v. <em>Hill</em> thus supports the position, expressed in §402.03, that the ESAs no-jeopardy mandate applies to every <em>discretionary</em> agency actionregardless of the expense or burden its application might impose.  But that case did not speak to the question whether §7(a)(2) applies to <em>non</em>-discretionary actions, like the one at issue here.  The regulation set forth in 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a> addressed that question, and we defer to its reasonable interpretation.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">IV</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Finally, respondents and their <em>amici</em> argue that, even if §7(a)(2) is read to apply only to discretionary agency actions, the decision to transfer NPDES permitting authority to Arizona represented such an exercise of discretion.  They contend that the EPAs decision to authorize a transfer is not entirely mechanical; that it involves some exercise of judgment as to whether a State has met the criteria set forth in §402(b); and that these criteria incorporate references to wildlife conservation that bring consideration of §7(a)(2)s no-jeopardy mandate properly within the agencys discretion.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The argument is unavailing.  While the EPA may exercise some judgment in determining whether a State has demonstrated that it has the authority to carry out §402(b)s enumerated statutory criteria, the statute clearly does not grant it the discretion to add another entirely separate prerequisite to that list.  Nothing in the text of §402(b) authorizes the EPA to consider the protection of threatened or endangered species as an end in itself when evaluating a transfer application.  And to the extent that some of the §402(b) criteria may result in environmental benefits to marine species,<a name="ZO-10ref" href="#ZO-10" class="">

            </a> there is no dispute that Arizona has satisfied each of those statutory criteria.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Respondents argument has been disclaimed not only by the EPA, but also by the FWS and the NMFS, the two agencies primarily charged with administering §7(a)(2) and the drafters of the regulations implementing that section. Each agency recently issued a formal letter concluding that the authorization of an NPDES permitting transfer is not the kind of discretionary agency action that is covered by §402.03.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06549, at 103a116a.  An agencys interpretation of the meaning of its own regulations is entitled to deference unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation, <em>Auer</em> v. <em>Robbins</em>,

Following the issuance of the panels opinion below, the EPAin connection with the State of Alaskas pending application for transfer of NPDES permitting authorityrequested confirmation from the FWS and NMFS of the EPAs position that the no-jeopardy and consultation duties of ESA Section 7(a)(2) do not apply to approval of a States application to administer the NPDES program, in the apparent hope that obtaining those agencies views in advance of processing Alaskas application may avoid a repetition of the confusion that occurred during the Arizona permitting process.  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06549, at 96a, 95a.  In response, both the FWS and the NMFS confirmed their understanding that there is no need to conduct Section 7 consultations on proposed actions to approve State NPDES programs because such actions are not the cause of any impact on listed species and do not constitute discretionary federal agency actions to which Section 7 applies.  Id., at 107a; see also id., at 116a (NMFS concur[s] with EPAs conclusion that EPA is not required to engage in section 7 consultation on applications to approve State programs in situations under Section 402(b) of the CWA).

For example, it suggests that the EPA could condition transfers of permitting authority on the States acceptance of additional continuing oversight by the EPA (presumably beyond that oversight already contemplated by the CWAs statutory language).  Post, at 1719.  But such a take-it-or-leave-it approach, no less than a straightforward rejection of a transfer application, would impose conditions on an NPDES transfer beyond those set forth in §402(b), and thus alter the CWAs statutory command.

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-10" href="#ZO-10ref">10</a> For example, §402(b) requires the EPA to consider whether the State has the legal authority to enforce applicable water quality standardssome of which, in turn, are informed by the judgment of the EPAs Administrator.

For example, they argue that the EPAs alleged provision of funding to Arizona for the administration of its clean water programs is the kind of discretionary agency action that is subject to §7(a)(2).  However, assuming this is true, any such funding decision is a separate agency action that is outside the scope of this lawsuit.  Respondents also point to the fact that, following the transfer of permitting authority, the EPA will retain oversight authority over the state permitting process, including the power to object to proposed permits.  But the fact that the EPA may exercise discretionary oversight authoritywhich may trigger §7(a)(2)s consultation and no-jeopardy obligationsafter the transfer does not mean that the decision authorizing the transfer is itself discretionary.

        <p class="bodytext">    These cases concern the interplay between two federal environmental statutes.  Section 402(b) of the Clean Water Act requires that the Environmental Protection Agency transfer certain permitting powers to state authorities upon an application and a showing that nine specified criteria have been met.  Section 7(a)(2) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 provides that a federal agency must consult with agencies designated by the Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior in order to insure that any action authorized, funded, or carried out by such agency … is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species.  The question presented is whether §7(a)(2) effectively operates as a tenth criterion on which the transfer of permitting power under the first statute must be conditioned.  We conclude that it does not.  The transfer of permitting authority to state authoritieswho will exercise that authority under continuing federal oversight to ensure compliance with relevant mandates of the Endangered Species Act and other federal environmental protection statuteswas proper.

            </a>  The EPA initiated consultation with the FWS to determine whether the transfer of permitting authority would adversely affect any listed species.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The FWS regional office concluded that the transfer of authority would not cause any direct impact on water quality that would adversely affect listed species.  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06340, p. 564.  However, the FWS office was concerned that the transfer could result in the issuance of more discharge permits, which would lead to more development, which in turn could have an indirect adverse effect on the habitat of certain upland species, such as the cactus ferruginous pygmy-owl and the Pima pineapple cactus.  Specifically, the FWS feared that, because §7(a)(2)s consultation requirement does not apply to permitting decisions by state<em></em>authorities,<a name="ZO-4ref" href="#ZO-4" class="">

            </a> the transfer of authority would empower Arizona officials to issue individual permits without considering and mitigating their indirect impact on these upland species.  <em>Id.,</em> at 565566.  The FWS regional office therefore urged that, in considering the proposed transfer of permitting authority, those involved in the consultation process should take these potential indirect impacts into account.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The EPA disagreed, maintaining that its approval action, which is an administrative transfer of authority, [would not be] the cause of future non-discharge-related impacts on endangered species from projects requiring State NPDES permits.  <em>Id.,</em> at 564.  As a factual matter, the EPA believed that the link between the transfer of permitting authority and the potential harm that could result from increased development was too attenuated.  <em>Id.</em>, at 654.  And as a legal matter, the EPA concluded that the mandatory nature of CWA §402(b)which directs that the EPA shall approve a transfer request if that sections nine statutory criteria are metstripped it of authority to disapprove a transfer based on any other considerations.  <em>Id.</em>, at 654655.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Pursuant to procedures set forth in a memorandum of understanding between the agencies, the dispute was referred to the agencies national offices for resolution.  In December 2002, the FWS issued its biological opinion, which concluded that the requested transfer would not cause jeopardy to listed species.  The opinion reasoned that the loss of section 7-related conservation benefits . . . is not an indirect effect of the authorization action, <em>id.,</em> at 117, because</p>
        <p class="bodytext">loss of any conservation benefit is not caused by EPAs decision to approve the State of Arizonas program.  Rather, the absence of the section 7 process that exists with respect to Federal NPDES permits reflects Congress decision to grant States the right to administer these programs under state law provided the States program meets the requirements of [§]402(b) of the Clean Water Act.  <em>Id.,</em> at 114.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In addition, the FWS opined that the EPAs continuing oversight of Arizonas permitting program, along with other statutory protections, would adequately protect listed species and their habitats following the transfer.  <em>Id.</em>, at 101107.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The EPA concluded that Arizona had met each of the nine statutory criteria listed in §402(b) and approved the transfer of permitting authority.  In the notice announcing the approval of the transfer, the EPA noted that the issuance of the FWSs biological opinion had conclude[d] the consultation process required by ESA section 7(a)(2) and reflects the [FWS] agreement with EPA that the approval of the State program meets the substantive requirements of the ESA.  <em>Id.,</em> at 73.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">2</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    On April 2, 2003, respondents filed a petition in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit seeking review of the transfer pursuant to 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1369.html#b_1_D" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §1369(b)(1)(D)</a>, which allows private parties to seek direct review of the EPAs determinations regarding state permitting programs in the federal courts of appeals.  The court granted petitioner National Association of Homebuilders leave to intervene as a respondent in that case.  Respondent Defenders of Wildlife also filed a separate action in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, alleging, among other things, that the biological opinion issued by the FWS in support of the proposed transfer did not comply with the ESAs standards.  The District Court severed that claim and transferred it to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which consolidated the case with the suit challenging the EPA transfer.  See 420 F. 3d 946 (2005).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    A divided panel of the Ninth Circuit held that the EPAs approval of the transfer was arbitrary and capricious because the EPA relied during the administrative proceedings on legally contradictory positions regarding its section 7 obligations.  <em>Id.,</em> at 959.  The court concluded that the EPA fail[ed] to understand its own authority under section 7(a)(2) to act on behalf of listed species and their habitat, <em>id.</em>, at 977, because the two propositions that underlie the EPAs actionthat (1) it must, under the [ESA], consult concerning transfers of CWA permitting authority, but (2) it is not permitted, as a matter of law, to take into account the impact on listed species in making the transfer decisioncannot both be true, <em>id.</em>, at 961.  The court therefore concluded that it was required to remand to the agency for a plausible explanation of its decision, based on a single, coherent interpretation of the statute.  <em>Id.</em>, at 962.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The panel majority, however, did not follow this course of action.  Rather, the panel went on to review the EPAs substantive construction of the statutes at issue and held that the ESA granted the EPA both the power and the duty to determine whether its transfer decision would jeopardize threatened or endangered species.  The panel did not dispute that Arizona had met the nine criteria set forth in §402(b) of the CWA, but the panel nevertheless concluded that §7(a)(2) of the ESA provided an affirmative grant of authority to attend to [the] protection of listed species, <em>id.</em>, at 965, in effect adding a tenth criterion to those specified in §402(b).  The panel dismissed the argument that the EPAs approval of the transfer application was not subject to §7(a)(2) because it was not a discretionary action within the meaning of 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a> (interpreting §7(a)(2) to apply only to agency actions in which there is discretionary Federal involvement and control).  420 F. 3d, at 967969.  It viewed the FWSs regulation as merely coterminous with the express statutory language encompassing all agency actions that are  authorized, funded, or carried out  by the agency.  <em>Id.</em>, at 969 (quoting 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#a_2" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(a)(2)</a>).  On these grounds, the court granted the petition and vacated the EPAs transfer decision.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In dissent, Judge Thompson explained that the transfer decision was not a discretionary action under 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a> because [t]he Clean Water Act, by its very terms, permits the EPA to consider only the nine specified factors.  If a states proposed permitting program meets the enumerated requirements, he reasoned, the EPA administrator shall approve the program.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1342.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §1342(b)</a>.  This [c]ongressional directive does not permit the EPA to impose additional conditions.  420 F. 3d, at 980.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Ninth Circuit denied rehearing and rehearing en banc.  450 F. 3d 394 (2006). <em></em>Writing for the six judges who dissented from the denial of rehearing en banc, Judge Kozinski disagreed with the panels conclusion that the EPAs analysis was so internally inconsistent as to be arbitrary and capricious.  He further noted that, if the panel was correct on this point, the proper resolution would have been to remand to the EPA for further explanation.  <em>Id.,</em> at 396398.  On the statutory question, Judge Kozinski echoed Judge Thompsons conclusion that once the nine criteria set forth in §402(b) of the CWA are satisfied, a transfer is mandatory and nondiscretionary.  <em>Id.</em>, at 397399.  He rejected the panel majoritys broad construction of ESA §7(a)(2), concluding that [i]f the ESA were as powerful as the majority contends, it would modify not only the EPAs obligation under the CWA, but <em>every</em> categorical mandate applicable to <em>every </em>federal agency.  <em>Id.</em>, at 399, n. 4.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Ninth Circuits construction of §7(a)(2) is at odds with that of other Courts of Appeals.  Compare 420 F. 3d 946 (case below), with <em>Platte River Whooping Crane Critical Habitat Maintenance Trust</em> v. <em>FERC</em>, 962 F. 2d 27, 3334 (CADC 1992), and <em>American Forest &amp; Paper Association</em> v. <em>EPA</em>, 137 F. 3d 291, 298299 (CA5 1998).  We granted certiorari to resolve this conflict, 549 U. S. ___ (2007), and we now reverse.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">II</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Before addressing this question of statutory interpretation, however, we first consider whether the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the EPAs transfer decision was arbitrary and capricious because, in that courts words, the agencies involved in the decision relied … on legally contradictory positions regarding [their] section 7 obligations.  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06340, at 23.  </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    As an initial matter, we note that if the EPAs action was arbitrary and capricious, as the Ninth Circuit held, the proper course would have been to remand to the agency for clarification of its reasons.  See <em>Gonzales</em> v. <em>Thomas</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/547/183" class="subref" title="subref">547 U. S. 183</a> (2006)
<em>(per curiam)</em>.  Indeed, the court below expressly recognized that this finding required it to remand to the agency for a plausible explanation of its decision, based on a single, coherent interpretation of the statute.  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06340, at 28.  But the Ninth Circuit did not take this course; instead, it jumped ahead to resolve the merits of the dispute.  In so doing, it erroneously deprived the agency of its usual administrative avenue for explaining and reconciling the arguably contradictory rationales that sometimes appear in the course of lengthy and complex administrative decisions.  We need not examine this question further, however, because we conclude that the Ninth Circuits determination that the EPAs action was arbitrary and capricious is not fairly supported by the record.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Review under the arbitrary and capricious standard is deferential; we will not vacate an agencys decision unless it</p>
        <p class="bodytext">has relied on factors which Congress had not intended it to consider, entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.  <em>Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court of Appeals concluded that the EPAs decision was internally inconsistent because, in its view, the agency statedboth during preliminary review of Arizonas transfer application and in the Federal Register notice memorializing its final actionthat section 7 requires consultation regarding the effect of a permitting transfer on listed species.  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06340, at 23.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    With regard to the various statements made by the involved agencies regional offices during the early stages of consideration, the only inconsistency respondents can point to is the fact that the agencies changed their mindssomething that, as long as the proper procedures were followed, they were fully entitled to do.  The federal courts ordinarily are empowered to review only an agencys <em>final</em> action, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/5/704.html" class="subref" title="subref">5 U. S. C. §704</a>, and the fact that a preliminary determination by a local agency representative is later overruled at a higher level within the agency does not render the decisionmaking process arbitrary and capricious.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Respondents also point to the final Federal Register notice memorializing the EPAs approval of Arizonas transfer application.  This notice stated that the FWSs issuance of its biological opinion had conclude[d] the consultation process required by ESA section 7(a)(2).  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06340, at 73.  Respondents contend that this statement is inconsistent with the EPAs previously expressed positionand their position throughout this litigationthat §7(a)(2)s consultation requirement is not triggered by a transfer application under §402 of the CWA.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    We are not persuaded that this statement constitutes the type of error that requires a remand.  By the time the Federal Register statement was issued, the EPA had already consulted with the FWS about the Arizona application, and the question whether that consultation had been <em>required</em>, as opposed to voluntarily undertaken by the agency, was simply not germane to the final agency transfer decision.  The Federal Register statement, in short, was dictum, and it had no bearing on the final agency action that respondents challenge.  Mindful of Congress admonition that in reviewing agency action, due account shall be taken of the rule of prejudicial error, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/5/706.html" class="subref" title="subref">5 U. S. C. §706</a>, we do not believe that this stray statement, which could have had no effect on the underlying agency action being challenged, requires that we further delay the transfer of permitting authority to Arizona by remanding to the agency for clarification.  See also <em>PDK Labs., Inc. </em>v. <em>United States Drug Enforcement Admin.</em>, 362 F. 3d 786, 799 (CADC 2004) (In administrative law, as in federal civil and criminal litigation, there is a harmless error rule).<a name="ZO-5ref" href="#ZO-5" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    We further disagree with respondents suggestion that, by allegedly altering its legal position while the Arizona transfer decision and its associated litigation was pending, the EPA is effectively nullifying respondents rights to participate in administrative proceedings concerning Arizonas application, and particularly respondents rights under EPAs own regulations to comment on NPDES transfer applications.  Brief for Respondents 28 (citing 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/40/123" class="subref" title="subref">40 CFR §123.61</a>(b); emphasis deleted).  Consistent with EPA regulations, the agency made available a comment period of not less than 45 days during which interested members of the public [could] express their views on the State program.  §123.61(a)(1).  Respondents do not suggest that they were deprived of their right to comment during this period.<a name="ZO-6ref" href="#ZO-6" class="">

        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Respondents also contend that if the case were remanded to the EPA, they would raise additional challengesincluding, for example, a challenge to the EPAs provision of financial assistance to Arizona for the administration of its NPDES program.  However, as explained below, any such agency action is separate and independent of the agencys decision to authorize the transfer of permitting authority pursuant to §402(b).  See n. 11, <em>infra</em>.  We express no opinion as to the viability of a separate administrative or legal challenge to such actions.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">We turn now to the substantive statutory question raised by the petitions, a question that requires us to mediate a clash of seemingly categoricaland, at first glance, irreconcilablelegislative commands.  Section 402(b) of the CWA provides, without qualification, that the EPA shall approve a transfer application unless it determines that the State lacks adequate authority to perform the nine functions specified in the section.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1342.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §1342(b)</a>.  By its terms, the statutory language is mandatory and the list exclusive; if the nine specified criteria are satisfied, the EPA does not have the discretion to deny a transfer application.

Neither respondents nor the Ninth Circuit has ever disputed that Arizona satisfied each of these nine criteria.  See 420 F. 3d, at 963, n. 11; Brief for Respondents 19, n. 8.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The language of §7(a)(2) of the ESA is similarly imperative: it provides that [e]ach Federal agency shall, in consultation with and with the assistance of the Secretary, insure that any action authorized, funded, or carried out by such agency . . . is not likely to jeopardize endangered or threatened species or their habitats.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#a_2" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(a)(2)</a>.  This mandate is to be carried out through consultation and may require the agency to adopt an alternative course of action.  As the author of the panel opinion below recognized, applying this language literally would <em>ad[d]</em> one [additional] requirement to the list of considerations under the Clean Water Act permitting transfer provision.  450 F. 3d, at 404, n. 2 (Berzon, J., concurring in denial of rehearing en banc) (emphasis in original).  That is, it would effectively repeal the mandatory and exclusive list of criteria set forth in §402(b), and replace it with a new, expanded list that includes §7(a)(2)s no-jeopardy requirement.</p>

Thus, §402(b) does not just set forth <em>minimum</em> requirements for the transfer of permitting authority; it affirmatively mandates that the transfer shall be approved if the specified criteria are met.  The provision operates as a ceiling as well as a floor.  By adding an additional criterion, the Ninth Circuits construction of §7(a)(2) raises that floor and alters §402(b)s statutory command.<a name="ZO-8ref" href="#ZO-8" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    The Ninth Circuits reading of §7(a)(2) would not only abrogate §402(b)s statutory mandate, but also result in the implicit repeal of many additional otherwise categorical statutory commands.  Section 7(a)(2) by its terms applies to any action authorized, funded, or carried out by a federal agencycovering, in effect, almost anything that an agency might do.  Reading the provision broadly would thus partially override every federal statute mandating agency action by subjecting such action to the further condition that it pose no jeopardy to endangered species.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Platte River Whooping Crane Critical Habitat Maintenance Trust</em> v. <em>FERC</em>, 962 F. 2d, at 3334 (considering whether §7(a)(2) overrides the Federal Power Acts prohibition on amending annual power licenses).  While the language of §7(a)(2) does not explicitly repeal any provision of the CWA (or any other statute), reading it for all that it might be worth runs foursquare into our presumption against implied repeals.</p>

        <p class="opcentered">1</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The agencies charged with implementing the ESA have attempted to resolve this tension through regulations implementing §7(a)(2).  The NMFS and FWS, acting jointly on behalf of the Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior and following notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures, have promulgated a regulation stating that Section 7 and the requirements of this part apply to all actions in which there is <em>discretionary</em> Federal involvement or control.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a> (emphasis added).  Pursuant to this regulation, §7(a)(2) would not be read as impliedly repealing nondiscretionary statutory mandates, even when they might result in some agency action.  Rather, the ESAs requirements would come into play only when an action results from the exercise of agency discretion.  This interpretation harmonizes the statutes by giving effect to the ESAs no-jeopardy mandate whenever an agency has discretion to do so, but not when the agency is forbidden from considering such extrastatutory factors.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    We have recognized that [t]he latitude the ESA gives the Secretary in enforcing the statute, together with the degree of regulatory expertise necessary to its enforcement, establishes that we owe some degree of deference to the Secretarys reasonable interpretation of the statutory scheme.  <em>Babbitt</em> v. <em>Sweet Home Chapter, Communities for Great Ore.</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    We must therefore read §7(a)(2) of the ESA against the statutory backdrop of the many mandatory agency directives whose operation it would implicitly abrogate or repeal if it were construed as broadly as the Ninth Circuit did below.  When §7(a)(2) is read this way, we are left with a fundamental ambiguity that is not resolved by the statutory text.  An agency cannot simultaneously obey the differing mandates set forth in §7(a)(2) of the ESA and §402(b) of the CWA, and consequently the statutory languageread in light of the canon against implied repealsdoes not itself provide clear guidance as to which command must give way.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In this situation, it is appropriate to look to the implementing agencys expert interpretation, which cabins §7(a)(2)s application to actions in which there is discretionary Federal involvement or control.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a>.  This reading harmonizes the statutes by applying §7(a)(2) to guide agencies existing discretionary authority, but not reading it to override express statutory mandates.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">2</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    We conclude that this interpretation is reasonable in light of the statutes text and the overall statutory scheme, and that it is therefore entitled to deference under <em>Chevron</em>.  Section 7(a)(2) requires that an agency insure that the actions it authorizes, funds, or carries out are not likely to jeopardize listed species or their habitats.  To insure somethingas the court below recognizedmeans  [t]o make certain, to secure, to guarantee (some thing, event, etc.).   420 F. 3d, at 963 (quoting 7 Oxford English Dictionary 1059 (2d ed. 1989)).  The regulations focus on discretionary actions accords with the commonsense conclusion that, when an agency is <em>required </em>to do something by statute, it simply lacks the power to insure that such action will not jeopardize endangered species.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This reasoning is supported by our decision in <em>Department of Transportation</em> v. <em>Public Citizen</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/541/752" class="subref" title="subref">541 U. S. 752</a> (2004)
.  That case concerned safety regulations that were promulgated by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) and had the effect of triggering a Presidential directive allowing Mexican trucks to ply their trade on United States roads.  The Court held that the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) did not require the agency to assess the environmental effects of allowing the trucks entry because the legally relevant cause of the entry of the Mexican trucks is <em>not </em>FMCSAs action, but instead the actions of the President in lifting the moratorium and those of Congress in granting the President this authority while simultaneously limiting FMCSAs discretion.  <em>Id.</em>,<em></em>at 769 (emphasis in original).  The Court concluded that where an agency has no ability to prevent a certain effect due to its limited statutory authority over the relevant actions, the agency cannot be considered a legally relevant cause of the effect.  <em>Id.</em>,<em></em>at 770.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    We do not suggest that <em>Public Citizen </em>controls the outcome here; §7(a)(2), unlike NEPA, imposes a substantive (and not just a procedural) statutory requirement, and these cases involve agency action more directly related to environmental concerns than the FMCSAs truck safety regulations.  But the basic principle announced in <em>Public Citizen</em>that an agency cannot be considered the legal cause of an action that it has no statutory discretion <em>not </em>to takesupports the reasonableness of the FWSs interpretation of §7(a)(2) as reaching only discretionary agency actions.

        <p class="opcentered">3</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The court below simply disregarded §402.03s interpretation of the ESAs reach, dismissing the regulations reference to discretionary … involvement  as merely congruent with the statutory reference to actions authorized, funded, or carried out by the agency.  420 F. 3d, 968.  But this reading cannot be right.  Agency discretion presumes that an agency can exercise judgment in connection with a particular action.  See <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc.</em> v. <em>Volpe</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/401/402" class="subref" title="subref">401 U. S. 402</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">415</a>416 (1971)
; see also Random House Dictionary of the English Language 411 (unabridged ed. 1967) (discretion defined as the power or right to decide or act according to ones own judgment; freedom of judgment or choice).  As the mandatory language of §402(b) itself illustrates, not every action authorized, funded, or carried out by a federal agency is a product of that agencys exercise of discretion.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The dissents interpretation of §402.03 is similarly implausible.  The dissent would read the regulation as simply clarifying that discretionary agency actions are included within the scope of §7(a)(2), but not confining the statutes reach to such actions.  See <em>post</em>, at 711.  But this reading would render the regulation entirely superfluous.  Nothing in either §7(a)(2) or the other agency regulations interpreting that section, see §402.02, suggests that discretionary actions are <em>excluded</em> from the scope of the ESA, and there is thus no need for a separate regulation to bring them within the statutes scope.  On the dissents reading, §402.03s reference to discretionary federal involvement is mere surplusage, and we have cautioned against reading a text in a way that makes part of it redundant.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>TRW Inc.</em> v. <em>Andrews</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/534/19" class="subref" title="subref">534 U. S. 19</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">31</a> (2001)
.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This history of the regulation also supports the reading  to which we defer today.  As the dissent itself points out, the proposed version of §402.03 initially stated that Section 7 and the requirements of this Part apply to <em>all actions in which there is Federal involvement or control</em>, 
48Fed. Reg.
29999 (1983) (emphasis added); the Secretary of the Interior modified this language to provide (as adopted in the Final Rule now at issue) that the statuory requirements apply to all actions in which there is <em>discretionary</em> Federal involvement or control, 
51Fed. Reg.
19958 (1986) (emphasis added).  The dissents reading would  rob the word discretionary of any effect, and substitute the earlier, proposed version of the regulation for the text that was actually adopted.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In short, we read §402.03 to mean what it says: that §7(a)(2)s no-jeopardy duty covers only discretionary agency actions and does not attach to actions (like the NPDES permitting transfer authorization) that an agency is <em>required</em> by statute to undertake once certain specified triggering events have occurred.  This reading not only is reasonable, inasmuch as it gives effect to the ESAs provision, but also comports with the canon against implied repeals because it stays §7(a)(2)s mandate where it would effectively override otherwise mandatory statutory duties.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    Respondents argue that our opinion in <em>TVA</em> v. <em>Hill</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/437/153" class="subref" title="subref">437 U. S. 153</a> (1978)
, supports their contrary position.  In that case, we held that the ESA prohibited the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) from putting into operation the Tellico Damdespite the fact that the agency had already spent over $100 million on the nearly completed projectbecause doing so would have threatened the critical habitat of the endangered snail darter.  In language on which respondents rely, the Court concluded that the ordinary meaning of §7 of the ESA contained no exemptions and reflected a conscious decision by Congress to give endangered species priority over the primary missions of federal agencies.  <em>Id.</em>, at 173, 185, 188.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>TVA </em>v. <em>Hill</em>, however, had no occasion to answer the question presented in these cases.  That case was decided almost a decade before the adoption in 1986 of the regulations contained in 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a>.  And in any event, the construction project at issue in <em>TVA </em>v. <em>Hill</em>, while expensive, was also discretionary.  The TVA argued that by continuing to make lump-sum appropriations to the TVA, some of which were informally earmarked for the Tellico Dam project, Congress had implicitly repealed §7s no-jeopardy requirement as it applied to that project.  See 437 U. S., at 189193.  The Court rejected this argument, concluding that [t]he Appropriations Acts did not themselves identify the projects for which the sums had been appropriated and that reports by congressional committees allegedly directing the TVA to complete the project lacked the force of law.  <em>Id.</em>, at 189, n. 35.  Central to the Courts decision was the conclusion that Congress did not <em>mandate</em> that the TVA put the dam into operation; there was no statutory command to that effect; and there was therefore no basis for contending that applying the ESAs no-jeopardy requirement would implicitly repeal another affirmative congressional directive.<a name="ZO-9ref" href="#ZO-9" class="">

            <em>TVA </em>v. <em>Hill</em> thus supports the position, expressed in §402.03, that the ESAs no-jeopardy mandate applies to every <em>discretionary</em> agency actionregardless of the expense or burden its application might impose.  But that case did not speak to the question whether §7(a)(2) applies to <em>non</em>-discretionary actions, like the one at issue here.  The regulation set forth in 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a> addressed that question, and we defer to its reasonable interpretation.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">IV</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Finally, respondents and their <em>amici</em> argue that, even if §7(a)(2) is read to apply only to discretionary agency actions, the decision to transfer NPDES permitting authority to Arizona represented such an exercise of discretion.  They contend that the EPAs decision to authorize a transfer is not entirely mechanical; that it involves some exercise of judgment as to whether a State has met the criteria set forth in §402(b); and that these criteria incorporate references to wildlife conservation that bring consideration of §7(a)(2)s no-jeopardy mandate properly within the agencys discretion.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The argument is unavailing.  While the EPA may exercise some judgment in determining whether a State has demonstrated that it has the authority to carry out §402(b)s enumerated statutory criteria, the statute clearly does not grant it the discretion to add another entirely separate prerequisite to that list.  Nothing in the text of §402(b) authorizes the EPA to consider the protection of threatened or endangered species as an end in itself when evaluating a transfer application.  And to the extent that some of the §402(b) criteria may result in environmental benefits to marine species,<a name="ZO-10ref" href="#ZO-10" class="">

            </a> there is no dispute that Arizona has satisfied each of those statutory criteria.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Respondents argument has been disclaimed not only by the EPA, but also by the FWS and the NMFS, the two agencies primarily charged with administering §7(a)(2) and the drafters of the regulations implementing that section. Each agency recently issued a formal letter concluding that the authorization of an NPDES permitting transfer is not the kind of discretionary agency action that is covered by §402.03.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06549, at 103a116a.  An agencys interpretation of the meaning of its own regulations is entitled to deference unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation, <em>Auer</em> v. <em>Robbins</em>,

Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and these cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>

In response, both the FWS and the NMFS confirmed their understanding that there is no need to conduct Section 7 consultations on proposed actions to approve State NPDES programs because such actions are not the cause of any impact on listed species and do not constitute discretionary federal agency actions to which Section 7 applies.  Id., at 107a; see also id., at 116a (NMFS concur[s] with EPAs conclusion that EPA is not required to engage in section 7 consultation on applications to approve State programs in situations under Section 402(b) of the CWA).

For example, it suggests that the EPA could condition transfers of permitting authority on the States acceptance of additional continuing oversight by the EPA (presumably beyond that oversight already contemplated by the CWAs statutory language).  Post, at 1719.  But such a take-it-or-leave-it approach, no less than a straightforward rejection of a transfer application, would impose conditions on an NPDES transfer beyond those set forth in §402(b), and thus alter the CWAs statutory command.

However, assuming this is true, any such funding decision is a separate agency action that is outside the scope of this lawsuit.  Respondents also point to the fact that, following the transfer of permitting authority, the EPA will retain oversight authority over the state permitting process, including the power to object to proposed permits.  But the fact that the EPA may exercise discretionary oversight authoritywhich may trigger §7(a)(2)s consultation and no-jeopardy obligationsafter the transfer does not mean that the decision authorizing the transfer is itself discretionary.

            <span class="smallcaps">Justice Alito</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    These cases concern the interplay between two federal environmental statutes.  Section 402(b) of the Clean Water Act requires that the Environmental Protection Agency transfer certain permitting powers to state authorities upon an application and a showing that nine specified criteria have been met.  Section 7(a)(2) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 provides that a federal agency must consult with agencies designated by the Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior in order to insure that any action authorized, funded, or carried out by such agency … is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species.  The question presented is whether §7(a)(2) effectively operates as a tenth criterion on which the transfer of permitting power under the first statute must be conditioned.  We conclude that it does not.  The transfer of permitting authority to state authoritieswho will exercise that authority under continuing federal oversight to ensure compliance with relevant mandates of the Endangered Species Act and other federal environmental protection statuteswas proper.  We therefore reverse the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</p>

            <em>et seq.</em>, is intended to protect and conserve endangered and threatened species and their habitats.  Section 4 of the ESA directs the Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior to list threatened and endangered species and to designate their critical habitats.  §1533.

        <p class="bodytext">    Once the consultation process contemplated by §7(a)(2) has been completed, the Secretary is required to give the agency a written biological opinion setting forth the Secretarys opinion, and a summary of the information on which the opinion is based, detailing how the agency action affects the species or its critical habitat.  §1536(b)(3)(A); see also 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.14</a>(h).  If the Secretary concludes that the agency action would place the listed species in jeopardy or adversely modify its critical habitat, the Secretary shall suggest those reasonable and prudent alternatives which he believes would not violate [§7(a)(2)] and can be taken by the Federal agency … in implementing the agency action.  16 U.

        <p class="bodytext">    In February 2002, Arizona officials applied for EPA authorization to administer that States NPDES program.<a name="ZO-3ref" href="#ZO-3" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>3</b>
                </sup>
            </a>  The EPA initiated consultation with the FWS to determine whether the transfer of permitting authority would adversely affect any listed species.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The FWS regional office concluded that the transfer of authority would not cause any direct impact on water quality that would adversely affect listed species.  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06340, p. 564.  However, the FWS office was concerned that the transfer could result in the issuance of more discharge permits, which would lead to more development, which in turn could have an indirect adverse effect on the habitat of certain upland species, such as the cactus ferruginous pygmy-owl and the Pima pineapple cactus.  Specifically, the FWS feared that, because §7(a)(2)s consultation requirement does not apply to permitting decisions by state<em></em>authorities,<a name="ZO-4ref" href="#ZO-4" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>4</b>
                </sup>
            </a> the transfer of authority would empower Arizona officials to issue individual permits without considering and mitigating their indirect impact on these upland species.  <em>Id.,</em> at 565566.  The FWS regional office therefore urged that, in considering the proposed transfer of permitting authority, those involved in the consultation process should take these potential indirect impacts into account.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The EPA disagreed, maintaining that its approval action, which is an administrative transfer of authority, [would not be] the cause of future non-discharge-related impacts on endangered species from projects requiring State NPDES permits.  <em>Id.,</em> at 564.  As a factual matter, the EPA believed that the link between the transfer of permitting authority and the potential harm that could result from increased development was too attenuated.  <em>Id.</em>, at 654.  And as a legal matter, the EPA concluded that the mandatory nature of CWA §402(b)which directs that the EPA shall approve a transfer request if that sections nine statutory criteria are metstripped it of authority to disapprove a transfer based on any other considerations.  <em>Id.</em>, at 654655.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Pursuant to procedures set forth in a memorandum of understanding between the agencies, the dispute was referred to the agencies national offices for resolution.  In December 2002, the FWS issued its biological opinion, which concluded that the requested transfer would not cause jeopardy to listed species.  The opinion reasoned that the loss of section 7-related conservation benefits . . . is not an indirect effect of the authorization action, <em>id.,</em> at 117, because</p>
        <p class="bodytext">loss of any conservation benefit is not caused by EPAs decision to approve the State of Arizonas program.  Rather, the absence of the section 7 process that exists with respect to Federal NPDES permits reflects Congress decision to grant States the right to administer these programs under state law provided the States program meets the requirements of [§]402(b) of the Clean Water Act.  <em>Id.,</em> at 114.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In addition, the FWS opined that the EPAs continuing oversight of Arizonas permitting program, along with other statutory protections, would adequately protect listed species and their habitats following the transfer.  <em>Id.</em>, at 101107.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The EPA concluded that Arizona had met each of the nine statutory criteria listed in §402(b) and approved the transfer of permitting authority.  In the notice announcing the approval of the transfer, the EPA noted that the issuance of the FWSs biological opinion had conclude[d] the consultation process required by ESA section 7(a)(2) and reflects the [FWS] agreement with EPA that the approval of the State program meets the substantive requirements of the ESA.  <em>Id.,</em> at 73.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">2</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    On April 2, 2003, respondents filed a petition in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit seeking review of the transfer pursuant to 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1369.html#b_1_D" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §1369(b)(1)(D)</a>, which allows private parties to seek direct review of the EPAs determinations regarding state permitting programs in the federal courts of appeals.  The court granted petitioner National Association of Homebuilders leave to intervene as a respondent in that case.  Respondent Defenders of Wildlife also filed a separate action in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, alleging, among other things, that the biological opinion issued by the FWS in support of the proposed transfer did not comply with the ESAs standards.  The District Court severed that claim and transferred it to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which consolidated the case with the suit challenging the EPA transfer.  See 420 F. 3d 946 (2005).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    A divided panel of the Ninth Circuit held that the EPAs approval of the transfer was arbitrary and capricious because the EPA relied during the administrative proceedings on legally contradictory positions regarding its section 7 obligations.  <em>Id.,</em> at 959.  The court concluded that the EPA fail[ed] to understand its own authority under section 7(a)(2) to act on behalf of listed species and their habitat, <em>id.</em>, at 977, because the two propositions that underlie the EPAs actionthat (1) it must, under the [ESA], consult concerning transfers of CWA permitting authority, but (2) it is not permitted, as a matter of law, to take into account the impact on listed species in making the transfer decisioncannot both be true, <em>id.</em>, at 961.  The court therefore concluded that it was required to remand to the agency for a plausible explanation of its decision, based on a single, coherent interpretation of the statute.  <em>Id.</em>, at 962.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The panel majority, however, did not follow this course of action.  Rather, the panel went on to review the EPAs substantive construction of the statutes at issue and held that the ESA granted the EPA both the power and the duty to determine whether its transfer decision would jeopardize threatened or endangered species.  The panel did not dispute that Arizona had met the nine criteria set forth in §402(b) of the CWA, but the panel nevertheless concluded that §7(a)(2) of the ESA provided an affirmative grant of authority to attend to [the] protection of listed species, <em>id.</em>, at 965, in effect adding a tenth criterion to those specified in §402(b).  The panel dismissed the argument that the EPAs approval of the transfer application was not subject to §7(a)(2) because it was not a discretionary action within the meaning of 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a> (interpreting §7(a)(2) to apply only to agency actions in which there is discretionary Federal involvement and control).  420 F. 3d, at 967969.  It viewed the FWSs regulation as merely coterminous with the express statutory language encompassing all agency actions that are  authorized, funded, or carried out  by the agency.  <em>Id.</em>, at 969 (quoting 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#a_2" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(a)(2)</a>).  On these grounds, the court granted the petition and vacated the EPAs transfer decision.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In dissent, Judge Thompson explained that the transfer decision was not a discretionary action under 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a> because [t]he Clean Water Act, by its very terms, permits the EPA to consider only the nine specified factors.  If a states proposed permitting program meets the enumerated requirements, he reasoned, the EPA administrator shall approve the program.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1342.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §1342(b)</a>.  This [c]ongressional directive does not permit the EPA to impose additional conditions.  420 F. 3d, at 980.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Ninth Circuit denied rehearing and rehearing en banc.  450 F. 3d 394 (2006). <em></em>Writing for the six judges who dissented from the denial of rehearing en banc, Judge Kozinski disagreed with the panels conclusion that the EPAs analysis was so internally inconsistent as to be arbitrary and capricious.  He further noted that, if the panel was correct on this point, the proper resolution would have been to remand to the EPA for further explanation.  <em>Id.,</em> at 396398.  On the statutory question, Judge Kozinski echoed Judge Thompsons conclusion that once the nine criteria set forth in §402(b) of the CWA are satisfied, a transfer is mandatory and nondiscretionary.  <em>Id.</em>, at 397399.  He rejected the panel majoritys broad construction of ESA §7(a)(2), concluding that [i]f the ESA were as powerful as the majority contends, it would modify not only the EPAs obligation under the CWA, but <em>every</em> categorical mandate applicable to <em>every </em>federal agency.  <em>Id.</em>, at 399, n. 4.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Ninth Circuits construction of §7(a)(2) is at odds with that of other Courts of Appeals.  Compare 420 F. 3d 946 (case below), with <em>Platte River Whooping Crane Critical Habitat Maintenance Trust</em> v. <em>FERC</em>, 962 F. 2d 27, 3334 (CADC 1992), and <em>American Forest &amp; Paper Association</em> v. <em>EPA</em>, 137 F. 3d 291, 298299 (CA5 1998).  We granted certiorari to resolve this conflict, 549 U. S. ___ (2007), and we now reverse.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">II</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Before addressing this question of statutory interpretation, however, we first consider whether the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the EPAs transfer decision was arbitrary and capricious because, in that courts words, the agencies involved in the decision relied … on legally contradictory positions regarding [their] section 7 obligations.  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06340, at 23.  </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    As an initial matter, we note that if the EPAs action was arbitrary and capricious, as the Ninth Circuit held, the proper course would have been to remand to the agency for clarification of its reasons.  See <em>Gonzales</em> v. <em>Thomas</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/547/183" class="subref" title="subref">547 U. S. 183</a> (2006)
<em>(per curiam)</em>.  Indeed, the court below expressly recognized that this finding required it to remand to the agency for a plausible explanation of its decision, based on a single, coherent interpretation of the statute.  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06340, at 28.  But the Ninth Circuit did not take this course; instead, it jumped ahead to resolve the merits of the dispute.  In so doing, it erroneously deprived the agency of its usual administrative avenue for explaining and reconciling the arguably contradictory rationales that sometimes appear in the course of lengthy and complex administrative decisions.  We need not examine this question further, however, because we conclude that the Ninth Circuits determination that the EPAs action was arbitrary and capricious is not fairly supported by the record.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Review under the arbitrary and capricious standard is deferential; we will not vacate an agencys decision unless it</p>
        <p class="bodytext">has relied on factors which Congress had not intended it to consider, entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.  <em>Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

We will, however, uphold a decision of less than ideal clarity if the agencys path may reasonably be discerned.   <em>Ibid.</em> (quoting <em>Bowman Transp., Inc.</em> v. <em>Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc.</em>,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">286</a> (1974)
).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court of Appeals concluded that the EPAs decision was internally inconsistent because, in its view, the agency statedboth during preliminary review of Arizonas transfer application and in the Federal Register notice memorializing its final actionthat section 7 requires consultation regarding the effect of a permitting transfer on listed species.  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06340, at 23.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    With regard to the various statements made by the involved agencies regional offices during the early stages of consideration, the only inconsistency respondents can point to is the fact that the agencies changed their mindssomething that, as long as the proper procedures were followed, they were fully entitled to do.  The federal courts ordinarily are empowered to review only an agencys <em>final</em> action, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/5/704.html" class="subref" title="subref">5 U. S. C. §704</a>, and the fact that a preliminary determination by a local agency representative is later overruled at a higher level within the agency does not render the decisionmaking process arbitrary and capricious.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Respondents also point to the final Federal Register notice memorializing the EPAs approval of Arizonas transfer application.  This notice stated that the FWSs issuance of its biological opinion had conclude[d] the consultation process required by ESA section 7(a)(2).  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06340, at 73.  Respondents contend that this statement is inconsistent with the EPAs previously expressed positionand their position throughout this litigationthat §7(a)(2)s consultation requirement is not triggered by a transfer application under §402 of the CWA.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    We are not persuaded that this statement constitutes the type of error that requires a remand.  By the time the Federal Register statement was issued, the EPA had already consulted with the FWS about the Arizona application, and the question whether that consultation had been <em>required</em>, as opposed to voluntarily undertaken by the agency, was simply not germane to the final agency transfer decision.  The Federal Register statement, in short, was dictum, and it had no bearing on the final agency action that respondents challenge.  Mindful of Congress admonition that in reviewing agency action, due account shall be taken of the rule of prejudicial error, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/5/706.html" class="subref" title="subref">5 U. S. C. §706</a>, we do not believe that this stray statement, which could have had no effect on the underlying agency action being challenged, requires that we further delay the transfer of permitting authority to Arizona by remanding to the agency for clarification.  See also <em>PDK Labs., Inc. </em>v. <em>United States Drug Enforcement Admin.</em>, 362 F. 3d 786, 799 (CADC 2004) (In administrative law, as in federal civil and criminal litigation, there is a harmless error rule).<a name="ZO-5ref" href="#ZO-5" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    We further disagree with respondents suggestion that, by allegedly altering its legal position while the Arizona transfer decision and its associated litigation was pending, the EPA is effectively nullifying respondents rights to participate in administrative proceedings concerning Arizonas application, and particularly respondents rights under EPAs own regulations to comment on NPDES transfer applications.  Brief for Respondents 28 (citing 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/40/123" class="subref" title="subref">40 CFR §123.61</a>(b); emphasis deleted).  Consistent with EPA regulations, the agency made available a comment period of not less than 45 days during which interested members of the public [could] express their views on the State program.  §123.61(a)(1).  Respondents do not suggest that they were deprived of their right to comment during this period.<a name="ZO-6ref" href="#ZO-6" class="">

        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Respondents also contend that if the case were remanded to the EPA, they would raise additional challengesincluding, for example, a challenge to the EPAs provision of financial assistance to Arizona for the administration of its NPDES program.  However, as explained below, any such agency action is separate and independent of the agencys decision to authorize the transfer of permitting authority pursuant to §402(b).  See n. 11, <em>infra</em>.  We express no opinion as to the viability of a separate administrative or legal challenge to such actions.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">We turn now to the substantive statutory question raised by the petitions, a question that requires us to mediate a clash of seemingly categoricaland, at first glance, irreconcilablelegislative commands.  Section 402(b) of the CWA provides, without qualification, that the EPA shall approve a transfer application unless it determines that the State lacks adequate authority to perform the nine functions specified in the section.

Thus, §402(b) does not just set forth <em>minimum</em> requirements for the transfer of permitting authority; it affirmatively mandates that the transfer shall be approved if the specified criteria are met.  The provision operates as a ceiling as well as a floor.  By adding an additional criterion, the Ninth Circuits construction of §7(a)(2) raises that floor and alters §402(b)s statutory command.<a name="ZO-8ref" href="#ZO-8" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    The Ninth Circuits reading of §7(a)(2) would not only abrogate §402(b)s statutory mandate, but also result in the implicit repeal of many additional otherwise categorical statutory commands.  Section 7(a)(2) by its terms applies to any action authorized, funded, or carried out by a federal agencycovering, in effect, almost anything that an agency might do.  Reading the provision broadly would thus partially override every federal statute mandating agency action by subjecting such action to the further condition that it pose no jeopardy to endangered species.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Platte River Whooping Crane Critical Habitat Maintenance Trust</em> v. <em>FERC</em>, 962 F. 2d, at 3334 (considering whether §7(a)(2) overrides the Federal Power Acts prohibition on amending annual power licenses).  While the language of §7(a)(2) does not explicitly repeal any provision of the CWA (or any other statute), reading it for all that it might be worth runs foursquare into our presumption against implied repeals.</p>

        <p class="opcentered">1</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The agencies charged with implementing the ESA have attempted to resolve this tension through regulations implementing §7(a)(2).  The NMFS and FWS, acting jointly on behalf of the Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior and following notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures, have promulgated a regulation stating that Section 7 and the requirements of this part apply to all actions in which there is <em>discretionary</em> Federal involvement or control.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a> (emphasis added).  Pursuant to this regulation, §7(a)(2) would not be read as impliedly repealing nondiscretionary statutory mandates, even when they might result in some agency action.  Rather, the ESAs requirements would come into play only when an action results from the exercise of agency discretion.  This interpretation harmonizes the statutes by giving effect to the ESAs no-jeopardy mandate whenever an agency has discretion to do so, but not when the agency is forbidden from considering such extrastatutory factors.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    We have recognized that [t]he latitude the ESA gives the Secretary in enforcing the statute, together with the degree of regulatory expertise necessary to its enforcement, establishes that we owe some degree of deference to the Secretarys reasonable interpretation of the statutory scheme.  <em>Babbitt</em> v. <em>Sweet Home Chapter, Communities for Great Ore.</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">If the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress… . [However,] if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the question for the court is whether the agencys answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.  <em>Id.</em>, at 842843 (footnotes omitted).</p>

).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    We must therefore read §7(a)(2) of the ESA against the statutory backdrop of the many mandatory agency directives whose operation it would implicitly abrogate or repeal if it were construed as broadly as the Ninth Circuit did below.  When §7(a)(2) is read this way, we are left with a fundamental ambiguity that is not resolved by the statutory text.  An agency cannot simultaneously obey the differing mandates set forth in §7(a)(2) of the ESA and §402(b) of the CWA, and consequently the statutory languageread in light of the canon against implied repealsdoes not itself provide clear guidance as to which command must give way.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In this situation, it is appropriate to look to the implementing agencys expert interpretation, which cabins §7(a)(2)s application to actions in which there is discretionary Federal involvement or control.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a>.  This reading harmonizes the statutes by applying §7(a)(2) to guide agencies existing discretionary authority, but not reading it to override express statutory mandates.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">2</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    We conclude that this interpretation is reasonable in light of the statutes text and the overall statutory scheme, and that it is therefore entitled to deference under <em>Chevron</em>.  Section 7(a)(2) requires that an agency insure that the actions it authorizes, funds, or carries out are not likely to jeopardize listed species or their habitats.  To insure somethingas the court below recognizedmeans  [t]o make certain, to secure, to guarantee (some thing, event, etc.).   420 F. 3d, at 963 (quoting 7 Oxford English Dictionary 1059 (2d ed. 1989)).  The regulations focus on discretionary actions accords with the commonsense conclusion that, when an agency is <em>required </em>to do something by statute, it simply lacks the power to insure that such action will not jeopardize endangered species.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This reasoning is supported by our decision in <em>Department of Transportation</em> v. <em>Public Citizen</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/541/752" class="subref" title="subref">541 U. S. 752</a> (2004)
.  That case concerned safety regulations that were promulgated by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) and had the effect of triggering a Presidential directive allowing Mexican trucks to ply their trade on United States roads.  The Court held that the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) did not require the agency to assess the environmental effects of allowing the trucks entry because the legally relevant cause of the entry of the Mexican trucks is <em>not </em>FMCSAs action, but instead the actions of the President in lifting the moratorium and those of Congress in granting the President this authority while simultaneously limiting FMCSAs discretion.  <em>Id.</em>,<em></em>at 769 (emphasis in original).  The Court concluded that where an agency has no ability to prevent a certain effect due to its limited statutory authority over the relevant actions, the agency cannot be considered a legally relevant cause of the effect.  <em>Id.</em>,<em></em>at 770.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    We do not suggest that <em>Public Citizen </em>controls the outcome here; §7(a)(2), unlike NEPA, imposes a substantive (and not just a procedural) statutory requirement, and these cases involve agency action more directly related to environmental concerns than the FMCSAs truck safety regulations.  But the basic principle announced in <em>Public Citizen</em>that an agency cannot be considered the legal cause of an action that it has no statutory discretion <em>not </em>to takesupports the reasonableness of the FWSs interpretation of §7(a)(2) as reaching only discretionary agency actions.

        <p class="opcentered">3</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The court below simply disregarded §402.03s interpretation of the ESAs reach, dismissing the regulations reference to discretionary … involvement  as merely congruent with the statutory reference to actions authorized, funded, or carried out by the agency.  420 F. 3d, 968.  But this reading cannot be right.  Agency discretion presumes that an agency can exercise judgment in connection with a particular action.  See <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc.</em> v. <em>Volpe</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/401/402" class="subref" title="subref">401 U. S. 402</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">415</a>416 (1971)
; see also Random House Dictionary of the English Language 411 (unabridged ed. 1967) (discretion defined as the power or right to decide or act according to ones own judgment; freedom of judgment or choice).  As the mandatory language of §402(b) itself illustrates, not every action authorized, funded, or carried out by a federal agency is a product of that agencys exercise of discretion.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The dissents interpretation of §402.03 is similarly implausible.  The dissent would read the regulation as simply clarifying that discretionary agency actions are included within the scope of §7(a)(2), but not confining the statutes reach to such actions.  See <em>post</em>, at 711.  But this reading would render the regulation entirely superfluous.  Nothing in either §7(a)(2) or the other agency regulations interpreting that section, see §402.02, suggests that discretionary actions are <em>excluded</em> from the scope of the ESA, and there is thus no need for a separate regulation to bring them within the statutes scope.  On the dissents reading, §402.03s reference to discretionary federal involvement is mere surplusage, and we have cautioned against reading a text in a way that makes part of it redundant.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>TRW Inc.</em> v. <em>Andrews</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/534/19" class="subref" title="subref">534 U. S. 19</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">31</a> (2001)
.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This history of the regulation also supports the reading  to which we defer today.  As the dissent itself points out, the proposed version of §402.03 initially stated that Section 7 and the requirements of this Part apply to <em>all actions in which there is Federal involvement or control</em>, 
48Fed. Reg.
29999 (1983) (emphasis added); the Secretary of the Interior modified this language to provide (as adopted in the Final Rule now at issue) that the statuory requirements apply to all actions in which there is <em>discretionary</em> Federal involvement or control, 
51Fed. Reg.
19958 (1986) (emphasis added).  The dissents reading would  rob the word discretionary of any effect, and substitute the earlier, proposed version of the regulation for the text that was actually adopted.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In short, we read §402.03 to mean what it says: that §7(a)(2)s no-jeopardy duty covers only discretionary agency actions and does not attach to actions (like the NPDES permitting transfer authorization) that an agency is <em>required</em> by statute to undertake once certain specified triggering events have occurred.  This reading not only is reasonable, inasmuch as it gives effect to the ESAs provision, but also comports with the canon against implied repeals because it stays §7(a)(2)s mandate where it would effectively override otherwise mandatory statutory duties.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">D</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Respondents argue that our opinion in <em>TVA</em> v. <em>Hill</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/437/153" class="subref" title="subref">437 U. S. 153</a> (1978)
, supports their contrary position.  In that case, we held that the ESA prohibited the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) from putting into operation the Tellico Damdespite the fact that the agency had already spent over $100 million on the nearly completed projectbecause doing so would have threatened the critical habitat of the endangered snail darter.  In language on which respondents rely, the Court concluded that the ordinary meaning of §7 of the ESA contained no exemptions and reflected a conscious decision by Congress to give endangered species priority over the primary missions of federal agencies.  <em>Id.</em>, at 173, 185, 188.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>TVA </em>v. <em>Hill</em>, however, had no occasion to answer the question presented in these cases.  That case was decided almost a decade before the adoption in 1986 of the regulations contained in 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a>.  And in any event, the construction project at issue in <em>TVA </em>v. <em>Hill</em>, while expensive, was also discretionary.  The TVA argued that by continuing to make lump-sum appropriations to the TVA, some of which were informally earmarked for the Tellico Dam project, Congress had implicitly repealed §7s no-jeopardy requirement as it applied to that project.  See 437 U. S., at 189193.  The Court rejected this argument, concluding that [t]he Appropriations Acts did not themselves identify the projects for which the sums had been appropriated and that reports by congressional committees allegedly directing the TVA to complete the project lacked the force of law.  <em>Id.</em>, at 189, n. 35.  Central to the Courts decision was the conclusion that Congress did not <em>mandate</em> that the TVA put the dam into operation; there was no statutory command to that effect; and there was therefore no basis for contending that applying the ESAs no-jeopardy requirement would implicitly repeal another affirmative congressional directive.<a name="ZO-9ref" href="#ZO-9" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>TVA </em>v. <em>Hill</em> thus supports the position, expressed in §402.03, that the ESAs no-jeopardy mandate applies to every <em>discretionary</em> agency actionregardless of the expense or burden its application might impose.  But that case did not speak to the question whether §7(a)(2) applies to <em>non</em>-discretionary actions, like the one at issue here.  The regulation set forth in 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a> addressed that question, and we defer to its reasonable interpretation.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">IV</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Finally, respondents and their <em>amici</em> argue that, even if §7(a)(2) is read to apply only to discretionary agency actions, the decision to transfer NPDES permitting authority to Arizona represented such an exercise of discretion.  They contend that the EPAs decision to authorize a transfer is not entirely mechanical; that it involves some exercise of judgment as to whether a State has met the criteria set forth in §402(b); and that these criteria incorporate references to wildlife conservation that bring consideration of §7(a)(2)s no-jeopardy mandate properly within the agencys discretion.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The argument is unavailing.  While the EPA may exercise some judgment in determining whether a State has demonstrated that it has the authority to carry out §402(b)s enumerated statutory criteria, the statute clearly does not grant it the discretion to add another entirely separate prerequisite to that list.  Nothing in the text of §402(b) authorizes the EPA to consider the protection of threatened or endangered species as an end in itself when evaluating a transfer application.  And to the extent that some of the §402(b) criteria may result in environmental benefits to marine species,<a name="ZO-10ref" href="#ZO-10" class="">

            </a> there is no dispute that Arizona has satisfied each of those statutory criteria.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Respondents argument has been disclaimed not only by the EPA, but also by the FWS and the NMFS, the two agencies primarily charged with administering §7(a)(2) and the drafters of the regulations implementing that section. Each agency recently issued a formal letter concluding that the authorization of an NPDES permitting transfer is not the kind of discretionary agency action that is covered by §402.03.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06549, at 103a116a.  An agencys interpretation of the meaning of its own regulations is entitled to deference unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation, <em>Auer</em> v. <em>Robbins</em>,

For example, it suggests that the EPA could condition transfers of permitting authority on the States acceptance of additional continuing oversight by the EPA (presumably beyond that oversight already contemplated by the CWAs statutory language).

For example, they argue that the EPAs alleged provision of funding to Arizona for the administration of its clean water programs is the kind of discretionary agency action that is subject to §7(a)(2).  However, assuming this is true, any such funding decision is a separate agency action that is outside the scope of this lawsuit.  Respondents also point to the fact that, following the transfer of permitting authority, the EPA will retain oversight authority over the state permitting process, including the power to object to proposed permits.  But the fact that the EPA may exercise discretionary oversight authoritywhich may trigger §7(a)(2)s consultation and no-jeopardy obligationsafter the transfer does not mean that the decision authorizing the transfer is itself discretionary.

        <p class="bodytext">    These cases present a problem of conflicting shalls.  On the one hand, §402(b) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) provides that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) shall approve a States application to administer a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permitting program unless it determines that nine criteria are not satisfied.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1342.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §1342(b)</a>.  On the other hand, shortly after the passage of the CWA, Congress enacted §7(a)(2) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA), which commands that federal agencies shall insure that their actions do not jeopardize endangered species.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#a_2" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(a)(2)</a>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    When faced with competing statutory mandates, it is our duty to give full effect to both if at all possible.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Morton</em> v. <em>Mancari</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/417/535" class="subref" title="subref">417 U. S. 535</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">551</a> (1974)
 ([W]hen two statutes are capable of co-existence, it is the duty of the courts, absent a clearly expressed congressional intention to the contrary, to regard each as effective).  The Court fails at this task.  Its opinion unsuccessfully tries to reconcile the CWA and ESA by relying on a federal regulation, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a> (2006), which it reads as limiting the reach of §7(a)(2) to <em>only</em> discretionary federal actions, see <em>ante</em>, at 1719.  Not only is this reading inconsistent with the text and history of §402.03, but it is fundamentally inconsistent with the ESA itself.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In the celebrated snail darter case, <em>TVA</em> v. <em>Hill</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/437/153" class="subref" title="subref">437 U. S. 153</a> (1978)
, we held that the ESA reveals a conscious decision by Congress to give endangered species priority over the primary missions of federal agencies, <em>id</em>., at 185.  Consistent with that intent, Chief Justice Burgers exceptionally thorough and admirable opinion explained that §7 admits of<em></em>no exception.<em>  Id</em>., at 173.  Creating precisely such an exception by exempting nondiscretionary federal actions from the ESAs coverage, the Court whittles away at Congress comprehensive effort to protect endangered species from the risk of extinction and fails to give the Act its intended effect.  After first giving <em>Hill</em> the attention it deserves, I will comment further on the irrelevance of §402.03 to these cases and offer other available ways to give effect to both CWA and the ESA.  Having done so, I conclude by explaining why these cases should be remanded to the EPA for further proceedings.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">I</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In <em>Hill, </em>we were presented with two separate questions: (1) whether the ESA required a court to enjoin the operation of the nearly completed Tellico Dam and Reservoir Project because the Secretary of the Interior had determined that its operation would eradicate a small endangered fish known as a snail darter; and (2) whether post-1973 congressional appropriations for the completion of the Tellico Dam constituted an implied repeal of the ESA, at least insofar as it applied to the Dam.  437 U. S., at 156.  More than 30 pages of our opinion explain our affirmative answer to the first question, see <em>id.,</em> at 156188, but just over four pages sufficed to explain our negative answer to the second, see <em>id</em>., at 189193.  While it is our ruling on the first question that is relevant to the cases before us, it is our refusal to hold that the ESA itself had been impliedly repealed that the majority strangely deems most significant.  See <em>ante, </em>at 2122.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In answering <em>Hill</em>s first question,<em></em>we did not discuss implied repeals.  On the contrary, that portion of the opinion contained our definitive interpretation of the ESA, in which we concluded that the language, history, and structure of the [ESA] indicates beyond doubt that Congress intended endangered species to be afforded the highest of priorities.  437 U. S., at 174; see also <em>id</em>., at 177 ( The dominant theme pervading all Congressional discussion of the proposed [ESA] was the overriding need <em>to devote whatever effort and resources were necessary</em> to avoid further diminution of national and worldwide wildlife resources  (quoting Coggins, Conserving Wildlife Resources: An Overview of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, 
51N. D. L. Rev.
315,
321 (1975) (emphasis added in <em>Hill</em>))).  With respect to §7 in particular, our opinion could not have been any clearer.  We plainly held that it admits of<em> no exception</em>.  437 U. S., at 173 (emphasis added).<a name="ZD-1ref" href="#ZD-1" class="">

        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Our opinion in <em>Hill </em>explained at length why §7 imposed obligations on all federal agencies to ensure that actions authorized, funded, or carried out by them do not jeopardize the continued existence of endangered species.  437 U. S., at 173 (emphasis deleted; internal quotation marks omitted).  Not a word in the opinion stated or suggested that §7 obligations are inapplicable to mandatory agency actions that would threaten the eradication of an endangered species.  Nor did the opinion describe the Tennessee Valley Authoritys (TVA) attempted completion of the Tellico Dam as a discretionary act.  How could it?  After all, if the Secretary of the Interior had not declared the snail darter an endangered species whose critical habitat would be destroyed by operation of the Tellico Dam, the TVA surely would have been obligated to spend the additional funds that Congress appropriated to complete the project.<a name="ZD-2ref" href="#ZD-2" class="">

            </a>  Unconcerned with whether an agency action was mandatory or discretionary, we simply held that §7 of the ESA</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> reveals an explicit congressional decision to require agencies to afford <em>first priority</em> to the declared national policy of saving endangered species.  The pointed omission of the type of qualifying language previously included in endangered species legislation reveals a conscious decision by Congress to give endangered species <em>priority over the </em><em>primary missions of federal agencies.</em>   <em>Id</em>., at 185 (emphasis added).<a name="ZD-3ref" href="#ZD-3" class="">

            </a>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The fact that we also concluded that the post-1973 congressional appropriations did not impliedly repeal the ESA provides no support for the majoritys contention that the obligations imposed by §7(a)(2) may be limited to discretionary acts.  A few passages from the relevant parts of <em>Hill</em> belie that suggestion.  After noting the oddity of holding that the interest in protecting the survival of a relatively small number of 3-inch fish would require the permanent halting of a virtually completed dam for which Congress has expended more than $100 million, we found that the explicit provisions of the Endangered Species Act require precisely that result.  <em>Id.,</em> at 172, 173.  We then continued:</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> One would be hard pressed to find a statutory provision whose terms were any plainer than those in §7 of the Endangered Species Act.  Its very words affirmatively command all federal agencies to <em>insure </em>that actions <em>authorized, funded,</em> or <em>carried out </em>by them do not <em>jeopardize </em>the continued existence of an endangered species or <em>result </em>in the destruction or modification of habitat of such species … .   <em>Id</em>., at 173 (quoting 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536</a> (1976 ed.) (emphasis added in <em>Hill</em>)).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
We also reviewed the ESAs history to identify a variety of exceptions that had been included in earlier legislation and unenacted proposals but were omitted from the final version of the 1973 statute.  We explained that earlier endangered species legislation qualified the obligation of federal agencies, but the 1973 Act purposefully omitted all phrases which might have qualified an agencys responsibilities.  437 U. S., at 181, 182.  Moreover, after observing that the ESA creates only a limited number of hardship exemptions, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1539.html" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1539</a>none of which would apply to federal agencieswe applied the maxim <em>expressio unius est expression alterius</em> to conclude that there are no exemptions in the Endangered Species Act for federal agencies,437 U. S., at 188.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Today, however, the Court countenances such an exemption.  It erroneously concludes that the ESA contains an unmentioned exception for nondiscretionary agency action and that the statutes command to enjoin the completion of the Tellico Dam depended on the unmentioned fact that the TVA was attempting to perform a discretionary act.  But both the text of the ESA and our opinion in <em>Hill</em> compel the contrary determination that Congress intended the ESA to apply to all federal agencies and to all actions authorized, funded, or carried out by them.  <em>Id.,</em> at 173 (emphasis deleted).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    A transfer of NPDES permitting authority under §402(b) of the CWA is undoubtedly one of those actions that is authorized or carried out by a federal agency.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(b)</a>; 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.02</a> (defining action as all activities or programs of any kind authorized, funded, or carried out, in whole or in part, by Federal agencies in the United States or upon the high seas.  Examples include, but are not limited to . . . actions directly or indirectly causing modifications to the land, water, or air).  It follows from <em>Hill </em>that §7(a)(2) applies to such NPDES transferswhether they are mandatory or discretionary.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">II</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Given our unequivocal holding in <em>Hill</em> that the ESA has first priority over all other federal action, 437 U. S., at 185, if any statute should yield, it should be the CWA.  But no statute must yield unless it is truly incapable of coexistence.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Morton</em>, 417 U. S., at 551.  Therefore, assuming that §402(b) of the CWA contains its own mandatory command, we should first try to harmonize that provision with the mandatory requirements of §7(a)(2) of the ESA.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Courts solution is to rely on 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a>, which states that Section 7 and the requirements of this part apply to all actions in which there is discretionary Federal involvement or control.  The Court explains that this regulation harmonizes the statutes by giving effect to the ESAs no-jeopardy mandate whenever an agency has discretion to do so, but by lifting that mandate when the agency is forbidden from considering such extrastatutory factors.  <em>Ante</em>, at 17.  This is not harmony, and it certainly isnt effect.  Rather than giving genuine effect to §7(a)(2), the Court permits a wholesale limitation on the reach of the ESA.  Its interpretation of §402.03 conflicts with the text and history of the regulation, as well as our interpretation of §7 in the snail darter case.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    To begin with, the plain language of §402.03 does not state that its coverage is limited to discretionary actions.  Quite the opposite, the most natural reading of the text is that it confirms the broad construction of §7 endorsed by our opinion in <em>Hill</em>.  Indeed, the only way to read §402.03 in accordance with the facts of the case and our holding that §7 admits of no exception[s], 437 U. S., at 173, is that it eliminates any possible argument that the ESA does not extend to situations in which the discretionary federal involvement is only marginal.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court is simply mistaken when it says that it reads §402.03 to mean what it says: that §7(a)(2)s no-jeopardy duty covers <em>only</em> discretionary agency actions … .  <em>Ante,</em> at 21 (emphasis added).  That is not, in fact, what §402.03 says.  The word only is the Courts addition to the text, not the agencys.  Moreover, that text surely does not go on to say (as the Court does) that the duty does not attach to actions (like the NPDES permitting transfer authorization) that an agency is <em>required</em> by statute to undertake once certain specified triggering events have occurred. <em>Ibid.</em>  If the drafters of the regulation had intended such a far-reaching change in the law, surely they would have said so by using language similar to that which the Court uses today.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Nothing in the proceedings that led to the promulgation of the regulation suggests any reason for limiting the pre-existing understanding of the scope of §7s coverage.  EPA codified the current version of §402.03 in 1986 as part of a general redrafting of ESA regulations.  In the 1983 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the proposed version of §402.03 stated that §7 and the requirements of this Part apply to all actions in which there is Federal involvement or control.  
48Fed. Reg.
29999 (1983).  Without any explanation, the final rule inserted the word discretionary before Federal involvement or control.

            </a>  Clearly, if the Secretary of the Interior meant to limit the pre-existing understanding of the scope of the coverage of §7(a)(2) by promulgating this regulation, that intent would have been mentioned somewhere in the text of the regulations or in contemporaneous comment about them.  See <em>National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assn.</em> v. <em>Brand X Internet Services</em>,

 (We have frequently reiterated that an agency must cogently explain why it has exercised its discretion in a given manner).  Yet, the final rule said nothing about limiting the reach of §7 or our decision in <em>Hill.  </em>Nor did it mention the change from the notice of proposed rulemaking.  I can only assume, then, that the regulation does mean what both it and the notice of proposed rulemaking says: Section 7(a)(2) applies to discretionary federal action, but not <em>only</em> to discretionary action.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The only explanation the agency provided for §402.03 was the following:</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> This section, which explains the applicability of section 7, implicitly covers Federal activities within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States and upon the high seas as a result of the definition of action in §402.02.  The explanation for the scope of the term action is provided in the discussion under §402.01 above.  51 Fed. Reg. 19937.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
This statement directs us to two sources: the definition of action in §402.02 and the explanation for the scope of the term action  in §402.01.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Both confirm that there was no intent to draw a distinction between discretionary and nondiscretionary actions.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Section 402.02 provides in relevant part:</p>
        <p class="bodytext"><em>Action </em>means <em>all</em> activities or programs <em>of any kind</em> authorized, funded, or carried out, in whole or in part, by Federal agencies in the United States or upon the high seas.  Examples include, but are not limited to:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    (a)actions intended to conserve listed species or their habitat;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    (b)the promulgation of regulations . . .   (second and third emphases added.)</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
Actions in either of the described sub-categories are sometimes mandatory and sometimes discretionary.  Likewise, as the italicized portions indicate, the term action expressly refers to all agency activities or programs of any kind, regardless of whether they are discretionary or mandatory.  By reading the term discretionary as a limitation on action, the Court creates a contradiction in the EPAs own regulation.<a name="ZD-5ref" href="#ZD-5" class="">

        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    As for the final rules explanation for the scope of the term action in §402.01, that too is fully consistent with my interpretation of §402.03.  That explanation plainly states that <em>all</em> Federal actions including conservations programs are subject to the consultation requirements of section 7(a)(2) if they may affect listed species or their critical habitats.  51 Fed. Reg. 19929 (emphasis added).  The regulation does not say all discretionary federal actions, nor does it evince an intent to limit the scope of §7(a)(2) in any way.  Rather, it just restates that the ESA applies to all federal actions, just as the notice of proposed rulemaking did.  This explanation of the scope of the word action is therefore a strong indication that the Courts reading of discretionary is contrary to its intended meaning.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    An even stronger indication is the fact that at no point in the administrative proceedings in these cases did EPA even mention<em></em>it.<a name="ZD-6ref" href="#ZD-6" class="">

            </a>  As an initial matter, it is worth emphasizing that even if EPA had relied on §402.03, its interpretation of the ESA would not be entitled to deference under <em>Chevron U. S. A. Inc.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/467/837" class="subref" title="subref">467 U. S. 837</a> (1984)
, because it is not charged with administering that statute, <em>id</em>., at 844 (We have long recognized that considerable weight should be accorded to an executive departments construction of a statutory scheme <em>it is entrusted to administer</em>. (emphasis added)); <em>Department of Treasury</em> v. <em>FLRA</em>, 837 F. 2d 1163, 1167 (CADC 1988) ([W]hen an agency interprets a statute other than that which it has been entrusted to administer, its interpretation is not entitled to deference).  The Departments of the Interior and Commerce, not EPA, are charged with administering the ESA.  See <em>Babbitt </em>v. <em>Sweet Home Chapter, Communities for Great Ore.,</em> 515 U. S., 687, 703704 (1995).  And EPA has conceded that the Department of the Interiors biological opinion did not discuss 50 CFR. 402.03, and it did not address the question whether the consultation that produced the [biological opinion] was required by the ESA.  Pet. for Cert. in No. 06549, p. 24; see App. 77124 (never mentioning §402.03).  Left with this unfavorable administrative record, EPA can only lean on the fact that the Department of the Interior has recently clarified its position regarding §402.03 in a <em>different</em> administrative proceeding.  See Pet. for Cert. in No. 06549, pp. 2425; <em>id</em>., at 26 (The recent F[ish and Wildlife Service] and N[ational Marine Fisheries Service] communications regarding Alaskas pending transfer application reflect those agencies considered interpretations . . . of [50 CFR] 402.03); App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06340, pp. 103a116a; see also <em>ante</em>, at 12 n. 5.  We have long held, however, that courts may not affirm an agency action on grounds other than those adopted by the agency in the administrative proceedings.  See <em>SEC</em> v. <em>Chenery Corp.</em>,

.  The majority ignores this hoary principle of administrative law and substitutes a post-hoc interpretation of §7(a)(2) and §402.03 for that of the relevant agency.  For that reason alone, these cases should be remanded to the agency.  And for the other reasons I have given, §402.03 cannot be used to harmonize the CWA and the ESA.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">III</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    There are at least two ways in which the CWA and the ESA can be given full effect without privileging one statute over the other.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">A</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The text of §7(a)(2) itself provides the first possible way of reconciling that provision with §402(b) of the CWA.   The subsection reads:</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> Each Federal agency shall, <em>in consultation with and with the assistance of the Secretary</em>, insure that any action authorized, funded, or carried out by such agency (hereinafter in this section referred to as an agency action) is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of habitat of such species which is determined by the Secretary, after consultation as appropriate with affected States, to be critical, unless such agency has been granted an exemption for such action by the Committee pursuant to subsection (h) of this section.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#a_2" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(a)(2)</a> (emphasis added).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court is certainly correct that the use of the word shall in §7(a)(2) imposes a mandatory requirement on the federal agencies.  See <em>ante</em>, at 14.  It is also correct that the ESAs mandate is to be carried out through consultation and may require the agency to adopt an alternative course of action.  <em>Ante,</em> at 15.  The Court is too quick to conclude, however, that this consultation requirement creates an irreconcilable conflict between this provision and §402(b) of the CWA.  It rushes to this flawed judgment because of a basic conceptual erroran error that is revealed as early as the first paragraph of its opinion.  Rather than attempting to find a way to give effect to §7(a)(2)s consultation requirement, the Court frames the question presented as whether §7(a)(2) effectively operates as a tenth criterion on which the transfer of permitting power under the first statute must be conditioned.   <em>Ante</em>, at 12.  The Court is not alone in this.  The author of the Ninth Circuit opinion below also stated that the ESA <em>adds</em> one requirement to the list of considerations under the Clean Water Act permitting transfer provision.  450 F. 3d, at 404 n. 2 (2006) (Berzon, J., concurring in denial of rehearing en banc) (emphasis in original).  But while the ESA does mandate that the relevant agencies consul[t] with the Interior Department, that consultation process also provides a way for the agencies to give effect to both statutes.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The first step in the statutory consultation process is to identify whether any endangered species will be affected by an agency action.  An agency proposing a particular action, such as an NPDES transfer, will typically ask the Secretary of the Interior whether any listed species may be present in the area of the proposed action and whether that action will affect those species.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#c" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(c)</a>.  It is entirely possible that no listed species will be affected, and any anticipated conflict between the ESA and another statute will have been avoided at this threshold stage.  If, however, the Secretary determines that a proposed action may affect an endangered species or its critical habitat, the agency must formally consult with the Secretary.  This consultation culminates in the issuance of a biological opinion, which detail[s] how the agency action affects the species or its critical habitat.  §1536(b)(3)(A); see also 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.14</a>(h).  Even at this stage, it is still possible that formal consultation will reveal that the agency action will not jeopardize any species.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 
63Fed. Reg.
51199 (1998) (noting that FWS rendered a no jeopardy finding with respect to the transfer of permitting authority to Texas).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    If the biological opinion concludes that the agency action would put a listed species in jeopardy, however, the ESA contains a process for resolving the competing demands of agency action and species protection.  The ESA provides that the Secretary shall suggest those reasonable and prudent alternatives which he believes would not violate subsection (a)(2) and can be taken by the Federal agency or applicant in implementing the agency action.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#b_3_A" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(b)(3)(A)</a>; see also 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.14</a>(h)(3).  The agencys regulations define [r]easonable and prudent alternatives as</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> alternative actions identified during formal consultation that can be implemented in a manner consistent with the intended purpose of the action, that can be implemented consistent with the scope of the Federal agencys legal authority and jurisdiction, that is economically and technologically feasible, and that the Director [of FWS] believes would avoid the likelihood of jeopardizing the continued existence of listed species or resulting in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat.   
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.02</a>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
Thus, in the face of any conflict between the ESA and another federal statute, the ESA and its implementing regulations encourage federal agencies to work out a reasonable alternative that would let the proposed action move forward consistent with [its] intended purpose and the agencys legal authority, while also avoiding any violation of  §7(a)(2).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    When applied to the NPDES transfer program, the reasonable and prudent alternatives process would enable EPA and the Department of the Interior to develop a substitute that would allow a transfer of permitting authority <em>and</em> would not jeopardize endangered species.  Stated differently, the consultation process would generate an alternative course of action whereby the transfer could still take placeas required by §402(b) of the CWAbut in such a way that would honor the mandatory requirements of §7(a)(2) of the ESA.  This should come as no surprise to EPA, as it has engaged in pre-transfer consultations at least six times in the past and has stated that it is not barred from doing so by the CWA.<a name="ZD-7ref" href="#ZD-7" class="">

        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Finally, for the rare case in which no reasonable and prudent alternative can be found, Congress has provided yet another mechanism for resolving any conflicts between the ESA and a proposed agency action.  In 1978, shortly after our decision in <em>Hill</em>, Congress amended the ESA to create the Endangered Species Committee, which it authorized to grant exemptions from §7(a)(2).  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#e" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(e)</a>.  Because it has the authority to approve the extinction of an endangered species, the Endangered Species Committee is colloquially described as the God Squad or God Committee.  In light of this weighty responsibility, Congress carefully laid out requirements for the God Committees membership,<a name="ZD-8ref" href="#ZD-8" class="">

                    <b>10</b>

            </a>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    As the final arbiter in situations in which the ESA conflicts with a proposed agency action, the God Committee embodies the primacy of the ESAs mandate and serves as the final mechanism for harmonizing that Act with other federal statutes.  By creating this Committee, Congress recognized that some conflicts with the ESA may not be capable of resolution without having to forever sacrifice some endangered species.  At the same time, the creation of this last line of defense reflects Congress view that the ESA should not yield to another federal action except as a final resort and except when authorized by high level officials after serious consideration.  In short, when all else has failed and two federal statutes are incapable of resolution, Congress left the choice to the Committeenot to this Court; it did not limit the ESA in the way the majority does today.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">B</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    EPAs regulations offer a second way to harmonize the CWA with the ESA.  After EPA has transferred NPDES permitting authority to a State, the agency continues to oversee the States permitting program.  See <em>Arkansas</em> v. <em>Oklahoma</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/503/91" class="subref" title="subref">503 U. S. 91</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">105</a> (1992)
 (Congress preserved for the Administrator broad authority to oversee state permit programs).  If a state permit is outside the guidelines and the requirements of the CWA, EPA may object to it and block its issuance.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1342.html#d_2" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §1342(d)(2)</a>; 
66Fed. Reg.
11206 (2001).  Given these ongoing responsibilities, EPA has enacted a regulation that requires a State to enter into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) that sets forth the particulars of the agencys oversight duties.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/40/123" class="subref" title="subref">40 CFR §123.24</a>(a) (2006).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">The regulation governing MOAs contains several detailed requirements.  For instance, the regulation states that an MOA must contain [p]rovisions specifying classes and categories of permit applications, draft permits and proposed permits that the State will send to the [EPA] Regional Administrator for review, comment and, where applicable, objection, §123.24(b)(2); [p]rovisions specifying the frequency and content of reports, documents and other information which the State is required to submit to the EPA, §123.24(b)(3); and [p]rovisions for coordination of compliance monitoring activities by the State and by EPA, §123.24(b)(4)(i).  More generally, the regulation provides that an MOA may include other terms, conditions, or agreements that are relevant to the administration and enforcement of the States regulatory program.  §123.24(a).  Under the MOA regulation, furthermore, EPA will not approve any MOA that restricts its statutory oversight responsibility.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Like the §7(a)(2) consultation process described above, MOAs provide a potential mechanism for giving effect to §7 of the ESA while also allowing the transfer of permitting authority to a State.  It is important to remember that EPA must approve an MOA <em>prior to</em> the transfer of NPDES authority.  As such, EPA can useand in fact has usedthe MOA process to structure its later oversight in a way that will allow it to protect endangered species in accordance with §7(a)(2) of the ESA.  EPA might negotiate a provision in the MOA that would require a State to abide by the ESA requirements when issuing pollution permits.  See Brief for American Fisheries Society et al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 28. (In the Maine MOA, for example, EPA and the state agreed that state permits would protect ESA-listed species by ensuring compliance with state water quality standards).  Alternatively, EPA could require the state to provide copies of draft permits for discharges in particularly sensitive habitats such as those of ESA-listed species or for discharges that contain a pollutant that threatens ESA-listed wildlife.  <em>Id</em>., at 10.  Or the MOA might be drafted in a way that would allow the agency to object to state permits that would jeopardize any and all endangered species.  See<em> id</em>., at 28 (explaining that the Maine MOA includes a provision allowing EPA to object to any state permit that risks harm to a listed species by threatening water quality).  These are just three of many possibilities.  I need not identify other ways EPA could use the MOA process to comply with the ESA; it is enough to observe that MOAs provide a straightforward way to give the ESA its full effect without restricting §7(a)(2) in the way the Court does.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">IV</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    As discussed above, I believe that the Court incorrectly restricts the reach of §7(a)(2) to discretionary federal actions.  See Part II, <em>supra.</em>  Even if such a limitation were permissible, however, it is clear that EPAs authority to transfer permitting authority under §402(b) <em>is </em>discretionary.<a name="ZD-11ref" href="#ZD-11" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>11</b>

            </a>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The EPA Administrators authority to approve state permit programs pursuant to §402(b) of the CWA does not even fit within the Courts description of the category of mandatory actions that the Court holds are covered by the ESA.  In the Courts words, that category includes actions that an agency is <em>required </em>by statute to undertake once certain specified triggering events have occurred.  <em>Ante</em>, at 22.  The triggering event for EPAs approval is simply the filing of a satisfactory description of the States proposed program.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1342.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §1342(b)</a>.  The statute then commands that the EPA Administrator shall approve the submitted program unless he determines that state law does not satisfy nine specified conditions.  Those conditions are not triggering events; they are potential objections to the exercise of the Administrators authority.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    What is more, §402(b) is a perfect example of why our analysis should not end simply because a statute uses the word shall.  Instead, we must look more closely at its listed criteria to determine whether they allow for discretion, despite the use of shall.  After all, as then-Justice Rehnquists dissenting opinion in the snail darter case explains, a federal statute using the word shall will sometimes allow room for discretion.  See <em>Hill</em>, 437 U. S. at 211212 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).<a name="ZD-12ref" href="#ZD-12" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>12</b>
                </sup>
            </a>  In these cases, there is significant room for discretion in EPAs evaluation of §402(b)s nine conditions.  The first criterion, for example, requires the EPA Administrator to examine five other statutes and ensure that the State has adequate authority to comply with each.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1342.html#b_1_A" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §1342(b)(1)(A)</a>.  One of those five statutes, in turn, expressly directs the Administrator to exercise his judgment.  §1312.  Even the Court acknowledges that EPA must exercise some judgment in determining whether a State has demonstrated that it has the authority to carry out §402(b)s enumerated statutory criteria.  <em>Ante</em>, at 24.  However, in the very same breath, the Court states that the dispositive fact is that the statute clearly does not grant it the discretion to add another entirely separate prerequisite to that list.  <em>Ibid</em>.  This reasoning flouts the Courts own logic.  Under the Courts reading of §402.03, §7(a)(2) applies to discretionary federal actions of any kind.  The Court plainly acknowledges that EPA exercises discretion when deciding whether to transfer permitting authority to a State.  If we are to take the Courts approach seriously, once <em>any</em> discretion has been identifiedas it has here§7(a)(2) must apply.<a name="ZD-13ref" href="#ZD-13" class="">
                <sup>

            </a>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The MOA regulation described in Part IIIB, <em>supra,</em> also demonstrates that an NPDES transfer is not as ministerial a task as the Court would suggest.  The agency retains significant discretion under §123.24 over the content of an MOA, which of course must be approved prior to a transfer. For instance, EPA may require a State to file reports on a weekly basis or a monthly basis.  It may require a State to submit only certain classes and categories of permit applications.  And it may include any additional terms and conditions that are relevant to the enforcement of the NPDES program.  There is ample room for judgment in all of these areas, and EPA has exercised such judgment in the past when approving MOAs from many States.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Approval of Application by Maine to Administer the NPDES Program, 66 Fed. Reg. 12791, (2001); Approval of Application by Maine to Administer the NPDES Program; Texas, 
63Fed. Reg.
51165 (1998).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In fact, in an earlier case raising a question similar to this one, see <em>American Forest &amp; Paper Assn.</em> v. <em>EPA</em>, 137 F. 3d 291, 298299 (CA5 1998), EPA itself explained how 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/40/123" class="subref" title="subref">40 CFR §123.24</a> gives it discretion over the approval of a State pollution control program, see Brief for EPA in No. 9660874 (CA5).  Arguing that [i]ndicia of discretionary involvement or control abound in [its] regulations, the agency listed its MOA regulation as a prime example.<a name="ZD-14ref" href="#ZD-14" class="">

            </a>  Again, because EPAs approval of a State application to administer an NPDES program entails significantindeed, aboundingdiscretion, I would find that §7(a)(2) of the ESA applies even under the Courts own flawed theory of these cases.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    Mindful that judges must always remain faithful to the intent of the legislature, Chief Justice Burger closed his opinion in the snail darter case with a reminder that [o]nce the meaning of an enactment is discerned and its constitutionality determined, the judicial process comes to an end.  <em>Hill</em>, 437 U. S., at 194.  This Court offered a definitive interpretation of the Endangered Species Act nearly 30 years ago in that very case.  Today the Court turns its back on our decision in <em>Hill</em> and places a great number of endangered species in jeopardy, including the cactus ferruginous pygmy-owl and Pima pineapple cactus at issue here.  At the risk of plagiarizing Chief Justice Burgers fine opinion, I think it is appropriate to end my opinion just as he didwith a quotation attributed to Sir Thomas More that has as much relevance today as it did three decades ago.  This quotation illustrates not only the fundamental character of the rule of law embodied in §7 of the ESA but also the pernicious consequences of official disobedience of such a rule.

        <p class="bodytext">    Although its reasons have shifted over time, at both the administrative level and in the federal courts, EPA has insisted that the requirements of §7(a)(2) of the ESA do not apply to its decision to transfer permitting authority under §402(b) of the CWA.  See App. 114; Brief for Petitioner EPA 16, 42.  As I have explained above, that conclusion is contrary to the text of §7(a)(2), our decision in the <em>TVA</em> v. <em>Hill</em>, and the regulation on which the agency has since relied and upon which the Court relies on today.  Accordingly, I would hold that EPAs decision was arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act, see

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-2" href="#ZD-2ref">2</a> The Court misreads this sentence and, in so doing, overreads our decision in Hill.  Justice Alito maintains that Hill held that the acts appropriating funds to the TVA … did not require the agency to use any of the generally appropriated funds to complete the Tellico Dam project.  Ante, at 2324, n. 9.  But Hill said no such thing.  That case only held that the subsequent appropriation of funds for the Tellico Dam Project could not overcome the mandatory requirements of §7 of the ESA; it did not hold that the TVA would not have been required to spend any and all appropriated funds if the ESA had never been passed.  See Hill, 437 U. S., at 189190.  If the ESA had never been enacted and did not stand in the way of the completion of the Tellico Dam, there is no doubt that the TVA would have finished the project that Congress had funded.

Hill, O.T. 1977, No. 761701, p. 26.  Instead, the TVA sought to restrict §7 to only those actions for which the agency has reasonable decision-making alternatives before it.  Ibid.  We rejected that narrow interpretation, stating that the only way to sustain the TVAs position would be to ignore the ordinary meaning of plain language.  Hill, 437 U. S., at 173.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.02</a>.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/541/752" class="subref" title="subref">541 U. S. 752</a> (2004)
,that an agency cannot be considered the legal cause of an action that it has no statutory discretion not to takesupports its reliance on §402.03.  Ante, at 20.  First of all, the Court itself recognizes that it must distance itself from that case, ibid., because Public Citizen dealt with a procedural requirement under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), not a substantive requirement like that imposed by §7(a)(2) of the ESA, see TVA v. Hill, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/437/158" class="subref" title="subref">437 U. S. 158</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">188</a>, n. 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">34</a> (1978)
 (holding that NEPA cases are completely inapposite to the ESA context).  What the Court does not recognize, however, is that what it views as the basic principle of Public Citizen is stated too broadly and therefore inapplicable to this case.  Ante, at 20.


Our decision in Public Citizen turned on what we called a critical feature of the case: that the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) had no ability to countermand the Presidents lifting a moratorium that prohibited certain motor carriers from obtaining authority to operate within the United States.  541 U. S., at 766.  Once the President decided to lift that moratorium, and once the relevant vehicles had entered the United States, FMCSA was required by statute to register the vehicles if certain conditions were met.  Ibid. (Under FMCSAs entirely reasonable reading of this provision, it must certify any motor carrier that can show that it is willing and able to comply with the various substantive requirements for safety and financial responsibility contained in DOT regulations; only the moratorium prevented it from doing so for Mexican motor carriers before 2001 (emphasis deleted)).  Therefore, any potential NEPA concerns were generated by another decisionmaker, the President, and not the FMCSA.  Here, by contrast, EPA is not required to act ministerially once another person or agency has made a decision.  Instead, EPA must exercise its own judgment when considering the transfer of NPDES authority to a State; it also has its own authority to deny such a transfer.  Any effect on endangered species will be caused, even if indirectly, by the agencys own decision to transfer NPDES authority.  Cf. 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.02</a> (providing that the ESA will apply to all agency activities that directly or indirectly caus[e] modifications to the land, water, or air (emphasis added)).

        <p class="bodytext">    These cases present a problem of conflicting shalls.  On the one hand, §402(b) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) provides that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) shall approve a States application to administer a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permitting program unless it determines that nine criteria are not satisfied.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1342.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §1342(b)</a>.  On the other hand, shortly after the passage of the CWA, Congress enacted §7(a)(2) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA), which commands that federal agencies shall insure that their actions do not jeopardize endangered species.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#a_2" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(a)(2)</a>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    When faced with competing statutory mandates, it is our duty to give full effect to both if at all possible.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Morton</em> v. <em>Mancari</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/417/535" class="subref" title="subref">417 U. S. 535</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">551</a> (1974)
 ([W]hen two statutes are capable of co-existence, it is the duty of the courts, absent a clearly expressed congressional intention to the contrary, to regard each as effective).  The Court fails at this task.  Its opinion unsuccessfully tries to reconcile the CWA and ESA by relying on a federal regulation, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a> (2006), which it reads as limiting the reach of §7(a)(2) to <em>only</em> discretionary federal actions, see <em>ante</em>, at 1719.  Not only is this reading inconsistent with the text and history of §402.03, but it is fundamentally inconsistent with the ESA itself.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In the celebrated snail darter case, <em>TVA</em> v. <em>Hill</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/437/153" class="subref" title="subref">437 U. S. 153</a> (1978)
, we held that the ESA reveals a conscious decision by Congress to give endangered species priority over the primary missions of federal agencies, <em>id</em>., at 185.  Consistent with that intent, Chief Justice Burgers exceptionally thorough and admirable opinion explained that §7 admits of<em></em>no exception.<em>  Id</em>., at 173.  Creating precisely such an exception by exempting nondiscretionary federal actions from the ESAs coverage, the Court whittles away at Congress comprehensive effort to protect endangered species from the risk of extinction and fails to give the Act its intended effect.  After first giving <em>Hill</em> the attention it deserves, I will comment further on the irrelevance of §402.03 to these cases and offer other available ways to give effect to both CWA and the ESA.  Having done so, I conclude by explaining why these cases should be remanded to the EPA for further proceedings.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">I</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In <em>Hill, </em>we were presented with two separate questions: (1) whether the ESA required a court to enjoin the operation of the nearly completed Tellico Dam and Reservoir Project because the Secretary of the Interior had determined that its operation would eradicate a small endangered fish known as a snail darter; and (2) whether post-1973 congressional appropriations for the completion of the Tellico Dam constituted an implied repeal of the ESA, at least insofar as it applied to the Dam.  437 U. S., at 156.  More than 30 pages of our opinion explain our affirmative answer to the first question, see <em>id.,</em> at 156188, but just over four pages sufficed to explain our negative answer to the second, see <em>id</em>., at 189193.  While it is our ruling on the first question that is relevant to the cases before us, it is our refusal to hold that the ESA itself had been impliedly repealed that the majority strangely deems most significant.  See <em>ante, </em>at 2122.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In answering <em>Hill</em>s first question,<em></em>we did not discuss implied repeals.  On the contrary, that portion of the opinion contained our definitive interpretation of the ESA, in which we concluded that the language, history, and structure of the [ESA] indicates beyond doubt that Congress intended endangered species to be afforded the highest of priorities.  437 U. S., at 174; see also <em>id</em>., at 177 ( The dominant theme pervading all Congressional discussion of the proposed [ESA] was the overriding need <em>to devote whatever effort and resources were necessary</em> to avoid further diminution of national and worldwide wildlife resources  (quoting Coggins, Conserving Wildlife Resources: An Overview of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, 
51N. D. L. Rev.
315,
321 (1975) (emphasis added in <em>Hill</em>))).  With respect to §7 in particular, our opinion could not have been any clearer.  We plainly held that it admits of<em> no exception</em>.  437 U. S., at 173 (emphasis added).<a name="ZD-1ref" href="#ZD-1" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    Our opinion in <em>Hill </em>explained at length why §7 imposed obligations on all federal agencies to ensure that actions authorized, funded, or carried out by them do not jeopardize the continued existence of endangered species.  437 U.

Not a word in the opinion stated or suggested that §7 obligations are inapplicable to mandatory agency actions that would threaten the eradication of an endangered species.  Nor did the opinion describe the Tennessee Valley Authoritys (TVA) attempted completion of the Tellico Dam as a discretionary act.  How could it?  After all, if the Secretary of the Interior had not declared the snail darter an endangered species whose critical habitat would be destroyed by operation of the Tellico Dam, the TVA surely would have been obligated to spend the additional funds that Congress appropriated to complete the project.<a name="ZD-2ref" href="#ZD-2" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    The fact that we also concluded that the post-1973 congressional appropriations did not impliedly repeal the ESA provides no support for the majoritys contention that the obligations imposed by §7(a)(2) may be limited to discretionary acts.  A few passages from the relevant parts of <em>Hill</em> belie that suggestion.  After noting the oddity of holding that the interest in protecting the survival of a relatively small number of 3-inch fish would require the permanent halting of a virtually completed dam for which Congress has expended more than $100 million, we found that the explicit provisions of the Endangered Species Act require precisely that result.  <em>Id.,</em> at 172, 173.  We then continued:</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> One would be hard pressed to find a statutory provision whose terms were any plainer than those in §7 of the Endangered Species Act.  Its very words affirmatively command all federal agencies to <em>insure </em>that actions <em>authorized, funded,</em> or <em>carried out </em>by them do not <em>jeopardize </em>the continued existence of an endangered species or <em>result </em>in the destruction or modification of habitat of such species … .   <em>Id</em>., at 173 (quoting 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536</a> (1976 ed.) (emphasis added in <em>Hill</em>)).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
We also reviewed the ESAs history to identify a variety of exceptions that had been included in earlier legislation and unenacted proposals but were omitted from the final version of the 1973 statute.  We explained that earlier endangered species legislation qualified the obligation of federal agencies, but the 1973 Act purposefully omitted all phrases which might have qualified an agencys responsibilities.  437 U. S., at 181, 182.  Moreover, after observing that the ESA creates only a limited number of hardship exemptions, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1539.html" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1539</a>none of which would apply to federal agencieswe applied the maxim <em>expressio unius est expression alterius</em> to conclude that there are no exemptions in the Endangered Species Act for federal agencies,437 U. S., at 188.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Today, however, the Court countenances such an exemption.  It erroneously concludes that the ESA contains an unmentioned exception for nondiscretionary agency action and that the statutes command to enjoin the completion of the Tellico Dam depended on the unmentioned fact that the TVA was attempting to perform a discretionary act.  But both the text of the ESA and our opinion in <em>Hill</em> compel the contrary determination that Congress intended the ESA to apply to all federal agencies and to all actions authorized, funded, or carried out by them.  <em>Id.,</em> at 173 (emphasis deleted).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    A transfer of NPDES permitting authority under §402(b) of the CWA is undoubtedly one of those actions that is authorized or carried out by a federal agency.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(b)</a>; 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.02</a> (defining action as all activities or programs of any kind authorized, funded, or carried out, in whole or in part, by Federal agencies in the United States or upon the high seas.  Examples include, but are not limited to . . . actions directly or indirectly causing modifications to the land, water, or air).  It follows from <em>Hill </em>that §7(a)(2) applies to such NPDES transferswhether they are mandatory or discretionary.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">II</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Given our unequivocal holding in <em>Hill</em> that the ESA has first priority over all other federal action, 437 U. S., at 185, if any statute should yield, it should be the CWA.  But no statute must yield unless it is truly incapable of coexistence.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Morton</em>, 417 U. S., at 551.  Therefore, assuming that §402(b) of the CWA contains its own mandatory command, we should first try to harmonize that provision with the mandatory requirements of §7(a)(2) of the ESA.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Courts solution is to rely on 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a>, which states that Section 7 and the requirements of this part apply to all actions in which there is discretionary Federal involvement or control.  The Court explains that this regulation harmonizes the statutes by giving effect to the ESAs no-jeopardy mandate whenever an agency has discretion to do so, but by lifting that mandate when the agency is forbidden from considering such extrastatutory factors.  <em>Ante</em>, at 17.  This is not harmony, and it certainly isnt effect.  Rather than giving genuine effect to §7(a)(2), the Court permits a wholesale limitation on the reach of the ESA.  Its interpretation of §402.03 conflicts with the text and history of the regulation, as well as our interpretation of §7 in the snail darter case.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    To begin with, the plain language of §402.03 does not state that its coverage is limited to discretionary actions.  Quite the opposite, the most natural reading of the text is that it confirms the broad construction of §7 endorsed by our opinion in <em>Hill</em>.  Indeed, the only way to read §402.03 in accordance with the facts of the case and our holding that §7 admits of no exception[s], 437 U. S., at 173, is that it eliminates any possible argument that the ESA does not extend to situations in which the discretionary federal involvement is only marginal.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court is simply mistaken when it says that it reads §402.03 to mean what it says: that §7(a)(2)s no-jeopardy duty covers <em>only</em> discretionary agency actions … .  <em>Ante,</em> at 21 (emphasis added).  That is not, in fact, what §402.03 says.  The word only is the Courts addition to the text, not the agencys.  Moreover, that text surely does not go on to say (as the Court does) that the duty does not attach to actions (like the NPDES permitting transfer authorization) that an agency is <em>required</em> by statute to undertake once certain specified triggering events have occurred. <em>Ibid.</em>  If the drafters of the regulation had intended such a far-reaching change in the law, surely they would have said so by using language similar to that which the Court uses today.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Nothing in the proceedings that led to the promulgation of the regulation suggests any reason for limiting the pre-existing understanding of the scope of §7s coverage.  EPA codified the current version of §402.03 in 1986 as part of a general redrafting of ESA regulations.  In the 1983 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the proposed version of §402.03 stated that §7 and the requirements of this Part apply to all actions in which there is Federal involvement or control.  
48Fed. Reg.
29999 (1983).  Without any explanation, the final rule inserted the word discretionary before Federal involvement or control.

            </a>  Clearly, if the Secretary of the Interior meant to limit the pre-existing understanding of the scope of the coverage of §7(a)(2) by promulgating this regulation, that intent would have been mentioned somewhere in the text of the regulations or in contemporaneous comment about them.

 (We have frequently reiterated that an agency must cogently explain why it has exercised its discretion in a given manner).  Yet, the final rule said nothing about limiting the reach of §7 or our decision in <em>Hill.  </em>Nor did it mention the change from the notice of proposed rulemaking.  I can only assume, then, that the regulation does mean what both it and the notice of proposed rulemaking says: Section 7(a)(2) applies to discretionary federal action, but not <em>only</em> to discretionary action.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The only explanation the agency provided for §402.03 was the following:</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> This section, which explains the applicability of section 7, implicitly covers Federal activities within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States and upon the high seas as a result of the definition of action in §402.02.  The explanation for the scope of the term action is provided in the discussion under §402.01 above.  51 Fed. Reg. 19937.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
This statement directs us to two sources: the definition of action in §402.02 and the explanation for the scope of the term action  in §402.01.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Both confirm that there was no intent to draw a distinction between discretionary and nondiscretionary actions.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Section 402.02 provides in relevant part:</p>
        <p class="bodytext"><em>Action </em>means <em>all</em> activities or programs <em>of any kind</em> authorized, funded, or carried out, in whole or in part, by Federal agencies in the United States or upon the high seas.  Examples include, but are not limited to:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    (a)actions intended to conserve listed species or their habitat;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    (b)the promulgation of regulations . . .   (second and third emphases added.)</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
Actions in either of the described sub-categories are sometimes mandatory and sometimes discretionary.  Likewise, as the italicized portions indicate, the term action expressly refers to all agency activities or programs of any kind, regardless of whether they are discretionary or mandatory.  By reading the term discretionary as a limitation on action, the Court creates a contradiction in the EPAs own regulation.<a name="ZD-5ref" href="#ZD-5" class="">
                <sup>

            </a>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    As for the final rules explanation for the scope of the term action in §402.01, that too is fully consistent with my interpretation of §402.03.  That explanation plainly states that <em>all</em> Federal actions including conservations programs are subject to the consultation requirements of section 7(a)(2) if they may affect listed species or their critical habitats.  51 Fed. Reg. 19929 (emphasis added).  The regulation does not say all discretionary federal actions, nor does it evince an intent to limit the scope of §7(a)(2) in any way.  Rather, it just restates that the ESA applies to all federal actions, just as the notice of proposed rulemaking did.  This explanation of the scope of the word action is therefore a strong indication that the Courts reading of discretionary is contrary to its intended meaning.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    An even stronger indication is the fact that at no point in the administrative proceedings in these cases did EPA even mention<em></em>it.<a name="ZD-6ref" href="#ZD-6" class="">

            </a>  As an initial matter, it is worth emphasizing that even if EPA had relied on §402.03, its interpretation of the ESA would not be entitled to deference under <em>Chevron U. S. A. Inc.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/467/837" class="subref" title="subref">467 U. S. 837</a> (1984)
, because it is not charged with administering that statute, <em>id</em>., at 844 (We have long recognized that considerable weight should be accorded to an executive departments construction of a statutory scheme <em>it is entrusted to administer</em>. (emphasis added)); <em>Department of Treasury</em> v. <em>FLRA</em>, 837 F. 2d 1163, 1167 (CADC 1988) ([W]hen an agency interprets a statute other than that which it has been entrusted to administer, its interpretation is not entitled to deference).  The Departments of the Interior and Commerce, not EPA, are charged with administering the ESA.  See <em>Babbitt </em>v. <em>Sweet Home Chapter, Communities for Great Ore.,</em> 515 U. S., 687, 703704 (1995).  And EPA has conceded that the Department of the Interiors biological opinion did not discuss 50 CFR. 402.03, and it did not address the question whether the consultation that produced the [biological opinion] was required by the ESA.  Pet. for Cert. in No. 06549, p. 24; see App. 77124 (never mentioning §402.03).  Left with this unfavorable administrative record, EPA can only lean on the fact that the Department of the Interior has recently clarified its position regarding §402.03 in a <em>different</em> administrative proceeding.  See Pet. for Cert. in No. 06549, pp. 2425; <em>id</em>., at 26 (The recent F[ish and Wildlife Service] and N[ational Marine Fisheries Service] communications regarding Alaskas pending transfer application reflect those agencies considered interpretations . . . of [50 CFR] 402.03); App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06340, pp. 103a116a; see also <em>ante</em>, at 12 n. 5.  We have long held, however, that courts may not affirm an agency action on grounds other than those adopted by the agency in the administrative proceedings.  See <em>SEC</em> v. <em>Chenery Corp.</em>,

.  The majority ignores this hoary principle of administrative law and substitutes a post-hoc interpretation of §7(a)(2) and §402.03 for that of the relevant agency.  For that reason alone, these cases should be remanded to the agency.  And for the other reasons I have given, §402.03 cannot be used to harmonize the CWA and the ESA.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">III</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    There are at least two ways in which the CWA and the ESA can be given full effect without privileging one statute over the other.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">A</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The text of §7(a)(2) itself provides the first possible way of reconciling that provision with §402(b) of the CWA.   The subsection reads:</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> Each Federal agency shall, <em>in consultation with and with the assistance of the Secretary</em>, insure that any action authorized, funded, or carried out by such agency (hereinafter in this section referred to as an agency action) is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of habitat of such species which is determined by the Secretary, after consultation as appropriate with affected States, to be critical, unless such agency has been granted an exemption for such action by the Committee pursuant to subsection (h) of this section.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#a_2" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(a)(2)</a> (emphasis added).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court is certainly correct that the use of the word shall in §7(a)(2) imposes a mandatory requirement on the federal agencies.  See <em>ante</em>, at 14.  It is also correct that the ESAs mandate is to be carried out through consultation and may require the agency to adopt an alternative course of action.  <em>Ante,</em> at 15.  The Court is too quick to conclude, however, that this consultation requirement creates an irreconcilable conflict between this provision and §402(b) of the CWA.  It rushes to this flawed judgment because of a basic conceptual erroran error that is revealed as early as the first paragraph of its opinion.  Rather than attempting to find a way to give effect to §7(a)(2)s consultation requirement, the Court frames the question presented as whether §7(a)(2) effectively operates as a tenth criterion on which the transfer of permitting power under the first statute must be conditioned.   <em>Ante</em>, at 12.  The Court is not alone in this.  The author of the Ninth Circuit opinion below also stated that the ESA <em>adds</em> one requirement to the list of considerations under the Clean Water Act permitting transfer provision.  450 F. 3d, at 404 n. 2 (2006) (Berzon, J., concurring in denial of rehearing en banc) (emphasis in original).  But while the ESA does mandate that the relevant agencies consul[t] with the Interior Department, that consultation process also provides a way for the agencies to give effect to both statutes.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The first step in the statutory consultation process is to identify whether any endangered species will be affected by an agency action.  An agency proposing a particular action, such as an NPDES transfer, will typically ask the Secretary of the Interior whether any listed species may be present in the area of the proposed action and whether that action will affect those species.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#c" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(c)</a>.  It is entirely possible that no listed species will be affected, and any anticipated conflict between the ESA and another statute will have been avoided at this threshold stage.  If, however, the Secretary determines that a proposed action may affect an endangered species or its critical habitat, the agency must formally consult with the Secretary.  This consultation culminates in the issuance of a biological opinion, which detail[s] how the agency action affects the species or its critical habitat.  §1536(b)(3)(A); see also 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.14</a>(h).  Even at this stage, it is still possible that formal consultation will reveal that the agency action will not jeopardize any species.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 
63Fed. Reg.
51199 (1998) (noting that FWS rendered a no jeopardy finding with respect to the transfer of permitting authority to Texas).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    If the biological opinion concludes that the agency action would put a listed species in jeopardy, however, the ESA contains a process for resolving the competing demands of agency action and species protection.  The ESA provides that the Secretary shall suggest those reasonable and prudent alternatives which he believes would not violate subsection (a)(2) and can be taken by the Federal agency or applicant in implementing the agency action.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#b_3_A" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(b)(3)(A)</a>; see also 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.14</a>(h)(3).  The agencys regulations define [r]easonable and prudent alternatives as</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> alternative actions identified during formal consultation that can be implemented in a manner consistent with the intended purpose of the action, that can be implemented consistent with the scope of the Federal agencys legal authority and jurisdiction, that is economically and technologically feasible, and that the Director [of FWS] believes would avoid the likelihood of jeopardizing the continued existence of listed species or resulting in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat.   
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.02</a>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
Thus, in the face of any conflict between the ESA and another federal statute, the ESA and its implementing regulations encourage federal agencies to work out a reasonable alternative that would let the proposed action move forward consistent with [its] intended purpose and the agencys legal authority, while also avoiding any violation of  §7(a)(2).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    When applied to the NPDES transfer program, the reasonable and prudent alternatives process would enable EPA and the Department of the Interior to develop a substitute that would allow a transfer of permitting authority <em>and</em> would not jeopardize endangered species.  Stated differently, the consultation process would generate an alternative course of action whereby the transfer could still take placeas required by §402(b) of the CWAbut in such a way that would honor the mandatory requirements of §7(a)(2) of the ESA.  This should come as no surprise to EPA, as it has engaged in pre-transfer consultations at least six times in the past and has stated that it is not barred from doing so by the CWA.<a name="ZD-7ref" href="#ZD-7" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    Finally, for the rare case in which no reasonable and prudent alternative can be found, Congress has provided yet another mechanism for resolving any conflicts between the ESA and a proposed agency action.  In 1978, shortly after our decision in <em>Hill</em>, Congress amended the ESA to create the Endangered Species Committee, which it authorized to grant exemptions from §7(a)(2).  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#e" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(e)</a>.  Because it has the authority to approve the extinction of an endangered species, the Endangered Species Committee is colloquially described as the God Squad or God Committee.  In light of this weighty responsibility, Congress carefully laid out requirements for the God Committees membership,<a name="ZD-8ref" href="#ZD-8" class="">

        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    As the final arbiter in situations in which the ESA conflicts with a proposed agency action, the God Committee embodies the primacy of the ESAs mandate and serves as the final mechanism for harmonizing that Act with other federal statutes.  By creating this Committee, Congress recognized that some conflicts with the ESA may not be capable of resolution without having to forever sacrifice some endangered species.  At the same time, the creation of this last line of defense reflects Congress view that the ESA should not yield to another federal action except as a final resort and except when authorized by high level officials after serious consideration.  In short, when all else has failed and two federal statutes are incapable of resolution, Congress left the choice to the Committeenot to this Court; it did not limit the ESA in the way the majority does today.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">B</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    EPAs regulations offer a second way to harmonize the CWA with the ESA.  After EPA has transferred NPDES permitting authority to a State, the agency continues to oversee the States permitting program.  See <em>Arkansas</em> v. <em>Oklahoma</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">The regulation governing MOAs contains several detailed requirements.  For instance, the regulation states that an MOA must contain [p]rovisions specifying classes and categories of permit applications, draft permits and proposed permits that the State will send to the [EPA] Regional Administrator for review, comment and, where applicable, objection, §123.24(b)(2); [p]rovisions specifying the frequency and content of reports, documents and other information which the State is required to submit to the EPA, §123.24(b)(3); and [p]rovisions for coordination of compliance monitoring activities by the State and by EPA, §123.24(b)(4)(i).  More generally, the regulation provides that an MOA may include other terms, conditions, or agreements that are relevant to the administration and enforcement of the States regulatory program.  §123.24(a).  Under the MOA regulation, furthermore, EPA will not approve any MOA that restricts its statutory oversight responsibility.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Like the §7(a)(2) consultation process described above, MOAs provide a potential mechanism for giving effect to §7 of the ESA while also allowing the transfer of permitting authority to a State.  It is important to remember that EPA must approve an MOA <em>prior to</em> the transfer of NPDES authority.  As such, EPA can useand in fact has usedthe MOA process to structure its later oversight in a way that will allow it to protect endangered species in accordance with §7(a)(2) of the ESA.  EPA might negotiate a provision in the MOA that would require a State to abide by the ESA requirements when issuing pollution permits.  See Brief for American Fisheries Society et al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 28. (In the Maine MOA, for example, EPA and the state agreed that state permits would protect ESA-listed species by ensuring compliance with state water quality standards).  Alternatively, EPA could require the state to provide copies of draft permits for discharges in particularly sensitive habitats such as those of ESA-listed species or for discharges that contain a pollutant that threatens ESA-listed wildlife.  <em>Id</em>., at 10.  Or the MOA might be drafted in a way that would allow the agency to object to state permits that would jeopardize any and all endangered species.  See<em> id</em>., at 28 (explaining that the Maine MOA includes a provision allowing EPA to object to any state permit that risks harm to a listed species by threatening water quality).  These are just three of many possibilities.  I need not identify other ways EPA could use the MOA process to comply with the ESA; it is enough to observe that MOAs provide a straightforward way to give the ESA its full effect without restricting §7(a)(2) in the way the Court does.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">IV</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    As discussed above, I believe that the Court incorrectly restricts the reach of §7(a)(2) to discretionary federal actions.  See Part II, <em>supra.</em>  Even if such a limitation were permissible, however, it is clear that EPAs authority to transfer permitting authority under §402(b) <em>is </em>discretionary.<a name="ZD-11ref" href="#ZD-11" class="">

            </a>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The EPA Administrators authority to approve state permit programs pursuant to §402(b) of the CWA does not even fit within the Courts description of the category of mandatory actions that the Court holds are covered by the ESA.  In the Courts words, that category includes actions that an agency is <em>required </em>by statute to undertake once certain specified triggering events have occurred.  <em>Ante</em>, at 22.  The triggering event for EPAs approval is simply the filing of a satisfactory description of the States proposed program.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1342.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §1342(b)</a>.  The statute then commands that the EPA Administrator shall approve the submitted program unless he determines that state law does not satisfy nine specified conditions.  Those conditions are not triggering events; they are potential objections to the exercise of the Administrators authority.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    What is more, §402(b) is a perfect example of why our analysis should not end simply because a statute uses the word shall.  Instead, we must look more closely at its listed criteria to determine whether they allow for discretion, despite the use of shall.  After all, as then-Justice Rehnquists dissenting opinion in the snail darter case explains, a federal statute using the word shall will sometimes allow room for discretion.  See <em>Hill</em>, 437 U. S. at 211212 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).<a name="ZD-12ref" href="#ZD-12" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>12</b>
                </sup>
            </a>  In these cases, there is significant room for discretion in EPAs evaluation of §402(b)s nine conditions.  The first criterion, for example, requires the EPA Administrator to examine five other statutes and ensure that the State has adequate authority to comply with each.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1342.html#b_1_A" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §1342(b)(1)(A)</a>.  One of those five statutes, in turn, expressly directs the Administrator to exercise his judgment.  §1312.  Even the Court acknowledges that EPA must exercise some judgment in determining whether a State has demonstrated that it has the authority to carry out §402(b)s enumerated statutory criteria.  <em>Ante</em>, at 24.  However, in the very same breath, the Court states that the dispositive fact is that the statute clearly does not grant it the discretion to add another entirely separate prerequisite to that list.  <em>Ibid</em>.  This reasoning flouts the Courts own logic.  Under the Courts reading of §402.03, §7(a)(2) applies to discretionary federal actions of any kind.  The Court plainly acknowledges that EPA exercises discretion when deciding whether to transfer permitting authority to a State.  If we are to take the Courts approach seriously, once <em>any</em> discretion has been identifiedas it has here§7(a)(2) must apply.<a name="ZD-13ref" href="#ZD-13" class="">

            </a>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The MOA regulation described in Part IIIB, <em>supra,</em> also demonstrates that an NPDES transfer is not as ministerial a task as the Court would suggest.  The agency retains significant discretion under §123.24 over the content of an MOA, which of course must be approved prior to a transfer. For instance, EPA may require a State to file reports on a weekly basis or a monthly basis.  It may require a State to submit only certain classes and categories of permit applications.  And it may include any additional terms and conditions that are relevant to the enforcement of the NPDES program.  There is ample room for judgment in all of these areas, and EPA has exercised such judgment in the past when approving MOAs from many States.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Approval of Application by Maine to Administer the NPDES Program, 66 Fed. Reg. 12791, (2001); Approval of Application by Maine to Administer the NPDES Program; Texas, 
63Fed. Reg.
51165 (1998).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In fact, in an earlier case raising a question similar to this one, see <em>American Forest &amp; Paper Assn.</em> v. <em>EPA</em>, 137 F. 3d 291, 298299 (CA5 1998), EPA itself explained how 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/40/123" class="subref" title="subref">40 CFR §123.24</a> gives it discretion over the approval of a State pollution control program, see Brief for EPA in No. 9660874 (CA5).  Arguing that [i]ndicia of discretionary involvement or control abound in [its] regulations, the agency listed its MOA regulation as a prime example.<a name="ZD-14ref" href="#ZD-14" class="">

                    <b>14</b>
                </sup>
            </a>  Again, because EPAs approval of a State application to administer an NPDES program entails significantindeed, aboundingdiscretion, I would find that §7(a)(2) of the ESA applies even under the Courts own flawed theory of these cases.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    Mindful that judges must always remain faithful to the intent of the legislature, Chief Justice Burger closed his opinion in the snail darter case with a reminder that [o]nce the meaning of an enactment is discerned and its constitutionality determined, the judicial process comes to an end.  <em>Hill</em>, 437 U. S., at 194.  This Court offered a definitive interpretation of the Endangered Species Act nearly 30 years ago in that very case.  Today the Court turns its back on our decision in <em>Hill</em> and places a great number of endangered species in jeopardy, including the cactus ferruginous pygmy-owl and Pima pineapple cactus at issue here.  At the risk of plagiarizing Chief Justice Burgers fine opinion, I think it is appropriate to end my opinion just as he didwith a quotation attributed to Sir Thomas More that has as much relevance today as it did three decades ago.  This quotation illustrates not only the fundamental character of the rule of law embodied in §7 of the ESA but also the pernicious consequences of official disobedience of such a rule.  Repetition of that literary allusion is especially appropriate today:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">The law, Roper, the law.  I know whats legal, not whats right.  And Ill stick to whats legal. . . . Im <em>not</em> God.  The currents and eddies of right and wrong, which you find such plain-sailing, I cant navigate, Im no voyager.  But in the thickets of the law, oh there Im a forester. . . . What would you do?  Cut a great road through the law to get after the Devil? . . . And when the last law was down, and the Devil turned round on youwhere would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat? . . . This country's planted thick with laws from coast to coastMans laws, not Godsand if you cut them down . . . dyou really think you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then? . . .

        <p class="bodytext">    Although its reasons have shifted over time, at both the administrative level and in the federal courts, EPA has insisted that the requirements of §7(a)(2) of the ESA do not apply to its decision to transfer permitting authority under §402(b) of the CWA.  See App. 114; Brief for Petitioner EPA 16, 42.  As I have explained above, that conclusion is contrary to the text of §7(a)(2), our decision in the <em>TVA</em> v. <em>Hill</em>, and the regulation on which the agency has since relied and upon which the Court relies on today.  Accordingly, I would hold that EPAs decision was arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/5/706.html#2_A" class="subref" title="subref">5 U. S. C. §706(2)(A)</a>, and would remand to the agency for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>

But Hill said no such thing.  That case only held that the subsequent appropriation of funds for the Tellico Dam Project could not overcome the mandatory requirements of §7 of the ESA; it did not hold that the TVA would not have been required to spend any and all appropriated funds if the ESA had never been passed.  See Hill, 437 U. S., at 189190.

First of all, the Court itself recognizes that it must distance itself from that case, ibid., because Public Citizen dealt with a procedural requirement under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), not a substantive requirement like that imposed by §7(a)(2) of the ESA, see TVA v. Hill, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/437/158" class="subref" title="subref">437 U. S. 158</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">188</a>, n. 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">34</a> (1978)
 (holding that NEPA cases are completely inapposite to the ESA context).  What the Court does not recognize, however, is that what it views as the basic principle of Public Citizen is stated too broadly and therefore inapplicable to this case.  Ante, at 20.


Our decision in Public Citizen turned on what we called a critical feature of the case: that the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) had no ability to countermand the Presidents lifting a moratorium that prohibited certain motor carriers from obtaining authority to operate within the United States.  541 U. S., at 766.  Once the President decided to lift that moratorium, and once the relevant vehicles had entered the United States, FMCSA was required by statute to register the vehicles if certain conditions were met.  Ibid. (Under FMCSAs entirely reasonable reading of this provision, it must certify any motor carrier that can show that it is willing and able to comply with the various substantive requirements for safety and financial responsibility contained in DOT regulations; only the moratorium prevented it from doing so for Mexican motor carriers before 2001 (emphasis deleted)).  Therefore, any potential NEPA concerns were generated by another decisionmaker, the President, and not the FMCSA.  Here, by contrast, EPA is not required to act ministerially once another person or agency has made a decision.  Instead, EPA must exercise its own judgment when considering the transfer of NPDES authority to a State; it also has its own authority to deny such a transfer.  Any effect on endangered species will be caused, even if indirectly, by the agencys own decision to transfer NPDES authority.  Cf.

        <p class="bodytext">    These cases present a problem of conflicting shalls.  On the one hand, §402(b) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) provides that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) shall approve a States application to administer a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permitting program unless it determines that nine criteria are not satisfied.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1342.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §1342(b)</a>.  On the other hand, shortly after the passage of the CWA, Congress enacted §7(a)(2) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA), which commands that federal agencies shall insure that their actions do not jeopardize endangered species.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#a_2" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(a)(2)</a>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    When faced with competing statutory mandates, it is our duty to give full effect to both if at all possible.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Morton</em> v. <em>Mancari</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/417/535" class="subref" title="subref">417 U. S. 535</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">551</a> (1974)
 ([W]hen two statutes are capable of co-existence, it is the duty of the courts, absent a clearly expressed congressional intention to the contrary, to regard each as effective).  The Court fails at this task.  Its opinion unsuccessfully tries to reconcile the CWA and ESA by relying on a federal regulation, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a> (2006), which it reads as limiting the reach of §7(a)(2) to <em>only</em> discretionary federal actions, see <em>ante</em>, at 1719.  Not only is this reading inconsistent with the text and history of §402.03, but it is fundamentally inconsistent with the ESA itself.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In the celebrated snail darter case, <em>TVA</em> v. <em>Hill</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/437/153" class="subref" title="subref">437 U. S. 153</a> (1978)
, we held that the ESA reveals a conscious decision by Congress to give endangered species priority over the primary missions of federal agencies, <em>id</em>., at 185.  Consistent with that intent, Chief Justice Burgers exceptionally thorough and admirable opinion explained that §7 admits of<em></em>no exception.<em>  Id</em>., at 173.  Creating precisely such an exception by exempting nondiscretionary federal actions from the ESAs coverage, the Court whittles away at Congress comprehensive effort to protect endangered species from the risk of extinction and fails to give the Act its intended effect.  After first giving <em>Hill</em> the attention it deserves, I will comment further on the irrelevance of §402.03 to these cases and offer other available ways to give effect to both CWA and the ESA.  Having done so, I conclude by explaining why these cases should be remanded to the EPA for further proceedings.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">I</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In <em>Hill, </em>we were presented with two separate questions: (1) whether the ESA required a court to enjoin the operation of the nearly completed Tellico Dam and Reservoir Project because the Secretary of the Interior had determined that its operation would eradicate a small endangered fish known as a snail darter; and (2) whether post-1973 congressional appropriations for the completion of the Tellico Dam constituted an implied repeal of the ESA, at least insofar as it applied to the Dam.  437 U. S., at 156.  More than 30 pages of our opinion explain our affirmative answer to the first question, see <em>id.,</em> at 156188, but just over four pages sufficed to explain our negative answer to the second, see <em>id</em>., at 189193.  While it is our ruling on the first question that is relevant to the cases before us, it is our refusal to hold that the ESA itself had been impliedly repealed that the majority strangely deems most significant.  See <em>ante, </em>at 2122.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In answering <em>Hill</em>s first question,<em></em>we did not discuss implied repeals.  On the contrary, that portion of the opinion contained our definitive interpretation of the ESA, in which we concluded that the language, history, and structure of the [ESA] indicates beyond doubt that Congress intended endangered species to be afforded the highest of priorities.  437 U. S., at 174; see also <em>id</em>., at 177 ( The dominant theme pervading all Congressional discussion of the proposed [ESA] was the overriding need <em>to devote whatever effort and resources were necessary</em> to avoid further diminution of national and worldwide wildlife resources  (quoting Coggins, Conserving Wildlife Resources: An Overview of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, 
51N. D. L. Rev.
315,
321 (1975) (emphasis added in <em>Hill</em>))).  With respect to §7 in particular, our opinion could not have been any clearer.  We plainly held that it admits of<em> no exception</em>.  437 U. S., at 173 (emphasis added).<a name="ZD-1ref" href="#ZD-1" class="">

        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Our opinion in <em>Hill </em>explained at length why §7 imposed obligations on all federal agencies to ensure that actions authorized, funded, or carried out by them do not jeopardize the continued existence of endangered species.  437 U. S., at 173 (emphasis deleted; internal quotation marks omitted).  Not a word in the opinion stated or suggested that §7 obligations are inapplicable to mandatory agency actions that would threaten the eradication of an endangered species.  Nor did the opinion describe the Tennessee Valley Authoritys (TVA) attempted completion of the Tellico Dam as a discretionary act.  How could it?  After all, if the Secretary of the Interior had not declared the snail darter an endangered species whose critical habitat would be destroyed by operation of the Tellico Dam, the TVA surely would have been obligated to spend the additional funds that Congress appropriated to complete the project.<a name="ZD-2ref" href="#ZD-2" class="">

            </a>  Unconcerned with whether an agency action was mandatory or discretionary, we simply held that §7 of the ESA</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> reveals an explicit congressional decision to require agencies to afford <em>first priority</em> to the declared national policy of saving endangered species.  The pointed omission of the type of qualifying language previously included in endangered species legislation reveals a conscious decision by Congress to give endangered species <em>priority over the </em><em>primary missions of federal agencies.</em>   <em>Id</em>., at 185 (emphasis added).<a name="ZD-3ref" href="#ZD-3" class="">

        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The fact that we also concluded that the post-1973 congressional appropriations did not impliedly repeal the ESA provides no support for the majoritys contention that the obligations imposed by §7(a)(2) may be limited to discretionary acts.  A few passages from the relevant parts of <em>Hill</em> belie that suggestion.  After noting the oddity of holding that the interest in protecting the survival of a relatively small number of 3-inch fish would require the permanent halting of a virtually completed dam for which Congress has expended more than $100 million, we found that the explicit provisions of the Endangered Species Act require precisely that result.  <em>Id.,</em> at 172, 173.  We then continued:</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> One would be hard pressed to find a statutory provision whose terms were any plainer than those in §7 of the Endangered Species Act.  Its very words affirmatively command all federal agencies to <em>insure </em>that actions <em>authorized, funded,</em> or <em>carried out </em>by them do not <em>jeopardize </em>the continued existence of an endangered species or <em>result </em>in the destruction or modification of habitat of such species … .   <em>Id</em>., at 173 (quoting 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536</a> (1976 ed.) (emphasis added in <em>Hill</em>)).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
We also reviewed the ESAs history to identify a variety of exceptions that had been included in earlier legislation and unenacted proposals but were omitted from the final version of the 1973 statute.  We explained that earlier endangered species legislation qualified the obligation of federal agencies, but the 1973 Act purposefully omitted all phrases which might have qualified an agencys responsibilities.  437 U. S., at 181, 182.  Moreover, after observing that the ESA creates only a limited number of hardship exemptions, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1539.html" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1539</a>none of which would apply to federal agencieswe applied the maxim <em>expressio unius est expression alterius</em> to conclude that there are no exemptions in the Endangered Species Act for federal agencies,437 U. S., at 188.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Today, however, the Court countenances such an exemption.  It erroneously concludes that the ESA contains an unmentioned exception for nondiscretionary agency action and that the statutes command to enjoin the completion of the Tellico Dam depended on the unmentioned fact that the TVA was attempting to perform a discretionary act.  But both the text of the ESA and our opinion in <em>Hill</em> compel the contrary determination that Congress intended the ESA to apply to all federal agencies and to all actions authorized, funded, or carried out by them.  <em>Id.,</em> at 173 (emphasis deleted).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    A transfer of NPDES permitting authority under §402(b) of the CWA is undoubtedly one of those actions that is authorized or carried out by a federal agency.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(b)</a>; 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.02</a> (defining action as all activities or programs of any kind authorized, funded, or carried out, in whole or in part, by Federal agencies in the United States or upon the high seas.  Examples include, but are not limited to . . . actions directly or indirectly causing modifications to the land, water, or air).  It follows from <em>Hill </em>that §7(a)(2) applies to such NPDES transferswhether they are mandatory or discretionary.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">II</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Given our unequivocal holding in <em>Hill</em> that the ESA has first priority over all other federal action, 437 U. S., at 185, if any statute should yield, it should be the CWA.  But no statute must yield unless it is truly incapable of coexistence.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Morton</em>, 417 U. S., at 551.  Therefore, assuming that §402(b) of the CWA contains its own mandatory command, we should first try to harmonize that provision with the mandatory requirements of §7(a)(2) of the ESA.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Courts solution is to rely on 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a>, which states that Section 7 and the requirements of this part apply to all actions in which there is discretionary Federal involvement or control.  The Court explains that this regulation harmonizes the statutes by giving effect to the ESAs no-jeopardy mandate whenever an agency has discretion to do so, but by lifting that mandate when the agency is forbidden from considering such extrastatutory factors.  <em>Ante</em>, at 17.  This is not harmony, and it certainly isnt effect.  Rather than giving genuine effect to §7(a)(2), the Court permits a wholesale limitation on the reach of the ESA.  Its interpretation of §402.03 conflicts with the text and history of the regulation, as well as our interpretation of §7 in the snail darter case.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    To begin with, the plain language of §402.03 does not state that its coverage is limited to discretionary actions.  Quite the opposite, the most natural reading of the text is that it confirms the broad construction of §7 endorsed by our opinion in <em>Hill</em>.  Indeed, the only way to read §402.03 in accordance with the facts of the case and our holding that §7 admits of no exception[s], 437 U. S., at 173, is that it eliminates any possible argument that the ESA does not extend to situations in which the discretionary federal involvement is only marginal.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court is simply mistaken when it says that it reads §402.03 to mean what it says: that §7(a)(2)s no-jeopardy duty covers <em>only</em> discretionary agency actions … .  <em>Ante,</em> at 21 (emphasis added).  That is not, in fact, what §402.03 says.  The word only is the Courts addition to the text, not the agencys.  Moreover, that text surely does not go on to say (as the Court does) that the duty does not attach to actions (like the NPDES permitting transfer authorization) that an agency is <em>required</em> by statute to undertake once certain specified triggering events have occurred. <em>Ibid.</em>  If the drafters of the regulation had intended such a far-reaching change in the law, surely they would have said so by using language similar to that which the Court uses today.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Nothing in the proceedings that led to the promulgation of the regulation suggests any reason for limiting the pre-existing understanding of the scope of §7s coverage.  EPA codified the current version of §402.03 in 1986 as part of a general redrafting of ESA regulations.  In the 1983 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the proposed version of §402.03 stated that §7 and the requirements of this Part apply to all actions in which there is Federal involvement or control.  
48Fed. Reg.
29999 (1983).  Without any explanation, the final rule inserted the word discretionary before Federal involvement or control.  
51Fed. Reg.
19958 (1986).<a name="ZD-4ref" href="#ZD-4" class="">

                </sup>
            </a>  Clearly, if the Secretary of the Interior meant to limit the pre-existing understanding of the scope of the coverage of §7(a)(2) by promulgating this regulation, that intent would have been mentioned somewhere in the text of the regulations or in contemporaneous comment about them.  See <em>National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assn.</em> v. <em>Brand X Internet Services</em>,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">48</a> (1983)
 (We have frequently reiterated that an agency must cogently explain why it has exercised its discretion in a given manner).  Yet, the final rule said nothing about limiting the reach of §7 or our decision in <em>Hill.  </em>Nor did it mention the change from the notice of proposed rulemaking.  I can only assume, then, that the regulation does mean what both it and the notice of proposed rulemaking says: Section 7(a)(2) applies to discretionary federal action, but not <em>only</em> to discretionary action.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The only explanation the agency provided for §402.03 was the following:</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> This section, which explains the applicability of section 7, implicitly covers Federal activities within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States and upon the high seas as a result of the definition of action in §402.02.  The explanation for the scope of the term action is provided in the discussion under §402.01 above.  51 Fed. Reg. 19937.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
This statement directs us to two sources: the definition of action in §402.02 and the explanation for the scope of the term action  in §402.01.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Both confirm that there was no intent to draw a distinction between discretionary and nondiscretionary actions.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Section 402.02 provides in relevant part:</p>
        <p class="bodytext"><em>Action </em>means <em>all</em> activities or programs <em>of any kind</em> authorized, funded, or carried out, in whole or in part, by Federal agencies in the United States or upon the high seas.  Examples include, but are not limited to:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    (a)actions intended to conserve listed species or their habitat;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    (b)the promulgation of regulations . . .   (second and third emphases added.)</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
Actions in either of the described sub-categories are sometimes mandatory and sometimes discretionary.  Likewise, as the italicized portions indicate, the term action expressly refers to all agency activities or programs of any kind, regardless of whether they are discretionary or mandatory.  By reading the term discretionary as a limitation on action, the Court creates a contradiction in the EPAs own regulation.<a name="ZD-5ref" href="#ZD-5" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>5</b>

            </a>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    As for the final rules explanation for the scope of the term action in §402.01, that too is fully consistent with my interpretation of §402.03.  That explanation plainly states that <em>all</em> Federal actions including conservations programs are subject to the consultation requirements of section 7(a)(2) if they may affect listed species or their critical habitats.  51 Fed. Reg. 19929 (emphasis added).  The regulation does not say all discretionary federal actions, nor does it evince an intent to limit the scope of §7(a)(2) in any way.  Rather, it just restates that the ESA applies to all federal actions, just as the notice of proposed rulemaking did.  This explanation of the scope of the word action is therefore a strong indication that the Courts reading of discretionary is contrary to its intended meaning.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    An even stronger indication is the fact that at no point in the administrative proceedings in these cases did EPA even mention<em></em>it.<a name="ZD-6ref" href="#ZD-6" class="">

            </a>  As an initial matter, it is worth emphasizing that even if EPA had relied on §402.03, its interpretation of the ESA would not be entitled to deference under <em>Chevron U. S. A. Inc.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/467/837" class="subref" title="subref">467 U. S. 837</a> (1984)
, because it is not charged with administering that statute, <em>id</em>., at 844 (We have long recognized that considerable weight should be accorded to an executive departments construction of a statutory scheme <em>it is entrusted to administer</em>. (emphasis added)); <em>Department of Treasury</em> v. <em>FLRA</em>, 837 F. 2d 1163, 1167 (CADC 1988) ([W]hen an agency interprets a statute other than that which it has been entrusted to administer, its interpretation is not entitled to deference).  The Departments of the Interior and Commerce, not EPA, are charged with administering the ESA.  See <em>Babbitt </em>v. <em>Sweet Home Chapter, Communities for Great Ore.,</em> 515 U. S., 687, 703704 (1995).  And EPA has conceded that the Department of the Interiors biological opinion did not discuss 50 CFR. 402.03, and it did not address the question whether the consultation that produced the [biological opinion] was required by the ESA.  Pet. for Cert. in No. 06549, p. 24; see App. 77124 (never mentioning §402.03).  Left with this unfavorable administrative record, EPA can only lean on the fact that the Department of the Interior has recently clarified its position regarding §402.03 in a <em>different</em> administrative proceeding.  See Pet. for Cert. in No. 06549, pp. 2425; <em>id</em>., at 26 (The recent F[ish and Wildlife Service] and N[ational Marine Fisheries Service] communications regarding Alaskas pending transfer application reflect those agencies considered interpretations . . . of [50 CFR] 402.03); App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06340, pp. 103a116a; see also <em>ante</em>, at 12 n. 5.

.  The majority ignores this hoary principle of administrative law and substitutes a post-hoc interpretation of §7(a)(2) and §402.03 for that of the relevant agency.  For that reason alone, these cases should be remanded to the agency.  And for the other reasons I have given, §402.03 cannot be used to harmonize the CWA and the ESA.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">III</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    There are at least two ways in which the CWA and the ESA can be given full effect without privileging one statute over the other.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">A</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The text of §7(a)(2) itself provides the first possible way of reconciling that provision with §402(b) of the CWA.   The subsection reads:</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> Each Federal agency shall, <em>in consultation with and with the assistance of the Secretary</em>, insure that any action authorized, funded, or carried out by such agency (hereinafter in this section referred to as an agency action) is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of habitat of such species which is determined by the Secretary, after consultation as appropriate with affected States, to be critical, unless such agency has been granted an exemption for such action by the Committee pursuant to subsection (h) of this section.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#a_2" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(a)(2)</a> (emphasis added).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court is certainly correct that the use of the word shall in §7(a)(2) imposes a mandatory requirement on the federal agencies.  See <em>ante</em>, at 14.  It is also correct that the ESAs mandate is to be carried out through consultation and may require the agency to adopt an alternative course of action.  <em>Ante,</em> at 15.  The Court is too quick to conclude, however, that this consultation requirement creates an irreconcilable conflict between this provision and §402(b) of the CWA.  It rushes to this flawed judgment because of a basic conceptual erroran error that is revealed as early as the first paragraph of its opinion.  Rather than attempting to find a way to give effect to §7(a)(2)s consultation requirement, the Court frames the question presented as whether §7(a)(2) effectively operates as a tenth criterion on which the transfer of permitting power under the first statute must be conditioned.   <em>Ante</em>, at 12.  The Court is not alone in this.  The author of the Ninth Circuit opinion below also stated that the ESA <em>adds</em> one requirement to the list of considerations under the Clean Water Act permitting transfer provision.  450 F. 3d, at 404 n. 2 (2006) (Berzon, J., concurring in denial of rehearing en banc) (emphasis in original).  But while the ESA does mandate that the relevant agencies consul[t] with the Interior Department, that consultation process also provides a way for the agencies to give effect to both statutes.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The first step in the statutory consultation process is to identify whether any endangered species will be affected by an agency action.  An agency proposing a particular action, such as an NPDES transfer, will typically ask the Secretary of the Interior whether any listed species may be present in the area of the proposed action and whether that action will affect those species.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#c" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(c)</a>.  It is entirely possible that no listed species will be affected, and any anticipated conflict between the ESA and another statute will have been avoided at this threshold stage.  If, however, the Secretary determines that a proposed action may affect an endangered species or its critical habitat, the agency must formally consult with the Secretary.  This consultation culminates in the issuance of a biological opinion, which detail[s] how the agency action affects the species or its critical habitat.  §1536(b)(3)(A); see also 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.14</a>(h).  Even at this stage, it is still possible that formal consultation will reveal that the agency action will not jeopardize any species.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 
63Fed. Reg.
51199 (1998) (noting that FWS rendered a no jeopardy finding with respect to the transfer of permitting authority to Texas).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    If the biological opinion concludes that the agency action would put a listed species in jeopardy, however, the ESA contains a process for resolving the competing demands of agency action and species protection.  The ESA provides that the Secretary shall suggest those reasonable and prudent alternatives which he believes would not violate subsection (a)(2) and can be taken by the Federal agency or applicant in implementing the agency action.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#b_3_A" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(b)(3)(A)</a>; see also 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.14</a>(h)(3).  The agencys regulations define [r]easonable and prudent alternatives as</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> alternative actions identified during formal consultation that can be implemented in a manner consistent with the intended purpose of the action, that can be implemented consistent with the scope of the Federal agencys legal authority and jurisdiction, that is economically and technologically feasible, and that the Director [of FWS] believes would avoid the likelihood of jeopardizing the continued existence of listed species or resulting in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat.   
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.02</a>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
Thus, in the face of any conflict between the ESA and another federal statute, the ESA and its implementing regulations encourage federal agencies to work out a reasonable alternative that would let the proposed action move forward consistent with [its] intended purpose and the agencys legal authority, while also avoiding any violation of  §7(a)(2).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    When applied to the NPDES transfer program, the reasonable and prudent alternatives process would enable EPA and the Department of the Interior to develop a substitute that would allow a transfer of permitting authority <em>and</em> would not jeopardize endangered species.  Stated differently, the consultation process would generate an alternative course of action whereby the transfer could still take placeas required by §402(b) of the CWAbut in such a way that would honor the mandatory requirements of §7(a)(2) of the ESA.  This should come as no surprise to EPA, as it has engaged in pre-transfer consultations at least six times in the past and has stated that it is not barred from doing so by the CWA.<a name="ZD-7ref" href="#ZD-7" class="">

        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Finally, for the rare case in which no reasonable and prudent alternative can be found, Congress has provided yet another mechanism for resolving any conflicts between the ESA and a proposed agency action.  In 1978, shortly after our decision in <em>Hill</em>, Congress amended the ESA to create the Endangered Species Committee, which it authorized to grant exemptions from §7(a)(2).  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#e" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(e)</a>.  Because it has the authority to approve the extinction of an endangered species, the Endangered Species Committee is colloquially described as the God Squad or God Committee.  In light of this weighty responsibility, Congress carefully laid out requirements for the God Committees membership,<a name="ZD-8ref" href="#ZD-8" class="">

                    <b>8</b>

            </a>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    As the final arbiter in situations in which the ESA conflicts with a proposed agency action, the God Committee embodies the primacy of the ESAs mandate and serves as the final mechanism for harmonizing that Act with other federal statutes.  By creating this Committee, Congress recognized that some conflicts with the ESA may not be capable of resolution without having to forever sacrifice some endangered species.  At the same time, the creation of this last line of defense reflects Congress view that the ESA should not yield to another federal action except as a final resort and except when authorized by high level officials after serious consideration.  In short, when all else has failed and two federal statutes are incapable of resolution, Congress left the choice to the Committeenot to this Court; it did not limit the ESA in the way the majority does today.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">B</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    EPAs regulations offer a second way to harmonize the CWA with the ESA.  After EPA has transferred NPDES permitting authority to a State, the agency continues to oversee the States permitting program.  See <em>Arkansas</em> v. <em>Oklahoma</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/503/91" class="subref" title="subref">503 U. S. 91</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">105</a> (1992)
 (Congress preserved for the Administrator broad authority to oversee state permit programs).  If a state permit is outside the guidelines and the requirements of the CWA, EPA may object to it and block its issuance.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1342.html#d_2" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §1342(d)(2)</a>; 
66Fed. Reg.
11206 (2001).  Given these ongoing responsibilities, EPA has enacted a regulation that requires a State to enter into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) that sets forth the particulars of the agencys oversight duties.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/40/123" class="subref" title="subref">40 CFR §123.24</a>(a) (2006).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">The regulation governing MOAs contains several detailed requirements.  For instance, the regulation states that an MOA must contain [p]rovisions specifying classes and categories of permit applications, draft permits and proposed permits that the State will send to the [EPA] Regional Administrator for review, comment and, where applicable, objection, §123.24(b)(2); [p]rovisions specifying the frequency and content of reports, documents and other information which the State is required to submit to the EPA, §123.24(b)(3); and [p]rovisions for coordination of compliance monitoring activities by the State and by EPA, §123.24(b)(4)(i).  More generally, the regulation provides that an MOA may include other terms, conditions, or agreements that are relevant to the administration and enforcement of the States regulatory program.  §123.24(a).  Under the MOA regulation, furthermore, EPA will not approve any MOA that restricts its statutory oversight responsibility.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Like the §7(a)(2) consultation process described above, MOAs provide a potential mechanism for giving effect to §7 of the ESA while also allowing the transfer of permitting authority to a State.  It is important to remember that EPA must approve an MOA <em>prior to</em> the transfer of NPDES authority.  As such, EPA can useand in fact has usedthe MOA process to structure its later oversight in a way that will allow it to protect endangered species in accordance with §7(a)(2) of the ESA.  EPA might negotiate a provision in the MOA that would require a State to abide by the ESA requirements when issuing pollution permits.  See Brief for American Fisheries Society et al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 28. (In the Maine MOA, for example, EPA and the state agreed that state permits would protect ESA-listed species by ensuring compliance with state water quality standards).  Alternatively, EPA could require the state to provide copies of draft permits for discharges in particularly sensitive habitats such as those of ESA-listed species or for discharges that contain a pollutant that threatens ESA-listed wildlife.  <em>Id</em>., at 10.  Or the MOA might be drafted in a way that would allow the agency to object to state permits that would jeopardize any and all endangered species.  See<em> id</em>., at 28 (explaining that the Maine MOA includes a provision allowing EPA to object to any state permit that risks harm to a listed species by threatening water quality).  These are just three of many possibilities.  I need not identify other ways EPA could use the MOA process to comply with the ESA; it is enough to observe that MOAs provide a straightforward way to give the ESA its full effect without restricting §7(a)(2) in the way the Court does.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">IV</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    As discussed above, I believe that the Court incorrectly restricts the reach of §7(a)(2) to discretionary federal actions.  See Part II, <em>supra.</em>  Even if such a limitation were permissible, however, it is clear that EPAs authority to transfer permitting authority under §402(b) <em>is </em>discretionary.<a name="ZD-11ref" href="#ZD-11" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>11</b>

            </a>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The EPA Administrators authority to approve state permit programs pursuant to §402(b) of the CWA does not even fit within the Courts description of the category of mandatory actions that the Court holds are covered by the ESA.  In the Courts words, that category includes actions that an agency is <em>required </em>by statute to undertake once certain specified triggering events have occurred.  <em>Ante</em>, at 22.  The triggering event for EPAs approval is simply the filing of a satisfactory description of the States proposed program.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1342.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §1342(b)</a>.  The statute then commands that the EPA Administrator shall approve the submitted program unless he determines that state law does not satisfy nine specified conditions.  Those conditions are not triggering events; they are potential objections to the exercise of the Administrators authority.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    What is more, §402(b) is a perfect example of why our analysis should not end simply because a statute uses the word shall.  Instead, we must look more closely at its listed criteria to determine whether they allow for discretion, despite the use of shall.  After all, as then-Justice Rehnquists dissenting opinion in the snail darter case explains, a federal statute using the word shall will sometimes allow room for discretion.  See <em>Hill</em>, 437 U. S. at 211212 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).<a name="ZD-12ref" href="#ZD-12" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>12</b>
                </sup>
            </a>  In these cases, there is significant room for discretion in EPAs evaluation of §402(b)s nine conditions.  The first criterion, for example, requires the EPA Administrator to examine five other statutes and ensure that the State has adequate authority to comply with each.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1342.html#b_1_A" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §1342(b)(1)(A)</a>.  One of those five statutes, in turn, expressly directs the Administrator to exercise his judgment.  §1312.  Even the Court acknowledges that EPA must exercise some judgment in determining whether a State has demonstrated that it has the authority to carry out §402(b)s enumerated statutory criteria.  <em>Ante</em>, at 24.  However, in the very same breath, the Court states that the dispositive fact is that the statute clearly does not grant it the discretion to add another entirely separate prerequisite to that list.  <em>Ibid</em>.  This reasoning flouts the Courts own logic.  Under the Courts reading of §402.03, §7(a)(2) applies to discretionary federal actions of any kind.  The Court plainly acknowledges that EPA exercises discretion when deciding whether to transfer permitting authority to a State.  If we are to take the Courts approach seriously, once <em>any</em> discretion has been identifiedas it has here§7(a)(2) must apply.<a name="ZD-13ref" href="#ZD-13" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>13</b>
                </sup>
            </a>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The MOA regulation described in Part IIIB, <em>supra,</em> also demonstrates that an NPDES transfer is not as ministerial a task as the Court would suggest.  The agency retains significant discretion under §123.24 over the content of an MOA, which of course must be approved prior to a transfer. For instance, EPA may require a State to file reports on a weekly basis or a monthly basis.  It may require a State to submit only certain classes and categories of permit applications.  And it may include any additional terms and conditions that are relevant to the enforcement of the NPDES program.  There is ample room for judgment in all of these areas, and EPA has exercised such judgment in the past when approving MOAs from many States.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Approval of Application by Maine to Administer the NPDES Program, 66 Fed. Reg. 12791, (2001); Approval of Application by Maine to Administer the NPDES Program; Texas, 
63Fed. Reg.
51165 (1998).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In fact, in an earlier case raising a question similar to this one, see <em>American Forest &amp; Paper Assn.</em> v. <em>EPA</em>, 137 F. 3d 291, 298299 (CA5 1998), EPA itself explained how 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/40/123" class="subref" title="subref">40 CFR §123.24</a> gives it discretion over the approval of a State pollution control program, see Brief for EPA in No. 9660874 (CA5).  Arguing that [i]ndicia of discretionary involvement or control abound in [its] regulations, the agency listed its MOA regulation as a prime example.<a name="ZD-14ref" href="#ZD-14" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>14</b>
                </sup>
            </a>  Again, because EPAs approval of a State application to administer an NPDES program entails significantindeed, aboundingdiscretion, I would find that §7(a)(2) of the ESA applies even under the Courts own flawed theory of these cases.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">V</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Mindful that judges must always remain faithful to the intent of the legislature, Chief Justice Burger closed his opinion in the snail darter case with a reminder that [o]nce the meaning of an enactment is discerned and its constitutionality determined, the judicial process comes to an end.  <em>Hill</em>, 437 U. S., at 194.  This Court offered a definitive interpretation of the Endangered Species Act nearly 30 years ago in that very case.  Today the Court turns its back on our decision in <em>Hill</em> and places a great number of endangered species in jeopardy, including the cactus ferruginous pygmy-owl and Pima pineapple cactus at issue here.  At the risk of plagiarizing Chief Justice Burgers fine opinion, I think it is appropriate to end my opinion just as he didwith a quotation attributed to Sir Thomas More that has as much relevance today as it did three decades ago.  This quotation illustrates not only the fundamental character of the rule of law embodied in §7 of the ESA but also the pernicious consequences of official disobedience of such a rule.  Repetition of that literary allusion is especially appropriate today:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">The law, Roper, the law.  I know whats legal, not whats right.  And Ill stick to whats legal. . . . Im <em>not</em> God.

Cut a great road through the law to get after the Devil? . . . And when the last law was down, and the Devil turned round on youwhere would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat? . . . This country's planted thick with laws from coast to coastMans laws, not Godsand if you cut them down . . . dyou really think you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then? . . .

        <p class="bodytext">    Although its reasons have shifted over time, at both the administrative level and in the federal courts, EPA has insisted that the requirements of §7(a)(2) of the ESA do not apply to its decision to transfer permitting authority under §402(b) of the CWA.  See App. 114; Brief for Petitioner EPA 16, 42.  As I have explained above, that conclusion is contrary to the text of §7(a)(2), our decision in the <em>TVA</em> v. <em>Hill</em>, and the regulation on which the agency has since relied and upon which the Court relies on today.  Accordingly, I would hold that EPAs decision was arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/5/706.html#2_A" class="subref" title="subref">5 U. S. C. §706(2)(A)</a>, and would remand to the agency for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-2" href="#ZD-2ref">2</a> The Court misreads this sentence and, in so doing, overreads our decision in Hill.  Justice Alito maintains that Hill held that the acts appropriating funds to the TVA … did not require the agency to use any of the generally appropriated funds to complete the Tellico Dam project.  Ante, at 2324, n. 9.  But Hill said no such thing.  That case only held that the subsequent appropriation of funds for the Tellico Dam Project could not overcome the mandatory requirements of §7 of the ESA; it did not hold that the TVA would not have been required to spend any and all appropriated funds if the ESA had never been passed.  See Hill, 437 U. S., at 189190.  If the ESA had never been enacted and did not stand in the way of the completion of the Tellico Dam, there is no doubt that the TVA would have finished the project that Congress had funded.

Hill, O.T. 1977, No. 761701, p. 26.  Instead, the TVA sought to restrict §7 to only those actions for which the agency has reasonable decision-making alternatives before it.  Ibid.  We rejected that narrow interpretation, stating that the only way to sustain the TVAs position would be to ignore the ordinary meaning of plain language.  Hill, 437 U. S., at 173.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/541/752" class="subref" title="subref">541 U. S. 752</a> (2004)
,that an agency cannot be considered the legal cause of an action that it has no statutory discretion not to takesupports its reliance on §402.03.  Ante, at 20.  First of all, the Court itself recognizes that it must distance itself from that case, ibid., because Public Citizen dealt with a procedural requirement under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), not a substantive requirement like that imposed by §7(a)(2) of the ESA, see TVA v. Hill, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/437/158" class="subref" title="subref">437 U. S. 158</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">188</a>, n. 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">34</a> (1978)
 (holding that NEPA cases are completely inapposite to the ESA context).  What the Court does not recognize, however, is that what it views as the basic principle of Public Citizen is stated too broadly and therefore inapplicable to this case.  Ante, at 20.


Our decision in Public Citizen turned on what we called a critical feature of the case: that the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) had no ability to countermand the Presidents lifting a moratorium that prohibited certain motor carriers from obtaining authority to operate within the United States.  541 U. S., at 766.  Once the President decided to lift that moratorium, and once the relevant vehicles had entered the United States, FMCSA was required by statute to register the vehicles if certain conditions were met.  Ibid. (Under FMCSAs entirely reasonable reading of this provision, it must certify any motor carrier that can show that it is willing and able to comply with the various substantive requirements for safety and financial responsibility contained in DOT regulations; only the moratorium prevented it from doing so for Mexican motor carriers before 2001 (emphasis deleted)).  Therefore, any potential NEPA concerns were generated by another decisionmaker, the President, and not the FMCSA.  Here, by contrast, EPA is not required to act ministerially once another person or agency has made a decision.  Instead, EPA must exercise its own judgment when considering the transfer of NPDES authority to a State; it also has its own authority to deny such a transfer.  Any effect on endangered species will be caused, even if indirectly, by the agencys own decision to transfer NPDES authority.  Cf. 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.02</a> (providing that the ESA will apply to all agency activities that directly or indirectly caus[e] modifications to the land, water, or air (emphasis added)).

        <p class="bodytext">    These cases present a problem of conflicting shalls.  On the one hand, §402(b) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) provides that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) shall approve a States application to administer a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permitting program unless it determines that nine criteria are not satisfied.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1342.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §1342(b)</a>.  On the other hand, shortly after the passage of the CWA, Congress enacted §7(a)(2) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA), which commands that federal agencies shall insure that their actions do not jeopardize endangered species.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#a_2" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(a)(2)</a>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    When faced with competing statutory mandates, it is our duty to give full effect to both if at all possible.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Morton</em> v. <em>Mancari</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/417/535" class="subref" title="subref">417 U. S. 535</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">551</a> (1974)
 ([W]hen two statutes are capable of co-existence, it is the duty of the courts, absent a clearly expressed congressional intention to the contrary, to regard each as effective).  The Court fails at this task.  Its opinion unsuccessfully tries to reconcile the CWA and ESA by relying on a federal regulation, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a> (2006), which it reads as limiting the reach of §7(a)(2) to <em>only</em> discretionary federal actions, see <em>ante</em>, at 1719.  Not only is this reading inconsistent with the text and history of §402.03, but it is fundamentally inconsistent with the ESA itself.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In the celebrated snail darter case, <em>TVA</em> v. <em>Hill</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/437/153" class="subref" title="subref">437 U. S. 153</a> (1978)
, we held that the ESA reveals a conscious decision by Congress to give endangered species priority over the primary missions of federal agencies, <em>id</em>., at 185.  Consistent with that intent, Chief Justice Burgers exceptionally thorough and admirable opinion explained that §7 admits of<em></em>no exception.<em>  Id</em>., at 173.  Creating precisely such an exception by exempting nondiscretionary federal actions from the ESAs coverage, the Court whittles away at Congress comprehensive effort to protect endangered species from the risk of extinction and fails to give the Act its intended effect.  After first giving <em>Hill</em> the attention it deserves, I will comment further on the irrelevance of §402.03 to these cases and offer other available ways to give effect to both CWA and the ESA.  Having done so, I conclude by explaining why these cases should be remanded to the EPA for further proceedings.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">I</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In <em>Hill, </em>we were presented with two separate questions: (1) whether the ESA required a court to enjoin the operation of the nearly completed Tellico Dam and Reservoir Project because the Secretary of the Interior had determined that its operation would eradicate a small endangered fish known as a snail darter; and (2) whether post-1973 congressional appropriations for the completion of the Tellico Dam constituted an implied repeal of the ESA, at least insofar as it applied to the Dam.  437 U. S., at 156.  More than 30 pages of our opinion explain our affirmative answer to the first question, see <em>id.,</em> at 156188, but just over four pages sufficed to explain our negative answer to the second, see <em>id</em>., at 189193.  While it is our ruling on the first question that is relevant to the cases before us, it is our refusal to hold that the ESA itself had been impliedly repealed that the majority strangely deems most significant.  See <em>ante, </em>at 2122.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In answering <em>Hill</em>s first question,<em></em>we did not discuss implied repeals.  On the contrary, that portion of the opinion contained our definitive interpretation of the ESA, in which we concluded that the language, history, and structure of the [ESA] indicates beyond doubt that Congress intended endangered species to be afforded the highest of priorities.  437 U. S., at 174; see also <em>id</em>., at 177 ( The dominant theme pervading all Congressional discussion of the proposed [ESA] was the overriding need <em>to devote whatever effort and resources were necessary</em> to avoid further diminution of national and worldwide wildlife resources  (quoting Coggins, Conserving Wildlife Resources: An Overview of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, 
51N. D. L. Rev.
315,
321 (1975) (emphasis added in <em>Hill</em>))).  With respect to §7 in particular, our opinion could not have been any clearer.  We plainly held that it admits of<em> no exception</em>.  437 U. S., at 173 (emphasis added).<a name="ZD-1ref" href="#ZD-1" class="">

            </a>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Our opinion in <em>Hill </em>explained at length why §7 imposed obligations on all federal agencies to ensure that actions authorized, funded, or carried out by them do not jeopardize the continued existence of endangered species.  437 U. S., at 173 (emphasis deleted; internal quotation marks omitted).  Not a word in the opinion stated or suggested that §7 obligations are inapplicable to mandatory agency actions that would threaten the eradication of an endangered species.  Nor did the opinion describe the Tennessee Valley Authoritys (TVA) attempted completion of the Tellico Dam as a discretionary act.  How could it?  After all, if the Secretary of the Interior had not declared the snail darter an endangered species whose critical habitat would be destroyed by operation of the Tellico Dam, the TVA surely would have been obligated to spend the additional funds that Congress appropriated to complete the project.<a name="ZD-2ref" href="#ZD-2" class="">

                </sup>
            </a>  Unconcerned with whether an agency action was mandatory or discretionary, we simply held that §7 of the ESA</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> reveals an explicit congressional decision to require agencies to afford <em>first priority</em> to the declared national policy of saving endangered species.  The pointed omission of the type of qualifying language previously included in endangered species legislation reveals a conscious decision by Congress to give endangered species <em>priority over the </em><em>primary missions of federal agencies.</em>   <em>Id</em>., at 185 (emphasis added).<a name="ZD-3ref" href="#ZD-3" class="">

            </a>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The fact that we also concluded that the post-1973 congressional appropriations did not impliedly repeal the ESA provides no support for the majoritys contention that the obligations imposed by §7(a)(2) may be limited to discretionary acts.  A few passages from the relevant parts of <em>Hill</em> belie that suggestion.  After noting the oddity of holding that the interest in protecting the survival of a relatively small number of 3-inch fish would require the permanent halting of a virtually completed dam for which Congress has expended more than $100 million, we found that the explicit provisions of the Endangered Species Act require precisely that result.  <em>Id.,</em> at 172, 173.  We then continued:</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> One would be hard pressed to find a statutory provision whose terms were any plainer than those in §7 of the Endangered Species Act.  Its very words affirmatively command all federal agencies to <em>insure </em>that actions <em>authorized, funded,</em> or <em>carried out </em>by them do not <em>jeopardize </em>the continued existence of an endangered species or <em>result </em>in the destruction or modification of habitat of such species … .   <em>Id</em>., at 173 (quoting 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536</a> (1976 ed.) (emphasis added in <em>Hill</em>)).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
We also reviewed the ESAs history to identify a variety of exceptions that had been included in earlier legislation and unenacted proposals but were omitted from the final version of the 1973 statute.  We explained that earlier endangered species legislation qualified the obligation of federal agencies, but the 1973 Act purposefully omitted all phrases which might have qualified an agencys responsibilities.  437 U. S., at 181, 182.  Moreover, after observing that the ESA creates only a limited number of hardship exemptions, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1539.html" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1539</a>none of which would apply to federal agencieswe applied the maxim <em>expressio unius est expression alterius</em> to conclude that there are no exemptions in the Endangered Species Act for federal agencies,437 U. S., at 188.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Today, however, the Court countenances such an exemption.  It erroneously concludes that the ESA contains an unmentioned exception for nondiscretionary agency action and that the statutes command to enjoin the completion of the Tellico Dam depended on the unmentioned fact that the TVA was attempting to perform a discretionary act.  But both the text of the ESA and our opinion in <em>Hill</em> compel the contrary determination that Congress intended the ESA to apply to all federal agencies and to all actions authorized, funded, or carried out by them.  <em>Id.,</em> at 173 (emphasis deleted).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    A transfer of NPDES permitting authority under §402(b) of the CWA is undoubtedly one of those actions that is authorized or carried out by a federal agency.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(b)</a>; 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.02</a> (defining action as all activities or programs of any kind authorized, funded, or carried out, in whole or in part, by Federal agencies in the United States or upon the high seas.  Examples include, but are not limited to . . . actions directly or indirectly causing modifications to the land, water, or air).  It follows from <em>Hill </em>that §7(a)(2) applies to such NPDES transferswhether they are mandatory or discretionary.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    Given our unequivocal holding in <em>Hill</em> that the ESA has first priority over all other federal action, 437 U. S., at 185, if any statute should yield, it should be the CWA.  But no statute must yield unless it is truly incapable of coexistence.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Morton</em>, 417 U. S., at 551.  Therefore, assuming that §402(b) of the CWA contains its own mandatory command, we should first try to harmonize that provision with the mandatory requirements of §7(a)(2) of the ESA.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Courts solution is to rely on 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a>, which states that Section 7 and the requirements of this part apply to all actions in which there is discretionary Federal involvement or control.  The Court explains that this regulation harmonizes the statutes by giving effect to the ESAs no-jeopardy mandate whenever an agency has discretion to do so, but by lifting that mandate when the agency is forbidden from considering such extrastatutory factors.  <em>Ante</em>, at 17.  This is not harmony, and it certainly isnt effect.  Rather than giving genuine effect to §7(a)(2), the Court permits a wholesale limitation on the reach of the ESA.  Its interpretation of §402.03 conflicts with the text and history of the regulation, as well as our interpretation of §7 in the snail darter case.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    To begin with, the plain language of §402.03 does not state that its coverage is limited to discretionary actions.  Quite the opposite, the most natural reading of the text is that it confirms the broad construction of §7 endorsed by our opinion in <em>Hill</em>.  Indeed, the only way to read §402.03 in accordance with the facts of the case and our holding that §7 admits of no exception[s], 437 U. S., at 173, is that it eliminates any possible argument that the ESA does not extend to situations in which the discretionary federal involvement is only marginal.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court is simply mistaken when it says that it reads §402.03 to mean what it says: that §7(a)(2)s no-jeopardy duty covers <em>only</em> discretionary agency actions … .  <em>Ante,</em> at 21 (emphasis added).  That is not, in fact, what §402.03 says.  The word only is the Courts addition to the text, not the agencys.  Moreover, that text surely does not go on to say (as the Court does) that the duty does not attach to actions (like the NPDES permitting transfer authorization) that an agency is <em>required</em> by statute to undertake once certain specified triggering events have occurred. <em>Ibid.</em>  If the drafters of the regulation had intended such a far-reaching change in the law, surely they would have said so by using language similar to that which the Court uses today.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Nothing in the proceedings that led to the promulgation of the regulation suggests any reason for limiting the pre-existing understanding of the scope of §7s coverage.  EPA codified the current version of §402.03 in 1986 as part of a general redrafting of ESA regulations.  In the 1983 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the proposed version of §402.03 stated that §7 and the requirements of this Part apply to all actions in which there is Federal involvement or control.  
48Fed. Reg.
29999 (1983).  Without any explanation, the final rule inserted the word discretionary before Federal involvement or control.

            </a>  Clearly, if the Secretary of the Interior meant to limit the pre-existing understanding of the scope of the coverage of §7(a)(2) by promulgating this regulation, that intent would have been mentioned somewhere in the text of the regulations or in contemporaneous comment about them.

 (We have frequently reiterated that an agency must cogently explain why it has exercised its discretion in a given manner).  Yet, the final rule said nothing about limiting the reach of §7 or our decision in <em>Hill.  </em>Nor did it mention the change from the notice of proposed rulemaking.  I can only assume, then, that the regulation does mean what both it and the notice of proposed rulemaking says: Section 7(a)(2) applies to discretionary federal action, but not <em>only</em> to discretionary action.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The only explanation the agency provided for §402.03 was the following:</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> This section, which explains the applicability of section 7, implicitly covers Federal activities within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States and upon the high seas as a result of the definition of action in §402.02.  The explanation for the scope of the term action is provided in the discussion under §402.01 above.  51 Fed. Reg. 19937.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
This statement directs us to two sources: the definition of action in §402.02 and the explanation for the scope of the term action  in §402.01.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Both confirm that there was no intent to draw a distinction between discretionary and nondiscretionary actions.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Section 402.02 provides in relevant part:</p>
        <p class="bodytext"><em>Action </em>means <em>all</em> activities or programs <em>of any kind</em> authorized, funded, or carried out, in whole or in part, by Federal agencies in the United States or upon the high seas.  Examples include, but are not limited to:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    (a)actions intended to conserve listed species or their habitat;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    (b)the promulgation of regulations . . .   (second and third emphases added.)</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
Actions in either of the described sub-categories are sometimes mandatory and sometimes discretionary.  Likewise, as the italicized portions indicate, the term action expressly refers to all agency activities or programs of any kind, regardless of whether they are discretionary or mandatory.  By reading the term discretionary as a limitation on action, the Court creates a contradiction in the EPAs own regulation.<a name="ZD-5ref" href="#ZD-5" class="">

        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    As for the final rules explanation for the scope of the term action in §402.01, that too is fully consistent with my interpretation of §402.03.  That explanation plainly states that <em>all</em> Federal actions including conservations programs are subject to the consultation requirements of section 7(a)(2) if they may affect listed species or their critical habitats.  51 Fed. Reg. 19929 (emphasis added).  The regulation does not say all discretionary federal actions, nor does it evince an intent to limit the scope of §7(a)(2) in any way.  Rather, it just restates that the ESA applies to all federal actions, just as the notice of proposed rulemaking did.  This explanation of the scope of the word action is therefore a strong indication that the Courts reading of discretionary is contrary to its intended meaning.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    An even stronger indication is the fact that at no point in the administrative proceedings in these cases did EPA even mention<em></em>it.<a name="ZD-6ref" href="#ZD-6" class="">

            </a>  As an initial matter, it is worth emphasizing that even if EPA had relied on §402.03, its interpretation of the ESA would not be entitled to deference under <em>Chevron U. S. A. Inc.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/467/837" class="subref" title="subref">467 U. S. 837</a> (1984)
, because it is not charged with administering that statute, <em>id</em>., at 844 (We have long recognized that considerable weight should be accorded to an executive departments construction of a statutory scheme <em>it is entrusted to administer</em>. (emphasis added)); <em>Department of Treasury</em> v. <em>FLRA</em>, 837 F. 2d 1163, 1167 (CADC 1988) ([W]hen an agency interprets a statute other than that which it has been entrusted to administer, its interpretation is not entitled to deference).  The Departments of the Interior and Commerce, not EPA, are charged with administering the ESA.  See <em>Babbitt </em>v. <em>Sweet Home Chapter, Communities for Great Ore.,</em> 515 U. S., 687, 703704 (1995).  And EPA has conceded that the Department of the Interiors biological opinion did not discuss 50 CFR. 402.03, and it did not address the question whether the consultation that produced the [biological opinion] was required by the ESA.  Pet. for Cert. in No. 06549, p. 24; see App. 77124 (never mentioning §402.03).  Left with this unfavorable administrative record, EPA can only lean on the fact that the Department of the Interior has recently clarified its position regarding §402.03 in a <em>different</em> administrative proceeding.  See Pet. for Cert. in No. 06549, pp. 2425; <em>id</em>., at 26 (The recent F[ish and Wildlife Service] and N[ational Marine Fisheries Service] communications regarding Alaskas pending transfer application reflect those agencies considered interpretations . . . of [50 CFR] 402.03); App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06340, pp. 103a116a; see also <em>ante</em>, at 12 n. 5.  We have long held, however, that courts may not affirm an agency action on grounds other than those adopted by the agency in the administrative proceedings.  See <em>SEC</em> v. <em>Chenery Corp.</em>,

.  The majority ignores this hoary principle of administrative law and substitutes a post-hoc interpretation of §7(a)(2) and §402.03 for that of the relevant agency.  For that reason alone, these cases should be remanded to the agency.  And for the other reasons I have given, §402.03 cannot be used to harmonize the CWA and the ESA.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">III</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    There are at least two ways in which the CWA and the ESA can be given full effect without privileging one statute over the other.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">A</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The text of §7(a)(2) itself provides the first possible way of reconciling that provision with §402(b) of the CWA.   The subsection reads:</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> Each Federal agency shall, <em>in consultation with and with the assistance of the Secretary</em>, insure that any action authorized, funded, or carried out by such agency (hereinafter in this section referred to as an agency action) is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of habitat of such species which is determined by the Secretary, after consultation as appropriate with affected States, to be critical, unless such agency has been granted an exemption for such action by the Committee pursuant to subsection (h) of this section.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#a_2" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(a)(2)</a> (emphasis added).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court is certainly correct that the use of the word shall in §7(a)(2) imposes a mandatory requirement on the federal agencies.  See <em>ante</em>, at 14.  It is also correct that the ESAs mandate is to be carried out through consultation and may require the agency to adopt an alternative course of action.  <em>Ante,</em> at 15.  The Court is too quick to conclude, however, that this consultation requirement creates an irreconcilable conflict between this provision and §402(b) of the CWA.  It rushes to this flawed judgment because of a basic conceptual erroran error that is revealed as early as the first paragraph of its opinion.  Rather than attempting to find a way to give effect to §7(a)(2)s consultation requirement, the Court frames the question presented as whether §7(a)(2) effectively operates as a tenth criterion on which the transfer of permitting power under the first statute must be conditioned.   <em>Ante</em>, at 12.  The Court is not alone in this.  The author of the Ninth Circuit opinion below also stated that the ESA <em>adds</em> one requirement to the list of considerations under the Clean Water Act permitting transfer provision.  450 F. 3d, at 404 n. 2 (2006) (Berzon, J., concurring in denial of rehearing en banc) (emphasis in original).  But while the ESA does mandate that the relevant agencies consul[t] with the Interior Department, that consultation process also provides a way for the agencies to give effect to both statutes.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The first step in the statutory consultation process is to identify whether any endangered species will be affected by an agency action.  An agency proposing a particular action, such as an NPDES transfer, will typically ask the Secretary of the Interior whether any listed species may be present in the area of the proposed action and whether that action will affect those species.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#c" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(c)</a>.  It is entirely possible that no listed species will be affected, and any anticipated conflict between the ESA and another statute will have been avoided at this threshold stage.  If, however, the Secretary determines that a proposed action may affect an endangered species or its critical habitat, the agency must formally consult with the Secretary.  This consultation culminates in the issuance of a biological opinion, which detail[s] how the agency action affects the species or its critical habitat.  §1536(b)(3)(A); see also 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.14</a>(h).  Even at this stage, it is still possible that formal consultation will reveal that the agency action will not jeopardize any species.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 
63Fed. Reg.
51199 (1998) (noting that FWS rendered a no jeopardy finding with respect to the transfer of permitting authority to Texas).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    If the biological opinion concludes that the agency action would put a listed species in jeopardy, however, the ESA contains a process for resolving the competing demands of agency action and species protection.  The ESA provides that the Secretary shall suggest those reasonable and prudent alternatives which he believes would not violate subsection (a)(2) and can be taken by the Federal agency or applicant in implementing the agency action.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#b_3_A" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(b)(3)(A)</a>; see also 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.14</a>(h)(3).  The agencys regulations define [r]easonable and prudent alternatives as</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> alternative actions identified during formal consultation that can be implemented in a manner consistent with the intended purpose of the action, that can be implemented consistent with the scope of the Federal agencys legal authority and jurisdiction, that is economically and technologically feasible, and that the Director [of FWS] believes would avoid the likelihood of jeopardizing the continued existence of listed species or resulting in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat.   
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.02</a>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
Thus, in the face of any conflict between the ESA and another federal statute, the ESA and its implementing regulations encourage federal agencies to work out a reasonable alternative that would let the proposed action move forward consistent with [its] intended purpose and the agencys legal authority, while also avoiding any violation of  §7(a)(2).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    When applied to the NPDES transfer program, the reasonable and prudent alternatives process would enable EPA and the Department of the Interior to develop a substitute that would allow a transfer of permitting authority <em>and</em> would not jeopardize endangered species.  Stated differently, the consultation process would generate an alternative course of action whereby the transfer could still take placeas required by §402(b) of the CWAbut in such a way that would honor the mandatory requirements of §7(a)(2) of the ESA.  This should come as no surprise to EPA, as it has engaged in pre-transfer consultations at least six times in the past and has stated that it is not barred from doing so by the CWA.<a name="ZD-7ref" href="#ZD-7" class="">

        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Finally, for the rare case in which no reasonable and prudent alternative can be found, Congress has provided yet another mechanism for resolving any conflicts between the ESA and a proposed agency action.  In 1978, shortly after our decision in <em>Hill</em>, Congress amended the ESA to create the Endangered Species Committee, which it authorized to grant exemptions from §7(a)(2).  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#e" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(e)</a>.  Because it has the authority to approve the extinction of an endangered species, the Endangered Species Committee is colloquially described as the God Squad or God Committee.  In light of this weighty responsibility, Congress carefully laid out requirements for the God Committees membership,<a name="ZD-8ref" href="#ZD-8" class="">

            </a> and the factors it must consider in deciding whether to grant an exemption.<a name="ZD-10ref" href="#ZD-10" class="">

                    <b>10</b>

            </a>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    As the final arbiter in situations in which the ESA conflicts with a proposed agency action, the God Committee embodies the primacy of the ESAs mandate and serves as the final mechanism for harmonizing that Act with other federal statutes.  By creating this Committee, Congress recognized that some conflicts with the ESA may not be capable of resolution without having to forever sacrifice some endangered species.  At the same time, the creation of this last line of defense reflects Congress view that the ESA should not yield to another federal action except as a final resort and except when authorized by high level officials after serious consideration.  In short, when all else has failed and two federal statutes are incapable of resolution, Congress left the choice to the Committeenot to this Court; it did not limit the ESA in the way the majority does today.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">B</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    EPAs regulations offer a second way to harmonize the CWA with the ESA.  After EPA has transferred NPDES permitting authority to a State, the agency continues to oversee the States permitting program.  See <em>Arkansas</em> v. <em>Oklahoma</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/503/91" class="subref" title="subref">503 U. S. 91</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">105</a> (1992)
 (Congress preserved for the Administrator broad authority to oversee state permit programs).  If a state permit is outside the guidelines and the requirements of the CWA, EPA may object to it and block its issuance.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1342.html#d_2" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §1342(d)(2)</a>; 
66Fed. Reg.
11206 (2001).  Given these ongoing responsibilities, EPA has enacted a regulation that requires a State to enter into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) that sets forth the particulars of the agencys oversight duties.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/40/123" class="subref" title="subref">40 CFR §123.24</a>(a) (2006).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">The regulation governing MOAs contains several detailed requirements.  For instance, the regulation states that an MOA must contain [p]rovisions specifying classes and categories of permit applications, draft permits and proposed permits that the State will send to the [EPA] Regional Administrator for review, comment and, where applicable, objection, §123.24(b)(2); [p]rovisions specifying the frequency and content of reports, documents and other information which the State is required to submit to the EPA, §123.24(b)(3); and [p]rovisions for coordination of compliance monitoring activities by the State and by EPA, §123.24(b)(4)(i).  More generally, the regulation provides that an MOA may include other terms, conditions, or agreements that are relevant to the administration and enforcement of the States regulatory program.  §123.24(a).  Under the MOA regulation, furthermore, EPA will not approve any MOA that restricts its statutory oversight responsibility.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Like the §7(a)(2) consultation process described above, MOAs provide a potential mechanism for giving effect to §7 of the ESA while also allowing the transfer of permitting authority to a State.  It is important to remember that EPA must approve an MOA <em>prior to</em> the transfer of NPDES authority.  As such, EPA can useand in fact has usedthe MOA process to structure its later oversight in a way that will allow it to protect endangered species in accordance with §7(a)(2) of the ESA.  EPA might negotiate a provision in the MOA that would require a State to abide by the ESA requirements when issuing pollution permits.  See Brief for American Fisheries Society et al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 28. (In the Maine MOA, for example, EPA and the state agreed that state permits would protect ESA-listed species by ensuring compliance with state water quality standards).  Alternatively, EPA could require the state to provide copies of draft permits for discharges in particularly sensitive habitats such as those of ESA-listed species or for discharges that contain a pollutant that threatens ESA-listed wildlife.  <em>Id</em>., at 10.  Or the MOA might be drafted in a way that would allow the agency to object to state permits that would jeopardize any and all endangered species.  See<em> id</em>., at 28 (explaining that the Maine MOA includes a provision allowing EPA to object to any state permit that risks harm to a listed species by threatening water quality).  These are just three of many possibilities.  I need not identify other ways EPA could use the MOA process to comply with the ESA; it is enough to observe that MOAs provide a straightforward way to give the ESA its full effect without restricting §7(a)(2) in the way the Court does.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">IV</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    As discussed above, I believe that the Court incorrectly restricts the reach of §7(a)(2) to discretionary federal actions.  See Part II, <em>supra.</em>  Even if such a limitation were permissible, however, it is clear that EPAs authority to transfer permitting authority under §402(b) <em>is </em>discretionary.<a name="ZD-11ref" href="#ZD-11" class="">

            </a>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The EPA Administrators authority to approve state permit programs pursuant to §402(b) of the CWA does not even fit within the Courts description of the category of mandatory actions that the Court holds are covered by the ESA.  In the Courts words, that category includes actions that an agency is <em>required </em>by statute to undertake once certain specified triggering events have occurred.  <em>Ante</em>, at 22.  The triggering event for EPAs approval is simply the filing of a satisfactory description of the States proposed program.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1342.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §1342(b)</a>.  The statute then commands that the EPA Administrator shall approve the submitted program unless he determines that state law does not satisfy nine specified conditions.  Those conditions are not triggering events; they are potential objections to the exercise of the Administrators authority.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    What is more, §402(b) is a perfect example of why our analysis should not end simply because a statute uses the word shall.  Instead, we must look more closely at its listed criteria to determine whether they allow for discretion, despite the use of shall.  After all, as then-Justice Rehnquists dissenting opinion in the snail darter case explains, a federal statute using the word shall will sometimes allow room for discretion.  See <em>Hill</em>, 437 U. S. at 211212 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).<a name="ZD-12ref" href="#ZD-12" class="">

                </sup>
            </a>  In these cases, there is significant room for discretion in EPAs evaluation of §402(b)s nine conditions.  The first criterion, for example, requires the EPA Administrator to examine five other statutes and ensure that the State has adequate authority to comply with each.

One of those five statutes, in turn, expressly directs the Administrator to exercise his judgment.  §1312.  Even the Court acknowledges that EPA must exercise some judgment in determining whether a State has demonstrated that it has the authority to carry out §402(b)s enumerated statutory criteria.  <em>Ante</em>, at 24.  However, in the very same breath, the Court states that the dispositive fact is that the statute clearly does not grant it the discretion to add another entirely separate prerequisite to that list.  <em>Ibid</em>.  This reasoning flouts the Courts own logic.  Under the Courts reading of §402.03, §7(a)(2) applies to discretionary federal actions of any kind.  The Court plainly acknowledges that EPA exercises discretion when deciding whether to transfer permitting authority to a State.  If we are to take the Courts approach seriously, once <em>any</em> discretion has been identifiedas it has here§7(a)(2) must apply.<a name="ZD-13ref" href="#ZD-13" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    The MOA regulation described in Part IIIB, <em>supra,</em> also demonstrates that an NPDES transfer is not as ministerial a task as the Court would suggest.  The agency retains significant discretion under §123.24 over the content of an MOA, which of course must be approved prior to a transfer. For instance, EPA may require a State to file reports on a weekly basis or a monthly basis.  It may require a State to submit only certain classes and categories of permit applications.  And it may include any additional terms and conditions that are relevant to the enforcement of the NPDES program.  There is ample room for judgment in all of these areas, and EPA has exercised such judgment in the past when approving MOAs from many States.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Approval of Application by Maine to Administer the NPDES Program, 66 Fed. Reg. 12791, (2001); Approval of Application by Maine to Administer the NPDES Program; Texas, 
63Fed. Reg.
51165 (1998).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In fact, in an earlier case raising a question similar to this one, see <em>American Forest &amp; Paper Assn.</em> v. <em>EPA</em>, 137 F. 3d 291, 298299 (CA5 1998), EPA itself explained how 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/40/123" class="subref" title="subref">40 CFR §123.24</a> gives it discretion over the approval of a State pollution control program, see Brief for EPA in No. 9660874 (CA5).  Arguing that [i]ndicia of discretionary involvement or control abound in [its] regulations, the agency listed its MOA regulation as a prime example.<a name="ZD-14ref" href="#ZD-14" class="">

            </a>  Again, because EPAs approval of a State application to administer an NPDES program entails significantindeed, aboundingdiscretion, I would find that §7(a)(2) of the ESA applies even under the Courts own flawed theory of these cases.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    Mindful that judges must always remain faithful to the intent of the legislature, Chief Justice Burger closed his opinion in the snail darter case with a reminder that [o]nce the meaning of an enactment is discerned and its constitutionality determined, the judicial process comes to an end.  <em>Hill</em>, 437 U. S., at 194.  This Court offered a definitive interpretation of the Endangered Species Act nearly 30 years ago in that very case.  Today the Court turns its back on our decision in <em>Hill</em> and places a great number of endangered species in jeopardy, including the cactus ferruginous pygmy-owl and Pima pineapple cactus at issue here.  At the risk of plagiarizing Chief Justice Burgers fine opinion, I think it is appropriate to end my opinion just as he didwith a quotation attributed to Sir Thomas More that has as much relevance today as it did three decades ago.  This quotation illustrates not only the fundamental character of the rule of law embodied in §7 of the ESA but also the pernicious consequences of official disobedience of such a rule.  Repetition of that literary allusion is especially appropriate today:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">The law, Roper, the law.  I know whats legal, not whats right.  And Ill stick to whats legal. . . . Im <em>not</em> God.

Cut a great road through the law to get after the Devil? . . . And when the last law was down, and the Devil turned round on youwhere would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat? . . .

        <p class="bodytext">    Although its reasons have shifted over time, at both the administrative level and in the federal courts, EPA has insisted that the requirements of §7(a)(2) of the ESA do not apply to its decision to transfer permitting authority under §402(b) of the CWA.  See App. 114; Brief for Petitioner EPA 16, 42.  As I have explained above, that conclusion is contrary to the text of §7(a)(2), our decision in the <em>TVA</em> v. <em>Hill</em>, and the regulation on which the agency has since relied and upon which the Court relies on today.  Accordingly, I would hold that EPAs decision was arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/5/706.html#2_A" class="subref" title="subref">5 U. S. C. §706(2)(A)</a>, and would remand to the agency for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-2" href="#ZD-2ref">2</a> The Court misreads this sentence and, in so doing, overreads our decision in Hill.  Justice Alito maintains that Hill held that the acts appropriating funds to the TVA … did not require the agency to use any of the generally appropriated funds to complete the Tellico Dam project.  Ante, at 2324, n. 9.  But Hill said no such thing.  That case only held that the subsequent appropriation of funds for the Tellico Dam Project could not overcome the mandatory requirements of §7 of the ESA; it did not hold that the TVA would not have been required to spend any and all appropriated funds if the ESA had never been passed.  See Hill, 437 U. S., at 189190.  If the ESA had never been enacted and did not stand in the way of the completion of the Tellico Dam, there is no doubt that the TVA would have finished the project that Congress had funded.

We rejected that narrow interpretation, stating that the only way to sustain the TVAs position would be to ignore the ordinary meaning of plain language.  Hill, 437 U. S., at 173.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/541/752" class="subref" title="subref">541 U. S. 752</a> (2004)
,that an agency cannot be considered the legal cause of an action that it has no statutory discretion not to takesupports its reliance on §402.03.  Ante, at 20.  First of all, the Court itself recognizes that it must distance itself from that case, ibid., because Public Citizen dealt with a procedural requirement under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), not a substantive requirement like that imposed by §7(a)(2) of the ESA, see TVA v. Hill, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/437/158" class="subref" title="subref">437 U. S. 158</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">188</a>, n. 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">34</a> (1978)
 (holding that NEPA cases are completely inapposite to the ESA context).  What the Court does not recognize, however, is that what it views as the basic principle of Public Citizen is stated too broadly and therefore inapplicable to this case.  Ante, at 20.


Our decision in Public Citizen turned on what we called a critical feature of the case: that the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) had no ability to countermand the Presidents lifting a moratorium that prohibited certain motor carriers from obtaining authority to operate within the United States.  541 U. S., at 766.  Once the President decided to lift that moratorium, and once the relevant vehicles had entered the United States, FMCSA was required by statute to register the vehicles if certain conditions were met.  Ibid. (Under FMCSAs entirely reasonable reading of this provision, it must certify any motor carrier that can show that it is willing and able to comply with the various substantive requirements for safety and financial responsibility contained in DOT regulations; only the moratorium prevented it from doing so for Mexican motor carriers before 2001 (emphasis deleted)).  Therefore, any potential NEPA concerns were generated by another decisionmaker, the President, and not the FMCSA.  Here, by contrast, EPA is not required to act ministerially once another person or agency has made a decision.  Instead, EPA must exercise its own judgment when considering the transfer of NPDES authority to a State; it also has its own authority to deny such a transfer.  Any effect on endangered species will be caused, even if indirectly, by the agencys own decision to transfer NPDES authority.  Cf. 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.02</a> (providing that the ESA will apply to all agency activities that directly or indirectly caus[e] modifications to the land, water, or air (emphasis added)).

On the other hand, shortly after the passage of the CWA, Congress enacted §7(a)(2) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA), which commands that federal agencies shall insure that their actions do not jeopardize endangered species.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#a_2" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(a)(2)</a>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    When faced with competing statutory mandates, it is our duty to give full effect to both if at all possible.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Morton</em> v. <em>Mancari</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/417/535" class="subref" title="subref">417 U. S. 535</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">551</a> (1974)
 ([W]hen two statutes are capable of co-existence, it is the duty of the courts, absent a clearly expressed congressional intention to the contrary, to regard each as effective).  The Court fails at this task.  Its opinion unsuccessfully tries to reconcile the CWA and ESA by relying on a federal regulation, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a> (2006), which it reads as limiting the reach of §7(a)(2) to <em>only</em> discretionary federal actions, see <em>ante</em>, at 1719.  Not only is this reading inconsistent with the text and history of §402.03, but it is fundamentally inconsistent with the ESA itself.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In the celebrated snail darter case, <em>TVA</em> v. <em>Hill</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/437/153" class="subref" title="subref">437 U. S. 153</a> (1978)
, we held that the ESA reveals a conscious decision by Congress to give endangered species priority over the primary missions of federal agencies, <em>id</em>., at 185.  Consistent with that intent, Chief Justice Burgers exceptionally thorough and admirable opinion explained that §7 admits of<em></em>no exception.<em>  Id</em>., at 173.  Creating precisely such an exception by exempting nondiscretionary federal actions from the ESAs coverage, the Court whittles away at Congress comprehensive effort to protect endangered species from the risk of extinction and fails to give the Act its intended effect.  After first giving <em>Hill</em> the attention it deserves, I will comment further on the irrelevance of §402.03 to these cases and offer other available ways to give effect to both CWA and the ESA.  Having done so, I conclude by explaining why these cases should be remanded to the EPA for further proceedings.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">I</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In <em>Hill, </em>we were presented with two separate questions: (1) whether the ESA required a court to enjoin the operation of the nearly completed Tellico Dam and Reservoir Project because the Secretary of the Interior had determined that its operation would eradicate a small endangered fish known as a snail darter; and (2) whether post-1973 congressional appropriations for the completion of the Tellico Dam constituted an implied repeal of the ESA, at least insofar as it applied to the Dam.  437 U. S., at 156.  More than 30 pages of our opinion explain our affirmative answer to the first question, see <em>id.,</em> at 156188, but just over four pages sufficed to explain our negative answer to the second, see <em>id</em>., at 189193.  While it is our ruling on the first question that is relevant to the cases before us, it is our refusal to hold that the ESA itself had been impliedly repealed that the majority strangely deems most significant.  See <em>ante, </em>at 2122.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In answering <em>Hill</em>s first question,<em></em>we did not discuss implied repeals.  On the contrary, that portion of the opinion contained our definitive interpretation of the ESA, in which we concluded that the language, history, and structure of the [ESA] indicates beyond doubt that Congress intended endangered species to be afforded the highest of priorities.  437 U. S., at 174; see also <em>id</em>., at 177 ( The dominant theme pervading all Congressional discussion of the proposed [ESA] was the overriding need <em>to devote whatever effort and resources were necessary</em> to avoid further diminution of national and worldwide wildlife resources  (quoting Coggins, Conserving Wildlife Resources: An Overview of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, 
51N. D. L. Rev.
315,
321 (1975) (emphasis added in <em>Hill</em>))).  With respect to §7 in particular, our opinion could not have been any clearer.  We plainly held that it admits of<em> no exception</em>.  437 U. S., at 173 (emphasis added).<a name="ZD-1ref" href="#ZD-1" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    Our opinion in <em>Hill </em>explained at length why §7 imposed obligations on all federal agencies to ensure that actions authorized, funded, or carried out by them do not jeopardize the continued existence of endangered species.  437 U. S., at 173 (emphasis deleted; internal quotation marks omitted).  Not a word in the opinion stated or suggested that §7 obligations are inapplicable to mandatory agency actions that would threaten the eradication of an endangered species.  Nor did the opinion describe the Tennessee Valley Authoritys (TVA) attempted completion of the Tellico Dam as a discretionary act.  How could it?  After all, if the Secretary of the Interior had not declared the snail darter an endangered species whose critical habitat would be destroyed by operation of the Tellico Dam, the TVA surely would have been obligated to spend the additional funds that Congress appropriated to complete the project.<a name="ZD-2ref" href="#ZD-2" class="">

            </a>  Unconcerned with whether an agency action was mandatory or discretionary, we simply held that §7 of the ESA</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> reveals an explicit congressional decision to require agencies to afford <em>first priority</em> to the declared national policy of saving endangered species.  The pointed omission of the type of qualifying language previously included in endangered species legislation reveals a conscious decision by Congress to give endangered species <em>priority over the </em><em>primary missions of federal agencies.</em>   <em>Id</em>., at 185 (emphasis added).<a name="ZD-3ref" href="#ZD-3" class="">

        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The fact that we also concluded that the post-1973 congressional appropriations did not impliedly repeal the ESA provides no support for the majoritys contention that the obligations imposed by §7(a)(2) may be limited to discretionary acts.  A few passages from the relevant parts of <em>Hill</em> belie that suggestion.  After noting the oddity of holding that the interest in protecting the survival of a relatively small number of 3-inch fish would require the permanent halting of a virtually completed dam for which Congress has expended more than $100 million, we found that the explicit provisions of the Endangered Species Act require precisely that result.  <em>Id.,</em> at 172, 173.  We then continued:</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> One would be hard pressed to find a statutory provision whose terms were any plainer than those in §7 of the Endangered Species Act.  Its very words affirmatively command all federal agencies to <em>insure </em>that actions <em>authorized, funded,</em> or <em>carried out </em>by them do not <em>jeopardize </em>the continued existence of an endangered species or <em>result </em>in the destruction or modification of habitat of such species … .   <em>Id</em>., at 173 (quoting 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536</a> (1976 ed.) (emphasis added in <em>Hill</em>)).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
We also reviewed the ESAs history to identify a variety of exceptions that had been included in earlier legislation and unenacted proposals but were omitted from the final version of the 1973 statute.  We explained that earlier endangered species legislation qualified the obligation of federal agencies, but the 1973 Act purposefully omitted all phrases which might have qualified an agencys responsibilities.  437 U. S., at 181, 182.  Moreover, after observing that the ESA creates only a limited number of hardship exemptions, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1539.html" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1539</a>none of which would apply to federal agencieswe applied the maxim <em>expressio unius est expression alterius</em> to conclude that there are no exemptions in the Endangered Species Act for federal agencies,437 U. S., at 188.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Today, however, the Court countenances such an exemption.  It erroneously concludes that the ESA contains an unmentioned exception for nondiscretionary agency action and that the statutes command to enjoin the completion of the Tellico Dam depended on the unmentioned fact that the TVA was attempting to perform a discretionary act.  But both the text of the ESA and our opinion in <em>Hill</em> compel the contrary determination that Congress intended the ESA to apply to all federal agencies and to all actions authorized, funded, or carried out by them.  <em>Id.,</em> at 173 (emphasis deleted).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    A transfer of NPDES permitting authority under §402(b) of the CWA is undoubtedly one of those actions that is authorized or carried out by a federal agency.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(b)</a>; 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.02</a> (defining action as all activities or programs of any kind authorized, funded, or carried out, in whole or in part, by Federal agencies in the United States or upon the high seas.  Examples include, but are not limited to . . . actions directly or indirectly causing modifications to the land, water, or air).  It follows from <em>Hill </em>that §7(a)(2) applies to such NPDES transferswhether they are mandatory or discretionary.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">II</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Given our unequivocal holding in <em>Hill</em> that the ESA has first priority over all other federal action, 437 U. S., at 185, if any statute should yield, it should be the CWA.  But no statute must yield unless it is truly incapable of coexistence.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Morton</em>, 417 U. S., at 551.  Therefore, assuming that §402(b) of the CWA contains its own mandatory command, we should first try to harmonize that provision with the mandatory requirements of §7(a)(2) of the ESA.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Courts solution is to rely on 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a>, which states that Section 7 and the requirements of this part apply to all actions in which there is discretionary Federal involvement or control.  The Court explains that this regulation harmonizes the statutes by giving effect to the ESAs no-jeopardy mandate whenever an agency has discretion to do so, but by lifting that mandate when the agency is forbidden from considering such extrastatutory factors.  <em>Ante</em>, at 17.  This is not harmony, and it certainly isnt effect.  Rather than giving genuine effect to §7(a)(2), the Court permits a wholesale limitation on the reach of the ESA.  Its interpretation of §402.03 conflicts with the text and history of the regulation, as well as our interpretation of §7 in the snail darter case.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    To begin with, the plain language of §402.03 does not state that its coverage is limited to discretionary actions.  Quite the opposite, the most natural reading of the text is that it confirms the broad construction of §7 endorsed by our opinion in <em>Hill</em>.  Indeed, the only way to read §402.03 in accordance with the facts of the case and our holding that §7 admits of no exception[s], 437 U. S., at 173, is that it eliminates any possible argument that the ESA does not extend to situations in which the discretionary federal involvement is only marginal.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court is simply mistaken when it says that it reads §402.03 to mean what it says: that §7(a)(2)s no-jeopardy duty covers <em>only</em> discretionary agency actions … .  <em>Ante,</em> at 21 (emphasis added).  That is not, in fact, what §402.03 says.  The word only is the Courts addition to the text, not the agencys.  Moreover, that text surely does not go on to say (as the Court does) that the duty does not attach to actions (like the NPDES permitting transfer authorization) that an agency is <em>required</em> by statute to undertake once certain specified triggering events have occurred. <em>Ibid.</em>  If the drafters of the regulation had intended such a far-reaching change in the law, surely they would have said so by using language similar to that which the Court uses today.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Nothing in the proceedings that led to the promulgation of the regulation suggests any reason for limiting the pre-existing understanding of the scope of §7s coverage.  EPA codified the current version of §402.03 in 1986 as part of a general redrafting of ESA regulations.  In the 1983 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the proposed version of §402.03 stated that §7 and the requirements of this Part apply to all actions in which there is Federal involvement or control.  
48Fed. Reg.
29999 (1983).  Without any explanation, the final rule inserted the word discretionary before Federal involvement or control.  
51Fed. Reg.
19958 (1986).<a name="ZD-4ref" href="#ZD-4" class="">

            </a>  Clearly, if the Secretary of the Interior meant to limit the pre-existing understanding of the scope of the coverage of §7(a)(2) by promulgating this regulation, that intent would have been mentioned somewhere in the text of the regulations or in contemporaneous comment about them.

 (We have frequently reiterated that an agency must cogently explain why it has exercised its discretion in a given manner).  Yet, the final rule said nothing about limiting the reach of §7 or our decision in <em>Hill.  </em>Nor did it mention the change from the notice of proposed rulemaking.  I can only assume, then, that the regulation does mean what both it and the notice of proposed rulemaking says: Section 7(a)(2) applies to discretionary federal action, but not <em>only</em> to discretionary action.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The only explanation the agency provided for §402.03 was the following:</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> This section, which explains the applicability of section 7, implicitly covers Federal activities within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States and upon the high seas as a result of the definition of action in §402.02.  The explanation for the scope of the term action is provided in the discussion under §402.01 above.  51 Fed. Reg. 19937.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
This statement directs us to two sources: the definition of action in §402.02 and the explanation for the scope of the term action  in §402.01.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Both confirm that there was no intent to draw a distinction between discretionary and nondiscretionary actions.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Section 402.02 provides in relevant part:</p>
        <p class="bodytext"><em>Action </em>means <em>all</em> activities or programs <em>of any kind</em> authorized, funded, or carried out, in whole or in part, by Federal agencies in the United States or upon the high seas.  Examples include, but are not limited to:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    (a)actions intended to conserve listed species or their habitat;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    (b)the promulgation of regulations . . .   (second and third emphases added.)</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
Actions in either of the described sub-categories are sometimes mandatory and sometimes discretionary.  Likewise, as the italicized portions indicate, the term action expressly refers to all agency activities or programs of any kind, regardless of whether they are discretionary or mandatory.  By reading the term discretionary as a limitation on action, the Court creates a contradiction in the EPAs own regulation.<a name="ZD-5ref" href="#ZD-5" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>5</b>

            </a>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    As for the final rules explanation for the scope of the term action in §402.01, that too is fully consistent with my interpretation of §402.03.  That explanation plainly states that <em>all</em> Federal actions including conservations programs are subject to the consultation requirements of section 7(a)(2) if they may affect listed species or their critical habitats.  51 Fed. Reg. 19929 (emphasis added).  The regulation does not say all discretionary federal actions, nor does it evince an intent to limit the scope of §7(a)(2) in any way.  Rather, it just restates that the ESA applies to all federal actions, just as the notice of proposed rulemaking did.  This explanation of the scope of the word action is therefore a strong indication that the Courts reading of discretionary is contrary to its intended meaning.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    An even stronger indication is the fact that at no point in the administrative proceedings in these cases did EPA even mention<em></em>it.<a name="ZD-6ref" href="#ZD-6" class="">

            </a>  As an initial matter, it is worth emphasizing that even if EPA had relied on §402.03, its interpretation of the ESA would not be entitled to deference under <em>Chevron U. S. A. Inc.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/467/837" class="subref" title="subref">467 U. S. 837</a> (1984)
, because it is not charged with administering that statute, <em>id</em>., at 844 (We have long recognized that considerable weight should be accorded to an executive departments construction of a statutory scheme <em>it is entrusted to administer</em>. (emphasis added)); <em>Department of Treasury</em> v. <em>FLRA</em>, 837 F. 2d 1163, 1167 (CADC 1988) ([W]hen an agency interprets a statute other than that which it has been entrusted to administer, its interpretation is not entitled to deference).  The Departments of the Interior and Commerce, not EPA, are charged with administering the ESA.  See <em>Babbitt </em>v. <em>Sweet Home Chapter, Communities for Great Ore.,</em> 515 U. S., 687, 703704 (1995).  And EPA has conceded that the Department of the Interiors biological opinion did not discuss 50 CFR. 402.03, and it did not address the question whether the consultation that produced the [biological opinion] was required by the ESA.  Pet. for Cert. in No. 06549, p. 24; see App. 77124 (never mentioning §402.03).  Left with this unfavorable administrative record, EPA can only lean on the fact that the Department of the Interior has recently clarified its position regarding §402.03 in a <em>different</em> administrative proceeding.  See Pet. for Cert. in No. 06549, pp. 2425; <em>id</em>., at 26 (The recent F[ish and Wildlife Service] and N[ational Marine Fisheries Service] communications regarding Alaskas pending transfer application reflect those agencies considered interpretations . . . of [50 CFR] 402.03); App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06340, pp. 103a116a; see also <em>ante</em>, at 12 n. 5.  We have long held, however, that courts may not affirm an agency action on grounds other than those adopted by the agency in the administrative proceedings.  See <em>SEC</em> v. <em>Chenery Corp.</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/318/80" class="subref" title="subref">318 U. S. 80</a>,

.  The majority ignores this hoary principle of administrative law and substitutes a post-hoc interpretation of §7(a)(2) and §402.03 for that of the relevant agency.  For that reason alone, these cases should be remanded to the agency.  And for the other reasons I have given, §402.03 cannot be used to harmonize the CWA and the ESA.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">III</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    There are at least two ways in which the CWA and the ESA can be given full effect without privileging one statute over the other.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">A</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The text of §7(a)(2) itself provides the first possible way of reconciling that provision with §402(b) of the CWA.   The subsection reads:</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> Each Federal agency shall, <em>in consultation with and with the assistance of the Secretary</em>, insure that any action authorized, funded, or carried out by such agency (hereinafter in this section referred to as an agency action) is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of habitat of such species which is determined by the Secretary, after consultation as appropriate with affected States, to be critical, unless such agency has been granted an exemption for such action by the Committee pursuant to subsection (h) of this section.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#a_2" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(a)(2)</a> (emphasis added).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court is certainly correct that the use of the word shall in §7(a)(2) imposes a mandatory requirement on the federal agencies.  See <em>ante</em>, at 14.  It is also correct that the ESAs mandate is to be carried out through consultation and may require the agency to adopt an alternative course of action.  <em>Ante,</em> at 15.  The Court is too quick to conclude, however, that this consultation requirement creates an irreconcilable conflict between this provision and §402(b) of the CWA.  It rushes to this flawed judgment because of a basic conceptual erroran error that is revealed as early as the first paragraph of its opinion.  Rather than attempting to find a way to give effect to §7(a)(2)s consultation requirement, the Court frames the question presented as whether §7(a)(2) effectively operates as a tenth criterion on which the transfer of permitting power under the first statute must be conditioned.   <em>Ante</em>, at 12.  The Court is not alone in this.  The author of the Ninth Circuit opinion below also stated that the ESA <em>adds</em> one requirement to the list of considerations under the Clean Water Act permitting transfer provision.  450 F. 3d, at 404 n. 2 (2006) (Berzon, J., concurring in denial of rehearing en banc) (emphasis in original).  But while the ESA does mandate that the relevant agencies consul[t] with the Interior Department, that consultation process also provides a way for the agencies to give effect to both statutes.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The first step in the statutory consultation process is to identify whether any endangered species will be affected by an agency action.  An agency proposing a particular action, such as an NPDES transfer, will typically ask the Secretary of the Interior whether any listed species may be present in the area of the proposed action and whether that action will affect those species.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#c" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(c)</a>.  It is entirely possible that no listed species will be affected, and any anticipated conflict between the ESA and another statute will have been avoided at this threshold stage.  If, however, the Secretary determines that a proposed action may affect an endangered species or its critical habitat, the agency must formally consult with the Secretary.  This consultation culminates in the issuance of a biological opinion, which detail[s] how the agency action affects the species or its critical habitat.  §1536(b)(3)(A); see also 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.14</a>(h).  Even at this stage, it is still possible that formal consultation will reveal that the agency action will not jeopardize any species.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 
63Fed. Reg.
51199 (1998) (noting that FWS rendered a no jeopardy finding with respect to the transfer of permitting authority to Texas).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    If the biological opinion concludes that the agency action would put a listed species in jeopardy, however, the ESA contains a process for resolving the competing demands of agency action and species protection.  The ESA provides that the Secretary shall suggest those reasonable and prudent alternatives which he believes would not violate subsection (a)(2) and can be taken by the Federal agency or applicant in implementing the agency action.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.14</a>(h)(3).  The agencys regulations define [r]easonable and prudent alternatives as</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> alternative actions identified during formal consultation that can be implemented in a manner consistent with the intended purpose of the action, that can be implemented consistent with the scope of the Federal agencys legal authority and jurisdiction, that is economically and technologically feasible, and that the Director [of FWS] believes would avoid the likelihood of jeopardizing the continued existence of listed species or resulting in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat.   
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.02</a>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
Thus, in the face of any conflict between the ESA and another federal statute, the ESA and its implementing regulations encourage federal agencies to work out a reasonable alternative that would let the proposed action move forward consistent with [its] intended purpose and the agencys legal authority, while also avoiding any violation of  §7(a)(2).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    When applied to the NPDES transfer program, the reasonable and prudent alternatives process would enable EPA and the Department of the Interior to develop a substitute that would allow a transfer of permitting authority <em>and</em> would not jeopardize endangered species.  Stated differently, the consultation process would generate an alternative course of action whereby the transfer could still take placeas required by §402(b) of the CWAbut in such a way that would honor the mandatory requirements of §7(a)(2) of the ESA.  This should come as no surprise to EPA, as it has engaged in pre-transfer consultations at least six times in the past and has stated that it is not barred from doing so by the CWA.<a name="ZD-7ref" href="#ZD-7" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    Finally, for the rare case in which no reasonable and prudent alternative can be found, Congress has provided yet another mechanism for resolving any conflicts between the ESA and a proposed agency action.  In 1978, shortly after our decision in <em>Hill</em>, Congress amended the ESA to create the Endangered Species Committee, which it authorized to grant exemptions from §7(a)(2).  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#e" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(e)</a>.  Because it has the authority to approve the extinction of an endangered species, the Endangered Species Committee is colloquially described as the God Squad or God Committee.  In light of this weighty responsibility, Congress carefully laid out requirements for the God Committees membership,<a name="ZD-8ref" href="#ZD-8" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    As the final arbiter in situations in which the ESA conflicts with a proposed agency action, the God Committee embodies the primacy of the ESAs mandate and serves as the final mechanism for harmonizing that Act with other federal statutes.  By creating this Committee, Congress recognized that some conflicts with the ESA may not be capable of resolution without having to forever sacrifice some endangered species.  At the same time, the creation of this last line of defense reflects Congress view that the ESA should not yield to another federal action except as a final resort and except when authorized by high level officials after serious consideration.  In short, when all else has failed and two federal statutes are incapable of resolution, Congress left the choice to the Committeenot to this Court; it did not limit the ESA in the way the majority does today.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">B</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    EPAs regulations offer a second way to harmonize the CWA with the ESA.  After EPA has transferred NPDES permitting authority to a State, the agency continues to oversee the States permitting program.  See <em>Arkansas</em> v. <em>Oklahoma</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/503/91" class="subref" title="subref">503 U. S. 91</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">105</a> (1992)
 (Congress preserved for the Administrator broad authority to oversee state permit programs).  If a state permit is outside the guidelines and the requirements of the CWA, EPA may object to it and block its issuance.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1342.html#d_2" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §1342(d)(2)</a>; 
66Fed. Reg.
11206 (2001).  Given these ongoing responsibilities, EPA has enacted a regulation that requires a State to enter into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) that sets forth the particulars of the agencys oversight duties.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/40/123" class="subref" title="subref">40 CFR §123.24</a>(a) (2006).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">The regulation governing MOAs contains several detailed requirements.  For instance, the regulation states that an MOA must contain [p]rovisions specifying classes and categories of permit applications, draft permits and proposed permits that the State will send to the [EPA] Regional Administrator for review, comment and, where applicable, objection, §123.24(b)(2); [p]rovisions specifying the frequency and content of reports, documents and other information which the State is required to submit to the EPA, §123.24(b)(3); and [p]rovisions for coordination of compliance monitoring activities by the State and by EPA, §123.24(b)(4)(i).  More generally, the regulation provides that an MOA may include other terms, conditions, or agreements that are relevant to the administration and enforcement of the States regulatory program.  §123.24(a).  Under the MOA regulation, furthermore, EPA will not approve any MOA that restricts its statutory oversight responsibility.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Like the §7(a)(2) consultation process described above, MOAs provide a potential mechanism for giving effect to §7 of the ESA while also allowing the transfer of permitting authority to a State.  It is important to remember that EPA must approve an MOA <em>prior to</em> the transfer of NPDES authority.  As such, EPA can useand in fact has usedthe MOA process to structure its later oversight in a way that will allow it to protect endangered species in accordance with §7(a)(2) of the ESA.  EPA might negotiate a provision in the MOA that would require a State to abide by the ESA requirements when issuing pollution permits.  See Brief for American Fisheries Society et al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 28. (In the Maine MOA, for example, EPA and the state agreed that state permits would protect ESA-listed species by ensuring compliance with state water quality standards).  Alternatively, EPA could require the state to provide copies of draft permits for discharges in particularly sensitive habitats such as those of ESA-listed species or for discharges that contain a pollutant that threatens ESA-listed wildlife.  <em>Id</em>., at 10.  Or the MOA might be drafted in a way that would allow the agency to object to state permits that would jeopardize any and all endangered species.  See<em> id</em>., at 28 (explaining that the Maine MOA includes a provision allowing EPA to object to any state permit that risks harm to a listed species by threatening water quality).  These are just three of many possibilities.  I need not identify other ways EPA could use the MOA process to comply with the ESA; it is enough to observe that MOAs provide a straightforward way to give the ESA its full effect without restricting §7(a)(2) in the way the Court does.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">IV</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    As discussed above, I believe that the Court incorrectly restricts the reach of §7(a)(2) to discretionary federal actions.  See Part II, <em>supra.</em>  Even if such a limitation were permissible, however, it is clear that EPAs authority to transfer permitting authority under §402(b) <em>is </em>discretionary.<a name="ZD-11ref" href="#ZD-11" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>11</b>

            </a>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The EPA Administrators authority to approve state permit programs pursuant to §402(b) of the CWA does not even fit within the Courts description of the category of mandatory actions that the Court holds are covered by the ESA.  In the Courts words, that category includes actions that an agency is <em>required </em>by statute to undertake once certain specified triggering events have occurred.  <em>Ante</em>, at 22.  The triggering event for EPAs approval is simply the filing of a satisfactory description of the States proposed program.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1342.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §1342(b)</a>.  The statute then commands that the EPA Administrator shall approve the submitted program unless he determines that state law does not satisfy nine specified conditions.  Those conditions are not triggering events; they are potential objections to the exercise of the Administrators authority.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    What is more, §402(b) is a perfect example of why our analysis should not end simply because a statute uses the word shall.  Instead, we must look more closely at its listed criteria to determine whether they allow for discretion, despite the use of shall.  After all, as then-Justice Rehnquists dissenting opinion in the snail darter case explains, a federal statute using the word shall will sometimes allow room for discretion.  See <em>Hill</em>, 437 U. S. at 211212 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).<a name="ZD-12ref" href="#ZD-12" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>12</b>
                </sup>
            </a>  In these cases, there is significant room for discretion in EPAs evaluation of §402(b)s nine conditions.  The first criterion, for example, requires the EPA Administrator to examine five other statutes and ensure that the State has adequate authority to comply with each.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1342.html#b_1_A" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §1342(b)(1)(A)</a>.  One of those five statutes, in turn, expressly directs the Administrator to exercise his judgment.  §1312.  Even the Court acknowledges that EPA must exercise some judgment in determining whether a State has demonstrated that it has the authority to carry out §402(b)s enumerated statutory criteria.  <em>Ante</em>, at 24.  However, in the very same breath, the Court states that the dispositive fact is that the statute clearly does not grant it the discretion to add another entirely separate prerequisite to that list.  <em>Ibid</em>.  This reasoning flouts the Courts own logic.  Under the Courts reading of §402.03, §7(a)(2) applies to discretionary federal actions of any kind.  The Court plainly acknowledges that EPA exercises discretion when deciding whether to transfer permitting authority to a State.  If we are to take the Courts approach seriously, once <em>any</em> discretion has been identifiedas it has here§7(a)(2) must apply.<a name="ZD-13ref" href="#ZD-13" class="">

            </a>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The MOA regulation described in Part IIIB, <em>supra,</em> also demonstrates that an NPDES transfer is not as ministerial a task as the Court would suggest.  The agency retains significant discretion under §123.24 over the content of an MOA, which of course must be approved prior to a transfer. For instance, EPA may require a State to file reports on a weekly basis or a monthly basis.  It may require a State to submit only certain classes and categories of permit applications.  And it may include any additional terms and conditions that are relevant to the enforcement of the NPDES program.  There is ample room for judgment in all of these areas, and EPA has exercised such judgment in the past when approving MOAs from many States.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Approval of Application by Maine to Administer the NPDES Program, 66 Fed. Reg. 12791, (2001); Approval of Application by Maine to Administer the NPDES Program; Texas, 
63Fed. Reg.
51165 (1998).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In fact, in an earlier case raising a question similar to this one, see <em>American Forest &amp; Paper Assn.</em> v. <em>EPA</em>, 137 F. 3d 291, 298299 (CA5 1998), EPA itself explained how 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/40/123" class="subref" title="subref">40 CFR §123.24</a> gives it discretion over the approval of a State pollution control program, see Brief for EPA in No. 9660874 (CA5).  Arguing that [i]ndicia of discretionary involvement or control abound in [its] regulations, the agency listed its MOA regulation as a prime example.<a name="ZD-14ref" href="#ZD-14" class="">

                </sup>
            </a>  Again, because EPAs approval of a State application to administer an NPDES program entails significantindeed, aboundingdiscretion, I would find that §7(a)(2) of the ESA applies even under the Courts own flawed theory of these cases.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    Mindful that judges must always remain faithful to the intent of the legislature, Chief Justice Burger closed his opinion in the snail darter case with a reminder that [o]nce the meaning of an enactment is discerned and its constitutionality determined, the judicial process comes to an end.  <em>Hill</em>, 437 U. S., at 194.  This Court offered a definitive interpretation of the Endangered Species Act nearly 30 years ago in that very case.  Today the Court turns its back on our decision in <em>Hill</em> and places a great number of endangered species in jeopardy, including the cactus ferruginous pygmy-owl and Pima pineapple cactus at issue here.  At the risk of plagiarizing Chief Justice Burgers fine opinion, I think it is appropriate to end my opinion just as he didwith a quotation attributed to Sir Thomas More that has as much relevance today as it did three decades ago.  This quotation illustrates not only the fundamental character of the rule of law embodied in §7 of the ESA but also the pernicious consequences of official disobedience of such a rule.  Repetition of that literary allusion is especially appropriate today:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">The law, Roper, the law.  I know whats legal, not whats right.  And Ill stick to whats legal. . . . Im <em>not</em> God.

Cut a great road through the law to get after the Devil? . . . And when the last law was down, and the Devil turned round on youwhere would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat? . . .

        <p class="bodytext">    Although its reasons have shifted over time, at both the administrative level and in the federal courts, EPA has insisted that the requirements of §7(a)(2) of the ESA do not apply to its decision to transfer permitting authority under §402(b) of the CWA.  See App. 114; Brief for Petitioner EPA 16, 42.  As I have explained above, that conclusion is contrary to the text of §7(a)(2), our decision in the <em>TVA</em> v. <em>Hill</em>, and the regulation on which the agency has since relied and upon which the Court relies on today.  Accordingly, I would hold that EPAs decision was arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act, see

But Hill said no such thing.  That case only held that the subsequent appropriation of funds for the Tellico Dam Project could not overcome the mandatory requirements of §7 of the ESA; it did not hold that the TVA would not have been required to spend any and all appropriated funds if the ESA had never been passed.  See Hill, 437 U. S., at 189190.

,that an agency cannot be considered the legal cause of an action that it has no statutory discretion not to takesupports its reliance on §402.03.  Ante, at 20.  First of all, the Court itself recognizes that it must distance itself from that case, ibid., because Public Citizen dealt with a procedural requirement under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), not a substantive requirement like that imposed by §7(a)(2) of the ESA, see TVA v. Hill,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">34</a> (1978)
 (holding that NEPA cases are completely inapposite to the ESA context).  What the Court does not recognize, however, is that what it views as the basic principle of Public Citizen is stated too broadly and therefore inapplicable to this case.  Ante, at 20.


Our decision in Public Citizen turned on what we called a critical feature of the case: that the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) had no ability to countermand the Presidents lifting a moratorium that prohibited certain motor carriers from obtaining authority to operate within the United States.  541 U. S., at 766.  Once the President decided to lift that moratorium, and once the relevant vehicles had entered the United States, FMCSA was required by statute to register the vehicles if certain conditions were met.  Ibid. (Under FMCSAs entirely reasonable reading of this provision, it must certify any motor carrier that can show that it is willing and able to comply with the various substantive requirements for safety and financial responsibility contained in DOT regulations; only the moratorium prevented it from doing so for Mexican motor carriers before 2001 (emphasis deleted)).  Therefore, any potential NEPA concerns were generated by another decisionmaker, the President, and not the FMCSA.  Here, by contrast, EPA is not required to act ministerially once another person or agency has made a decision.  Instead, EPA must exercise its own judgment when considering the transfer of NPDES authority to a State; it also has its own authority to deny such a transfer.  Any effect on endangered species will be caused, even if indirectly, by the agencys own decision to transfer NPDES authority.  Cf.

        <p class="bodytext">    These cases present a problem of conflicting shalls.  On the one hand, §402(b) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) provides that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) shall approve a States application to administer a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permitting program unless it determines that nine criteria are not satisfied.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1342.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §1342(b)</a>.  On the other hand, shortly after the passage of the CWA, Congress enacted §7(a)(2) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA), which commands that federal agencies shall insure that their actions do not jeopardize endangered species.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#a_2" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(a)(2)</a>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    When faced with competing statutory mandates, it is our duty to give full effect to both if at all possible.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Morton</em> v. <em>Mancari</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/417/535" class="subref" title="subref">417 U. S. 535</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">551</a> (1974)
 ([W]hen two statutes are capable of co-existence, it is the duty of the courts, absent a clearly expressed congressional intention to the contrary, to regard each as effective).  The Court fails at this task.  Its opinion unsuccessfully tries to reconcile the CWA and ESA by relying on a federal regulation, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a> (2006), which it reads as limiting the reach of §7(a)(2) to <em>only</em> discretionary federal actions, see <em>ante</em>, at 1719.  Not only is this reading inconsistent with the text and history of §402.03, but it is fundamentally inconsistent with the ESA itself.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In the celebrated snail darter case, <em>TVA</em> v. <em>Hill</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/437/153" class="subref" title="subref">437 U. S. 153</a> (1978)
, we held that the ESA reveals a conscious decision by Congress to give endangered species priority over the primary missions of federal agencies, <em>id</em>., at 185.  Consistent with that intent, Chief Justice Burgers exceptionally thorough and admirable opinion explained that §7 admits of<em></em>no exception.<em>  Id</em>., at 173.  Creating precisely such an exception by exempting nondiscretionary federal actions from the ESAs coverage, the Court whittles away at Congress comprehensive effort to protect endangered species from the risk of extinction and fails to give the Act its intended effect.  After first giving <em>Hill</em> the attention it deserves, I will comment further on the irrelevance of §402.03 to these cases and offer other available ways to give effect to both CWA and the ESA.  Having done so, I conclude by explaining why these cases should be remanded to the EPA for further proceedings.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">I</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In <em>Hill, </em>we were presented with two separate questions: (1) whether the ESA required a court to enjoin the operation of the nearly completed Tellico Dam and Reservoir Project because the Secretary of the Interior had determined that its operation would eradicate a small endangered fish known as a snail darter; and (2) whether post-1973 congressional appropriations for the completion of the Tellico Dam constituted an implied repeal of the ESA, at least insofar as it applied to the Dam.  437 U. S., at 156.  More than 30 pages of our opinion explain our affirmative answer to the first question, see <em>id.,</em> at 156188, but just over four pages sufficed to explain our negative answer to the second, see <em>id</em>., at 189193.  While it is our ruling on the first question that is relevant to the cases before us, it is our refusal to hold that the ESA itself had been impliedly repealed that the majority strangely deems most significant.  See <em>ante, </em>at 2122.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In answering <em>Hill</em>s first question,<em></em>we did not discuss implied repeals.  On the contrary, that portion of the opinion contained our definitive interpretation of the ESA, in which we concluded that the language, history, and structure of the [ESA] indicates beyond doubt that Congress intended endangered species to be afforded the highest of priorities.  437 U. S., at 174; see also <em>id</em>., at 177 ( The dominant theme pervading all Congressional discussion of the proposed [ESA] was the overriding need <em>to devote whatever effort and resources were necessary</em> to avoid further diminution of national and worldwide wildlife resources  (quoting Coggins, Conserving Wildlife Resources: An Overview of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, 
51N. D. L. Rev.
315,
321 (1975) (emphasis added in <em>Hill</em>))).  With respect to §7 in particular, our opinion could not have been any clearer.  We plainly held that it admits of<em> no exception</em>.  437 U. S., at 173 (emphasis added).<a name="ZD-1ref" href="#ZD-1" class="">

        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Our opinion in <em>Hill </em>explained at length why §7 imposed obligations on all federal agencies to ensure that actions authorized, funded, or carried out by them do not jeopardize the continued existence of endangered species.  437 U. S., at 173 (emphasis deleted; internal quotation marks omitted).  Not a word in the opinion stated or suggested that §7 obligations are inapplicable to mandatory agency actions that would threaten the eradication of an endangered species.  Nor did the opinion describe the Tennessee Valley Authoritys (TVA) attempted completion of the Tellico Dam as a discretionary act.  How could it?  After all, if the Secretary of the Interior had not declared the snail darter an endangered species whose critical habitat would be destroyed by operation of the Tellico Dam, the TVA surely would have been obligated to spend the additional funds that Congress appropriated to complete the project.<a name="ZD-2ref" href="#ZD-2" class="">

                </sup>
            </a>  Unconcerned with whether an agency action was mandatory or discretionary, we simply held that §7 of the ESA</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> reveals an explicit congressional decision to require agencies to afford <em>first priority</em> to the declared national policy of saving endangered species.  The pointed omission of the type of qualifying language previously included in endangered species legislation reveals a conscious decision by Congress to give endangered species <em>priority over the </em><em>primary missions of federal agencies.</em>   <em>Id</em>., at 185 (emphasis added).<a name="ZD-3ref" href="#ZD-3" class="">

            </a>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The fact that we also concluded that the post-1973 congressional appropriations did not impliedly repeal the ESA provides no support for the majoritys contention that the obligations imposed by §7(a)(2) may be limited to discretionary acts.  A few passages from the relevant parts of <em>Hill</em> belie that suggestion.  After noting the oddity of holding that the interest in protecting the survival of a relatively small number of 3-inch fish would require the permanent halting of a virtually completed dam for which Congress has expended more than $100 million, we found that the explicit provisions of the Endangered Species Act require precisely that result.  <em>Id.,</em> at 172, 173.  We then continued:</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> One would be hard pressed to find a statutory provision whose terms were any plainer than those in §7 of the Endangered Species Act.  Its very words affirmatively command all federal agencies to <em>insure </em>that actions <em>authorized, funded,</em> or <em>carried out </em>by them do not <em>jeopardize </em>the continued existence of an endangered species or <em>result </em>in the destruction or modification of habitat of such species … .   <em>Id</em>., at 173 (quoting 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536</a> (1976 ed.) (emphasis added in <em>Hill</em>)).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
We also reviewed the ESAs history to identify a variety of exceptions that had been included in earlier legislation and unenacted proposals but were omitted from the final version of the 1973 statute.  We explained that earlier endangered species legislation qualified the obligation of federal agencies, but the 1973 Act purposefully omitted all phrases which might have qualified an agencys responsibilities.  437 U. S., at 181, 182.  Moreover, after observing that the ESA creates only a limited number of hardship exemptions, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1539.html" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1539</a>none of which would apply to federal agencieswe applied the maxim <em>expressio unius est expression alterius</em> to conclude that there are no exemptions in the Endangered Species Act for federal agencies,437 U. S., at 188.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Today, however, the Court countenances such an exemption.  It erroneously concludes that the ESA contains an unmentioned exception for nondiscretionary agency action and that the statutes command to enjoin the completion of the Tellico Dam depended on the unmentioned fact that the TVA was attempting to perform a discretionary act.  But both the text of the ESA and our opinion in <em>Hill</em> compel the contrary determination that Congress intended the ESA to apply to all federal agencies and to all actions authorized, funded, or carried out by them.  <em>Id.,</em> at 173 (emphasis deleted).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    A transfer of NPDES permitting authority under §402(b) of the CWA is undoubtedly one of those actions that is authorized or carried out by a federal agency.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(b)</a>; 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.02</a> (defining action as all activities or programs of any kind authorized, funded, or carried out, in whole or in part, by Federal agencies in the United States or upon the high seas.  Examples include, but are not limited to . . . actions directly or indirectly causing modifications to the land, water, or air).  It follows from <em>Hill </em>that §7(a)(2) applies to such NPDES transferswhether they are mandatory or discretionary.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">II</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Given our unequivocal holding in <em>Hill</em> that the ESA has first priority over all other federal action, 437 U. S., at 185, if any statute should yield, it should be the CWA.  But no statute must yield unless it is truly incapable of coexistence.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Morton</em>, 417 U. S., at 551.  Therefore, assuming that §402(b) of the CWA contains its own mandatory command, we should first try to harmonize that provision with the mandatory requirements of §7(a)(2) of the ESA.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Courts solution is to rely on 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a>, which states that Section 7 and the requirements of this part apply to all actions in which there is discretionary Federal involvement or control.  The Court explains that this regulation harmonizes the statutes by giving effect to the ESAs no-jeopardy mandate whenever an agency has discretion to do so, but by lifting that mandate when the agency is forbidden from considering such extrastatutory factors.  <em>Ante</em>, at 17.  This is not harmony, and it certainly isnt effect.  Rather than giving genuine effect to §7(a)(2), the Court permits a wholesale limitation on the reach of the ESA.  Its interpretation of §402.03 conflicts with the text and history of the regulation, as well as our interpretation of §7 in the snail darter case.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    To begin with, the plain language of §402.03 does not state that its coverage is limited to discretionary actions.  Quite the opposite, the most natural reading of the text is that it confirms the broad construction of §7 endorsed by our opinion in <em>Hill</em>.  Indeed, the only way to read §402.03 in accordance with the facts of the case and our holding that §7 admits of no exception[s], 437 U. S., at 173, is that it eliminates any possible argument that the ESA does not extend to situations in which the discretionary federal involvement is only marginal.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court is simply mistaken when it says that it reads §402.03 to mean what it says: that §7(a)(2)s no-jeopardy duty covers <em>only</em> discretionary agency actions … .  <em>Ante,</em> at 21 (emphasis added).  That is not, in fact, what §402.03 says.  The word only is the Courts addition to the text, not the agencys.  Moreover, that text surely does not go on to say (as the Court does) that the duty does not attach to actions (like the NPDES permitting transfer authorization) that an agency is <em>required</em> by statute to undertake once certain specified triggering events have occurred. <em>Ibid.</em>  If the drafters of the regulation had intended such a far-reaching change in the law, surely they would have said so by using language similar to that which the Court uses today.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Nothing in the proceedings that led to the promulgation of the regulation suggests any reason for limiting the pre-existing understanding of the scope of §7s coverage.  EPA codified the current version of §402.03 in 1986 as part of a general redrafting of ESA regulations.  In the 1983 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the proposed version of §402.03 stated that §7 and the requirements of this Part apply to all actions in which there is Federal involvement or control.  
48Fed. Reg.
29999 (1983).  Without any explanation, the final rule inserted the word discretionary before Federal involvement or control.  
51Fed. Reg.

            </a>  Clearly, if the Secretary of the Interior meant to limit the pre-existing understanding of the scope of the coverage of §7(a)(2) by promulgating this regulation, that intent would have been mentioned somewhere in the text of the regulations or in contemporaneous comment about them.  See <em>National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assn.</em> v. <em>Brand X Internet Services</em>,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">48</a> (1983)
 (We have frequently reiterated that an agency must cogently explain why it has exercised its discretion in a given manner).  Yet, the final rule said nothing about limiting the reach of §7 or our decision in <em>Hill.  </em>Nor did it mention the change from the notice of proposed rulemaking.  I can only assume, then, that the regulation does mean what both it and the notice of proposed rulemaking says: Section 7(a)(2) applies to discretionary federal action, but not <em>only</em> to discretionary action.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The only explanation the agency provided for §402.03 was the following:</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> This section, which explains the applicability of section 7, implicitly covers Federal activities within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States and upon the high seas as a result of the definition of action in §402.02.  The explanation for the scope of the term action is provided in the discussion under §402.01 above.  51 Fed. Reg. 19937.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
This statement directs us to two sources: the definition of action in §402.02 and the explanation for the scope of the term action  in §402.01.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Both confirm that there was no intent to draw a distinction between discretionary and nondiscretionary actions.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Section 402.02 provides in relevant part:</p>
        <p class="bodytext"><em>Action </em>means <em>all</em> activities or programs <em>of any kind</em> authorized, funded, or carried out, in whole or in part, by Federal agencies in the United States or upon the high seas.  Examples include, but are not limited to:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    (a)actions intended to conserve listed species or their habitat;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    (b)the promulgation of regulations . . .   (second and third emphases added.)</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
Actions in either of the described sub-categories are sometimes mandatory and sometimes discretionary.  Likewise, as the italicized portions indicate, the term action expressly refers to all agency activities or programs of any kind, regardless of whether they are discretionary or mandatory.  By reading the term discretionary as a limitation on action, the Court creates a contradiction in the EPAs own regulation.<a name="ZD-5ref" href="#ZD-5" class="">

        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    As for the final rules explanation for the scope of the term action in §402.01, that too is fully consistent with my interpretation of §402.03.  That explanation plainly states that <em>all</em> Federal actions including conservations programs are subject to the consultation requirements of section 7(a)(2) if they may affect listed species or their critical habitats.  51 Fed. Reg. 19929 (emphasis added).  The regulation does not say all discretionary federal actions, nor does it evince an intent to limit the scope of §7(a)(2) in any way.  Rather, it just restates that the ESA applies to all federal actions, just as the notice of proposed rulemaking did.  This explanation of the scope of the word action is therefore a strong indication that the Courts reading of discretionary is contrary to its intended meaning.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    An even stronger indication is the fact that at no point in the administrative proceedings in these cases did EPA even mention<em></em>it.<a name="ZD-6ref" href="#ZD-6" class="">

            </a>  As an initial matter, it is worth emphasizing that even if EPA had relied on §402.03, its interpretation of the ESA would not be entitled to deference under <em>Chevron U. S. A. Inc.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/467/837" class="subref" title="subref">467 U. S. 837</a> (1984)
, because it is not charged with administering that statute, <em>id</em>., at 844 (We have long recognized that considerable weight should be accorded to an executive departments construction of a statutory scheme <em>it is entrusted to administer</em>. (emphasis added)); <em>Department of Treasury</em> v. <em>FLRA</em>, 837 F. 2d 1163, 1167 (CADC 1988) ([W]hen an agency interprets a statute other than that which it has been entrusted to administer, its interpretation is not entitled to deference).  The Departments of the Interior and Commerce, not EPA, are charged with administering the ESA.  See <em>Babbitt </em>v. <em>Sweet Home Chapter, Communities for Great Ore.,</em> 515 U. S., 687, 703704 (1995).  And EPA has conceded that the Department of the Interiors biological opinion did not discuss 50 CFR. 402.03, and it did not address the question whether the consultation that produced the [biological opinion] was required by the ESA.  Pet. for Cert. in No. 06549, p. 24; see App. 77124 (never mentioning §402.03).  Left with this unfavorable administrative record, EPA can only lean on the fact that the Department of the Interior has recently clarified its position regarding §402.03 in a <em>different</em> administrative proceeding.  See Pet. for Cert. in No. 06549, pp. 2425; <em>id</em>., at 26 (The recent F[ish and Wildlife Service] and N[ational Marine Fisheries Service] communications regarding Alaskas pending transfer application reflect those agencies considered interpretations . . . of [50 CFR] 402.03); App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06340, pp. 103a116a; see also <em>ante</em>, at 12 n. 5.  We have long held, however, that courts may not affirm an agency action on grounds other than those adopted by the agency in the administrative proceedings.  See <em>SEC</em> v. <em>Chenery Corp.</em>,

.  The majority ignores this hoary principle of administrative law and substitutes a post-hoc interpretation of §7(a)(2) and §402.03 for that of the relevant agency.  For that reason alone, these cases should be remanded to the agency.  And for the other reasons I have given, §402.03 cannot be used to harmonize the CWA and the ESA.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">III</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    There are at least two ways in which the CWA and the ESA can be given full effect without privileging one statute over the other.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">A</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The text of §7(a)(2) itself provides the first possible way of reconciling that provision with §402(b) of the CWA.   The subsection reads:</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> Each Federal agency shall, <em>in consultation with and with the assistance of the Secretary</em>, insure that any action authorized, funded, or carried out by such agency (hereinafter in this section referred to as an agency action) is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of habitat of such species which is determined by the Secretary, after consultation as appropriate with affected States, to be critical, unless such agency has been granted an exemption for such action by the Committee pursuant to subsection (h) of this section.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#a_2" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(a)(2)</a> (emphasis added).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court is certainly correct that the use of the word shall in §7(a)(2) imposes a mandatory requirement on the federal agencies.  See <em>ante</em>, at 14.  It is also correct that the ESAs mandate is to be carried out through consultation and may require the agency to adopt an alternative course of action.  <em>Ante,</em> at 15.  The Court is too quick to conclude, however, that this consultation requirement creates an irreconcilable conflict between this provision and §402(b) of the CWA.  It rushes to this flawed judgment because of a basic conceptual erroran error that is revealed as early as the first paragraph of its opinion.  Rather than attempting to find a way to give effect to §7(a)(2)s consultation requirement, the Court frames the question presented as whether §7(a)(2) effectively operates as a tenth criterion on which the transfer of permitting power under the first statute must be conditioned.   <em>Ante</em>, at 12.  The Court is not alone in this.  The author of the Ninth Circuit opinion below also stated that the ESA <em>adds</em> one requirement to the list of considerations under the Clean Water Act permitting transfer provision.  450 F. 3d, at 404 n. 2 (2006) (Berzon, J., concurring in denial of rehearing en banc) (emphasis in original).  But while the ESA does mandate that the relevant agencies consul[t] with the Interior Department, that consultation process also provides a way for the agencies to give effect to both statutes.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The first step in the statutory consultation process is to identify whether any endangered species will be affected by an agency action.  An agency proposing a particular action, such as an NPDES transfer, will typically ask the Secretary of the Interior whether any listed species may be present in the area of the proposed action and whether that action will affect those species.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#c" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(c)</a>.  It is entirely possible that no listed species will be affected, and any anticipated conflict between the ESA and another statute will have been avoided at this threshold stage.  If, however, the Secretary determines that a proposed action may affect an endangered species or its critical habitat, the agency must formally consult with the Secretary.  This consultation culminates in the issuance of a biological opinion, which detail[s] how the agency action affects the species or its critical habitat.  §1536(b)(3)(A); see also 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.14</a>(h).  Even at this stage, it is still possible that formal consultation will reveal that the agency action will not jeopardize any species.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 
63Fed. Reg.
51199 (1998) (noting that FWS rendered a no jeopardy finding with respect to the transfer of permitting authority to Texas).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    If the biological opinion concludes that the agency action would put a listed species in jeopardy, however, the ESA contains a process for resolving the competing demands of agency action and species protection.  The ESA provides that the Secretary shall suggest those reasonable and prudent alternatives which he believes would not violate subsection (a)(2) and can be taken by the Federal agency or applicant in implementing the agency action.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#b_3_A" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(b)(3)(A)</a>; see also 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.14</a>(h)(3).  The agencys regulations define [r]easonable and prudent alternatives as</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> alternative actions identified during formal consultation that can be implemented in a manner consistent with the intended purpose of the action, that can be implemented consistent with the scope of the Federal agencys legal authority and jurisdiction, that is economically and technologically feasible, and that the Director [of FWS] believes would avoid the likelihood of jeopardizing the continued existence of listed species or resulting in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat.   
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.02</a>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
Thus, in the face of any conflict between the ESA and another federal statute, the ESA and its implementing regulations encourage federal agencies to work out a reasonable alternative that would let the proposed action move forward consistent with [its] intended purpose and the agencys legal authority, while also avoiding any violation of  §7(a)(2).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    When applied to the NPDES transfer program, the reasonable and prudent alternatives process would enable EPA and the Department of the Interior to develop a substitute that would allow a transfer of permitting authority <em>and</em> would not jeopardize endangered species.  Stated differently, the consultation process would generate an alternative course of action whereby the transfer could still take placeas required by §402(b) of the CWAbut in such a way that would honor the mandatory requirements of §7(a)(2) of the ESA.  This should come as no surprise to EPA, as it has engaged in pre-transfer consultations at least six times in the past and has stated that it is not barred from doing so by the CWA.<a name="ZD-7ref" href="#ZD-7" class="">

        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Finally, for the rare case in which no reasonable and prudent alternative can be found, Congress has provided yet another mechanism for resolving any conflicts between the ESA and a proposed agency action.  In 1978, shortly after our decision in <em>Hill</em>, Congress amended the ESA to create the Endangered Species Committee, which it authorized to grant exemptions from §7(a)(2).  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#e" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(e)</a>.  Because it has the authority to approve the extinction of an endangered species, the Endangered Species Committee is colloquially described as the God Squad or God Committee.  In light of this weighty responsibility, Congress carefully laid out requirements for the God Committees membership,<a name="ZD-8ref" href="#ZD-8" class="">

            </a> and the factors it must consider in deciding whether to grant an exemption.<a name="ZD-10ref" href="#ZD-10" class="">

                    <b>10</b>

            </a>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    As the final arbiter in situations in which the ESA conflicts with a proposed agency action, the God Committee embodies the primacy of the ESAs mandate and serves as the final mechanism for harmonizing that Act with other federal statutes.  By creating this Committee, Congress recognized that some conflicts with the ESA may not be capable of resolution without having to forever sacrifice some endangered species.  At the same time, the creation of this last line of defense reflects Congress view that the ESA should not yield to another federal action except as a final resort and except when authorized by high level officials after serious consideration.  In short, when all else has failed and two federal statutes are incapable of resolution, Congress left the choice to the Committeenot to this Court; it did not limit the ESA in the way the majority does today.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">B</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    EPAs regulations offer a second way to harmonize the CWA with the ESA.  After EPA has transferred NPDES permitting authority to a State, the agency continues to oversee the States permitting program.  See <em>Arkansas</em> v. <em>Oklahoma</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/503/91" class="subref" title="subref">503 U. S. 91</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">105</a> (1992)
 (Congress preserved for the Administrator broad authority to oversee state permit programs).  If a state permit is outside the guidelines and the requirements of the CWA, EPA may object to it and block its issuance.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1342.html#d_2" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §1342(d)(2)</a>; 
66Fed. Reg.
11206 (2001).  Given these ongoing responsibilities, EPA has enacted a regulation that requires a State to enter into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) that sets forth the particulars of the agencys oversight duties.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/40/123" class="subref" title="subref">40 CFR §123.24</a>(a) (2006).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">The regulation governing MOAs contains several detailed requirements.  For instance, the regulation states that an MOA must contain [p]rovisions specifying classes and categories of permit applications, draft permits and proposed permits that the State will send to the [EPA] Regional Administrator for review, comment and, where applicable, objection, §123.24(b)(2); [p]rovisions specifying the frequency and content of reports, documents and other information which the State is required to submit to the EPA, §123.24(b)(3); and [p]rovisions for coordination of compliance monitoring activities by the State and by EPA, §123.24(b)(4)(i).  More generally, the regulation provides that an MOA may include other terms, conditions, or agreements that are relevant to the administration and enforcement of the States regulatory program.  §123.24(a).  Under the MOA regulation, furthermore, EPA will not approve any MOA that restricts its statutory oversight responsibility.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Like the §7(a)(2) consultation process described above, MOAs provide a potential mechanism for giving effect to §7 of the ESA while also allowing the transfer of permitting authority to a State.  It is important to remember that EPA must approve an MOA <em>prior to</em> the transfer of NPDES authority.  As such, EPA can useand in fact has usedthe MOA process to structure its later oversight in a way that will allow it to protect endangered species in accordance with §7(a)(2) of the ESA.  EPA might negotiate a provision in the MOA that would require a State to abide by the ESA requirements when issuing pollution permits.  See Brief for American Fisheries Society et al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 28. (In the Maine MOA, for example, EPA and the state agreed that state permits would protect ESA-listed species by ensuring compliance with state water quality standards).  Alternatively, EPA could require the state to provide copies of draft permits for discharges in particularly sensitive habitats such as those of ESA-listed species or for discharges that contain a pollutant that threatens ESA-listed wildlife.  <em>Id</em>., at 10.  Or the MOA might be drafted in a way that would allow the agency to object to state permits that would jeopardize any and all endangered species.  See<em> id</em>., at 28 (explaining that the Maine MOA includes a provision allowing EPA to object to any state permit that risks harm to a listed species by threatening water quality).  These are just three of many possibilities.  I need not identify other ways EPA could use the MOA process to comply with the ESA; it is enough to observe that MOAs provide a straightforward way to give the ESA its full effect without restricting §7(a)(2) in the way the Court does.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">IV</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    As discussed above, I believe that the Court incorrectly restricts the reach of §7(a)(2) to discretionary federal actions.  See Part II, <em>supra.</em>  Even if such a limitation were permissible, however, it is clear that EPAs authority to transfer permitting authority under §402(b) <em>is </em>discretionary.<a name="ZD-11ref" href="#ZD-11" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>11</b>

            </a>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The EPA Administrators authority to approve state permit programs pursuant to §402(b) of the CWA does not even fit within the Courts description of the category of mandatory actions that the Court holds are covered by the ESA.  In the Courts words, that category includes actions that an agency is <em>required </em>by statute to undertake once certain specified triggering events have occurred.  <em>Ante</em>, at 22.  The triggering event for EPAs approval is simply the filing of a satisfactory description of the States proposed program.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1342.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §1342(b)</a>.  The statute then commands that the EPA Administrator shall approve the submitted program unless he determines that state law does not satisfy nine specified conditions.  Those conditions are not triggering events; they are potential objections to the exercise of the Administrators authority.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    What is more, §402(b) is a perfect example of why our analysis should not end simply because a statute uses the word shall.  Instead, we must look more closely at its listed criteria to determine whether they allow for discretion, despite the use of shall.  After all, as then-Justice Rehnquists dissenting opinion in the snail darter case explains, a federal statute using the word shall will sometimes allow room for discretion.  See <em>Hill</em>, 437 U. S. at 211212 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).<a name="ZD-12ref" href="#ZD-12" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>12</b>
                </sup>
            </a>  In these cases, there is significant room for discretion in EPAs evaluation of §402(b)s nine conditions.  The first criterion, for example, requires the EPA Administrator to examine five other statutes and ensure that the State has adequate authority to comply with each.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1342.html#b_1_A" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §1342(b)(1)(A)</a>.  One of those five statutes, in turn, expressly directs the Administrator to exercise his judgment.  §1312.  Even the Court acknowledges that EPA must exercise some judgment in determining whether a State has demonstrated that it has the authority to carry out §402(b)s enumerated statutory criteria.  <em>Ante</em>, at 24.  However, in the very same breath, the Court states that the dispositive fact is that the statute clearly does not grant it the discretion to add another entirely separate prerequisite to that list.  <em>Ibid</em>.  This reasoning flouts the Courts own logic.  Under the Courts reading of §402.03, §7(a)(2) applies to discretionary federal actions of any kind.  The Court plainly acknowledges that EPA exercises discretion when deciding whether to transfer permitting authority to a State.  If we are to take the Courts approach seriously, once <em>any</em> discretion has been identifiedas it has here§7(a)(2) must apply.<a name="ZD-13ref" href="#ZD-13" class="">

            </a>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The MOA regulation described in Part IIIB, <em>supra,</em> also demonstrates that an NPDES transfer is not as ministerial a task as the Court would suggest.  The agency retains significant discretion under §123.24 over the content of an MOA, which of course must be approved prior to a transfer. For instance, EPA may require a State to file reports on a weekly basis or a monthly basis.  It may require a State to submit only certain classes and categories of permit applications.  And it may include any additional terms and conditions that are relevant to the enforcement of the NPDES program.  There is ample room for judgment in all of these areas, and EPA has exercised such judgment in the past when approving MOAs from many States.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Approval of Application by Maine to Administer the NPDES Program, 66 Fed. Reg. 12791, (2001); Approval of Application by Maine to Administer the NPDES Program; Texas, 
63Fed. Reg.
51165 (1998).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In fact, in an earlier case raising a question similar to this one, see <em>American Forest &amp; Paper Assn.</em> v. <em>EPA</em>, 137 F. 3d 291, 298299 (CA5 1998), EPA itself explained how 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/40/123" class="subref" title="subref">40 CFR §123.24</a> gives it discretion over the approval of a State pollution control program, see Brief for EPA in No. 9660874 (CA5).  Arguing that [i]ndicia of discretionary involvement or control abound in [its] regulations, the agency listed its MOA regulation as a prime example.<a name="ZD-14ref" href="#ZD-14" class="">

            </a>  Again, because EPAs approval of a State application to administer an NPDES program entails significantindeed, aboundingdiscretion, I would find that §7(a)(2) of the ESA applies even under the Courts own flawed theory of these cases.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    Mindful that judges must always remain faithful to the intent of the legislature, Chief Justice Burger closed his opinion in the snail darter case with a reminder that [o]nce the meaning of an enactment is discerned and its constitutionality determined, the judicial process comes to an end.  <em>Hill</em>, 437 U. S., at 194.  This Court offered a definitive interpretation of the Endangered Species Act nearly 30 years ago in that very case.  Today the Court turns its back on our decision in <em>Hill</em> and places a great number of endangered species in jeopardy, including the cactus ferruginous pygmy-owl and Pima pineapple cactus at issue here.  At the risk of plagiarizing Chief Justice Burgers fine opinion, I think it is appropriate to end my opinion just as he didwith a quotation attributed to Sir Thomas More that has as much relevance today as it did three decades ago.  This quotation illustrates not only the fundamental character of the rule of law embodied in §7 of the ESA but also the pernicious consequences of official disobedience of such a rule.

        <p class="bodytext">    Although its reasons have shifted over time, at both the administrative level and in the federal courts, EPA has insisted that the requirements of §7(a)(2) of the ESA do not apply to its decision to transfer permitting authority under §402(b) of the CWA.  See App. 114; Brief for Petitioner EPA 16, 42.  As I have explained above, that conclusion is contrary to the text of §7(a)(2), our decision in the <em>TVA</em> v. <em>Hill</em>, and the regulation on which the agency has since relied and upon which the Court relies on today.  Accordingly, I would hold that EPAs decision was arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act, see

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-2" href="#ZD-2ref">2</a> The Court misreads this sentence and, in so doing, overreads our decision in Hill.  Justice Alito maintains that Hill held that the acts appropriating funds to the TVA … did not require the agency to use any of the generally appropriated funds to complete the Tellico Dam project.  Ante, at 2324, n. 9.  But Hill said no such thing.  That case only held that the subsequent appropriation of funds for the Tellico Dam Project could not overcome the mandatory requirements of §7 of the ESA; it did not hold that the TVA would not have been required to spend any and all appropriated funds if the ESA had never been passed.  See Hill, 437 U. S., at 189190.  If the ESA had never been enacted and did not stand in the way of the completion of the Tellico Dam, there is no doubt that the TVA would have finished the project that Congress had funded.

Hill, O.T. 1977, No. 761701, p. 26.  Instead, the TVA sought to restrict §7 to only those actions for which the agency has reasonable decision-making alternatives before it.  Ibid.  We rejected that narrow interpretation, stating that the only way to sustain the TVAs position would be to ignore the ordinary meaning of plain language.  Hill, 437 U. S., at 173.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/541/752" class="subref" title="subref">541 U. S. 752</a> (2004)
,that an agency cannot be considered the legal cause of an action that it has no statutory discretion not to takesupports its reliance on §402.03.  Ante, at 20.  First of all, the Court itself recognizes that it must distance itself from that case, ibid., because Public Citizen dealt with a procedural requirement under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), not a substantive requirement like that imposed by §7(a)(2) of the ESA, see TVA v. Hill, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/437/158" class="subref" title="subref">437 U. S. 158</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">188</a>, n. 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">34</a> (1978)
 (holding that NEPA cases are completely inapposite to the ESA context).  What the Court does not recognize, however, is that what it views as the basic principle of Public Citizen is stated too broadly and therefore inapplicable to this case.  Ante, at 20.


Our decision in Public Citizen turned on what we called a critical feature of the case: that the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) had no ability to countermand the Presidents lifting a moratorium that prohibited certain motor carriers from obtaining authority to operate within the United States.  541 U. S., at 766.  Once the President decided to lift that moratorium, and once the relevant vehicles had entered the United States, FMCSA was required by statute to register the vehicles if certain conditions were met.  Ibid. (Under FMCSAs entirely reasonable reading of this provision, it must certify any motor carrier that can show that it is willing and able to comply with the various substantive requirements for safety and financial responsibility contained in DOT regulations; only the moratorium prevented it from doing so for Mexican motor carriers before 2001 (emphasis deleted)).  Therefore, any potential NEPA concerns were generated by another decisionmaker, the President, and not the FMCSA.  Here, by contrast, EPA is not required to act ministerially once another person or agency has made a decision.  Instead, EPA must exercise its own judgment when considering the transfer of NPDES authority to a State; it also has its own authority to deny such a transfer.  Any effect on endangered species will be caused, even if indirectly, by the agencys own decision to transfer NPDES authority.  Cf. 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.02</a> (providing that the ESA will apply to all agency activities that directly or indirectly caus[e] modifications to the land, water, or air (emphasis added)).

        <p class="bodytext">    These cases present a problem of conflicting shalls.  On the one hand, §402(b) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) provides that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) shall approve a States application to administer a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permitting program unless it determines that nine criteria are not satisfied.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1342.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §1342(b)</a>.  On the other hand, shortly after the passage of the CWA, Congress enacted §7(a)(2) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA), which commands that federal agencies shall insure that their actions do not jeopardize endangered species.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#a_2" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(a)(2)</a>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    When faced with competing statutory mandates, it is our duty to give full effect to both if at all possible.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Morton</em> v. <em>Mancari</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/417/535" class="subref" title="subref">417 U. S. 535</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">551</a> (1974)
 ([W]hen two statutes are capable of co-existence, it is the duty of the courts, absent a clearly expressed congressional intention to the contrary, to regard each as effective).  The Court fails at this task.  Its opinion unsuccessfully tries to reconcile the CWA and ESA by relying on a federal regulation, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a> (2006), which it reads as limiting the reach of §7(a)(2) to <em>only</em> discretionary federal actions, see <em>ante</em>, at 1719.  Not only is this reading inconsistent with the text and history of §402.03, but it is fundamentally inconsistent with the ESA itself.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In the celebrated snail darter case, <em>TVA</em> v. <em>Hill</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/437/153" class="subref" title="subref">437 U. S. 153</a> (1978)
, we held that the ESA reveals a conscious decision by Congress to give endangered species priority over the primary missions of federal agencies, <em>id</em>., at 185.  Consistent with that intent, Chief Justice Burgers exceptionally thorough and admirable opinion explained that §7 admits of<em></em>no exception.<em>  Id</em>., at 173.  Creating precisely such an exception by exempting nondiscretionary federal actions from the ESAs coverage, the Court whittles away at Congress comprehensive effort to protect endangered species from the risk of extinction and fails to give the Act its intended effect.  After first giving <em>Hill</em> the attention it deserves, I will comment further on the irrelevance of §402.03 to these cases and offer other available ways to give effect to both CWA and the ESA.  Having done so, I conclude by explaining why these cases should be remanded to the EPA for further proceedings.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">I</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In <em>Hill, </em>we were presented with two separate questions: (1) whether the ESA required a court to enjoin the operation of the nearly completed Tellico Dam and Reservoir Project because the Secretary of the Interior had determined that its operation would eradicate a small endangered fish known as a snail darter; and (2) whether post-1973 congressional appropriations for the completion of the Tellico Dam constituted an implied repeal of the ESA, at least insofar as it applied to the Dam.  437 U. S., at 156.  More than 30 pages of our opinion explain our affirmative answer to the first question, see <em>id.,</em> at 156188, but just over four pages sufficed to explain our negative answer to the second, see <em>id</em>., at 189193.  While it is our ruling on the first question that is relevant to the cases before us, it is our refusal to hold that the ESA itself had been impliedly repealed that the majority strangely deems most significant.  See <em>ante, </em>at 2122.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In answering <em>Hill</em>s first question,<em></em>we did not discuss implied repeals.  On the contrary, that portion of the opinion contained our definitive interpretation of the ESA, in which we concluded that the language, history, and structure of the [ESA] indicates beyond doubt that Congress intended endangered species to be afforded the highest of priorities.  437 U. S., at 174; see also <em>id</em>., at 177 ( The dominant theme pervading all Congressional discussion of the proposed [ESA] was the overriding need <em>to devote whatever effort and resources were necessary</em> to avoid further diminution of national and worldwide wildlife resources  (quoting Coggins, Conserving Wildlife Resources: An Overview of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, 
51N. D. L. Rev.
315,
321 (1975) (emphasis added in <em>Hill</em>))).  With respect to §7 in particular, our opinion could not have been any clearer.  We plainly held that it admits of<em> no exception</em>.  437 U. S., at 173 (emphasis added).<a name="ZD-1ref" href="#ZD-1" class="">

Not a word in the opinion stated or suggested that §7 obligations are inapplicable to mandatory agency actions that would threaten the eradication of an endangered species.  Nor did the opinion describe the Tennessee Valley Authoritys (TVA) attempted completion of the Tellico Dam as a discretionary act.  How could it?  After all, if the Secretary of the Interior had not declared the snail darter an endangered species whose critical habitat would be destroyed by operation of the Tellico Dam, the TVA surely would have been obligated to spend the additional funds that Congress appropriated to complete the project.<a name="ZD-2ref" href="#ZD-2" class="">

The pointed omission of the type of qualifying language previously included in endangered species legislation reveals a conscious decision by Congress to give endangered species <em>priority over the </em><em>primary missions of federal agencies.</em>   <em>Id</em>., at 185 (emphasis added).<a name="ZD-3ref" href="#ZD-3" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    The fact that we also concluded that the post-1973 congressional appropriations did not impliedly repeal the ESA provides no support for the majoritys contention that the obligations imposed by §7(a)(2) may be limited to discretionary acts.  A few passages from the relevant parts of <em>Hill</em> belie that suggestion.  After noting the oddity of holding that the interest in protecting the survival of a relatively small number of 3-inch fish would require the permanent halting of a virtually completed dam for which Congress has expended more than $100 million, we found that the explicit provisions of the Endangered Species Act require precisely that result.  <em>Id.,</em> at 172, 173.  We then continued:</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> One would be hard pressed to find a statutory provision whose terms were any plainer than those in §7 of the Endangered Species Act.  Its very words affirmatively command all federal agencies to <em>insure </em>that actions <em>authorized, funded,</em> or <em>carried out </em>by them do not <em>jeopardize </em>the continued existence of an endangered species or <em>result </em>in the destruction or modification of habitat of such species … .   <em>Id</em>., at 173 (quoting 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536</a> (1976 ed.) (emphasis added in <em>Hill</em>)).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
We also reviewed the ESAs history to identify a variety of exceptions that had been included in earlier legislation and unenacted proposals but were omitted from the final version of the 1973 statute.  We explained that earlier endangered species legislation qualified the obligation of federal agencies, but the 1973 Act purposefully omitted all phrases which might have qualified an agencys responsibilities.  437 U. S., at 181, 182.  Moreover, after observing that the ESA creates only a limited number of hardship exemptions, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1539.html" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1539</a>none of which would apply to federal agencieswe applied the maxim <em>expressio unius est expression alterius</em> to conclude that there are no exemptions in the Endangered Species Act for federal agencies,437 U. S., at 188.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Today, however, the Court countenances such an exemption.  It erroneously concludes that the ESA contains an unmentioned exception for nondiscretionary agency action and that the statutes command to enjoin the completion of the Tellico Dam depended on the unmentioned fact that the TVA was attempting to perform a discretionary act.  But both the text of the ESA and our opinion in <em>Hill</em> compel the contrary determination that Congress intended the ESA to apply to all federal agencies and to all actions authorized, funded, or carried out by them.  <em>Id.,</em> at 173 (emphasis deleted).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    A transfer of NPDES permitting authority under §402(b) of the CWA is undoubtedly one of those actions that is authorized or carried out by a federal agency.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(b)</a>; 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.02</a> (defining action as all activities or programs of any kind authorized, funded, or carried out, in whole or in part, by Federal agencies in the United States or upon the high seas.  Examples include, but are not limited to . . . actions directly or indirectly causing modifications to the land, water, or air).  It follows from <em>Hill </em>that §7(a)(2) applies to such NPDES transferswhether they are mandatory or discretionary.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">II</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Given our unequivocal holding in <em>Hill</em> that the ESA has first priority over all other federal action, 437 U. S., at 185, if any statute should yield, it should be the CWA.  But no statute must yield unless it is truly incapable of coexistence.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Morton</em>, 417 U. S., at 551.  Therefore, assuming that §402(b) of the CWA contains its own mandatory command, we should first try to harmonize that provision with the mandatory requirements of §7(a)(2) of the ESA.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Courts solution is to rely on 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a>, which states that Section 7 and the requirements of this part apply to all actions in which there is discretionary Federal involvement or control.  The Court explains that this regulation harmonizes the statutes by giving effect to the ESAs no-jeopardy mandate whenever an agency has discretion to do so, but by lifting that mandate when the agency is forbidden from considering such extrastatutory factors.  <em>Ante</em>, at 17.  This is not harmony, and it certainly isnt effect.  Rather than giving genuine effect to §7(a)(2), the Court permits a wholesale limitation on the reach of the ESA.  Its interpretation of §402.03 conflicts with the text and history of the regulation, as well as our interpretation of §7 in the snail darter case.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    To begin with, the plain language of §402.03 does not state that its coverage is limited to discretionary actions.  Quite the opposite, the most natural reading of the text is that it confirms the broad construction of §7 endorsed by our opinion in <em>Hill</em>.  Indeed, the only way to read §402.03 in accordance with the facts of the case and our holding that §7 admits of no exception[s], 437 U. S., at 173, is that it eliminates any possible argument that the ESA does not extend to situations in which the discretionary federal involvement is only marginal.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court is simply mistaken when it says that it reads §402.03 to mean what it says: that §7(a)(2)s no-jeopardy duty covers <em>only</em> discretionary agency actions … .  <em>Ante,</em> at 21 (emphasis added).  That is not, in fact, what §402.03 says.  The word only is the Courts addition to the text, not the agencys.  Moreover, that text surely does not go on to say (as the Court does) that the duty does not attach to actions (like the NPDES permitting transfer authorization) that an agency is <em>required</em> by statute to undertake once certain specified triggering events have occurred. <em>Ibid.</em>  If the drafters of the regulation had intended such a far-reaching change in the law, surely they would have said so by using language similar to that which the Court uses today.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Nothing in the proceedings that led to the promulgation of the regulation suggests any reason for limiting the pre-existing understanding of the scope of §7s coverage.  EPA codified the current version of §402.03 in 1986 as part of a general redrafting of ESA regulations.  In the 1983 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the proposed version of §402.03 stated that §7 and the requirements of this Part apply to all actions in which there is Federal involvement or control.  
48Fed. Reg.
29999 (1983).  Without any explanation, the final rule inserted the word discretionary before Federal involvement or control.

            </a>  Clearly, if the Secretary of the Interior meant to limit the pre-existing understanding of the scope of the coverage of §7(a)(2) by promulgating this regulation, that intent would have been mentioned somewhere in the text of the regulations or in contemporaneous comment about them.

 (We have frequently reiterated that an agency must cogently explain why it has exercised its discretion in a given manner).  Yet, the final rule said nothing about limiting the reach of §7 or our decision in <em>Hill.  </em>Nor did it mention the change from the notice of proposed rulemaking.  I can only assume, then, that the regulation does mean what both it and the notice of proposed rulemaking says: Section 7(a)(2) applies to discretionary federal action, but not <em>only</em> to discretionary action.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The only explanation the agency provided for §402.03 was the following:</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> This section, which explains the applicability of section 7, implicitly covers Federal activities within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States and upon the high seas as a result of the definition of action in §402.02.  The explanation for the scope of the term action is provided in the discussion under §402.01 above.  51 Fed. Reg. 19937.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
This statement directs us to two sources: the definition of action in §402.02 and the explanation for the scope of the term action  in §402.01.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Both confirm that there was no intent to draw a distinction between discretionary and nondiscretionary actions.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Section 402.02 provides in relevant part:</p>
        <p class="bodytext"><em>Action </em>means <em>all</em> activities or programs <em>of any kind</em> authorized, funded, or carried out, in whole or in part, by Federal agencies in the United States or upon the high seas.  Examples include, but are not limited to:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    (a)actions intended to conserve listed species or their habitat;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    (b)the promulgation of regulations . . .   (second and third emphases added.)</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
Actions in either of the described sub-categories are sometimes mandatory and sometimes discretionary.  Likewise, as the italicized portions indicate, the term action expressly refers to all agency activities or programs of any kind, regardless of whether they are discretionary or mandatory.  By reading the term discretionary as a limitation on action, the Court creates a contradiction in the EPAs own regulation.<a name="ZD-5ref" href="#ZD-5" class="">
                <sup>

            </a>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    As for the final rules explanation for the scope of the term action in §402.01, that too is fully consistent with my interpretation of §402.03.  That explanation plainly states that <em>all</em> Federal actions including conservations programs are subject to the consultation requirements of section 7(a)(2) if they may affect listed species or their critical habitats.  51 Fed. Reg. 19929 (emphasis added).  The regulation does not say all discretionary federal actions, nor does it evince an intent to limit the scope of §7(a)(2) in any way.  Rather, it just restates that the ESA applies to all federal actions, just as the notice of proposed rulemaking did.  This explanation of the scope of the word action is therefore a strong indication that the Courts reading of discretionary is contrary to its intended meaning.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    An even stronger indication is the fact that at no point in the administrative proceedings in these cases did EPA even mention<em></em>it.<a name="ZD-6ref" href="#ZD-6" class="">

            </a>  As an initial matter, it is worth emphasizing that even if EPA had relied on §402.03, its interpretation of the ESA would not be entitled to deference under <em>Chevron U. S. A. Inc.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/467/837" class="subref" title="subref">467 U. S. 837</a> (1984)
, because it is not charged with administering that statute, <em>id</em>., at 844 (We have long recognized that considerable weight should be accorded to an executive departments construction of a statutory scheme <em>it is entrusted to administer</em>. (emphasis added)); <em>Department of Treasury</em> v. <em>FLRA</em>, 837 F. 2d 1163, 1167 (CADC 1988) ([W]hen an agency interprets a statute other than that which it has been entrusted to administer, its interpretation is not entitled to deference).  The Departments of the Interior and Commerce, not EPA, are charged with administering the ESA.  See <em>Babbitt </em>v. <em>Sweet Home Chapter, Communities for Great Ore.,</em> 515 U. S., 687, 703704 (1995).  And EPA has conceded that the Department of the Interiors biological opinion did not discuss 50 CFR. 402.03, and it did not address the question whether the consultation that produced the [biological opinion] was required by the ESA.  Pet. for Cert. in No. 06549, p. 24; see App. 77124 (never mentioning §402.03).  Left with this unfavorable administrative record, EPA can only lean on the fact that the Department of the Interior has recently clarified its position regarding §402.03 in a <em>different</em> administrative proceeding.  See Pet. for Cert. in No. 06549, pp. 2425; <em>id</em>., at 26 (The recent F[ish and Wildlife Service] and N[ational Marine Fisheries Service] communications regarding Alaskas pending transfer application reflect those agencies considered interpretations . . . of [50 CFR] 402.03); App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06340, pp. 103a116a; see also <em>ante</em>, at 12 n. 5.  We have long held, however, that courts may not affirm an agency action on grounds other than those adopted by the agency in the administrative proceedings.  See <em>SEC</em> v. <em>Chenery Corp.</em>,

.  The majority ignores this hoary principle of administrative law and substitutes a post-hoc interpretation of §7(a)(2) and §402.03 for that of the relevant agency.  For that reason alone, these cases should be remanded to the agency.  And for the other reasons I have given, §402.03 cannot be used to harmonize the CWA and the ESA.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">III</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    There are at least two ways in which the CWA and the ESA can be given full effect without privileging one statute over the other.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">A</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The text of §7(a)(2) itself provides the first possible way of reconciling that provision with §402(b) of the CWA.   The subsection reads:</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> Each Federal agency shall, <em>in consultation with and with the assistance of the Secretary</em>, insure that any action authorized, funded, or carried out by such agency (hereinafter in this section referred to as an agency action) is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of habitat of such species which is determined by the Secretary, after consultation as appropriate with affected States, to be critical, unless such agency has been granted an exemption for such action by the Committee pursuant to subsection (h) of this section.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#a_2" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(a)(2)</a> (emphasis added).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court is certainly correct that the use of the word shall in §7(a)(2) imposes a mandatory requirement on the federal agencies.  See <em>ante</em>, at 14.  It is also correct that the ESAs mandate is to be carried out through consultation and may require the agency to adopt an alternative course of action.  <em>Ante,</em> at 15.  The Court is too quick to conclude, however, that this consultation requirement creates an irreconcilable conflict between this provision and §402(b) of the CWA.  It rushes to this flawed judgment because of a basic conceptual erroran error that is revealed as early as the first paragraph of its opinion.  Rather than attempting to find a way to give effect to §7(a)(2)s consultation requirement, the Court frames the question presented as whether §7(a)(2) effectively operates as a tenth criterion on which the transfer of permitting power under the first statute must be conditioned.   <em>Ante</em>, at 12.  The Court is not alone in this.  The author of the Ninth Circuit opinion below also stated that the ESA <em>adds</em> one requirement to the list of considerations under the Clean Water Act permitting transfer provision.  450 F. 3d, at 404 n. 2 (2006) (Berzon, J., concurring in denial of rehearing en banc) (emphasis in original).  But while the ESA does mandate that the relevant agencies consul[t] with the Interior Department, that consultation process also provides a way for the agencies to give effect to both statutes.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The first step in the statutory consultation process is to identify whether any endangered species will be affected by an agency action.  An agency proposing a particular action, such as an NPDES transfer, will typically ask the Secretary of the Interior whether any listed species may be present in the area of the proposed action and whether that action will affect those species.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#c" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(c)</a>.  It is entirely possible that no listed species will be affected, and any anticipated conflict between the ESA and another statute will have been avoided at this threshold stage.  If, however, the Secretary determines that a proposed action may affect an endangered species or its critical habitat, the agency must formally consult with the Secretary.  This consultation culminates in the issuance of a biological opinion, which detail[s] how the agency action affects the species or its critical habitat.  §1536(b)(3)(A); see also 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.14</a>(h).  Even at this stage, it is still possible that formal consultation will reveal that the agency action will not jeopardize any species.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 
63Fed. Reg.
51199 (1998) (noting that FWS rendered a no jeopardy finding with respect to the transfer of permitting authority to Texas).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    If the biological opinion concludes that the agency action would put a listed species in jeopardy, however, the ESA contains a process for resolving the competing demands of agency action and species protection.  The ESA provides that the Secretary shall suggest those reasonable and prudent alternatives which he believes would not violate subsection (a)(2) and can be taken by the Federal agency or applicant in implementing the agency action.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#b_3_A" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(b)(3)(A)</a>; see also 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.14</a>(h)(3).  The agencys regulations define [r]easonable and prudent alternatives as</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> alternative actions identified during formal consultation that can be implemented in a manner consistent with the intended purpose of the action, that can be implemented consistent with the scope of the Federal agencys legal authority and jurisdiction, that is economically and technologically feasible, and that the Director [of FWS] believes would avoid the likelihood of jeopardizing the continued existence of listed species or resulting in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat.   
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.02</a>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
Thus, in the face of any conflict between the ESA and another federal statute, the ESA and its implementing regulations encourage federal agencies to work out a reasonable alternative that would let the proposed action move forward consistent with [its] intended purpose and the agencys legal authority, while also avoiding any violation of  §7(a)(2).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    When applied to the NPDES transfer program, the reasonable and prudent alternatives process would enable EPA and the Department of the Interior to develop a substitute that would allow a transfer of permitting authority <em>and</em> would not jeopardize endangered species.  Stated differently, the consultation process would generate an alternative course of action whereby the transfer could still take placeas required by §402(b) of the CWAbut in such a way that would honor the mandatory requirements of §7(a)(2) of the ESA.  This should come as no surprise to EPA, as it has engaged in pre-transfer consultations at least six times in the past and has stated that it is not barred from doing so by the CWA.<a name="ZD-7ref" href="#ZD-7" class="">

        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Finally, for the rare case in which no reasonable and prudent alternative can be found, Congress has provided yet another mechanism for resolving any conflicts between the ESA and a proposed agency action.  In 1978, shortly after our decision in <em>Hill</em>, Congress amended the ESA to create the Endangered Species Committee, which it authorized to grant exemptions from §7(a)(2).  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#e" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(e)</a>.  Because it has the authority to approve the extinction of an endangered species, the Endangered Species Committee is colloquially described as the God Squad or God Committee.  In light of this weighty responsibility, Congress carefully laid out requirements for the God Committees membership,<a name="ZD-8ref" href="#ZD-8" class="">

        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    As the final arbiter in situations in which the ESA conflicts with a proposed agency action, the God Committee embodies the primacy of the ESAs mandate and serves as the final mechanism for harmonizing that Act with other federal statutes.  By creating this Committee, Congress recognized that some conflicts with the ESA may not be capable of resolution without having to forever sacrifice some endangered species.  At the same time, the creation of this last line of defense reflects Congress view that the ESA should not yield to another federal action except as a final resort and except when authorized by high level officials after serious consideration.  In short, when all else has failed and two federal statutes are incapable of resolution, Congress left the choice to the Committeenot to this Court; it did not limit the ESA in the way the majority does today.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">B</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    EPAs regulations offer a second way to harmonize the CWA with the ESA.  After EPA has transferred NPDES permitting authority to a State, the agency continues to oversee the States permitting program.  See <em>Arkansas</em> v. <em>Oklahoma</em>,

11206 (2001).  Given these ongoing responsibilities, EPA has enacted a regulation that requires a State to enter into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) that sets forth the particulars of the agencys oversight duties.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/40/123" class="subref" title="subref">40 CFR §123.24</a>(a) (2006).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">The regulation governing MOAs contains several detailed requirements.  For instance, the regulation states that an MOA must contain [p]rovisions specifying classes and categories of permit applications, draft permits and proposed permits that the State will send to the [EPA] Regional Administrator for review, comment and, where applicable, objection, §123.24(b)(2); [p]rovisions specifying the frequency and content of reports, documents and other information which the State is required to submit to the EPA, §123.24(b)(3); and [p]rovisions for coordination of compliance monitoring activities by the State and by EPA, §123.24(b)(4)(i).  More generally, the regulation provides that an MOA may include other terms, conditions, or agreements that are relevant to the administration and enforcement of the States regulatory program.  §123.24(a).  Under the MOA regulation, furthermore, EPA will not approve any MOA that restricts its statutory oversight responsibility.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Like the §7(a)(2) consultation process described above, MOAs provide a potential mechanism for giving effect to §7 of the ESA while also allowing the transfer of permitting authority to a State.  It is important to remember that EPA must approve an MOA <em>prior to</em> the transfer of NPDES authority.  As such, EPA can useand in fact has usedthe MOA process to structure its later oversight in a way that will allow it to protect endangered species in accordance with §7(a)(2) of the ESA.  EPA might negotiate a provision in the MOA that would require a State to abide by the ESA requirements when issuing pollution permits.  See Brief for American Fisheries Society et al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 28. (In the Maine MOA, for example, EPA and the state agreed that state permits would protect ESA-listed species by ensuring compliance with state water quality standards).  Alternatively, EPA could require the state to provide copies of draft permits for discharges in particularly sensitive habitats such as those of ESA-listed species or for discharges that contain a pollutant that threatens ESA-listed wildlife.  <em>Id</em>., at 10.  Or the MOA might be drafted in a way that would allow the agency to object to state permits that would jeopardize any and all endangered species.  See<em> id</em>., at 28 (explaining that the Maine MOA includes a provision allowing EPA to object to any state permit that risks harm to a listed species by threatening water quality).  These are just three of many possibilities.  I need not identify other ways EPA could use the MOA process to comply with the ESA; it is enough to observe that MOAs provide a straightforward way to give the ESA its full effect without restricting §7(a)(2) in the way the Court does.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">IV</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    As discussed above, I believe that the Court incorrectly restricts the reach of §7(a)(2) to discretionary federal actions.  See Part II, <em>supra.</em>  Even if such a limitation were permissible, however, it is clear that EPAs authority to transfer permitting authority under §402(b) <em>is </em>discretionary.<a name="ZD-11ref" href="#ZD-11" class="">

            </a>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The EPA Administrators authority to approve state permit programs pursuant to §402(b) of the CWA does not even fit within the Courts description of the category of mandatory actions that the Court holds are covered by the ESA.  In the Courts words, that category includes actions that an agency is <em>required </em>by statute to undertake once certain specified triggering events have occurred.  <em>Ante</em>, at 22.  The triggering event for EPAs approval is simply the filing of a satisfactory description of the States proposed program.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1342.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §1342(b)</a>.  The statute then commands that the EPA Administrator shall approve the submitted program unless he determines that state law does not satisfy nine specified conditions.  Those conditions are not triggering events; they are potential objections to the exercise of the Administrators authority.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    What is more, §402(b) is a perfect example of why our analysis should not end simply because a statute uses the word shall.  Instead, we must look more closely at its listed criteria to determine whether they allow for discretion, despite the use of shall.  After all, as then-Justice Rehnquists dissenting opinion in the snail darter case explains, a federal statute using the word shall will sometimes allow room for discretion.  See <em>Hill</em>, 437 U. S. at 211212 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).<a name="ZD-12ref" href="#ZD-12" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>12</b>
                </sup>
            </a>  In these cases, there is significant room for discretion in EPAs evaluation of §402(b)s nine conditions.  The first criterion, for example, requires the EPA Administrator to examine five other statutes and ensure that the State has adequate authority to comply with each.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1342.html#b_1_A" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §1342(b)(1)(A)</a>.  One of those five statutes, in turn, expressly directs the Administrator to exercise his judgment.  §1312.  Even the Court acknowledges that EPA must exercise some judgment in determining whether a State has demonstrated that it has the authority to carry out §402(b)s enumerated statutory criteria.  <em>Ante</em>, at 24.  However, in the very same breath, the Court states that the dispositive fact is that the statute clearly does not grant it the discretion to add another entirely separate prerequisite to that list.  <em>Ibid</em>.  This reasoning flouts the Courts own logic.  Under the Courts reading of §402.03, §7(a)(2) applies to discretionary federal actions of any kind.  The Court plainly acknowledges that EPA exercises discretion when deciding whether to transfer permitting authority to a State.  If we are to take the Courts approach seriously, once <em>any</em> discretion has been identifiedas it has here§7(a)(2) must apply.<a name="ZD-13ref" href="#ZD-13" class="">

            </a>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The MOA regulation described in Part IIIB, <em>supra,</em> also demonstrates that an NPDES transfer is not as ministerial a task as the Court would suggest.  The agency retains significant discretion under §123.24 over the content of an MOA, which of course must be approved prior to a transfer. For instance, EPA may require a State to file reports on a weekly basis or a monthly basis.  It may require a State to submit only certain classes and categories of permit applications.  And it may include any additional terms and conditions that are relevant to the enforcement of the NPDES program.  There is ample room for judgment in all of these areas, and EPA has exercised such judgment in the past when approving MOAs from many States.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Approval of Application by Maine to Administer the NPDES Program, 66 Fed. Reg. 12791, (2001); Approval of Application by Maine to Administer the NPDES Program; Texas, 
63Fed. Reg.
51165 (1998).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In fact, in an earlier case raising a question similar to this one, see <em>American Forest &amp; Paper Assn.</em> v. <em>EPA</em>, 137 F. 3d 291, 298299 (CA5 1998), EPA itself explained how 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/40/123" class="subref" title="subref">40 CFR §123.24</a> gives it discretion over the approval of a State pollution control program, see Brief for EPA in No. 9660874 (CA5).  Arguing that [i]ndicia of discretionary involvement or control abound in [its] regulations, the agency listed its MOA regulation as a prime example.<a name="ZD-14ref" href="#ZD-14" class="">

                </sup>
            </a>  Again, because EPAs approval of a State application to administer an NPDES program entails significantindeed, aboundingdiscretion, I would find that §7(a)(2) of the ESA applies even under the Courts own flawed theory of these cases.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    Mindful that judges must always remain faithful to the intent of the legislature, Chief Justice Burger closed his opinion in the snail darter case with a reminder that [o]nce the meaning of an enactment is discerned and its constitutionality determined, the judicial process comes to an end.  <em>Hill</em>, 437 U. S., at 194.  This Court offered a definitive interpretation of the Endangered Species Act nearly 30 years ago in that very case.  Today the Court turns its back on our decision in <em>Hill</em> and places a great number of endangered species in jeopardy, including the cactus ferruginous pygmy-owl and Pima pineapple cactus at issue here.  At the risk of plagiarizing Chief Justice Burgers fine opinion, I think it is appropriate to end my opinion just as he didwith a quotation attributed to Sir Thomas More that has as much relevance today as it did three decades ago.  This quotation illustrates not only the fundamental character of the rule of law embodied in §7 of the ESA but also the pernicious consequences of official disobedience of such a rule.  Repetition of that literary allusion is especially appropriate today:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">The law, Roper, the law.  I know whats legal, not whats right.  And Ill stick to whats legal. . . . Im <em>not</em> God.  The currents and eddies of right and wrong, which you find such plain-sailing, I cant navigate, Im no voyager.  But in the thickets of the law, oh there Im a forester. . . . What would you do?  Cut a great road through the law to get after the Devil? . . . And when the last law was down, and the Devil turned round on youwhere would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat? . . . This country's planted thick with laws from coast to coastMans laws, not Godsand if you cut them down . . . dyou really think you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then? . . . Yes, Id give the Devil benefit of law, for my own safetys sake.  R. Bolt, A Man for All Seasons, Act I, p. 147 (Three Plays, Heinemann ed. 1967) (quoted in <em>Hill</em>, 437 U. S., at 195).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Although its reasons have shifted over time, at both the administrative level and in the federal courts, EPA has insisted that the requirements of §7(a)(2) of the ESA do not apply to its decision to transfer permitting authority under §402(b) of the CWA.  See App. 114; Brief for Petitioner EPA 16, 42.  As I have explained above, that conclusion is contrary to the text of §7(a)(2), our decision in the <em>TVA</em> v. <em>Hill</em>, and the regulation on which the agency has since relied and upon which the Court relies on today.  Accordingly, I would hold that EPAs decision was arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/5/706.html#2_A" class="subref" title="subref">5 U. S. C. §706(2)(A)</a>, and would remand to the agency for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>

But Hill said no such thing.  That case only held that the subsequent appropriation of funds for the Tellico Dam Project could not overcome the mandatory requirements of §7 of the ESA; it did not hold that the TVA would not have been required to spend any and all appropriated funds if the ESA had never been passed.  See Hill, 437 U. S., at 189190.

,that an agency cannot be considered the legal cause of an action that it has no statutory discretion not to takesupports its reliance on §402.03.  Ante, at 20.  First of all, the Court itself recognizes that it must distance itself from that case, ibid., because Public Citizen dealt with a procedural requirement under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), not a substantive requirement like that imposed by §7(a)(2) of the ESA, see TVA v. Hill, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/437/158" class="subref" title="subref">437 U. S. 158</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">188</a>, n. 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">34</a> (1978)
 (holding that NEPA cases are completely inapposite to the ESA context).  What the Court does not recognize, however, is that what it views as the basic principle of Public Citizen is stated too broadly and therefore inapplicable to this case.  Ante, at 20.


Our decision in Public Citizen turned on what we called a critical feature of the case: that the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) had no ability to countermand the Presidents lifting a moratorium that prohibited certain motor carriers from obtaining authority to operate within the United States.  541 U. S., at 766.  Once the President decided to lift that moratorium, and once the relevant vehicles had entered the United States, FMCSA was required by statute to register the vehicles if certain conditions were met.  Ibid. (Under FMCSAs entirely reasonable reading of this provision, it must certify any motor carrier that can show that it is willing and able to comply with the various substantive requirements for safety and financial responsibility contained in DOT regulations; only the moratorium prevented it from doing so for Mexican motor carriers before 2001 (emphasis deleted)).  Therefore, any potential NEPA concerns were generated by another decisionmaker, the President, and not the FMCSA.  Here, by contrast, EPA is not required to act ministerially once another person or agency has made a decision.  Instead, EPA must exercise its own judgment when considering the transfer of NPDES authority to a State; it also has its own authority to deny such a transfer.  Any effect on endangered species will be caused, even if indirectly, by the agencys own decision to transfer NPDES authority.  Cf.

        <p class="bodytext">    These cases present a problem of conflicting shalls.  On the one hand, §402(b) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) provides that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) shall approve a States application to administer a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permitting program unless it determines that nine criteria are not satisfied.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1342.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §1342(b)</a>.  On the other hand, shortly after the passage of the CWA, Congress enacted §7(a)(2) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA), which commands that federal agencies shall insure that their actions do not jeopardize endangered species.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#a_2" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(a)(2)</a>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    When faced with competing statutory mandates, it is our duty to give full effect to both if at all possible.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Morton</em> v. <em>Mancari</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/417/535" class="subref" title="subref">417 U. S. 535</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">551</a> (1974)
 ([W]hen two statutes are capable of co-existence, it is the duty of the courts, absent a clearly expressed congressional intention to the contrary, to regard each as effective).  The Court fails at this task.  Its opinion unsuccessfully tries to reconcile the CWA and ESA by relying on a federal regulation, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a> (2006), which it reads as limiting the reach of §7(a)(2) to <em>only</em> discretionary federal actions, see <em>ante</em>, at 1719.  Not only is this reading inconsistent with the text and history of §402.03, but it is fundamentally inconsistent with the ESA itself.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In the celebrated snail darter case, <em>TVA</em> v. <em>Hill</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/437/153" class="subref" title="subref">437 U. S. 153</a> (1978)
, we held that the ESA reveals a conscious decision by Congress to give endangered species priority over the primary missions of federal agencies, <em>id</em>., at 185.  Consistent with that intent, Chief Justice Burgers exceptionally thorough and admirable opinion explained that §7 admits of<em></em>no exception.<em>  Id</em>., at 173.  Creating precisely such an exception by exempting nondiscretionary federal actions from the ESAs coverage, the Court whittles away at Congress comprehensive effort to protect endangered species from the risk of extinction and fails to give the Act its intended effect.  After first giving <em>Hill</em> the attention it deserves, I will comment further on the irrelevance of §402.03 to these cases and offer other available ways to give effect to both CWA and the ESA.  Having done so, I conclude by explaining why these cases should be remanded to the EPA for further proceedings.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">I</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In <em>Hill, </em>we were presented with two separate questions: (1) whether the ESA required a court to enjoin the operation of the nearly completed Tellico Dam and Reservoir Project because the Secretary of the Interior had determined that its operation would eradicate a small endangered fish known as a snail darter; and (2) whether post-1973 congressional appropriations for the completion of the Tellico Dam constituted an implied repeal of the ESA, at least insofar as it applied to the Dam.  437 U. S., at 156.  More than 30 pages of our opinion explain our affirmative answer to the first question, see <em>id.,</em> at 156188, but just over four pages sufficed to explain our negative answer to the second, see <em>id</em>., at 189193.  While it is our ruling on the first question that is relevant to the cases before us, it is our refusal to hold that the ESA itself had been impliedly repealed that the majority strangely deems most significant.  See <em>ante, </em>at 2122.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In answering <em>Hill</em>s first question,<em></em>we did not discuss implied repeals.  On the contrary, that portion of the opinion contained our definitive interpretation of the ESA, in which we concluded that the language, history, and structure of the [ESA] indicates beyond doubt that Congress intended endangered species to be afforded the highest of priorities.  437 U. S., at 174; see also <em>id</em>., at 177 ( The dominant theme pervading all Congressional discussion of the proposed [ESA] was the overriding need <em>to devote whatever effort and resources were necessary</em> to avoid further diminution of national and worldwide wildlife resources  (quoting Coggins, Conserving Wildlife Resources: An Overview of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, 
51N. D. L. Rev.
315,
321 (1975) (emphasis added in <em>Hill</em>))).  With respect to §7 in particular, our opinion could not have been any clearer.  We plainly held that it admits of<em> no exception</em>.  437 U. S., at 173 (emphasis added).<a name="ZD-1ref" href="#ZD-1" class="">

        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Our opinion in <em>Hill </em>explained at length why §7 imposed obligations on all federal agencies to ensure that actions authorized, funded, or carried out by them do not jeopardize the continued existence of endangered species.  437 U. S., at 173 (emphasis deleted; internal quotation marks omitted).  Not a word in the opinion stated or suggested that §7 obligations are inapplicable to mandatory agency actions that would threaten the eradication of an endangered species.  Nor did the opinion describe the Tennessee Valley Authoritys (TVA) attempted completion of the Tellico Dam as a discretionary act.  How could it?  After all, if the Secretary of the Interior had not declared the snail darter an endangered species whose critical habitat would be destroyed by operation of the Tellico Dam, the TVA surely would have been obligated to spend the additional funds that Congress appropriated to complete the project.<a name="ZD-2ref" href="#ZD-2" class="">

                </sup>
            </a>  Unconcerned with whether an agency action was mandatory or discretionary, we simply held that §7 of the ESA</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> reveals an explicit congressional decision to require agencies to afford <em>first priority</em> to the declared national policy of saving endangered species.  The pointed omission of the type of qualifying language previously included in endangered species legislation reveals a conscious decision by Congress to give endangered species <em>priority over the </em><em>primary missions of federal agencies.</em>   <em>Id</em>., at 185 (emphasis added).<a name="ZD-3ref" href="#ZD-3" class="">

        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The fact that we also concluded that the post-1973 congressional appropriations did not impliedly repeal the ESA provides no support for the majoritys contention that the obligations imposed by §7(a)(2) may be limited to discretionary acts.  A few passages from the relevant parts of <em>Hill</em> belie that suggestion.  After noting the oddity of holding that the interest in protecting the survival of a relatively small number of 3-inch fish would require the permanent halting of a virtually completed dam for which Congress has expended more than $100 million, we found that the explicit provisions of the Endangered Species Act require precisely that result.  <em>Id.,</em> at 172, 173.  We then continued:</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> One would be hard pressed to find a statutory provision whose terms were any plainer than those in §7 of the Endangered Species Act.  Its very words affirmatively command all federal agencies to <em>insure </em>that actions <em>authorized, funded,</em> or <em>carried out </em>by them do not <em>jeopardize </em>the continued existence of an endangered species or <em>result </em>in the destruction or modification of habitat of such species … .   <em>Id</em>., at 173 (quoting 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536</a> (1976 ed.) (emphasis added in <em>Hill</em>)).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
We also reviewed the ESAs history to identify a variety of exceptions that had been included in earlier legislation and unenacted proposals but were omitted from the final version of the 1973 statute.  We explained that earlier endangered species legislation qualified the obligation of federal agencies, but the 1973 Act purposefully omitted all phrases which might have qualified an agencys responsibilities.  437 U. S., at 181, 182.  Moreover, after observing that the ESA creates only a limited number of hardship exemptions, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1539.html" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1539</a>none of which would apply to federal agencieswe applied the maxim <em>expressio unius est expression alterius</em> to conclude that there are no exemptions in the Endangered Species Act for federal agencies,437 U. S., at 188.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Today, however, the Court countenances such an exemption.  It erroneously concludes that the ESA contains an unmentioned exception for nondiscretionary agency action and that the statutes command to enjoin the completion of the Tellico Dam depended on the unmentioned fact that the TVA was attempting to perform a discretionary act.  But both the text of the ESA and our opinion in <em>Hill</em> compel the contrary determination that Congress intended the ESA to apply to all federal agencies and to all actions authorized, funded, or carried out by them.  <em>Id.,</em> at 173 (emphasis deleted).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    A transfer of NPDES permitting authority under §402(b) of the CWA is undoubtedly one of those actions that is authorized or carried out by a federal agency.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(b)</a>; 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.02</a> (defining action as all activities or programs of any kind authorized, funded, or carried out, in whole or in part, by Federal agencies in the United States or upon the high seas.  Examples include, but are not limited to . . . actions directly or indirectly causing modifications to the land, water, or air).  It follows from <em>Hill </em>that §7(a)(2) applies to such NPDES transferswhether they are mandatory or discretionary.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">II</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Given our unequivocal holding in <em>Hill</em> that the ESA has first priority over all other federal action, 437 U. S., at 185, if any statute should yield, it should be the CWA.  But no statute must yield unless it is truly incapable of coexistence.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Morton</em>, 417 U. S., at 551.  Therefore, assuming that §402(b) of the CWA contains its own mandatory command, we should first try to harmonize that provision with the mandatory requirements of §7(a)(2) of the ESA.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Courts solution is to rely on 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a>, which states that Section 7 and the requirements of this part apply to all actions in which there is discretionary Federal involvement or control.  The Court explains that this regulation harmonizes the statutes by giving effect to the ESAs no-jeopardy mandate whenever an agency has discretion to do so, but by lifting that mandate when the agency is forbidden from considering such extrastatutory factors.  <em>Ante</em>, at 17.  This is not harmony, and it certainly isnt effect.  Rather than giving genuine effect to §7(a)(2), the Court permits a wholesale limitation on the reach of the ESA.  Its interpretation of §402.03 conflicts with the text and history of the regulation, as well as our interpretation of §7 in the snail darter case.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    To begin with, the plain language of §402.03 does not state that its coverage is limited to discretionary actions.  Quite the opposite, the most natural reading of the text is that it confirms the broad construction of §7 endorsed by our opinion in <em>Hill</em>.  Indeed, the only way to read §402.03 in accordance with the facts of the case and our holding that §7 admits of no exception[s], 437 U. S., at 173, is that it eliminates any possible argument that the ESA does not extend to situations in which the discretionary federal involvement is only marginal.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court is simply mistaken when it says that it reads §402.03 to mean what it says: that §7(a)(2)s no-jeopardy duty covers <em>only</em> discretionary agency actions … .  <em>Ante,</em> at 21 (emphasis added).  That is not, in fact, what §402.03 says.  The word only is the Courts addition to the text, not the agencys.  Moreover, that text surely does not go on to say (as the Court does) that the duty does not attach to actions (like the NPDES permitting transfer authorization) that an agency is <em>required</em> by statute to undertake once certain specified triggering events have occurred. <em>Ibid.</em>  If the drafters of the regulation had intended such a far-reaching change in the law, surely they would have said so by using language similar to that which the Court uses today.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Nothing in the proceedings that led to the promulgation of the regulation suggests any reason for limiting the pre-existing understanding of the scope of §7s coverage.  EPA codified the current version of §402.03 in 1986 as part of a general redrafting of ESA regulations.  In the 1983 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the proposed version of §402.03 stated that §7 and the requirements of this Part apply to all actions in which there is Federal involvement or control.  
48Fed. Reg.
29999 (1983).  Without any explanation, the final rule inserted the word discretionary before Federal involvement or control.  
51Fed. Reg.
19958 (1986).<a name="ZD-4ref" href="#ZD-4" class="">

                </sup>
            </a>  Clearly, if the Secretary of the Interior meant to limit the pre-existing understanding of the scope of the coverage of §7(a)(2) by promulgating this regulation, that intent would have been mentioned somewhere in the text of the regulations or in contemporaneous comment about them.  See <em>National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assn.</em> v. <em>Brand X Internet Services</em>,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">48</a> (1983)
 (We have frequently reiterated that an agency must cogently explain why it has exercised its discretion in a given manner).  Yet, the final rule said nothing about limiting the reach of §7 or our decision in <em>Hill.  </em>Nor did it mention the change from the notice of proposed rulemaking.  I can only assume, then, that the regulation does mean what both it and the notice of proposed rulemaking says: Section 7(a)(2) applies to discretionary federal action, but not <em>only</em> to discretionary action.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The only explanation the agency provided for §402.03 was the following:</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> This section, which explains the applicability of section 7, implicitly covers Federal activities within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States and upon the high seas as a result of the definition of action in §402.02.  The explanation for the scope of the term action is provided in the discussion under §402.01 above.  51 Fed. Reg. 19937.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
This statement directs us to two sources: the definition of action in §402.02 and the explanation for the scope of the term action  in §402.01.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Both confirm that there was no intent to draw a distinction between discretionary and nondiscretionary actions.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Section 402.02 provides in relevant part:</p>
        <p class="bodytext"><em>Action </em>means <em>all</em> activities or programs <em>of any kind</em> authorized, funded, or carried out, in whole or in part, by Federal agencies in the United States or upon the high seas.  Examples include, but are not limited to:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    (a)actions intended to conserve listed species or their habitat;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    (b)the promulgation of regulations . . .   (second and third emphases added.)</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
Actions in either of the described sub-categories are sometimes mandatory and sometimes discretionary.  Likewise, as the italicized portions indicate, the term action expressly refers to all agency activities or programs of any kind, regardless of whether they are discretionary or mandatory.  By reading the term discretionary as a limitation on action, the Court creates a contradiction in the EPAs own regulation.<a name="ZD-5ref" href="#ZD-5" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>5</b>

            </a>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    As for the final rules explanation for the scope of the term action in §402.01, that too is fully consistent with my interpretation of §402.03.  That explanation plainly states that <em>all</em> Federal actions including conservations programs are subject to the consultation requirements of section 7(a)(2) if they may affect listed species or their critical habitats.  51 Fed. Reg. 19929 (emphasis added).  The regulation does not say all discretionary federal actions, nor does it evince an intent to limit the scope of §7(a)(2) in any way.  Rather, it just restates that the ESA applies to all federal actions, just as the notice of proposed rulemaking did.  This explanation of the scope of the word action is therefore a strong indication that the Courts reading of discretionary is contrary to its intended meaning.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    An even stronger indication is the fact that at no point in the administrative proceedings in these cases did EPA even mention<em></em>it.<a name="ZD-6ref" href="#ZD-6" class="">

            </a>  As an initial matter, it is worth emphasizing that even if EPA had relied on §402.03, its interpretation of the ESA would not be entitled to deference under <em>Chevron U. S. A. Inc.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/467/837" class="subref" title="subref">467 U. S. 837</a> (1984)
, because it is not charged with administering that statute, <em>id</em>., at 844 (We have long recognized that considerable weight should be accorded to an executive departments construction of a statutory scheme <em>it is entrusted to administer</em>. (emphasis added)); <em>Department of Treasury</em> v. <em>FLRA</em>, 837 F. 2d 1163, 1167 (CADC 1988) ([W]hen an agency interprets a statute other than that which it has been entrusted to administer, its interpretation is not entitled to deference).  The Departments of the Interior and Commerce, not EPA, are charged with administering the ESA.  See <em>Babbitt </em>v. <em>Sweet Home Chapter, Communities for Great Ore.,</em> 515 U. S., 687, 703704 (1995).  And EPA has conceded that the Department of the Interiors biological opinion did not discuss 50 CFR. 402.03, and it did not address the question whether the consultation that produced the [biological opinion] was required by the ESA.  Pet. for Cert. in No. 06549, p. 24; see App. 77124 (never mentioning §402.03).  Left with this unfavorable administrative record, EPA can only lean on the fact that the Department of the Interior has recently clarified its position regarding §402.03 in a <em>different</em> administrative proceeding.  See Pet. for Cert. in No. 06549, pp. 2425; <em>id</em>., at 26 (The recent F[ish and Wildlife Service] and N[ational Marine Fisheries Service] communications regarding Alaskas pending transfer application reflect those agencies considered interpretations . . . of [50 CFR] 402.03); App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06340, pp. 103a116a; see also <em>ante</em>, at 12 n. 5.  We have long held, however, that courts may not affirm an agency action on grounds other than those adopted by the agency in the administrative proceedings.

.  The majority ignores this hoary principle of administrative law and substitutes a post-hoc interpretation of §7(a)(2) and §402.03 for that of the relevant agency.  For that reason alone, these cases should be remanded to the agency.  And for the other reasons I have given, §402.03 cannot be used to harmonize the CWA and the ESA.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">III</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    There are at least two ways in which the CWA and the ESA can be given full effect without privileging one statute over the other.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">A</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The text of §7(a)(2) itself provides the first possible way of reconciling that provision with §402(b) of the CWA.   The subsection reads:</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> Each Federal agency shall, <em>in consultation with and with the assistance of the Secretary</em>, insure that any action authorized, funded, or carried out by such agency (hereinafter in this section referred to as an agency action) is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of habitat of such species which is determined by the Secretary, after consultation as appropriate with affected States, to be critical, unless such agency has been granted an exemption for such action by the Committee pursuant to subsection (h) of this section.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#a_2" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(a)(2)</a> (emphasis added).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court is certainly correct that the use of the word shall in §7(a)(2) imposes a mandatory requirement on the federal agencies.  See <em>ante</em>, at 14.  It is also correct that the ESAs mandate is to be carried out through consultation and may require the agency to adopt an alternative course of action.  <em>Ante,</em> at 15.  The Court is too quick to conclude, however, that this consultation requirement creates an irreconcilable conflict between this provision and §402(b) of the CWA.  It rushes to this flawed judgment because of a basic conceptual erroran error that is revealed as early as the first paragraph of its opinion.  Rather than attempting to find a way to give effect to §7(a)(2)s consultation requirement, the Court frames the question presented as whether §7(a)(2) effectively operates as a tenth criterion on which the transfer of permitting power under the first statute must be conditioned.   <em>Ante</em>, at 12.  The Court is not alone in this.  The author of the Ninth Circuit opinion below also stated that the ESA <em>adds</em> one requirement to the list of considerations under the Clean Water Act permitting transfer provision.  450 F. 3d, at 404 n. 2 (2006) (Berzon, J., concurring in denial of rehearing en banc) (emphasis in original).  But while the ESA does mandate that the relevant agencies consul[t] with the Interior Department, that consultation process also provides a way for the agencies to give effect to both statutes.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The first step in the statutory consultation process is to identify whether any endangered species will be affected by an agency action.  An agency proposing a particular action, such as an NPDES transfer, will typically ask the Secretary of the Interior whether any listed species may be present in the area of the proposed action and whether that action will affect those species.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#c" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(c)</a>.  It is entirely possible that no listed species will be affected, and any anticipated conflict between the ESA and another statute will have been avoided at this threshold stage.  If, however, the Secretary determines that a proposed action may affect an endangered species or its critical habitat, the agency must formally consult with the Secretary.  This consultation culminates in the issuance of a biological opinion, which detail[s] how the agency action affects the species or its critical habitat.  §1536(b)(3)(A); see also 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.14</a>(h).  Even at this stage, it is still possible that formal consultation will reveal that the agency action will not jeopardize any species.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 
63Fed. Reg.
51199 (1998) (noting that FWS rendered a no jeopardy finding with respect to the transfer of permitting authority to Texas).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    If the biological opinion concludes that the agency action would put a listed species in jeopardy, however, the ESA contains a process for resolving the competing demands of agency action and species protection.  The ESA provides that the Secretary shall suggest those reasonable and prudent alternatives which he believes would not violate subsection (a)(2) and can be taken by the Federal agency or applicant in implementing the agency action.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#b_3_A" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(b)(3)(A)</a>; see also 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.14</a>(h)(3).  The agencys regulations define [r]easonable and prudent alternatives as</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> alternative actions identified during formal consultation that can be implemented in a manner consistent with the intended purpose of the action, that can be implemented consistent with the scope of the Federal agencys legal authority and jurisdiction, that is economically and technologically feasible, and that the Director [of FWS] believes would avoid the likelihood of jeopardizing the continued existence of listed species or resulting in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat.   
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.02</a>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
Thus, in the face of any conflict between the ESA and another federal statute, the ESA and its implementing regulations encourage federal agencies to work out a reasonable alternative that would let the proposed action move forward consistent with [its] intended purpose and the agencys legal authority, while also avoiding any violation of  §7(a)(2).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    When applied to the NPDES transfer program, the reasonable and prudent alternatives process would enable EPA and the Department of the Interior to develop a substitute that would allow a transfer of permitting authority <em>and</em> would not jeopardize endangered species.  Stated differently, the consultation process would generate an alternative course of action whereby the transfer could still take placeas required by §402(b) of the CWAbut in such a way that would honor the mandatory requirements of §7(a)(2) of the ESA.  This should come as no surprise to EPA, as it has engaged in pre-transfer consultations at least six times in the past and has stated that it is not barred from doing so by the CWA.<a name="ZD-7ref" href="#ZD-7" class="">

        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Finally, for the rare case in which no reasonable and prudent alternative can be found, Congress has provided yet another mechanism for resolving any conflicts between the ESA and a proposed agency action.  In 1978, shortly after our decision in <em>Hill</em>, Congress amended the ESA to create the Endangered Species Committee, which it authorized to grant exemptions from §7(a)(2).  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#e" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(e)</a>.  Because it has the authority to approve the extinction of an endangered species, the Endangered Species Committee is colloquially described as the God Squad or God Committee.  In light of this weighty responsibility, Congress carefully laid out requirements for the God Committees membership,<a name="ZD-8ref" href="#ZD-8" class="">

            </a>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    As the final arbiter in situations in which the ESA conflicts with a proposed agency action, the God Committee embodies the primacy of the ESAs mandate and serves as the final mechanism for harmonizing that Act with other federal statutes.  By creating this Committee, Congress recognized that some conflicts with the ESA may not be capable of resolution without having to forever sacrifice some endangered species.  At the same time, the creation of this last line of defense reflects Congress view that the ESA should not yield to another federal action except as a final resort and except when authorized by high level officials after serious consideration.  In short, when all else has failed and two federal statutes are incapable of resolution, Congress left the choice to the Committeenot to this Court; it did not limit the ESA in the way the majority does today.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">B</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    EPAs regulations offer a second way to harmonize the CWA with the ESA.  After EPA has transferred NPDES permitting authority to a State, the agency continues to oversee the States permitting program.  See <em>Arkansas</em> v. <em>Oklahoma</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/503/91" class="subref" title="subref">503 U. S. 91</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">105</a> (1992)
 (Congress preserved for the Administrator broad authority to oversee state permit programs).  If a state permit is outside the guidelines and the requirements of the CWA, EPA may object to it and block its issuance.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1342.html#d_2" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §1342(d)(2)</a>; 
66Fed. Reg.
11206 (2001).  Given these ongoing responsibilities, EPA has enacted a regulation that requires a State to enter into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) that sets forth the particulars of the agencys oversight duties.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/40/123" class="subref" title="subref">40 CFR §123.24</a>(a) (2006).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">The regulation governing MOAs contains several detailed requirements.  For instance, the regulation states that an MOA must contain [p]rovisions specifying classes and categories of permit applications, draft permits and proposed permits that the State will send to the [EPA] Regional Administrator for review, comment and, where applicable, objection, §123.24(b)(2); [p]rovisions specifying the frequency and content of reports, documents and other information which the State is required to submit to the EPA, §123.24(b)(3); and [p]rovisions for coordination of compliance monitoring activities by the State and by EPA, §123.24(b)(4)(i).  More generally, the regulation provides that an MOA may include other terms, conditions, or agreements that are relevant to the administration and enforcement of the States regulatory program.  §123.24(a).  Under the MOA regulation, furthermore, EPA will not approve any MOA that restricts its statutory oversight responsibility.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Like the §7(a)(2) consultation process described above, MOAs provide a potential mechanism for giving effect to §7 of the ESA while also allowing the transfer of permitting authority to a State.  It is important to remember that EPA must approve an MOA <em>prior to</em> the transfer of NPDES authority.  As such, EPA can useand in fact has usedthe MOA process to structure its later oversight in a way that will allow it to protect endangered species in accordance with §7(a)(2) of the ESA.  EPA might negotiate a provision in the MOA that would require a State to abide by the ESA requirements when issuing pollution permits.  See Brief for American Fisheries Society et al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 28. (In the Maine MOA, for example, EPA and the state agreed that state permits would protect ESA-listed species by ensuring compliance with state water quality standards).  Alternatively, EPA could require the state to provide copies of draft permits for discharges in particularly sensitive habitats such as those of ESA-listed species or for discharges that contain a pollutant that threatens ESA-listed wildlife.  <em>Id</em>., at 10.  Or the MOA might be drafted in a way that would allow the agency to object to state permits that would jeopardize any and all endangered species.  See<em> id</em>., at 28 (explaining that the Maine MOA includes a provision allowing EPA to object to any state permit that risks harm to a listed species by threatening water quality).  These are just three of many possibilities.  I need not identify other ways EPA could use the MOA process to comply with the ESA; it is enough to observe that MOAs provide a straightforward way to give the ESA its full effect without restricting §7(a)(2) in the way the Court does.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">IV</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    As discussed above, I believe that the Court incorrectly restricts the reach of §7(a)(2) to discretionary federal actions.  See Part II, <em>supra.</em>  Even if such a limitation were permissible, however, it is clear that EPAs authority to transfer permitting authority under §402(b) <em>is </em>discretionary.<a name="ZD-11ref" href="#ZD-11" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>11</b>

            </a>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The EPA Administrators authority to approve state permit programs pursuant to §402(b) of the CWA does not even fit within the Courts description of the category of mandatory actions that the Court holds are covered by the ESA.  In the Courts words, that category includes actions that an agency is <em>required </em>by statute to undertake once certain specified triggering events have occurred.  <em>Ante</em>, at 22.  The triggering event for EPAs approval is simply the filing of a satisfactory description of the States proposed program.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1342.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §1342(b)</a>.  The statute then commands that the EPA Administrator shall approve the submitted program unless he determines that state law does not satisfy nine specified conditions.  Those conditions are not triggering events; they are potential objections to the exercise of the Administrators authority.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    What is more, §402(b) is a perfect example of why our analysis should not end simply because a statute uses the word shall.  Instead, we must look more closely at its listed criteria to determine whether they allow for discretion, despite the use of shall.  After all, as then-Justice Rehnquists dissenting opinion in the snail darter case explains, a federal statute using the word shall will sometimes allow room for discretion.  See <em>Hill</em>, 437 U. S. at 211212 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).<a name="ZD-12ref" href="#ZD-12" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>12</b>
                </sup>
            </a>  In these cases, there is significant room for discretion in EPAs evaluation of §402(b)s nine conditions.  The first criterion, for example, requires the EPA Administrator to examine five other statutes and ensure that the State has adequate authority to comply with each.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1342.html#b_1_A" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §1342(b)(1)(A)</a>.  One of those five statutes, in turn, expressly directs the Administrator to exercise his judgment.  §1312.  Even the Court acknowledges that EPA must exercise some judgment in determining whether a State has demonstrated that it has the authority to carry out §402(b)s enumerated statutory criteria.  <em>Ante</em>, at 24.  However, in the very same breath, the Court states that the dispositive fact is that the statute clearly does not grant it the discretion to add another entirely separate prerequisite to that list.  <em>Ibid</em>.  This reasoning flouts the Courts own logic.  Under the Courts reading of §402.03, §7(a)(2) applies to discretionary federal actions of any kind.  The Court plainly acknowledges that EPA exercises discretion when deciding whether to transfer permitting authority to a State.  If we are to take the Courts approach seriously, once <em>any</em> discretion has been identifiedas it has here§7(a)(2) must apply.<a name="ZD-13ref" href="#ZD-13" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>13</b>

            </a>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The MOA regulation described in Part IIIB, <em>supra,</em> also demonstrates that an NPDES transfer is not as ministerial a task as the Court would suggest.  The agency retains significant discretion under §123.24 over the content of an MOA, which of course must be approved prior to a transfer. For instance, EPA may require a State to file reports on a weekly basis or a monthly basis.  It may require a State to submit only certain classes and categories of permit applications.  And it may include any additional terms and conditions that are relevant to the enforcement of the NPDES program.  There is ample room for judgment in all of these areas, and EPA has exercised such judgment in the past when approving MOAs from many States.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Approval of Application by Maine to Administer the NPDES Program, 66 Fed. Reg. 12791, (2001); Approval of Application by Maine to Administer the NPDES Program; Texas, 
63Fed. Reg.
51165 (1998).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In fact, in an earlier case raising a question similar to this one, see <em>American Forest &amp; Paper Assn.</em> v. <em>EPA</em>, 137 F. 3d 291, 298299 (CA5 1998), EPA itself explained how 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/40/123" class="subref" title="subref">40 CFR §123.24</a> gives it discretion over the approval of a State pollution control program, see Brief for EPA in No. 9660874 (CA5).  Arguing that [i]ndicia of discretionary involvement or control abound in [its] regulations, the agency listed its MOA regulation as a prime example.<a name="ZD-14ref" href="#ZD-14" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>14</b>
                </sup>
            </a>  Again, because EPAs approval of a State application to administer an NPDES program entails significantindeed, aboundingdiscretion, I would find that §7(a)(2) of the ESA applies even under the Courts own flawed theory of these cases.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    Mindful that judges must always remain faithful to the intent of the legislature, Chief Justice Burger closed his opinion in the snail darter case with a reminder that [o]nce the meaning of an enactment is discerned and its constitutionality determined, the judicial process comes to an end.  <em>Hill</em>, 437 U. S., at 194.  This Court offered a definitive interpretation of the Endangered Species Act nearly 30 years ago in that very case.  Today the Court turns its back on our decision in <em>Hill</em> and places a great number of endangered species in jeopardy, including the cactus ferruginous pygmy-owl and Pima pineapple cactus at issue here.  At the risk of plagiarizing Chief Justice Burgers fine opinion, I think it is appropriate to end my opinion just as he didwith a quotation attributed to Sir Thomas More that has as much relevance today as it did three decades ago.  This quotation illustrates not only the fundamental character of the rule of law embodied in §7 of the ESA but also the pernicious consequences of official disobedience of such a rule.  Repetition of that literary allusion is especially appropriate today:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">The law, Roper, the law.  I know whats legal, not whats right.  And Ill stick to whats legal. . . . Im <em>not</em> God.

Cut a great road through the law to get after the Devil? . . . And when the last law was down, and the Devil turned round on youwhere would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat? . . .

        <p class="bodytext">    Although its reasons have shifted over time, at both the administrative level and in the federal courts, EPA has insisted that the requirements of §7(a)(2) of the ESA do not apply to its decision to transfer permitting authority under §402(b) of the CWA.  See App. 114; Brief for Petitioner EPA 16, 42.  As I have explained above, that conclusion is contrary to the text of §7(a)(2), our decision in the <em>TVA</em> v. <em>Hill</em>, and the regulation on which the agency has since relied and upon which the Court relies on today.  Accordingly, I would hold that EPAs decision was arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act, see

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-2" href="#ZD-2ref">2</a> The Court misreads this sentence and, in so doing, overreads our decision in Hill.  Justice Alito maintains that Hill held that the acts appropriating funds to the TVA … did not require the agency to use any of the generally appropriated funds to complete the Tellico Dam project.  Ante, at 2324, n. 9.  But Hill said no such thing.  That case only held that the subsequent appropriation of funds for the Tellico Dam Project could not overcome the mandatory requirements of §7 of the ESA; it did not hold that the TVA would not have been required to spend any and all appropriated funds if the ESA had never been passed.  See Hill, 437 U. S., at 189190.  If the ESA had never been enacted and did not stand in the way of the completion of the Tellico Dam, there is no doubt that the TVA would have finished the project that Congress had funded.

Hill, O.T. 1977, No. 761701, p. 26.  Instead, the TVA sought to restrict §7 to only those actions for which the agency has reasonable decision-making alternatives before it.  Ibid.  We rejected that narrow interpretation, stating that the only way to sustain the TVAs position would be to ignore the ordinary meaning of plain language.  Hill, 437 U. S., at 173.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/541/752" class="subref" title="subref">541 U. S. 752</a> (2004)
,that an agency cannot be considered the legal cause of an action that it has no statutory discretion not to takesupports its reliance on §402.03.  Ante, at 20.  First of all, the Court itself recognizes that it must distance itself from that case, ibid., because Public Citizen dealt with a procedural requirement under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), not a substantive requirement like that imposed by §7(a)(2) of the ESA, see TVA v. Hill, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/437/158" class="subref" title="subref">437 U. S. 158</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">188</a>, n. 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">34</a> (1978)
 (holding that NEPA cases are completely inapposite to the ESA context).  What the Court does not recognize, however, is that what it views as the basic principle of Public Citizen is stated too broadly and therefore inapplicable to this case.  Ante, at 20.


Our decision in Public Citizen turned on what we called a critical feature of the case: that the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) had no ability to countermand the Presidents lifting a moratorium that prohibited certain motor carriers from obtaining authority to operate within the United States.  541 U. S., at 766.  Once the President decided to lift that moratorium, and once the relevant vehicles had entered the United States, FMCSA was required by statute to register the vehicles if certain conditions were met.  Ibid. (Under FMCSAs entirely reasonable reading of this provision, it must certify any motor carrier that can show that it is willing and able to comply with the various substantive requirements for safety and financial responsibility contained in DOT regulations; only the moratorium prevented it from doing so for Mexican motor carriers before 2001 (emphasis deleted)).  Therefore, any potential NEPA concerns were generated by another decisionmaker, the President, and not the FMCSA.  Here, by contrast, EPA is not required to act ministerially once another person or agency has made a decision.  Instead, EPA must exercise its own judgment when considering the transfer of NPDES authority to a State; it also has its own authority to deny such a transfer.  Any effect on endangered species will be caused, even if indirectly, by the agencys own decision to transfer NPDES authority.  Cf. 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.02</a> (providing that the ESA will apply to all agency activities that directly or indirectly caus[e] modifications to the land, water, or air (emphasis added)).

        <p class="bodytext">    These cases present a problem of conflicting shalls.  On the one hand, §402(b) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) provides that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) shall approve a States application to administer a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permitting program unless it determines that nine criteria are not satisfied.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1342.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §1342(b)</a>.  On the other hand, shortly after the passage of the CWA, Congress enacted §7(a)(2) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA), which commands that federal agencies shall insure that their actions do not jeopardize endangered species.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#a_2" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(a)(2)</a>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    When faced with competing statutory mandates, it is our duty to give full effect to both if at all possible.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Morton</em> v. <em>Mancari</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/417/535" class="subref" title="subref">417 U. S. 535</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">551</a> (1974)
 ([W]hen two statutes are capable of co-existence, it is the duty of the courts, absent a clearly expressed congressional intention to the contrary, to regard each as effective).  The Court fails at this task.  Its opinion unsuccessfully tries to reconcile the CWA and ESA by relying on a federal regulation, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a> (2006), which it reads as limiting the reach of §7(a)(2) to <em>only</em> discretionary federal actions, see <em>ante</em>, at 1719.  Not only is this reading inconsistent with the text and history of §402.03, but it is fundamentally inconsistent with the ESA itself.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In the celebrated snail darter case, <em>TVA</em> v. <em>Hill</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/437/153" class="subref" title="subref">437 U. S. 153</a> (1978)
, we held that the ESA reveals a conscious decision by Congress to give endangered species priority over the primary missions of federal agencies, <em>id</em>., at 185.  Consistent with that intent, Chief Justice Burgers exceptionally thorough and admirable opinion explained that §7 admits of<em></em>no exception.<em>  Id</em>., at 173.  Creating precisely such an exception by exempting nondiscretionary federal actions from the ESAs coverage, the Court whittles away at Congress comprehensive effort to protect endangered species from the risk of extinction and fails to give the Act its intended effect.  After first giving <em>Hill</em> the attention it deserves, I will comment further on the irrelevance of §402.03 to these cases and offer other available ways to give effect to both CWA and the ESA.  Having done so, I conclude by explaining why these cases should be remanded to the EPA for further proceedings.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">I</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In <em>Hill, </em>we were presented with two separate questions: (1) whether the ESA required a court to enjoin the operation of the nearly completed Tellico Dam and Reservoir Project because the Secretary of the Interior had determined that its operation would eradicate a small endangered fish known as a snail darter; and (2) whether post-1973 congressional appropriations for the completion of the Tellico Dam constituted an implied repeal of the ESA, at least insofar as it applied to the Dam.  437 U. S., at 156.  More than 30 pages of our opinion explain our affirmative answer to the first question, see <em>id.,</em> at 156188, but just over four pages sufficed to explain our negative answer to the second, see <em>id</em>., at 189193.  While it is our ruling on the first question that is relevant to the cases before us, it is our refusal to hold that the ESA itself had been impliedly repealed that the majority strangely deems most significant.  See <em>ante, </em>at 2122.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In answering <em>Hill</em>s first question,<em></em>we did not discuss implied repeals.  On the contrary, that portion of the opinion contained our definitive interpretation of the ESA, in which we concluded that the language, history, and structure of the [ESA] indicates beyond doubt that Congress intended endangered species to be afforded the highest of priorities.  437 U. S., at 174; see also <em>id</em>., at 177 ( The dominant theme pervading all Congressional discussion of the proposed [ESA] was the overriding need <em>to devote whatever effort and resources were necessary</em> to avoid further diminution of national and worldwide wildlife resources  (quoting Coggins, Conserving Wildlife Resources: An Overview of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, 
51N. D. L. Rev.
315,
321 (1975) (emphasis added in <em>Hill</em>))).  With respect to §7 in particular, our opinion could not have been any clearer.  We plainly held that it admits of<em> no exception</em>.  437 U. S., at 173 (emphasis added).<a name="ZD-1ref" href="#ZD-1" class="">

            </a>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Our opinion in <em>Hill </em>explained at length why §7 imposed obligations on all federal agencies to ensure that actions authorized, funded, or carried out by them do not jeopardize the continued existence of endangered species.  437 U. S., at 173 (emphasis deleted; internal quotation marks omitted).  Not a word in the opinion stated or suggested that §7 obligations are inapplicable to mandatory agency actions that would threaten the eradication of an endangered species.  Nor did the opinion describe the Tennessee Valley Authoritys (TVA) attempted completion of the Tellico Dam as a discretionary act.  How could it?  After all, if the Secretary of the Interior had not declared the snail darter an endangered species whose critical habitat would be destroyed by operation of the Tellico Dam, the TVA surely would have been obligated to spend the additional funds that Congress appropriated to complete the project.<a name="ZD-2ref" href="#ZD-2" class="">

                </sup>
            </a>  Unconcerned with whether an agency action was mandatory or discretionary, we simply held that §7 of the ESA</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> reveals an explicit congressional decision to require agencies to afford <em>first priority</em> to the declared national policy of saving endangered species.  The pointed omission of the type of qualifying language previously included in endangered species legislation reveals a conscious decision by Congress to give endangered species <em>priority over the </em><em>primary missions of federal agencies.</em>   <em>Id</em>., at 185 (emphasis added).<a name="ZD-3ref" href="#ZD-3" class="">

            </a>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The fact that we also concluded that the post-1973 congressional appropriations did not impliedly repeal the ESA provides no support for the majoritys contention that the obligations imposed by §7(a)(2) may be limited to discretionary acts.  A few passages from the relevant parts of <em>Hill</em> belie that suggestion.  After noting the oddity of holding that the interest in protecting the survival of a relatively small number of 3-inch fish would require the permanent halting of a virtually completed dam for which Congress has expended more than $100 million, we found that the explicit provisions of the Endangered Species Act require precisely that result.  <em>Id.,</em> at 172, 173.  We then continued:</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> One would be hard pressed to find a statutory provision whose terms were any plainer than those in §7 of the Endangered Species Act.  Its very words affirmatively command all federal agencies to <em>insure </em>that actions <em>authorized, funded,</em> or <em>carried out </em>by them do not <em>jeopardize </em>the continued existence of an endangered species or <em>result </em>in the destruction or modification of habitat of such species … .   <em>Id</em>., at 173 (quoting 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536</a> (1976 ed.) (emphasis added in <em>Hill</em>)).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
We also reviewed the ESAs history to identify a variety of exceptions that had been included in earlier legislation and unenacted proposals but were omitted from the final version of the 1973 statute.  We explained that earlier endangered species legislation qualified the obligation of federal agencies, but the 1973 Act purposefully omitted all phrases which might have qualified an agencys responsibilities.  437 U. S., at 181, 182.  Moreover, after observing that the ESA creates only a limited number of hardship exemptions, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1539.html" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1539</a>none of which would apply to federal agencieswe applied the maxim <em>expressio unius est expression alterius</em> to conclude that there are no exemptions in the Endangered Species Act for federal agencies,437 U. S., at 188.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Today, however, the Court countenances such an exemption.  It erroneously concludes that the ESA contains an unmentioned exception for nondiscretionary agency action and that the statutes command to enjoin the completion of the Tellico Dam depended on the unmentioned fact that the TVA was attempting to perform a discretionary act.  But both the text of the ESA and our opinion in <em>Hill</em> compel the contrary determination that Congress intended the ESA to apply to all federal agencies and to all actions authorized, funded, or carried out by them.  <em>Id.,</em> at 173 (emphasis deleted).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    A transfer of NPDES permitting authority under §402(b) of the CWA is undoubtedly one of those actions that is authorized or carried out by a federal agency.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(b)</a>;

Examples include, but are not limited to . . . actions directly or indirectly causing modifications to the land, water, or air).  It follows from <em>Hill </em>that §7(a)(2) applies to such NPDES transferswhether they are mandatory or discretionary.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    Given our unequivocal holding in <em>Hill</em> that the ESA has first priority over all other federal action, 437 U. S., at 185, if any statute should yield, it should be the CWA.  But no statute must yield unless it is truly incapable of coexistence.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Morton</em>, 417 U. S., at 551.  Therefore, assuming that §402(b) of the CWA contains its own mandatory command, we should first try to harmonize that provision with the mandatory requirements of §7(a)(2) of the ESA.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Courts solution is to rely on 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a>, which states that Section 7 and the requirements of this part apply to all actions in which there is discretionary Federal involvement or control.  The Court explains that this regulation harmonizes the statutes by giving effect to the ESAs no-jeopardy mandate whenever an agency has discretion to do so, but by lifting that mandate when the agency is forbidden from considering such extrastatutory factors.  <em>Ante</em>, at 17.  This is not harmony, and it certainly isnt effect.  Rather than giving genuine effect to §7(a)(2), the Court permits a wholesale limitation on the reach of the ESA.  Its interpretation of §402.03 conflicts with the text and history of the regulation, as well as our interpretation of §7 in the snail darter case.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    To begin with, the plain language of §402.03 does not state that its coverage is limited to discretionary actions.  Quite the opposite, the most natural reading of the text is that it confirms the broad construction of §7 endorsed by our opinion in <em>Hill</em>.  Indeed, the only way to read §402.03 in accordance with the facts of the case and our holding that §7 admits of no exception[s], 437 U. S., at 173, is that it eliminates any possible argument that the ESA does not extend to situations in which the discretionary federal involvement is only marginal.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court is simply mistaken when it says that it reads §402.03 to mean what it says: that §7(a)(2)s no-jeopardy duty covers <em>only</em> discretionary agency actions … .  <em>Ante,</em> at 21 (emphasis added).  That is not, in fact, what §402.03 says.  The word only is the Courts addition to the text, not the agencys.  Moreover, that text surely does not go on to say (as the Court does) that the duty does not attach to actions (like the NPDES permitting transfer authorization) that an agency is <em>required</em> by statute to undertake once certain specified triggering events have occurred. <em>Ibid.</em>  If the drafters of the regulation had intended such a far-reaching change in the law, surely they would have said so by using language similar to that which the Court uses today.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Nothing in the proceedings that led to the promulgation of the regulation suggests any reason for limiting the pre-existing understanding of the scope of §7s coverage.  EPA codified the current version of §402.03 in 1986 as part of a general redrafting of ESA regulations.  In the 1983 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the proposed version of §402.03 stated that §7 and the requirements of this Part apply to all actions in which there is Federal involvement or control.  
48Fed. Reg.
29999 (1983).  Without any explanation, the final rule inserted the word discretionary before Federal involvement or control.

            </a>  Clearly, if the Secretary of the Interior meant to limit the pre-existing understanding of the scope of the coverage of §7(a)(2) by promulgating this regulation, that intent would have been mentioned somewhere in the text of the regulations or in contemporaneous comment about them.

 (We have frequently reiterated that an agency must cogently explain why it has exercised its discretion in a given manner).  Yet, the final rule said nothing about limiting the reach of §7 or our decision in <em>Hill.  </em>Nor did it mention the change from the notice of proposed rulemaking.  I can only assume, then, that the regulation does mean what both it and the notice of proposed rulemaking says: Section 7(a)(2) applies to discretionary federal action, but not <em>only</em> to discretionary action.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The only explanation the agency provided for §402.03 was the following:</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> This section, which explains the applicability of section 7, implicitly covers Federal activities within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States and upon the high seas as a result of the definition of action in §402.02.  The explanation for the scope of the term action is provided in the discussion under §402.01 above.  51 Fed. Reg. 19937.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
This statement directs us to two sources: the definition of action in §402.02 and the explanation for the scope of the term action  in §402.01.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Both confirm that there was no intent to draw a distinction between discretionary and nondiscretionary actions.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Section 402.02 provides in relevant part:</p>
        <p class="bodytext"><em>Action </em>means <em>all</em> activities or programs <em>of any kind</em> authorized, funded, or carried out, in whole or in part, by Federal agencies in the United States or upon the high seas.  Examples include, but are not limited to:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    (a)actions intended to conserve listed species or their habitat;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    (b)the promulgation of regulations . . .   (second and third emphases added.)</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
Actions in either of the described sub-categories are sometimes mandatory and sometimes discretionary.  Likewise, as the italicized portions indicate, the term action expressly refers to all agency activities or programs of any kind, regardless of whether they are discretionary or mandatory.  By reading the term discretionary as a limitation on action, the Court creates a contradiction in the EPAs own regulation.<a name="ZD-5ref" href="#ZD-5" class="">

        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    As for the final rules explanation for the scope of the term action in §402.01, that too is fully consistent with my interpretation of §402.03.  That explanation plainly states that <em>all</em> Federal actions including conservations programs are subject to the consultation requirements of section 7(a)(2) if they may affect listed species or their critical habitats.  51 Fed. Reg. 19929 (emphasis added).  The regulation does not say all discretionary federal actions, nor does it evince an intent to limit the scope of §7(a)(2) in any way.  Rather, it just restates that the ESA applies to all federal actions, just as the notice of proposed rulemaking did.  This explanation of the scope of the word action is therefore a strong indication that the Courts reading of discretionary is contrary to its intended meaning.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    An even stronger indication is the fact that at no point in the administrative proceedings in these cases did EPA even mention<em></em>it.<a name="ZD-6ref" href="#ZD-6" class="">

            </a>  As an initial matter, it is worth emphasizing that even if EPA had relied on §402.03, its interpretation of the ESA would not be entitled to deference under <em>Chevron U. S. A. Inc.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/467/837" class="subref" title="subref">467 U. S. 837</a> (1984)
, because it is not charged with administering that statute, <em>id</em>., at 844 (We have long recognized that considerable weight should be accorded to an executive departments construction of a statutory scheme <em>it is entrusted to administer</em>. (emphasis added)); <em>Department of Treasury</em> v. <em>FLRA</em>, 837 F. 2d 1163, 1167 (CADC 1988) ([W]hen an agency interprets a statute other than that which it has been entrusted to administer, its interpretation is not entitled to deference).  The Departments of the Interior and Commerce, not EPA, are charged with administering the ESA.  See <em>Babbitt </em>v. <em>Sweet Home Chapter, Communities for Great Ore.,</em> 515 U. S., 687, 703704 (1995).  And EPA has conceded that the Department of the Interiors biological opinion did not discuss 50 CFR. 402.03, and it did not address the question whether the consultation that produced the [biological opinion] was required by the ESA.  Pet. for Cert. in No. 06549, p. 24; see App. 77124 (never mentioning §402.03).  Left with this unfavorable administrative record, EPA can only lean on the fact that the Department of the Interior has recently clarified its position regarding §402.03 in a <em>different</em> administrative proceeding.  See Pet. for Cert. in No. 06549, pp. 2425; <em>id</em>., at 26 (The recent F[ish and Wildlife Service] and N[ational Marine Fisheries Service] communications regarding Alaskas pending transfer application reflect those agencies considered interpretations . . . of [50 CFR] 402.03); App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06340, pp. 103a116a; see also <em>ante</em>, at 12 n. 5.  We have long held, however, that courts may not affirm an agency action on grounds other than those adopted by the agency in the administrative proceedings.  See <em>SEC</em> v. <em>Chenery Corp.</em>,

.  The majority ignores this hoary principle of administrative law and substitutes a post-hoc interpretation of §7(a)(2) and §402.03 for that of the relevant agency.  For that reason alone, these cases should be remanded to the agency.  And for the other reasons I have given, §402.03 cannot be used to harmonize the CWA and the ESA.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">III</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    There are at least two ways in which the CWA and the ESA can be given full effect without privileging one statute over the other.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">A</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The text of §7(a)(2) itself provides the first possible way of reconciling that provision with §402(b) of the CWA.   The subsection reads:</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> Each Federal agency shall, <em>in consultation with and with the assistance of the Secretary</em>, insure that any action authorized, funded, or carried out by such agency (hereinafter in this section referred to as an agency action) is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of habitat of such species which is determined by the Secretary, after consultation as appropriate with affected States, to be critical, unless such agency has been granted an exemption for such action by the Committee pursuant to subsection (h) of this section.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#a_2" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(a)(2)</a> (emphasis added).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court is certainly correct that the use of the word shall in §7(a)(2) imposes a mandatory requirement on the federal agencies.  See <em>ante</em>, at 14.  It is also correct that the ESAs mandate is to be carried out through consultation and may require the agency to adopt an alternative course of action.  <em>Ante,</em> at 15.  The Court is too quick to conclude, however, that this consultation requirement creates an irreconcilable conflict between this provision and §402(b) of the CWA.  It rushes to this flawed judgment because of a basic conceptual erroran error that is revealed as early as the first paragraph of its opinion.  Rather than attempting to find a way to give effect to §7(a)(2)s consultation requirement, the Court frames the question presented as whether §7(a)(2) effectively operates as a tenth criterion on which the transfer of permitting power under the first statute must be conditioned.   <em>Ante</em>, at 12.  The Court is not alone in this.  The author of the Ninth Circuit opinion below also stated that the ESA <em>adds</em> one requirement to the list of considerations under the Clean Water Act permitting transfer provision.  450 F. 3d, at 404 n. 2 (2006) (Berzon, J., concurring in denial of rehearing en banc) (emphasis in original).  But while the ESA does mandate that the relevant agencies consul[t] with the Interior Department, that consultation process also provides a way for the agencies to give effect to both statutes.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The first step in the statutory consultation process is to identify whether any endangered species will be affected by an agency action.  An agency proposing a particular action, such as an NPDES transfer, will typically ask the Secretary of the Interior whether any listed species may be present in the area of the proposed action and whether that action will affect those species.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#c" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(c)</a>.  It is entirely possible that no listed species will be affected, and any anticipated conflict between the ESA and another statute will have been avoided at this threshold stage.  If, however, the Secretary determines that a proposed action may affect an endangered species or its critical habitat, the agency must formally consult with the Secretary.  This consultation culminates in the issuance of a biological opinion, which detail[s] how the agency action affects the species or its critical habitat.  §1536(b)(3)(A); see also 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.14</a>(h).  Even at this stage, it is still possible that formal consultation will reveal that the agency action will not jeopardize any species.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 
63Fed. Reg.
51199 (1998) (noting that FWS rendered a no jeopardy finding with respect to the transfer of permitting authority to Texas).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    If the biological opinion concludes that the agency action would put a listed species in jeopardy, however, the ESA contains a process for resolving the competing demands of agency action and species protection.  The ESA provides that the Secretary shall suggest those reasonable and prudent alternatives which he believes would not violate subsection (a)(2) and can be taken by the Federal agency or applicant in implementing the agency action.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#b_3_A" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(b)(3)(A)</a>; see also 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.14</a>(h)(3).  The agencys regulations define [r]easonable and prudent alternatives as</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> alternative actions identified during formal consultation that can be implemented in a manner consistent with the intended purpose of the action, that can be implemented consistent with the scope of the Federal agencys legal authority and jurisdiction, that is economically and technologically feasible, and that the Director [of FWS] believes would avoid the likelihood of jeopardizing the continued existence of listed species or resulting in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat.   
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.02</a>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
Thus, in the face of any conflict between the ESA and another federal statute, the ESA and its implementing regulations encourage federal agencies to work out a reasonable alternative that would let the proposed action move forward consistent with [its] intended purpose and the agencys legal authority, while also avoiding any violation of  §7(a)(2).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    When applied to the NPDES transfer program, the reasonable and prudent alternatives process would enable EPA and the Department of the Interior to develop a substitute that would allow a transfer of permitting authority <em>and</em> would not jeopardize endangered species.  Stated differently, the consultation process would generate an alternative course of action whereby the transfer could still take placeas required by §402(b) of the CWAbut in such a way that would honor the mandatory requirements of §7(a)(2) of the ESA.  This should come as no surprise to EPA, as it has engaged in pre-transfer consultations at least six times in the past and has stated that it is not barred from doing so by the CWA.<a name="ZD-7ref" href="#ZD-7" class="">

        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Finally, for the rare case in which no reasonable and prudent alternative can be found, Congress has provided yet another mechanism for resolving any conflicts between the ESA and a proposed agency action.  In 1978, shortly after our decision in <em>Hill</em>, Congress amended the ESA to create the Endangered Species Committee, which it authorized to grant exemptions from §7(a)(2).  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#e" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(e)</a>.  Because it has the authority to approve the extinction of an endangered species, the Endangered Species Committee is colloquially described as the God Squad or God Committee.  In light of this weighty responsibility, Congress carefully laid out requirements for the God Committees membership,<a name="ZD-8ref" href="#ZD-8" class="">

            </a> and the factors it must consider in deciding whether to grant an exemption.<a name="ZD-10ref" href="#ZD-10" class="">

                    <b>10</b>

            </a>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    As the final arbiter in situations in which the ESA conflicts with a proposed agency action, the God Committee embodies the primacy of the ESAs mandate and serves as the final mechanism for harmonizing that Act with other federal statutes.  By creating this Committee, Congress recognized that some conflicts with the ESA may not be capable of resolution without having to forever sacrifice some endangered species.  At the same time, the creation of this last line of defense reflects Congress view that the ESA should not yield to another federal action except as a final resort and except when authorized by high level officials after serious consideration.  In short, when all else has failed and two federal statutes are incapable of resolution, Congress left the choice to the Committeenot to this Court; it did not limit the ESA in the way the majority does today.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">B</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    EPAs regulations offer a second way to harmonize the CWA with the ESA.  After EPA has transferred NPDES permitting authority to a State, the agency continues to oversee the States permitting program.  See <em>Arkansas</em> v. <em>Oklahoma</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/503/91" class="subref" title="subref">503 U. S. 91</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">105</a> (1992)
 (Congress preserved for the Administrator broad authority to oversee state permit programs).  If a state permit is outside the guidelines and the requirements of the CWA, EPA may object to it and block its issuance.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1342.html#d_2" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §1342(d)(2)</a>; 
66Fed. Reg.
11206 (2001).  Given these ongoing responsibilities, EPA has enacted a regulation that requires a State to enter into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) that sets forth the particulars of the agencys oversight duties.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/40/123" class="subref" title="subref">40 CFR §123.24</a>(a) (2006).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">The regulation governing MOAs contains several detailed requirements.  For instance, the regulation states that an MOA must contain [p]rovisions specifying classes and categories of permit applications, draft permits and proposed permits that the State will send to the [EPA] Regional Administrator for review, comment and, where applicable, objection, §123.24(b)(2); [p]rovisions specifying the frequency and content of reports, documents and other information which the State is required to submit to the EPA, §123.24(b)(3); and [p]rovisions for coordination of compliance monitoring activities by the State and by EPA, §123.24(b)(4)(i).  More generally, the regulation provides that an MOA may include other terms, conditions, or agreements that are relevant to the administration and enforcement of the States regulatory program.  §123.24(a).  Under the MOA regulation, furthermore, EPA will not approve any MOA that restricts its statutory oversight responsibility.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Like the §7(a)(2) consultation process described above, MOAs provide a potential mechanism for giving effect to §7 of the ESA while also allowing the transfer of permitting authority to a State.  It is important to remember that EPA must approve an MOA <em>prior to</em> the transfer of NPDES authority.  As such, EPA can useand in fact has usedthe MOA process to structure its later oversight in a way that will allow it to protect endangered species in accordance with §7(a)(2) of the ESA.  EPA might negotiate a provision in the MOA that would require a State to abide by the ESA requirements when issuing pollution permits.  See Brief for American Fisheries Society et al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 28. (In the Maine MOA, for example, EPA and the state agreed that state permits would protect ESA-listed species by ensuring compliance with state water quality standards).  Alternatively, EPA could require the state to provide copies of draft permits for discharges in particularly sensitive habitats such as those of ESA-listed species or for discharges that contain a pollutant that threatens ESA-listed wildlife.  <em>Id</em>., at 10.  Or the MOA might be drafted in a way that would allow the agency to object to state permits that would jeopardize any and all endangered species.  See<em> id</em>., at 28 (explaining that the Maine MOA includes a provision allowing EPA to object to any state permit that risks harm to a listed species by threatening water quality).  These are just three of many possibilities.  I need not identify other ways EPA could use the MOA process to comply with the ESA; it is enough to observe that MOAs provide a straightforward way to give the ESA its full effect without restricting §7(a)(2) in the way the Court does.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">IV</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    As discussed above, I believe that the Court incorrectly restricts the reach of §7(a)(2) to discretionary federal actions.  See Part II, <em>supra.</em>  Even if such a limitation were permissible, however, it is clear that EPAs authority to transfer permitting authority under §402(b) <em>is </em>discretionary.<a name="ZD-11ref" href="#ZD-11" class="">

            </a>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The EPA Administrators authority to approve state permit programs pursuant to §402(b) of the CWA does not even fit within the Courts description of the category of mandatory actions that the Court holds are covered by the ESA.  In the Courts words, that category includes actions that an agency is <em>required </em>by statute to undertake once certain specified triggering events have occurred.  <em>Ante</em>, at 22.  The triggering event for EPAs approval is simply the filing of a satisfactory description of the States proposed program.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1342.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §1342(b)</a>.  The statute then commands that the EPA Administrator shall approve the submitted program unless he determines that state law does not satisfy nine specified conditions.  Those conditions are not triggering events; they are potential objections to the exercise of the Administrators authority.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    What is more, §402(b) is a perfect example of why our analysis should not end simply because a statute uses the word shall.  Instead, we must look more closely at its listed criteria to determine whether they allow for discretion, despite the use of shall.  After all, as then-Justice Rehnquists dissenting opinion in the snail darter case explains, a federal statute using the word shall will sometimes allow room for discretion.  See <em>Hill</em>, 437 U. S. at 211212 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).<a name="ZD-12ref" href="#ZD-12" class="">
                <sup>

            </a>  In these cases, there is significant room for discretion in EPAs evaluation of §402(b)s nine conditions.  The first criterion, for example, requires the EPA Administrator to examine five other statutes and ensure that the State has adequate authority to comply with each.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1342.html#b_1_A" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §1342(b)(1)(A)</a>.  One of those five statutes, in turn, expressly directs the Administrator to exercise his judgment.  §1312.  Even the Court acknowledges that EPA must exercise some judgment in determining whether a State has demonstrated that it has the authority to carry out §402(b)s enumerated statutory criteria.  <em>Ante</em>, at 24.  However, in the very same breath, the Court states that the dispositive fact is that the statute clearly does not grant it the discretion to add another entirely separate prerequisite to that list.  <em>Ibid</em>.  This reasoning flouts the Courts own logic.  Under the Courts reading of §402.03, §7(a)(2) applies to discretionary federal actions of any kind.  The Court plainly acknowledges that EPA exercises discretion when deciding whether to transfer permitting authority to a State.  If we are to take the Courts approach seriously, once <em>any</em> discretion has been identifiedas it has here§7(a)(2) must apply.<a name="ZD-13ref" href="#ZD-13" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    The MOA regulation described in Part IIIB, <em>supra,</em> also demonstrates that an NPDES transfer is not as ministerial a task as the Court would suggest.  The agency retains significant discretion under §123.24 over the content of an MOA, which of course must be approved prior to a transfer. For instance, EPA may require a State to file reports on a weekly basis or a monthly basis.  It may require a State to submit only certain classes and categories of permit applications.  And it may include any additional terms and conditions that are relevant to the enforcement of the NPDES program.  There is ample room for judgment in all of these areas, and EPA has exercised such judgment in the past when approving MOAs from many States.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Approval of Application by Maine to Administer the NPDES Program, 66 Fed. Reg. 12791, (2001); Approval of Application by Maine to Administer the NPDES Program; Texas, 
63Fed. Reg.

        <p class="bodytext">    In fact, in an earlier case raising a question similar to this one, see <em>American Forest &amp; Paper Assn.</em> v. <em>EPA</em>, 137 F. 3d 291, 298299 (CA5 1998), EPA itself explained how 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/40/123" class="subref" title="subref">40 CFR §123.24</a> gives it discretion over the approval of a State pollution control program, see Brief for EPA in No. 9660874 (CA5).  Arguing that [i]ndicia of discretionary involvement or control abound in [its] regulations, the agency listed its MOA regulation as a prime example.<a name="ZD-14ref" href="#ZD-14" class="">

            </a>  Again, because EPAs approval of a State application to administer an NPDES program entails significantindeed, aboundingdiscretion, I would find that §7(a)(2) of the ESA applies even under the Courts own flawed theory of these cases.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    Mindful that judges must always remain faithful to the intent of the legislature, Chief Justice Burger closed his opinion in the snail darter case with a reminder that [o]nce the meaning of an enactment is discerned and its constitutionality determined, the judicial process comes to an end.  <em>Hill</em>, 437 U. S., at 194.  This Court offered a definitive interpretation of the Endangered Species Act nearly 30 years ago in that very case.  Today the Court turns its back on our decision in <em>Hill</em> and places a great number of endangered species in jeopardy, including the cactus ferruginous pygmy-owl and Pima pineapple cactus at issue here.  At the risk of plagiarizing Chief Justice Burgers fine opinion, I think it is appropriate to end my opinion just as he didwith a quotation attributed to Sir Thomas More that has as much relevance today as it did three decades ago.  This quotation illustrates not only the fundamental character of the rule of law embodied in §7 of the ESA but also the pernicious consequences of official disobedience of such a rule.  Repetition of that literary allusion is especially appropriate today:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">The law, Roper, the law.  I know whats legal, not whats right.  And Ill stick to whats legal. . . . Im <em>not</em> God.

Cut a great road through the law to get after the Devil? . . . And when the last law was down, and the Devil turned round on youwhere would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat? . . .

        <p class="bodytext">    Although its reasons have shifted over time, at both the administrative level and in the federal courts, EPA has insisted that the requirements of §7(a)(2) of the ESA do not apply to its decision to transfer permitting authority under §402(b) of the CWA.  See App. 114; Brief for Petitioner EPA 16, 42.  As I have explained above, that conclusion is contrary to the text of §7(a)(2), our decision in the <em>TVA</em> v. <em>Hill</em>, and the regulation on which the agency has since relied and upon which the Court relies on today.  Accordingly, I would hold that EPAs decision was arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/5/706.html#2_A" class="subref" title="subref">5 U. S. C. §706(2)(A)</a>, and would remand to the agency for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-2" href="#ZD-2ref">2</a> The Court misreads this sentence and, in so doing, overreads our decision in Hill.  Justice Alito maintains that Hill held that the acts appropriating funds to the TVA … did not require the agency to use any of the generally appropriated funds to complete the Tellico Dam project.  Ante, at 2324, n. 9.  But Hill said no such thing.  That case only held that the subsequent appropriation of funds for the Tellico Dam Project could not overcome the mandatory requirements of §7 of the ESA; it did not hold that the TVA would not have been required to spend any and all appropriated funds if the ESA had never been passed.  See Hill, 437 U. S., at 189190.  If the ESA had never been enacted and did not stand in the way of the completion of the Tellico Dam, there is no doubt that the TVA would have finished the project that Congress had funded.

We rejected that narrow interpretation, stating that the only way to sustain the TVAs position would be to ignore the ordinary meaning of plain language.  Hill, 437 U. S., at 173.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/541/752" class="subref" title="subref">541 U. S. 752</a> (2004)
,that an agency cannot be considered the legal cause of an action that it has no statutory discretion not to takesupports its reliance on §402.03.  Ante, at 20.  First of all, the Court itself recognizes that it must distance itself from that case, ibid., because Public Citizen dealt with a procedural requirement under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), not a substantive requirement like that imposed by §7(a)(2) of the ESA, see TVA v. Hill, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/437/158" class="subref" title="subref">437 U. S. 158</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">188</a>, n. 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">34</a> (1978)
 (holding that NEPA cases are completely inapposite to the ESA context).  What the Court does not recognize, however, is that what it views as the basic principle of Public Citizen is stated too broadly and therefore inapplicable to this case.  Ante, at 20.


Our decision in Public Citizen turned on what we called a critical feature of the case: that the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) had no ability to countermand the Presidents lifting a moratorium that prohibited certain motor carriers from obtaining authority to operate within the United States.  541 U. S., at 766.  Once the President decided to lift that moratorium, and once the relevant vehicles had entered the United States, FMCSA was required by statute to register the vehicles if certain conditions were met.  Ibid. (Under FMCSAs entirely reasonable reading of this provision, it must certify any motor carrier that can show that it is willing and able to comply with the various substantive requirements for safety and financial responsibility contained in DOT regulations; only the moratorium prevented it from doing so for Mexican motor carriers before 2001 (emphasis deleted)).  Therefore, any potential NEPA concerns were generated by another decisionmaker, the President, and not the FMCSA.  Here, by contrast, EPA is not required to act ministerially once another person or agency has made a decision.  Instead, EPA must exercise its own judgment when considering the transfer of NPDES authority to a State; it also has its own authority to deny such a transfer.  Any effect on endangered species will be caused, even if indirectly, by the agencys own decision to transfer NPDES authority.  Cf.

On the other hand, shortly after the passage of the CWA, Congress enacted §7(a)(2) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA), which commands that federal agencies shall insure that their actions do not jeopardize endangered species.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#a_2" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(a)(2)</a>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    When faced with competing statutory mandates, it is our duty to give full effect to both if at all possible.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Morton</em> v. <em>Mancari</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/417/535" class="subref" title="subref">417 U. S. 535</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">551</a> (1974)
 ([W]hen two statutes are capable of co-existence, it is the duty of the courts, absent a clearly expressed congressional intention to the contrary, to regard each as effective).  The Court fails at this task.  Its opinion unsuccessfully tries to reconcile the CWA and ESA by relying on a federal regulation, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a> (2006), which it reads as limiting the reach of §7(a)(2) to <em>only</em> discretionary federal actions, see <em>ante</em>, at 1719.  Not only is this reading inconsistent with the text and history of §402.03, but it is fundamentally inconsistent with the ESA itself.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In the celebrated snail darter case, <em>TVA</em> v. <em>Hill</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/437/153" class="subref" title="subref">437 U. S. 153</a> (1978)
, we held that the ESA reveals a conscious decision by Congress to give endangered species priority over the primary missions of federal agencies, <em>id</em>., at 185.  Consistent with that intent, Chief Justice Burgers exceptionally thorough and admirable opinion explained that §7 admits of<em></em>no exception.<em>  Id</em>., at 173.  Creating precisely such an exception by exempting nondiscretionary federal actions from the ESAs coverage, the Court whittles away at Congress comprehensive effort to protect endangered species from the risk of extinction and fails to give the Act its intended effect.  After first giving <em>Hill</em> the attention it deserves, I will comment further on the irrelevance of §402.03 to these cases and offer other available ways to give effect to both CWA and the ESA.  Having done so, I conclude by explaining why these cases should be remanded to the EPA for further proceedings.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">I</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In <em>Hill, </em>we were presented with two separate questions: (1) whether the ESA required a court to enjoin the operation of the nearly completed Tellico Dam and Reservoir Project because the Secretary of the Interior had determined that its operation would eradicate a small endangered fish known as a snail darter; and (2) whether post-1973 congressional appropriations for the completion of the Tellico Dam constituted an implied repeal of the ESA, at least insofar as it applied to the Dam.  437 U. S., at 156.  More than 30 pages of our opinion explain our affirmative answer to the first question, see <em>id.,</em> at 156188, but just over four pages sufficed to explain our negative answer to the second, see <em>id</em>., at 189193.  While it is our ruling on the first question that is relevant to the cases before us, it is our refusal to hold that the ESA itself had been impliedly repealed that the majority strangely deems most significant.  See <em>ante, </em>at 2122.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In answering <em>Hill</em>s first question,<em></em>we did not discuss implied repeals.  On the contrary, that portion of the opinion contained our definitive interpretation of the ESA, in which we concluded that the language, history, and structure of the [ESA] indicates beyond doubt that Congress intended endangered species to be afforded the highest of priorities.  437 U. S., at 174; see also <em>id</em>., at 177 ( The dominant theme pervading all Congressional discussion of the proposed [ESA] was the overriding need <em>to devote whatever effort and resources were necessary</em> to avoid further diminution of national and worldwide wildlife resources  (quoting Coggins, Conserving Wildlife Resources: An Overview of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, 
51N. D. L. Rev.
315,
321 (1975) (emphasis added in <em>Hill</em>))).  With respect to §7 in particular, our opinion could not have been any clearer.  We plainly held that it admits of<em> no exception</em>.  437 U. S., at 173 (emphasis added).<a name="ZD-1ref" href="#ZD-1" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    Our opinion in <em>Hill </em>explained at length why §7 imposed obligations on all federal agencies to ensure that actions authorized, funded, or carried out by them do not jeopardize the continued existence of endangered species.  437 U. S., at 173 (emphasis deleted; internal quotation marks omitted).  Not a word in the opinion stated or suggested that §7 obligations are inapplicable to mandatory agency actions that would threaten the eradication of an endangered species.  Nor did the opinion describe the Tennessee Valley Authoritys (TVA) attempted completion of the Tellico Dam as a discretionary act.  How could it?  After all, if the Secretary of the Interior had not declared the snail darter an endangered species whose critical habitat would be destroyed by operation of the Tellico Dam, the TVA surely would have been obligated to spend the additional funds that Congress appropriated to complete the project.<a name="ZD-2ref" href="#ZD-2" class="">

            </a>  Unconcerned with whether an agency action was mandatory or discretionary, we simply held that §7 of the ESA</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> reveals an explicit congressional decision to require agencies to afford <em>first priority</em> to the declared national policy of saving endangered species.  The pointed omission of the type of qualifying language previously included in endangered species legislation reveals a conscious decision by Congress to give endangered species <em>priority over the </em><em>primary missions of federal agencies.</em>   <em>Id</em>., at 185 (emphasis added).<a name="ZD-3ref" href="#ZD-3" class="">

        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The fact that we also concluded that the post-1973 congressional appropriations did not impliedly repeal the ESA provides no support for the majoritys contention that the obligations imposed by §7(a)(2) may be limited to discretionary acts.  A few passages from the relevant parts of <em>Hill</em> belie that suggestion.  After noting the oddity of holding that the interest in protecting the survival of a relatively small number of 3-inch fish would require the permanent halting of a virtually completed dam for which Congress has expended more than $100 million, we found that the explicit provisions of the Endangered Species Act require precisely that result.  <em>Id.,</em> at 172, 173.  We then continued:</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> One would be hard pressed to find a statutory provision whose terms were any plainer than those in §7 of the Endangered Species Act.  Its very words affirmatively command all federal agencies to <em>insure </em>that actions <em>authorized, funded,</em> or <em>carried out </em>by them do not <em>jeopardize </em>the continued existence of an endangered species or <em>result </em>in the destruction or modification of habitat of such species … .   <em>Id</em>., at 173 (quoting 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536</a> (1976 ed.) (emphasis added in <em>Hill</em>)).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
We also reviewed the ESAs history to identify a variety of exceptions that had been included in earlier legislation and unenacted proposals but were omitted from the final version of the 1973 statute.  We explained that earlier endangered species legislation qualified the obligation of federal agencies, but the 1973 Act purposefully omitted all phrases which might have qualified an agencys responsibilities.  437 U. S., at 181, 182.  Moreover, after observing that the ESA creates only a limited number of hardship exemptions, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1539.html" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1539</a>none of which would apply to federal agencieswe applied the maxim <em>expressio unius est expression alterius</em> to conclude that there are no exemptions in the Endangered Species Act for federal agencies,437 U. S., at 188.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Today, however, the Court countenances such an exemption.  It erroneously concludes that the ESA contains an unmentioned exception for nondiscretionary agency action and that the statutes command to enjoin the completion of the Tellico Dam depended on the unmentioned fact that the TVA was attempting to perform a discretionary act.  But both the text of the ESA and our opinion in <em>Hill</em> compel the contrary determination that Congress intended the ESA to apply to all federal agencies and to all actions authorized, funded, or carried out by them.  <em>Id.,</em> at 173 (emphasis deleted).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    A transfer of NPDES permitting authority under §402(b) of the CWA is undoubtedly one of those actions that is authorized or carried out by a federal agency.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(b)</a>; 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.02</a> (defining action as all activities or programs of any kind authorized, funded, or carried out, in whole or in part, by Federal agencies in the United States or upon the high seas.  Examples include, but are not limited to . . . actions directly or indirectly causing modifications to the land, water, or air).  It follows from <em>Hill </em>that §7(a)(2) applies to such NPDES transferswhether they are mandatory or discretionary.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">II</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Given our unequivocal holding in <em>Hill</em> that the ESA has first priority over all other federal action, 437 U. S., at 185, if any statute should yield, it should be the CWA.  But no statute must yield unless it is truly incapable of coexistence.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Morton</em>, 417 U. S., at 551.  Therefore, assuming that §402(b) of the CWA contains its own mandatory command, we should first try to harmonize that provision with the mandatory requirements of §7(a)(2) of the ESA.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Courts solution is to rely on 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a>, which states that Section 7 and the requirements of this part apply to all actions in which there is discretionary Federal involvement or control.  The Court explains that this regulation harmonizes the statutes by giving effect to the ESAs no-jeopardy mandate whenever an agency has discretion to do so, but by lifting that mandate when the agency is forbidden from considering such extrastatutory factors.  <em>Ante</em>, at 17.  This is not harmony, and it certainly isnt effect.  Rather than giving genuine effect to §7(a)(2), the Court permits a wholesale limitation on the reach of the ESA.  Its interpretation of §402.03 conflicts with the text and history of the regulation, as well as our interpretation of §7 in the snail darter case.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    To begin with, the plain language of §402.03 does not state that its coverage is limited to discretionary actions.  Quite the opposite, the most natural reading of the text is that it confirms the broad construction of §7 endorsed by our opinion in <em>Hill</em>.  Indeed, the only way to read §402.03 in accordance with the facts of the case and our holding that §7 admits of no exception[s], 437 U. S., at 173, is that it eliminates any possible argument that the ESA does not extend to situations in which the discretionary federal involvement is only marginal.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court is simply mistaken when it says that it reads §402.03 to mean what it says: that §7(a)(2)s no-jeopardy duty covers <em>only</em> discretionary agency actions … .  <em>Ante,</em> at 21 (emphasis added).  That is not, in fact, what §402.03 says.  The word only is the Courts addition to the text, not the agencys.  Moreover, that text surely does not go on to say (as the Court does) that the duty does not attach to actions (like the NPDES permitting transfer authorization) that an agency is <em>required</em> by statute to undertake once certain specified triggering events have occurred. <em>Ibid.</em>  If the drafters of the regulation had intended such a far-reaching change in the law, surely they would have said so by using language similar to that which the Court uses today.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Nothing in the proceedings that led to the promulgation of the regulation suggests any reason for limiting the pre-existing understanding of the scope of §7s coverage.  EPA codified the current version of §402.03 in 1986 as part of a general redrafting of ESA regulations.  In the 1983 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the proposed version of §402.03 stated that §7 and the requirements of this Part apply to all actions in which there is Federal involvement or control.  
48Fed. Reg.
29999 (1983).  Without any explanation, the final rule inserted the word discretionary before Federal involvement or control.  
51Fed. Reg.
19958 (1986).<a name="ZD-4ref" href="#ZD-4" class="">

            </a>  Clearly, if the Secretary of the Interior meant to limit the pre-existing understanding of the scope of the coverage of §7(a)(2) by promulgating this regulation, that intent would have been mentioned somewhere in the text of the regulations or in contemporaneous comment about them.

 (We have frequently reiterated that an agency must cogently explain why it has exercised its discretion in a given manner).  Yet, the final rule said nothing about limiting the reach of §7 or our decision in <em>Hill.  </em>Nor did it mention the change from the notice of proposed rulemaking.  I can only assume, then, that the regulation does mean what both it and the notice of proposed rulemaking says: Section 7(a)(2) applies to discretionary federal action, but not <em>only</em> to discretionary action.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The only explanation the agency provided for §402.03 was the following:</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> This section, which explains the applicability of section 7, implicitly covers Federal activities within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States and upon the high seas as a result of the definition of action in §402.02.  The explanation for the scope of the term action is provided in the discussion under §402.01 above.  51 Fed. Reg. 19937.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
This statement directs us to two sources: the definition of action in §402.02 and the explanation for the scope of the term action  in §402.01.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Both confirm that there was no intent to draw a distinction between discretionary and nondiscretionary actions.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Section 402.02 provides in relevant part:</p>
        <p class="bodytext"><em>Action </em>means <em>all</em> activities or programs <em>of any kind</em> authorized, funded, or carried out, in whole or in part, by Federal agencies in the United States or upon the high seas.  Examples include, but are not limited to:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    (a)actions intended to conserve listed species or their habitat;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    (b)the promulgation of regulations . . .   (second and third emphases added.)</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
Actions in either of the described sub-categories are sometimes mandatory and sometimes discretionary.  Likewise, as the italicized portions indicate, the term action expressly refers to all agency activities or programs of any kind, regardless of whether they are discretionary or mandatory.  By reading the term discretionary as a limitation on action, the Court creates a contradiction in the EPAs own regulation.<a name="ZD-5ref" href="#ZD-5" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>5</b>

            </a>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    As for the final rules explanation for the scope of the term action in §402.01, that too is fully consistent with my interpretation of §402.03.  That explanation plainly states that <em>all</em> Federal actions including conservations programs are subject to the consultation requirements of section 7(a)(2) if they may affect listed species or their critical habitats.  51 Fed. Reg. 19929 (emphasis added).  The regulation does not say all discretionary federal actions, nor does it evince an intent to limit the scope of §7(a)(2) in any way.  Rather, it just restates that the ESA applies to all federal actions, just as the notice of proposed rulemaking did.  This explanation of the scope of the word action is therefore a strong indication that the Courts reading of discretionary is contrary to its intended meaning.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    An even stronger indication is the fact that at no point in the administrative proceedings in these cases did EPA even mention<em></em>it.<a name="ZD-6ref" href="#ZD-6" class="">

            </a>  As an initial matter, it is worth emphasizing that even if EPA had relied on §402.03, its interpretation of the ESA would not be entitled to deference under <em>Chevron U. S. A. Inc.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/467/837" class="subref" title="subref">467 U. S. 837</a> (1984)
, because it is not charged with administering that statute, <em>id</em>., at 844 (We have long recognized that considerable weight should be accorded to an executive departments construction of a statutory scheme <em>it is entrusted to administer</em>. (emphasis added)); <em>Department of Treasury</em> v. <em>FLRA</em>, 837 F. 2d 1163, 1167 (CADC 1988) ([W]hen an agency interprets a statute other than that which it has been entrusted to administer, its interpretation is not entitled to deference).  The Departments of the Interior and Commerce, not EPA, are charged with administering the ESA.  See <em>Babbitt </em>v. <em>Sweet Home Chapter, Communities for Great Ore.,</em> 515 U. S., 687, 703704 (1995).  And EPA has conceded that the Department of the Interiors biological opinion did not discuss 50 CFR. 402.03, and it did not address the question whether the consultation that produced the [biological opinion] was required by the ESA.  Pet. for Cert. in No. 06549, p. 24; see App. 77124 (never mentioning §402.03).  Left with this unfavorable administrative record, EPA can only lean on the fact that the Department of the Interior has recently clarified its position regarding §402.03 in a <em>different</em> administrative proceeding.  See Pet. for Cert. in No. 06549, pp. 2425; <em>id</em>., at 26 (The recent F[ish and Wildlife Service] and N[ational Marine Fisheries Service] communications regarding Alaskas pending transfer application reflect those agencies considered interpretations . . . of [50 CFR] 402.03); App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06340, pp. 103a116a; see also <em>ante</em>, at 12 n. 5.  We have long held, however, that courts may not affirm an agency action on grounds other than those adopted by the agency in the administrative proceedings.  See <em>SEC</em> v. <em>Chenery Corp.</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/318/80" class="subref" title="subref">318 U. S. 80</a>,

.  The majority ignores this hoary principle of administrative law and substitutes a post-hoc interpretation of §7(a)(2) and §402.03 for that of the relevant agency.  For that reason alone, these cases should be remanded to the agency.  And for the other reasons I have given, §402.03 cannot be used to harmonize the CWA and the ESA.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">III</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    There are at least two ways in which the CWA and the ESA can be given full effect without privileging one statute over the other.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">A</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The text of §7(a)(2) itself provides the first possible way of reconciling that provision with §402(b) of the CWA.   The subsection reads:</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> Each Federal agency shall, <em>in consultation with and with the assistance of the Secretary</em>, insure that any action authorized, funded, or carried out by such agency (hereinafter in this section referred to as an agency action) is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of habitat of such species which is determined by the Secretary, after consultation as appropriate with affected States, to be critical, unless such agency has been granted an exemption for such action by the Committee pursuant to subsection (h) of this section.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#a_2" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(a)(2)</a> (emphasis added).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court is certainly correct that the use of the word shall in §7(a)(2) imposes a mandatory requirement on the federal agencies.  See <em>ante</em>, at 14.  It is also correct that the ESAs mandate is to be carried out through consultation and may require the agency to adopt an alternative course of action.  <em>Ante,</em> at 15.  The Court is too quick to conclude, however, that this consultation requirement creates an irreconcilable conflict between this provision and §402(b) of the CWA.  It rushes to this flawed judgment because of a basic conceptual erroran error that is revealed as early as the first paragraph of its opinion.  Rather than attempting to find a way to give effect to §7(a)(2)s consultation requirement, the Court frames the question presented as whether §7(a)(2) effectively operates as a tenth criterion on which the transfer of permitting power under the first statute must be conditioned.   <em>Ante</em>, at 12.  The Court is not alone in this.  The author of the Ninth Circuit opinion below also stated that the ESA <em>adds</em> one requirement to the list of considerations under the Clean Water Act permitting transfer provision.  450 F. 3d, at 404 n. 2 (2006) (Berzon, J., concurring in denial of rehearing en banc) (emphasis in original).  But while the ESA does mandate that the relevant agencies consul[t] with the Interior Department, that consultation process also provides a way for the agencies to give effect to both statutes.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The first step in the statutory consultation process is to identify whether any endangered species will be affected by an agency action.  An agency proposing a particular action, such as an NPDES transfer, will typically ask the Secretary of the Interior whether any listed species may be present in the area of the proposed action and whether that action will affect those species.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#c" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(c)</a>.  It is entirely possible that no listed species will be affected, and any anticipated conflict between the ESA and another statute will have been avoided at this threshold stage.  If, however, the Secretary determines that a proposed action may affect an endangered species or its critical habitat, the agency must formally consult with the Secretary.  This consultation culminates in the issuance of a biological opinion, which detail[s] how the agency action affects the species or its critical habitat.  §1536(b)(3)(A); see also 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.14</a>(h).  Even at this stage, it is still possible that formal consultation will reveal that the agency action will not jeopardize any species.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 
63Fed. Reg.
51199 (1998) (noting that FWS rendered a no jeopardy finding with respect to the transfer of permitting authority to Texas).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    If the biological opinion concludes that the agency action would put a listed species in jeopardy, however, the ESA contains a process for resolving the competing demands of agency action and species protection.  The ESA provides that the Secretary shall suggest those reasonable and prudent alternatives which he believes would not violate subsection (a)(2) and can be taken by the Federal agency or applicant in implementing the agency action.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.14</a>(h)(3).  The agencys regulations define [r]easonable and prudent alternatives as</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> alternative actions identified during formal consultation that can be implemented in a manner consistent with the intended purpose of the action, that can be implemented consistent with the scope of the Federal agencys legal authority and jurisdiction, that is economically and technologically feasible, and that the Director [of FWS] believes would avoid the likelihood of jeopardizing the continued existence of listed species or resulting in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat.   
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.02</a>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
Thus, in the face of any conflict between the ESA and another federal statute, the ESA and its implementing regulations encourage federal agencies to work out a reasonable alternative that would let the proposed action move forward consistent with [its] intended purpose and the agencys legal authority, while also avoiding any violation of  §7(a)(2).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    When applied to the NPDES transfer program, the reasonable and prudent alternatives process would enable EPA and the Department of the Interior to develop a substitute that would allow a transfer of permitting authority <em>and</em> would not jeopardize endangered species.  Stated differently, the consultation process would generate an alternative course of action whereby the transfer could still take placeas required by §402(b) of the CWAbut in such a way that would honor the mandatory requirements of §7(a)(2) of the ESA.  This should come as no surprise to EPA, as it has engaged in pre-transfer consultations at least six times in the past and has stated that it is not barred from doing so by the CWA.<a name="ZD-7ref" href="#ZD-7" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    Finally, for the rare case in which no reasonable and prudent alternative can be found, Congress has provided yet another mechanism for resolving any conflicts between the ESA and a proposed agency action.  In 1978, shortly after our decision in <em>Hill</em>, Congress amended the ESA to create the Endangered Species Committee, which it authorized to grant exemptions from §7(a)(2).  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#e" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(e)</a>.  Because it has the authority to approve the extinction of an endangered species, the Endangered Species Committee is colloquially described as the God Squad or God Committee.  In light of this weighty responsibility, Congress carefully laid out requirements for the God Committees membership,<a name="ZD-8ref" href="#ZD-8" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    As the final arbiter in situations in which the ESA conflicts with a proposed agency action, the God Committee embodies the primacy of the ESAs mandate and serves as the final mechanism for harmonizing that Act with other federal statutes.  By creating this Committee, Congress recognized that some conflicts with the ESA may not be capable of resolution without having to forever sacrifice some endangered species.  At the same time, the creation of this last line of defense reflects Congress view that the ESA should not yield to another federal action except as a final resort and except when authorized by high level officials after serious consideration.  In short, when all else has failed and two federal statutes are incapable of resolution, Congress left the choice to the Committeenot to this Court; it did not limit the ESA in the way the majority does today.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">B</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    EPAs regulations offer a second way to harmonize the CWA with the ESA.  After EPA has transferred NPDES permitting authority to a State, the agency continues to oversee the States permitting program.  See <em>Arkansas</em> v. <em>Oklahoma</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/503/91" class="subref" title="subref">503 U. S. 91</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">105</a> (1992)
 (Congress preserved for the Administrator broad authority to oversee state permit programs).  If a state permit is outside the guidelines and the requirements of the CWA, EPA may object to it and block its issuance.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1342.html#d_2" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §1342(d)(2)</a>; 
66Fed. Reg.
11206 (2001).  Given these ongoing responsibilities, EPA has enacted a regulation that requires a State to enter into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) that sets forth the particulars of the agencys oversight duties.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/40/123" class="subref" title="subref">40 CFR §123.24</a>(a) (2006).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">The regulation governing MOAs contains several detailed requirements.  For instance, the regulation states that an MOA must contain [p]rovisions specifying classes and categories of permit applications, draft permits and proposed permits that the State will send to the [EPA] Regional Administrator for review, comment and, where applicable, objection, §123.24(b)(2); [p]rovisions specifying the frequency and content of reports, documents and other information which the State is required to submit to the EPA, §123.24(b)(3); and [p]rovisions for coordination of compliance monitoring activities by the State and by EPA, §123.24(b)(4)(i).  More generally, the regulation provides that an MOA may include other terms, conditions, or agreements that are relevant to the administration and enforcement of the States regulatory program.  §123.24(a).  Under the MOA regulation, furthermore, EPA will not approve any MOA that restricts its statutory oversight responsibility.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Like the §7(a)(2) consultation process described above, MOAs provide a potential mechanism for giving effect to §7 of the ESA while also allowing the transfer of permitting authority to a State.  It is important to remember that EPA must approve an MOA <em>prior to</em> the transfer of NPDES authority.  As such, EPA can useand in fact has usedthe MOA process to structure its later oversight in a way that will allow it to protect endangered species in accordance with §7(a)(2) of the ESA.  EPA might negotiate a provision in the MOA that would require a State to abide by the ESA requirements when issuing pollution permits.  See Brief for American Fisheries Society et al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 28. (In the Maine MOA, for example, EPA and the state agreed that state permits would protect ESA-listed species by ensuring compliance with state water quality standards).  Alternatively, EPA could require the state to provide copies of draft permits for discharges in particularly sensitive habitats such as those of ESA-listed species or for discharges that contain a pollutant that threatens ESA-listed wildlife.  <em>Id</em>., at 10.  Or the MOA might be drafted in a way that would allow the agency to object to state permits that would jeopardize any and all endangered species.  See<em> id</em>., at 28 (explaining that the Maine MOA includes a provision allowing EPA to object to any state permit that risks harm to a listed species by threatening water quality).  These are just three of many possibilities.  I need not identify other ways EPA could use the MOA process to comply with the ESA; it is enough to observe that MOAs provide a straightforward way to give the ESA its full effect without restricting §7(a)(2) in the way the Court does.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">IV</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    As discussed above, I believe that the Court incorrectly restricts the reach of §7(a)(2) to discretionary federal actions.  See Part II, <em>supra.</em>  Even if such a limitation were permissible, however, it is clear that EPAs authority to transfer permitting authority under §402(b) <em>is </em>discretionary.<a name="ZD-11ref" href="#ZD-11" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>11</b>

            </a>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The EPA Administrators authority to approve state permit programs pursuant to §402(b) of the CWA does not even fit within the Courts description of the category of mandatory actions that the Court holds are covered by the ESA.  In the Courts words, that category includes actions that an agency is <em>required </em>by statute to undertake once certain specified triggering events have occurred.  <em>Ante</em>, at 22.  The triggering event for EPAs approval is simply the filing of a satisfactory description of the States proposed program.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1342.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §1342(b)</a>.  The statute then commands that the EPA Administrator shall approve the submitted program unless he determines that state law does not satisfy nine specified conditions.  Those conditions are not triggering events; they are potential objections to the exercise of the Administrators authority.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    What is more, §402(b) is a perfect example of why our analysis should not end simply because a statute uses the word shall.  Instead, we must look more closely at its listed criteria to determine whether they allow for discretion, despite the use of shall.  After all, as then-Justice Rehnquists dissenting opinion in the snail darter case explains, a federal statute using the word shall will sometimes allow room for discretion.  See <em>Hill</em>, 437 U. S. at 211212 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).<a name="ZD-12ref" href="#ZD-12" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>12</b>
                </sup>
            </a>  In these cases, there is significant room for discretion in EPAs evaluation of §402(b)s nine conditions.  The first criterion, for example, requires the EPA Administrator to examine five other statutes and ensure that the State has adequate authority to comply with each.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1342.html#b_1_A" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §1342(b)(1)(A)</a>.  One of those five statutes, in turn, expressly directs the Administrator to exercise his judgment.  §1312.  Even the Court acknowledges that EPA must exercise some judgment in determining whether a State has demonstrated that it has the authority to carry out §402(b)s enumerated statutory criteria.  <em>Ante</em>, at 24.  However, in the very same breath, the Court states that the dispositive fact is that the statute clearly does not grant it the discretion to add another entirely separate prerequisite to that list.  <em>Ibid</em>.  This reasoning flouts the Courts own logic.  Under the Courts reading of §402.03, §7(a)(2) applies to discretionary federal actions of any kind.  The Court plainly acknowledges that EPA exercises discretion when deciding whether to transfer permitting authority to a State.  If we are to take the Courts approach seriously, once <em>any</em> discretion has been identifiedas it has here§7(a)(2) must apply.<a name="ZD-13ref" href="#ZD-13" class="">

            </a>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The MOA regulation described in Part IIIB, <em>supra,</em> also demonstrates that an NPDES transfer is not as ministerial a task as the Court would suggest.  The agency retains significant discretion under §123.24 over the content of an MOA, which of course must be approved prior to a transfer. For instance, EPA may require a State to file reports on a weekly basis or a monthly basis.  It may require a State to submit only certain classes and categories of permit applications.  And it may include any additional terms and conditions that are relevant to the enforcement of the NPDES program.  There is ample room for judgment in all of these areas, and EPA has exercised such judgment in the past when approving MOAs from many States.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Approval of Application by Maine to Administer the NPDES Program, 66 Fed. Reg. 12791, (2001); Approval of Application by Maine to Administer the NPDES Program; Texas, 
63Fed. Reg.
51165 (1998).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In fact, in an earlier case raising a question similar to this one, see <em>American Forest &amp; Paper Assn.</em> v. <em>EPA</em>, 137 F. 3d 291, 298299 (CA5 1998), EPA itself explained how 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/40/123" class="subref" title="subref">40 CFR §123.24</a> gives it discretion over the approval of a State pollution control program, see Brief for EPA in No. 9660874 (CA5).  Arguing that [i]ndicia of discretionary involvement or control abound in [its] regulations, the agency listed its MOA regulation as a prime example.<a name="ZD-14ref" href="#ZD-14" class="">

                </sup>
            </a>  Again, because EPAs approval of a State application to administer an NPDES program entails significantindeed, aboundingdiscretion, I would find that §7(a)(2) of the ESA applies even under the Courts own flawed theory of these cases.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    Mindful that judges must always remain faithful to the intent of the legislature, Chief Justice Burger closed his opinion in the snail darter case with a reminder that [o]nce the meaning of an enactment is discerned and its constitutionality determined, the judicial process comes to an end.  <em>Hill</em>, 437 U. S., at 194.  This Court offered a definitive interpretation of the Endangered Species Act nearly 30 years ago in that very case.  Today the Court turns its back on our decision in <em>Hill</em> and places a great number of endangered species in jeopardy, including the cactus ferruginous pygmy-owl and Pima pineapple cactus at issue here.  At the risk of plagiarizing Chief Justice Burgers fine opinion, I think it is appropriate to end my opinion just as he didwith a quotation attributed to Sir Thomas More that has as much relevance today as it did three decades ago.  This quotation illustrates not only the fundamental character of the rule of law embodied in §7 of the ESA but also the pernicious consequences of official disobedience of such a rule.  Repetition of that literary allusion is especially appropriate today:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">The law, Roper, the law.  I know whats legal, not whats right.  And Ill stick to whats legal. . . . Im <em>not</em> God.

Cut a great road through the law to get after the Devil? . . . And when the last law was down, and the Devil turned round on youwhere would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat? . . .

        <p class="bodytext">    Although its reasons have shifted over time, at both the administrative level and in the federal courts, EPA has insisted that the requirements of §7(a)(2) of the ESA do not apply to its decision to transfer permitting authority under §402(b) of the CWA.  See App. 114; Brief for Petitioner EPA 16, 42.  As I have explained above, that conclusion is contrary to the text of §7(a)(2), our decision in the <em>TVA</em> v. <em>Hill</em>, and the regulation on which the agency has since relied and upon which the Court relies on today.  Accordingly, I would hold that EPAs decision was arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act, see

But Hill said no such thing.  That case only held that the subsequent appropriation of funds for the Tellico Dam Project could not overcome the mandatory requirements of §7 of the ESA; it did not hold that the TVA would not have been required to spend any and all appropriated funds if the ESA had never been passed.  See Hill, 437 U. S., at 189190.

,that an agency cannot be considered the legal cause of an action that it has no statutory discretion not to takesupports its reliance on §402.03.  Ante, at 20.  First of all, the Court itself recognizes that it must distance itself from that case, ibid., because Public Citizen dealt with a procedural requirement under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), not a substantive requirement like that imposed by §7(a)(2) of the ESA, see TVA v. Hill,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">34</a> (1978)
 (holding that NEPA cases are completely inapposite to the ESA context).  What the Court does not recognize, however, is that what it views as the basic principle of Public Citizen is stated too broadly and therefore inapplicable to this case.  Ante, at 20.


Our decision in Public Citizen turned on what we called a critical feature of the case: that the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) had no ability to countermand the Presidents lifting a moratorium that prohibited certain motor carriers from obtaining authority to operate within the United States.  541 U. S., at 766.  Once the President decided to lift that moratorium, and once the relevant vehicles had entered the United States, FMCSA was required by statute to register the vehicles if certain conditions were met.  Ibid. (Under FMCSAs entirely reasonable reading of this provision, it must certify any motor carrier that can show that it is willing and able to comply with the various substantive requirements for safety and financial responsibility contained in DOT regulations; only the moratorium prevented it from doing so for Mexican motor carriers before 2001 (emphasis deleted)).  Therefore, any potential NEPA concerns were generated by another decisionmaker, the President, and not the FMCSA.  Here, by contrast, EPA is not required to act ministerially once another person or agency has made a decision.  Instead, EPA must exercise its own judgment when considering the transfer of NPDES authority to a State; it also has its own authority to deny such a transfer.  Any effect on endangered species will be caused, even if indirectly, by the agencys own decision to transfer NPDES authority.  Cf.

        <p class="bodytext">    These cases present a problem of conflicting shalls.  On the one hand, §402(b) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) provides that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) shall approve a States application to administer a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permitting program unless it determines that nine criteria are not satisfied.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1342.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §1342(b)</a>.  On the other hand, shortly after the passage of the CWA, Congress enacted §7(a)(2) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA), which commands that federal agencies shall insure that their actions do not jeopardize endangered species.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#a_2" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(a)(2)</a>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    When faced with competing statutory mandates, it is our duty to give full effect to both if at all possible.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Morton</em> v. <em>Mancari</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/417/535" class="subref" title="subref">417 U. S. 535</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">551</a> (1974)
 ([W]hen two statutes are capable of co-existence, it is the duty of the courts, absent a clearly expressed congressional intention to the contrary, to regard each as effective).  The Court fails at this task.  Its opinion unsuccessfully tries to reconcile the CWA and ESA by relying on a federal regulation, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a> (2006), which it reads as limiting the reach of §7(a)(2) to <em>only</em> discretionary federal actions, see <em>ante</em>, at 1719.  Not only is this reading inconsistent with the text and history of §402.03, but it is fundamentally inconsistent with the ESA itself.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In the celebrated snail darter case, <em>TVA</em> v. <em>Hill</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/437/153" class="subref" title="subref">437 U. S. 153</a> (1978)
, we held that the ESA reveals a conscious decision by Congress to give endangered species priority over the primary missions of federal agencies, <em>id</em>., at 185.  Consistent with that intent, Chief Justice Burgers exceptionally thorough and admirable opinion explained that §7 admits of<em></em>no exception.<em>  Id</em>., at 173.  Creating precisely such an exception by exempting nondiscretionary federal actions from the ESAs coverage, the Court whittles away at Congress comprehensive effort to protect endangered species from the risk of extinction and fails to give the Act its intended effect.  After first giving <em>Hill</em> the attention it deserves, I will comment further on the irrelevance of §402.03 to these cases and offer other available ways to give effect to both CWA and the ESA.  Having done so, I conclude by explaining why these cases should be remanded to the EPA for further proceedings.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">I</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In <em>Hill, </em>we were presented with two separate questions: (1) whether the ESA required a court to enjoin the operation of the nearly completed Tellico Dam and Reservoir Project because the Secretary of the Interior had determined that its operation would eradicate a small endangered fish known as a snail darter; and (2) whether post-1973 congressional appropriations for the completion of the Tellico Dam constituted an implied repeal of the ESA, at least insofar as it applied to the Dam.  437 U. S., at 156.  More than 30 pages of our opinion explain our affirmative answer to the first question, see <em>id.,</em> at 156188, but just over four pages sufficed to explain our negative answer to the second, see <em>id</em>., at 189193.  While it is our ruling on the first question that is relevant to the cases before us, it is our refusal to hold that the ESA itself had been impliedly repealed that the majority strangely deems most significant.  See <em>ante, </em>at 2122.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In answering <em>Hill</em>s first question,<em></em>we did not discuss implied repeals.  On the contrary, that portion of the opinion contained our definitive interpretation of the ESA, in which we concluded that the language, history, and structure of the [ESA] indicates beyond doubt that Congress intended endangered species to be afforded the highest of priorities.  437 U. S., at 174; see also <em>id</em>., at 177 ( The dominant theme pervading all Congressional discussion of the proposed [ESA] was the overriding need <em>to devote whatever effort and resources were necessary</em> to avoid further diminution of national and worldwide wildlife resources  (quoting Coggins, Conserving Wildlife Resources: An Overview of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, 
51N. D. L. Rev.
315,
321 (1975) (emphasis added in <em>Hill</em>))).  With respect to §7 in particular, our opinion could not have been any clearer.  We plainly held that it admits of<em> no exception</em>.  437 U. S., at 173 (emphasis added).<a name="ZD-1ref" href="#ZD-1" class="">

        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Our opinion in <em>Hill </em>explained at length why §7 imposed obligations on all federal agencies to ensure that actions authorized, funded, or carried out by them do not jeopardize the continued existence of endangered species.  437 U. S., at 173 (emphasis deleted; internal quotation marks omitted).  Not a word in the opinion stated or suggested that §7 obligations are inapplicable to mandatory agency actions that would threaten the eradication of an endangered species.  Nor did the opinion describe the Tennessee Valley Authoritys (TVA) attempted completion of the Tellico Dam as a discretionary act.  How could it?  After all, if the Secretary of the Interior had not declared the snail darter an endangered species whose critical habitat would be destroyed by operation of the Tellico Dam, the TVA surely would have been obligated to spend the additional funds that Congress appropriated to complete the project.<a name="ZD-2ref" href="#ZD-2" class="">

                </sup>
            </a>  Unconcerned with whether an agency action was mandatory or discretionary, we simply held that §7 of the ESA</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> reveals an explicit congressional decision to require agencies to afford <em>first priority</em> to the declared national policy of saving endangered species.  The pointed omission of the type of qualifying language previously included in endangered species legislation reveals a conscious decision by Congress to give endangered species <em>priority over the </em><em>primary missions of federal agencies.</em>   <em>Id</em>., at 185 (emphasis added).<a name="ZD-3ref" href="#ZD-3" class="">

            </a>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The fact that we also concluded that the post-1973 congressional appropriations did not impliedly repeal the ESA provides no support for the majoritys contention that the obligations imposed by §7(a)(2) may be limited to discretionary acts.  A few passages from the relevant parts of <em>Hill</em> belie that suggestion.  After noting the oddity of holding that the interest in protecting the survival of a relatively small number of 3-inch fish would require the permanent halting of a virtually completed dam for which Congress has expended more than $100 million, we found that the explicit provisions of the Endangered Species Act require precisely that result.  <em>Id.,</em> at 172, 173.  We then continued:</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> One would be hard pressed to find a statutory provision whose terms were any plainer than those in §7 of the Endangered Species Act.  Its very words affirmatively command all federal agencies to <em>insure </em>that actions <em>authorized, funded,</em> or <em>carried out </em>by them do not <em>jeopardize </em>the continued existence of an endangered species or <em>result </em>in the destruction or modification of habitat of such species … .   <em>Id</em>., at 173 (quoting 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536</a> (1976 ed.) (emphasis added in <em>Hill</em>)).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
We also reviewed the ESAs history to identify a variety of exceptions that had been included in earlier legislation and unenacted proposals but were omitted from the final version of the 1973 statute.  We explained that earlier endangered species legislation qualified the obligation of federal agencies, but the 1973 Act purposefully omitted all phrases which might have qualified an agencys responsibilities.  437 U. S., at 181, 182.  Moreover, after observing that the ESA creates only a limited number of hardship exemptions, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1539.html" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1539</a>none of which would apply to federal agencieswe applied the maxim <em>expressio unius est expression alterius</em> to conclude that there are no exemptions in the Endangered Species Act for federal agencies,437 U. S., at 188.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Today, however, the Court countenances such an exemption.  It erroneously concludes that the ESA contains an unmentioned exception for nondiscretionary agency action and that the statutes command to enjoin the completion of the Tellico Dam depended on the unmentioned fact that the TVA was attempting to perform a discretionary act.  But both the text of the ESA and our opinion in <em>Hill</em> compel the contrary determination that Congress intended the ESA to apply to all federal agencies and to all actions authorized, funded, or carried out by them.  <em>Id.,</em> at 173 (emphasis deleted).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    A transfer of NPDES permitting authority under §402(b) of the CWA is undoubtedly one of those actions that is authorized or carried out by a federal agency.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(b)</a>; 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.02</a> (defining action as all activities or programs of any kind authorized, funded, or carried out, in whole or in part, by Federal agencies in the United States or upon the high seas.  Examples include, but are not limited to . . . actions directly or indirectly causing modifications to the land, water, or air).  It follows from <em>Hill </em>that §7(a)(2) applies to such NPDES transferswhether they are mandatory or discretionary.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">II</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Given our unequivocal holding in <em>Hill</em> that the ESA has first priority over all other federal action, 437 U. S., at 185, if any statute should yield, it should be the CWA.  But no statute must yield unless it is truly incapable of coexistence.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Morton</em>, 417 U. S., at 551.  Therefore, assuming that §402(b) of the CWA contains its own mandatory command, we should first try to harmonize that provision with the mandatory requirements of §7(a)(2) of the ESA.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Courts solution is to rely on 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a>, which states that Section 7 and the requirements of this part apply to all actions in which there is discretionary Federal involvement or control.  The Court explains that this regulation harmonizes the statutes by giving effect to the ESAs no-jeopardy mandate whenever an agency has discretion to do so, but by lifting that mandate when the agency is forbidden from considering such extrastatutory factors.  <em>Ante</em>, at 17.  This is not harmony, and it certainly isnt effect.  Rather than giving genuine effect to §7(a)(2), the Court permits a wholesale limitation on the reach of the ESA.  Its interpretation of §402.03 conflicts with the text and history of the regulation, as well as our interpretation of §7 in the snail darter case.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    To begin with, the plain language of §402.03 does not state that its coverage is limited to discretionary actions.  Quite the opposite, the most natural reading of the text is that it confirms the broad construction of §7 endorsed by our opinion in <em>Hill</em>.  Indeed, the only way to read §402.03 in accordance with the facts of the case and our holding that §7 admits of no exception[s], 437 U. S., at 173, is that it eliminates any possible argument that the ESA does not extend to situations in which the discretionary federal involvement is only marginal.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court is simply mistaken when it says that it reads §402.03 to mean what it says: that §7(a)(2)s no-jeopardy duty covers <em>only</em> discretionary agency actions … .  <em>Ante,</em> at 21 (emphasis added).  That is not, in fact, what §402.03 says.  The word only is the Courts addition to the text, not the agencys.  Moreover, that text surely does not go on to say (as the Court does) that the duty does not attach to actions (like the NPDES permitting transfer authorization) that an agency is <em>required</em> by statute to undertake once certain specified triggering events have occurred. <em>Ibid.</em>  If the drafters of the regulation had intended such a far-reaching change in the law, surely they would have said so by using language similar to that which the Court uses today.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Nothing in the proceedings that led to the promulgation of the regulation suggests any reason for limiting the pre-existing understanding of the scope of §7s coverage.  EPA codified the current version of §402.03 in 1986 as part of a general redrafting of ESA regulations.  In the 1983 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the proposed version of §402.03 stated that §7 and the requirements of this Part apply to all actions in which there is Federal involvement or control.  
48Fed. Reg.
29999 (1983).  Without any explanation, the final rule inserted the word discretionary before Federal involvement or control.  
51Fed. Reg.

            </a>  Clearly, if the Secretary of the Interior meant to limit the pre-existing understanding of the scope of the coverage of §7(a)(2) by promulgating this regulation, that intent would have been mentioned somewhere in the text of the regulations or in contemporaneous comment about them.  See <em>National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assn.</em> v. <em>Brand X Internet Services</em>,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">48</a> (1983)
 (We have frequently reiterated that an agency must cogently explain why it has exercised its discretion in a given manner).  Yet, the final rule said nothing about limiting the reach of §7 or our decision in <em>Hill.  </em>Nor did it mention the change from the notice of proposed rulemaking.  I can only assume, then, that the regulation does mean what both it and the notice of proposed rulemaking says: Section 7(a)(2) applies to discretionary federal action, but not <em>only</em> to discretionary action.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The only explanation the agency provided for §402.03 was the following:</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> This section, which explains the applicability of section 7, implicitly covers Federal activities within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States and upon the high seas as a result of the definition of action in §402.02.  The explanation for the scope of the term action is provided in the discussion under §402.01 above.  51 Fed. Reg. 19937.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
This statement directs us to two sources: the definition of action in §402.02 and the explanation for the scope of the term action  in §402.01.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Both confirm that there was no intent to draw a distinction between discretionary and nondiscretionary actions.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Section 402.02 provides in relevant part:</p>
        <p class="bodytext"><em>Action </em>means <em>all</em> activities or programs <em>of any kind</em> authorized, funded, or carried out, in whole or in part, by Federal agencies in the United States or upon the high seas.  Examples include, but are not limited to:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    (a)actions intended to conserve listed species or their habitat;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    (b)the promulgation of regulations . . .   (second and third emphases added.)</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
Actions in either of the described sub-categories are sometimes mandatory and sometimes discretionary.  Likewise, as the italicized portions indicate, the term action expressly refers to all agency activities or programs of any kind, regardless of whether they are discretionary or mandatory.  By reading the term discretionary as a limitation on action, the Court creates a contradiction in the EPAs own regulation.<a name="ZD-5ref" href="#ZD-5" class="">

        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    As for the final rules explanation for the scope of the term action in §402.01, that too is fully consistent with my interpretation of §402.03.  That explanation plainly states that <em>all</em> Federal actions including conservations programs are subject to the consultation requirements of section 7(a)(2) if they may affect listed species or their critical habitats.  51 Fed. Reg. 19929 (emphasis added).  The regulation does not say all discretionary federal actions, nor does it evince an intent to limit the scope of §7(a)(2) in any way.  Rather, it just restates that the ESA applies to all federal actions, just as the notice of proposed rulemaking did.  This explanation of the scope of the word action is therefore a strong indication that the Courts reading of discretionary is contrary to its intended meaning.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    An even stronger indication is the fact that at no point in the administrative proceedings in these cases did EPA even mention<em></em>it.<a name="ZD-6ref" href="#ZD-6" class="">

            </a>  As an initial matter, it is worth emphasizing that even if EPA had relied on §402.03, its interpretation of the ESA would not be entitled to deference under <em>Chevron U. S. A. Inc.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/467/837" class="subref" title="subref">467 U. S. 837</a> (1984)
, because it is not charged with administering that statute, <em>id</em>., at 844 (We have long recognized that considerable weight should be accorded to an executive departments construction of a statutory scheme <em>it is entrusted to administer</em>. (emphasis added)); <em>Department of Treasury</em> v. <em>FLRA</em>, 837 F. 2d 1163, 1167 (CADC 1988) ([W]hen an agency interprets a statute other than that which it has been entrusted to administer, its interpretation is not entitled to deference).  The Departments of the Interior and Commerce, not EPA, are charged with administering the ESA.  See <em>Babbitt </em>v. <em>Sweet Home Chapter, Communities for Great Ore.,</em> 515 U. S., 687, 703704 (1995).  And EPA has conceded that the Department of the Interiors biological opinion did not discuss 50 CFR. 402.03, and it did not address the question whether the consultation that produced the [biological opinion] was required by the ESA.  Pet. for Cert. in No. 06549, p. 24; see App. 77124 (never mentioning §402.03).  Left with this unfavorable administrative record, EPA can only lean on the fact that the Department of the Interior has recently clarified its position regarding §402.03 in a <em>different</em> administrative proceeding.  See Pet. for Cert. in No. 06549, pp. 2425; <em>id</em>., at 26 (The recent F[ish and Wildlife Service] and N[ational Marine Fisheries Service] communications regarding Alaskas pending transfer application reflect those agencies considered interpretations . . . of [50 CFR] 402.03); App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06340, pp. 103a116a; see also <em>ante</em>, at 12 n. 5.  We have long held, however, that courts may not affirm an agency action on grounds other than those adopted by the agency in the administrative proceedings.  See <em>SEC</em> v. <em>Chenery Corp.</em>,

.  The majority ignores this hoary principle of administrative law and substitutes a post-hoc interpretation of §7(a)(2) and §402.03 for that of the relevant agency.  For that reason alone, these cases should be remanded to the agency.  And for the other reasons I have given, §402.03 cannot be used to harmonize the CWA and the ESA.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">III</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    There are at least two ways in which the CWA and the ESA can be given full effect without privileging one statute over the other.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">A</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The text of §7(a)(2) itself provides the first possible way of reconciling that provision with §402(b) of the CWA.   The subsection reads:</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> Each Federal agency shall, <em>in consultation with and with the assistance of the Secretary</em>, insure that any action authorized, funded, or carried out by such agency (hereinafter in this section referred to as an agency action) is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of habitat of such species which is determined by the Secretary, after consultation as appropriate with affected States, to be critical, unless such agency has been granted an exemption for such action by the Committee pursuant to subsection (h) of this section.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#a_2" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(a)(2)</a> (emphasis added).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court is certainly correct that the use of the word shall in §7(a)(2) imposes a mandatory requirement on the federal agencies.  See <em>ante</em>, at 14.  It is also correct that the ESAs mandate is to be carried out through consultation and may require the agency to adopt an alternative course of action.  <em>Ante,</em> at 15.  The Court is too quick to conclude, however, that this consultation requirement creates an irreconcilable conflict between this provision and §402(b) of the CWA.  It rushes to this flawed judgment because of a basic conceptual erroran error that is revealed as early as the first paragraph of its opinion.  Rather than attempting to find a way to give effect to §7(a)(2)s consultation requirement, the Court frames the question presented as whether §7(a)(2) effectively operates as a tenth criterion on which the transfer of permitting power under the first statute must be conditioned.   <em>Ante</em>, at 12.  The Court is not alone in this.  The author of the Ninth Circuit opinion below also stated that the ESA <em>adds</em> one requirement to the list of considerations under the Clean Water Act permitting transfer provision.  450 F. 3d, at 404 n. 2 (2006) (Berzon, J., concurring in denial of rehearing en banc) (emphasis in original).  But while the ESA does mandate that the relevant agencies consul[t] with the Interior Department, that consultation process also provides a way for the agencies to give effect to both statutes.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The first step in the statutory consultation process is to identify whether any endangered species will be affected by an agency action.  An agency proposing a particular action, such as an NPDES transfer, will typically ask the Secretary of the Interior whether any listed species may be present in the area of the proposed action and whether that action will affect those species.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#c" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(c)</a>.  It is entirely possible that no listed species will be affected, and any anticipated conflict between the ESA and another statute will have been avoided at this threshold stage.  If, however, the Secretary determines that a proposed action may affect an endangered species or its critical habitat, the agency must formally consult with the Secretary.  This consultation culminates in the issuance of a biological opinion, which detail[s] how the agency action affects the species or its critical habitat.  §1536(b)(3)(A); see also 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.14</a>(h).  Even at this stage, it is still possible that formal consultation will reveal that the agency action will not jeopardize any species.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 
63Fed. Reg.
51199 (1998) (noting that FWS rendered a no jeopardy finding with respect to the transfer of permitting authority to Texas).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    If the biological opinion concludes that the agency action would put a listed species in jeopardy, however, the ESA contains a process for resolving the competing demands of agency action and species protection.  The ESA provides that the Secretary shall suggest those reasonable and prudent alternatives which he believes would not violate subsection (a)(2) and can be taken by the Federal agency or applicant in implementing the agency action.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#b_3_A" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(b)(3)(A)</a>; see also 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.14</a>(h)(3).  The agencys regulations define [r]easonable and prudent alternatives as</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> alternative actions identified during formal consultation that can be implemented in a manner consistent with the intended purpose of the action, that can be implemented consistent with the scope of the Federal agencys legal authority and jurisdiction, that is economically and technologically feasible, and that the Director [of FWS] believes would avoid the likelihood of jeopardizing the continued existence of listed species or resulting in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat.   
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.02</a>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
Thus, in the face of any conflict between the ESA and another federal statute, the ESA and its implementing regulations encourage federal agencies to work out a reasonable alternative that would let the proposed action move forward consistent with [its] intended purpose and the agencys legal authority, while also avoiding any violation of  §7(a)(2).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    When applied to the NPDES transfer program, the reasonable and prudent alternatives process would enable EPA and the Department of the Interior to develop a substitute that would allow a transfer of permitting authority <em>and</em> would not jeopardize endangered species.  Stated differently, the consultation process would generate an alternative course of action whereby the transfer could still take placeas required by §402(b) of the CWAbut in such a way that would honor the mandatory requirements of §7(a)(2) of the ESA.  This should come as no surprise to EPA, as it has engaged in pre-transfer consultations at least six times in the past and has stated that it is not barred from doing so by the CWA.<a name="ZD-7ref" href="#ZD-7" class="">

        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Finally, for the rare case in which no reasonable and prudent alternative can be found, Congress has provided yet another mechanism for resolving any conflicts between the ESA and a proposed agency action.  In 1978, shortly after our decision in <em>Hill</em>, Congress amended the ESA to create the Endangered Species Committee, which it authorized to grant exemptions from §7(a)(2).  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#e" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(e)</a>.  Because it has the authority to approve the extinction of an endangered species, the Endangered Species Committee is colloquially described as the God Squad or God Committee.  In light of this weighty responsibility, Congress carefully laid out requirements for the God Committees membership,<a name="ZD-8ref" href="#ZD-8" class="">

            </a> and the factors it must consider in deciding whether to grant an exemption.<a name="ZD-10ref" href="#ZD-10" class="">

                    <b>10</b>

            </a>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    As the final arbiter in situations in which the ESA conflicts with a proposed agency action, the God Committee embodies the primacy of the ESAs mandate and serves as the final mechanism for harmonizing that Act with other federal statutes.  By creating this Committee, Congress recognized that some conflicts with the ESA may not be capable of resolution without having to forever sacrifice some endangered species.  At the same time, the creation of this last line of defense reflects Congress view that the ESA should not yield to another federal action except as a final resort and except when authorized by high level officials after serious consideration.  In short, when all else has failed and two federal statutes are incapable of resolution, Congress left the choice to the Committeenot to this Court; it did not limit the ESA in the way the majority does today.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">B</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    EPAs regulations offer a second way to harmonize the CWA with the ESA.  After EPA has transferred NPDES permitting authority to a State, the agency continues to oversee the States permitting program.  See <em>Arkansas</em> v. <em>Oklahoma</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/503/91" class="subref" title="subref">503 U. S. 91</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">105</a> (1992)
 (Congress preserved for the Administrator broad authority to oversee state permit programs).  If a state permit is outside the guidelines and the requirements of the CWA, EPA may object to it and block its issuance.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1342.html#d_2" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §1342(d)(2)</a>; 
66Fed. Reg.
11206 (2001).  Given these ongoing responsibilities, EPA has enacted a regulation that requires a State to enter into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) that sets forth the particulars of the agencys oversight duties.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/40/123" class="subref" title="subref">40 CFR §123.24</a>(a) (2006).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">The regulation governing MOAs contains several detailed requirements.  For instance, the regulation states that an MOA must contain [p]rovisions specifying classes and categories of permit applications, draft permits and proposed permits that the State will send to the [EPA] Regional Administrator for review, comment and, where applicable, objection, §123.24(b)(2); [p]rovisions specifying the frequency and content of reports, documents and other information which the State is required to submit to the EPA, §123.24(b)(3); and [p]rovisions for coordination of compliance monitoring activities by the State and by EPA, §123.24(b)(4)(i).  More generally, the regulation provides that an MOA may include other terms, conditions, or agreements that are relevant to the administration and enforcement of the States regulatory program.  §123.24(a).  Under the MOA regulation, furthermore, EPA will not approve any MOA that restricts its statutory oversight responsibility.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Like the §7(a)(2) consultation process described above, MOAs provide a potential mechanism for giving effect to §7 of the ESA while also allowing the transfer of permitting authority to a State.  It is important to remember that EPA must approve an MOA <em>prior to</em> the transfer of NPDES authority.  As such, EPA can useand in fact has usedthe MOA process to structure its later oversight in a way that will allow it to protect endangered species in accordance with §7(a)(2) of the ESA.  EPA might negotiate a provision in the MOA that would require a State to abide by the ESA requirements when issuing pollution permits.  See Brief for American Fisheries Society et al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 28. (In the Maine MOA, for example, EPA and the state agreed that state permits would protect ESA-listed species by ensuring compliance with state water quality standards).  Alternatively, EPA could require the state to provide copies of draft permits for discharges in particularly sensitive habitats such as those of ESA-listed species or for discharges that contain a pollutant that threatens ESA-listed wildlife.  <em>Id</em>., at 10.  Or the MOA might be drafted in a way that would allow the agency to object to state permits that would jeopardize any and all endangered species.  See<em> id</em>., at 28 (explaining that the Maine MOA includes a provision allowing EPA to object to any state permit that risks harm to a listed species by threatening water quality).  These are just three of many possibilities.  I need not identify other ways EPA could use the MOA process to comply with the ESA; it is enough to observe that MOAs provide a straightforward way to give the ESA its full effect without restricting §7(a)(2) in the way the Court does.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">IV</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    As discussed above, I believe that the Court incorrectly restricts the reach of §7(a)(2) to discretionary federal actions.  See Part II, <em>supra.</em>  Even if such a limitation were permissible, however, it is clear that EPAs authority to transfer permitting authority under §402(b) <em>is </em>discretionary.<a name="ZD-11ref" href="#ZD-11" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>11</b>

            </a>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The EPA Administrators authority to approve state permit programs pursuant to §402(b) of the CWA does not even fit within the Courts description of the category of mandatory actions that the Court holds are covered by the ESA.  In the Courts words, that category includes actions that an agency is <em>required </em>by statute to undertake once certain specified triggering events have occurred.  <em>Ante</em>, at 22.  The triggering event for EPAs approval is simply the filing of a satisfactory description of the States proposed program.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1342.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §1342(b)</a>.  The statute then commands that the EPA Administrator shall approve the submitted program unless he determines that state law does not satisfy nine specified conditions.  Those conditions are not triggering events; they are potential objections to the exercise of the Administrators authority.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    What is more, §402(b) is a perfect example of why our analysis should not end simply because a statute uses the word shall.  Instead, we must look more closely at its listed criteria to determine whether they allow for discretion, despite the use of shall.  After all, as then-Justice Rehnquists dissenting opinion in the snail darter case explains, a federal statute using the word shall will sometimes allow room for discretion.  See <em>Hill</em>, 437 U. S. at 211212 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).<a name="ZD-12ref" href="#ZD-12" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>12</b>
                </sup>
            </a>  In these cases, there is significant room for discretion in EPAs evaluation of §402(b)s nine conditions.  The first criterion, for example, requires the EPA Administrator to examine five other statutes and ensure that the State has adequate authority to comply with each.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1342.html#b_1_A" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §1342(b)(1)(A)</a>.  One of those five statutes, in turn, expressly directs the Administrator to exercise his judgment.  §1312.  Even the Court acknowledges that EPA must exercise some judgment in determining whether a State has demonstrated that it has the authority to carry out §402(b)s enumerated statutory criteria.  <em>Ante</em>, at 24.  However, in the very same breath, the Court states that the dispositive fact is that the statute clearly does not grant it the discretion to add another entirely separate prerequisite to that list.  <em>Ibid</em>.  This reasoning flouts the Courts own logic.  Under the Courts reading of §402.03, §7(a)(2) applies to discretionary federal actions of any kind.  The Court plainly acknowledges that EPA exercises discretion when deciding whether to transfer permitting authority to a State.  If we are to take the Courts approach seriously, once <em>any</em> discretion has been identifiedas it has here§7(a)(2) must apply.<a name="ZD-13ref" href="#ZD-13" class="">

            </a>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The MOA regulation described in Part IIIB, <em>supra,</em> also demonstrates that an NPDES transfer is not as ministerial a task as the Court would suggest.  The agency retains significant discretion under §123.24 over the content of an MOA, which of course must be approved prior to a transfer. For instance, EPA may require a State to file reports on a weekly basis or a monthly basis.  It may require a State to submit only certain classes and categories of permit applications.  And it may include any additional terms and conditions that are relevant to the enforcement of the NPDES program.  There is ample room for judgment in all of these areas, and EPA has exercised such judgment in the past when approving MOAs from many States.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Approval of Application by Maine to Administer the NPDES Program, 66 Fed. Reg. 12791, (2001); Approval of Application by Maine to Administer the NPDES Program; Texas, 
63Fed. Reg.
51165 (1998).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In fact, in an earlier case raising a question similar to this one, see <em>American Forest &amp; Paper Assn.</em> v. <em>EPA</em>, 137 F. 3d 291, 298299 (CA5 1998), EPA itself explained how 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/40/123" class="subref" title="subref">40 CFR §123.24</a> gives it discretion over the approval of a State pollution control program, see Brief for EPA in No. 9660874 (CA5).  Arguing that [i]ndicia of discretionary involvement or control abound in [its] regulations, the agency listed its MOA regulation as a prime example.<a name="ZD-14ref" href="#ZD-14" class="">

            </a>  Again, because EPAs approval of a State application to administer an NPDES program entails significantindeed, aboundingdiscretion, I would find that §7(a)(2) of the ESA applies even under the Courts own flawed theory of these cases.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    Mindful that judges must always remain faithful to the intent of the legislature, Chief Justice Burger closed his opinion in the snail darter case with a reminder that [o]nce the meaning of an enactment is discerned and its constitutionality determined, the judicial process comes to an end.  <em>Hill</em>, 437 U. S., at 194.  This Court offered a definitive interpretation of the Endangered Species Act nearly 30 years ago in that very case.  Today the Court turns its back on our decision in <em>Hill</em> and places a great number of endangered species in jeopardy, including the cactus ferruginous pygmy-owl and Pima pineapple cactus at issue here.  At the risk of plagiarizing Chief Justice Burgers fine opinion, I think it is appropriate to end my opinion just as he didwith a quotation attributed to Sir Thomas More that has as much relevance today as it did three decades ago.  This quotation illustrates not only the fundamental character of the rule of law embodied in §7 of the ESA but also the pernicious consequences of official disobedience of such a rule.

        <p class="bodytext">    Although its reasons have shifted over time, at both the administrative level and in the federal courts, EPA has insisted that the requirements of §7(a)(2) of the ESA do not apply to its decision to transfer permitting authority under §402(b) of the CWA.  See App. 114; Brief for Petitioner EPA 16, 42.  As I have explained above, that conclusion is contrary to the text of §7(a)(2), our decision in the <em>TVA</em> v. <em>Hill</em>, and the regulation on which the agency has since relied and upon which the Court relies on today.  Accordingly, I would hold that EPAs decision was arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act, see

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-2" href="#ZD-2ref">2</a> The Court misreads this sentence and, in so doing, overreads our decision in Hill.  Justice Alito maintains that Hill held that the acts appropriating funds to the TVA … did not require the agency to use any of the generally appropriated funds to complete the Tellico Dam project.  Ante, at 2324, n. 9.  But Hill said no such thing.  That case only held that the subsequent appropriation of funds for the Tellico Dam Project could not overcome the mandatory requirements of §7 of the ESA; it did not hold that the TVA would not have been required to spend any and all appropriated funds if the ESA had never been passed.  See Hill, 437 U. S., at 189190.  If the ESA had never been enacted and did not stand in the way of the completion of the Tellico Dam, there is no doubt that the TVA would have finished the project that Congress had funded.

Hill, O.T. 1977, No. 761701, p. 26.  Instead, the TVA sought to restrict §7 to only those actions for which the agency has reasonable decision-making alternatives before it.  Ibid.  We rejected that narrow interpretation, stating that the only way to sustain the TVAs position would be to ignore the ordinary meaning of plain language.  Hill, 437 U. S., at 173.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/541/752" class="subref" title="subref">541 U. S. 752</a> (2004)
,that an agency cannot be considered the legal cause of an action that it has no statutory discretion not to takesupports its reliance on §402.03.  Ante, at 20.  First of all, the Court itself recognizes that it must distance itself from that case, ibid., because Public Citizen dealt with a procedural requirement under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), not a substantive requirement like that imposed by §7(a)(2) of the ESA, see TVA v. Hill, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/437/158" class="subref" title="subref">437 U. S. 158</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">188</a>, n. 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">34</a> (1978)
 (holding that NEPA cases are completely inapposite to the ESA context).  What the Court does not recognize, however, is that what it views as the basic principle of Public Citizen is stated too broadly and therefore inapplicable to this case.  Ante, at 20.


Our decision in Public Citizen turned on what we called a critical feature of the case: that the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) had no ability to countermand the Presidents lifting a moratorium that prohibited certain motor carriers from obtaining authority to operate within the United States.  541 U. S., at 766.  Once the President decided to lift that moratorium, and once the relevant vehicles had entered the United States, FMCSA was required by statute to register the vehicles if certain conditions were met.  Ibid. (Under FMCSAs entirely reasonable reading of this provision, it must certify any motor carrier that can show that it is willing and able to comply with the various substantive requirements for safety and financial responsibility contained in DOT regulations; only the moratorium prevented it from doing so for Mexican motor carriers before 2001 (emphasis deleted)).  Therefore, any potential NEPA concerns were generated by another decisionmaker, the President, and not the FMCSA.  Here, by contrast, EPA is not required to act ministerially once another person or agency has made a decision.  Instead, EPA must exercise its own judgment when considering the transfer of NPDES authority to a State; it also has its own authority to deny such a transfer.  Any effect on endangered species will be caused, even if indirectly, by the agencys own decision to transfer NPDES authority.  Cf. 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.02</a> (providing that the ESA will apply to all agency activities that directly or indirectly caus[e] modifications to the land, water, or air (emphasis added)).

        <p class="bodytext">    These cases present a problem of conflicting shalls.  On the one hand, §402(b) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) provides that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) shall approve a States application to administer a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permitting program unless it determines that nine criteria are not satisfied.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1342.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §1342(b)</a>.  On the other hand, shortly after the passage of the CWA, Congress enacted §7(a)(2) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA), which commands that federal agencies shall insure that their actions do not jeopardize endangered species.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#a_2" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(a)(2)</a>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    When faced with competing statutory mandates, it is our duty to give full effect to both if at all possible.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Morton</em> v. <em>Mancari</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/417/535" class="subref" title="subref">417 U. S. 535</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">551</a> (1974)
 ([W]hen two statutes are capable of co-existence, it is the duty of the courts, absent a clearly expressed congressional intention to the contrary, to regard each as effective).  The Court fails at this task.  Its opinion unsuccessfully tries to reconcile the CWA and ESA by relying on a federal regulation, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a> (2006), which it reads as limiting the reach of §7(a)(2) to <em>only</em> discretionary federal actions, see <em>ante</em>, at 1719.  Not only is this reading inconsistent with the text and history of §402.03, but it is fundamentally inconsistent with the ESA itself.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In the celebrated snail darter case, <em>TVA</em> v. <em>Hill</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/437/153" class="subref" title="subref">437 U. S. 153</a> (1978)
, we held that the ESA reveals a conscious decision by Congress to give endangered species priority over the primary missions of federal agencies, <em>id</em>., at 185.  Consistent with that intent, Chief Justice Burgers exceptionally thorough and admirable opinion explained that §7 admits of<em></em>no exception.<em>  Id</em>., at 173.  Creating precisely such an exception by exempting nondiscretionary federal actions from the ESAs coverage, the Court whittles away at Congress comprehensive effort to protect endangered species from the risk of extinction and fails to give the Act its intended effect.  After first giving <em>Hill</em> the attention it deserves, I will comment further on the irrelevance of §402.03 to these cases and offer other available ways to give effect to both CWA and the ESA.  Having done so, I conclude by explaining why these cases should be remanded to the EPA for further proceedings.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">I</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In <em>Hill, </em>we were presented with two separate questions: (1) whether the ESA required a court to enjoin the operation of the nearly completed Tellico Dam and Reservoir Project because the Secretary of the Interior had determined that its operation would eradicate a small endangered fish known as a snail darter; and (2) whether post-1973 congressional appropriations for the completion of the Tellico Dam constituted an implied repeal of the ESA, at least insofar as it applied to the Dam.  437 U. S., at 156.  More than 30 pages of our opinion explain our affirmative answer to the first question, see <em>id.,</em> at 156188, but just over four pages sufficed to explain our negative answer to the second, see <em>id</em>., at 189193.  While it is our ruling on the first question that is relevant to the cases before us, it is our refusal to hold that the ESA itself had been impliedly repealed that the majority strangely deems most significant.  See <em>ante, </em>at 2122.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In answering <em>Hill</em>s first question,<em></em>we did not discuss implied repeals.  On the contrary, that portion of the opinion contained our definitive interpretation of the ESA, in which we concluded that the language, history, and structure of the [ESA] indicates beyond doubt that Congress intended endangered species to be afforded the highest of priorities.  437 U. S., at 174; see also <em>id</em>., at 177 ( The dominant theme pervading all Congressional discussion of the proposed [ESA] was the overriding need <em>to devote whatever effort and resources were necessary</em> to avoid further diminution of national and worldwide wildlife resources  (quoting Coggins, Conserving Wildlife Resources: An Overview of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, 
51N. D. L. Rev.
315,
321 (1975) (emphasis added in <em>Hill</em>))).  With respect to §7 in particular, our opinion could not have been any clearer.  We plainly held that it admits of<em> no exception</em>.  437 U. S., at 173 (emphasis added).<a name="ZD-1ref" href="#ZD-1" class="">

Not a word in the opinion stated or suggested that §7 obligations are inapplicable to mandatory agency actions that would threaten the eradication of an endangered species.  Nor did the opinion describe the Tennessee Valley Authoritys (TVA) attempted completion of the Tellico Dam as a discretionary act.  How could it?  After all, if the Secretary of the Interior had not declared the snail darter an endangered species whose critical habitat would be destroyed by operation of the Tellico Dam, the TVA surely would have been obligated to spend the additional funds that Congress appropriated to complete the project.<a name="ZD-2ref" href="#ZD-2" class="">

The pointed omission of the type of qualifying language previously included in endangered species legislation reveals a conscious decision by Congress to give endangered species <em>priority over the </em><em>primary missions of federal agencies.</em>   <em>Id</em>., at 185 (emphasis added).<a name="ZD-3ref" href="#ZD-3" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    The fact that we also concluded that the post-1973 congressional appropriations did not impliedly repeal the ESA provides no support for the majoritys contention that the obligations imposed by §7(a)(2) may be limited to discretionary acts.  A few passages from the relevant parts of <em>Hill</em> belie that suggestion.  After noting the oddity of holding that the interest in protecting the survival of a relatively small number of 3-inch fish would require the permanent halting of a virtually completed dam for which Congress has expended more than $100 million, we found that the explicit provisions of the Endangered Species Act require precisely that result.  <em>Id.,</em> at 172, 173.  We then continued:</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> One would be hard pressed to find a statutory provision whose terms were any plainer than those in §7 of the Endangered Species Act.  Its very words affirmatively command all federal agencies to <em>insure </em>that actions <em>authorized, funded,</em> or <em>carried out </em>by them do not <em>jeopardize </em>the continued existence of an endangered species or <em>result </em>in the destruction or modification of habitat of such species … .   <em>Id</em>., at 173 (quoting 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536</a> (1976 ed.) (emphasis added in <em>Hill</em>)).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
We also reviewed the ESAs history to identify a variety of exceptions that had been included in earlier legislation and unenacted proposals but were omitted from the final version of the 1973 statute.  We explained that earlier endangered species legislation qualified the obligation of federal agencies, but the 1973 Act purposefully omitted all phrases which might have qualified an agencys responsibilities.  437 U. S., at 181, 182.  Moreover, after observing that the ESA creates only a limited number of hardship exemptions, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1539.html" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1539</a>none of which would apply to federal agencieswe applied the maxim <em>expressio unius est expression alterius</em> to conclude that there are no exemptions in the Endangered Species Act for federal agencies,437 U. S., at 188.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Today, however, the Court countenances such an exemption.  It erroneously concludes that the ESA contains an unmentioned exception for nondiscretionary agency action and that the statutes command to enjoin the completion of the Tellico Dam depended on the unmentioned fact that the TVA was attempting to perform a discretionary act.  But both the text of the ESA and our opinion in <em>Hill</em> compel the contrary determination that Congress intended the ESA to apply to all federal agencies and to all actions authorized, funded, or carried out by them.  <em>Id.,</em> at 173 (emphasis deleted).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    A transfer of NPDES permitting authority under §402(b) of the CWA is undoubtedly one of those actions that is authorized or carried out by a federal agency.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(b)</a>; 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.02</a> (defining action as all activities or programs of any kind authorized, funded, or carried out, in whole or in part, by Federal agencies in the United States or upon the high seas.  Examples include, but are not limited to . . . actions directly or indirectly causing modifications to the land, water, or air).  It follows from <em>Hill </em>that §7(a)(2) applies to such NPDES transferswhether they are mandatory or discretionary.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">II</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Given our unequivocal holding in <em>Hill</em> that the ESA has first priority over all other federal action, 437 U. S., at 185, if any statute should yield, it should be the CWA.  But no statute must yield unless it is truly incapable of coexistence.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Morton</em>, 417 U. S., at 551.  Therefore, assuming that §402(b) of the CWA contains its own mandatory command, we should first try to harmonize that provision with the mandatory requirements of §7(a)(2) of the ESA.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Courts solution is to rely on 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.03</a>, which states that Section 7 and the requirements of this part apply to all actions in which there is discretionary Federal involvement or control.  The Court explains that this regulation harmonizes the statutes by giving effect to the ESAs no-jeopardy mandate whenever an agency has discretion to do so, but by lifting that mandate when the agency is forbidden from considering such extrastatutory factors.  <em>Ante</em>, at 17.  This is not harmony, and it certainly isnt effect.  Rather than giving genuine effect to §7(a)(2), the Court permits a wholesale limitation on the reach of the ESA.  Its interpretation of §402.03 conflicts with the text and history of the regulation, as well as our interpretation of §7 in the snail darter case.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    To begin with, the plain language of §402.03 does not state that its coverage is limited to discretionary actions.  Quite the opposite, the most natural reading of the text is that it confirms the broad construction of §7 endorsed by our opinion in <em>Hill</em>.  Indeed, the only way to read §402.03 in accordance with the facts of the case and our holding that §7 admits of no exception[s], 437 U. S., at 173, is that it eliminates any possible argument that the ESA does not extend to situations in which the discretionary federal involvement is only marginal.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court is simply mistaken when it says that it reads §402.03 to mean what it says: that §7(a)(2)s no-jeopardy duty covers <em>only</em> discretionary agency actions … .  <em>Ante,</em> at 21 (emphasis added).  That is not, in fact, what §402.03 says.  The word only is the Courts addition to the text, not the agencys.  Moreover, that text surely does not go on to say (as the Court does) that the duty does not attach to actions (like the NPDES permitting transfer authorization) that an agency is <em>required</em> by statute to undertake once certain specified triggering events have occurred. <em>Ibid.</em>  If the drafters of the regulation had intended such a far-reaching change in the law, surely they would have said so by using language similar to that which the Court uses today.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Nothing in the proceedings that led to the promulgation of the regulation suggests any reason for limiting the pre-existing understanding of the scope of §7s coverage.  EPA codified the current version of §402.03 in 1986 as part of a general redrafting of ESA regulations.  In the 1983 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the proposed version of §402.03 stated that §7 and the requirements of this Part apply to all actions in which there is Federal involvement or control.  
48Fed. Reg.
29999 (1983).  Without any explanation, the final rule inserted the word discretionary before Federal involvement or control.

            </a>  Clearly, if the Secretary of the Interior meant to limit the pre-existing understanding of the scope of the coverage of §7(a)(2) by promulgating this regulation, that intent would have been mentioned somewhere in the text of the regulations or in contemporaneous comment about them.

 (We have frequently reiterated that an agency must cogently explain why it has exercised its discretion in a given manner).  Yet, the final rule said nothing about limiting the reach of §7 or our decision in <em>Hill.  </em>Nor did it mention the change from the notice of proposed rulemaking.  I can only assume, then, that the regulation does mean what both it and the notice of proposed rulemaking says: Section 7(a)(2) applies to discretionary federal action, but not <em>only</em> to discretionary action.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The only explanation the agency provided for §402.03 was the following:</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> This section, which explains the applicability of section 7, implicitly covers Federal activities within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States and upon the high seas as a result of the definition of action in §402.02.  The explanation for the scope of the term action is provided in the discussion under §402.01 above.  51 Fed. Reg. 19937.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
This statement directs us to two sources: the definition of action in §402.02 and the explanation for the scope of the term action  in §402.01.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Both confirm that there was no intent to draw a distinction between discretionary and nondiscretionary actions.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Section 402.02 provides in relevant part:</p>
        <p class="bodytext"><em>Action </em>means <em>all</em> activities or programs <em>of any kind</em> authorized, funded, or carried out, in whole or in part, by Federal agencies in the United States or upon the high seas.  Examples include, but are not limited to:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    (a)actions intended to conserve listed species or their habitat;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    (b)the promulgation of regulations . . .   (second and third emphases added.)</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
Actions in either of the described sub-categories are sometimes mandatory and sometimes discretionary.  Likewise, as the italicized portions indicate, the term action expressly refers to all agency activities or programs of any kind, regardless of whether they are discretionary or mandatory.  By reading the term discretionary as a limitation on action, the Court creates a contradiction in the EPAs own regulation.<a name="ZD-5ref" href="#ZD-5" class="">
                <sup>

            </a>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    As for the final rules explanation for the scope of the term action in §402.01, that too is fully consistent with my interpretation of §402.03.  That explanation plainly states that <em>all</em> Federal actions including conservations programs are subject to the consultation requirements of section 7(a)(2) if they may affect listed species or their critical habitats.  51 Fed. Reg. 19929 (emphasis added).  The regulation does not say all discretionary federal actions, nor does it evince an intent to limit the scope of §7(a)(2) in any way.  Rather, it just restates that the ESA applies to all federal actions, just as the notice of proposed rulemaking did.  This explanation of the scope of the word action is therefore a strong indication that the Courts reading of discretionary is contrary to its intended meaning.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    An even stronger indication is the fact that at no point in the administrative proceedings in these cases did EPA even mention<em></em>it.<a name="ZD-6ref" href="#ZD-6" class="">

            </a>  As an initial matter, it is worth emphasizing that even if EPA had relied on §402.03, its interpretation of the ESA would not be entitled to deference under <em>Chevron U. S. A. Inc.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/467/837" class="subref" title="subref">467 U. S. 837</a> (1984)
, because it is not charged with administering that statute, <em>id</em>., at 844 (We have long recognized that considerable weight should be accorded to an executive departments construction of a statutory scheme <em>it is entrusted to administer</em>. (emphasis added)); <em>Department of Treasury</em> v. <em>FLRA</em>, 837 F. 2d 1163, 1167 (CADC 1988) ([W]hen an agency interprets a statute other than that which it has been entrusted to administer, its interpretation is not entitled to deference).  The Departments of the Interior and Commerce, not EPA, are charged with administering the ESA.  See <em>Babbitt </em>v. <em>Sweet Home Chapter, Communities for Great Ore.,</em> 515 U. S., 687, 703704 (1995).  And EPA has conceded that the Department of the Interiors biological opinion did not discuss 50 CFR. 402.03, and it did not address the question whether the consultation that produced the [biological opinion] was required by the ESA.  Pet. for Cert. in No. 06549, p. 24; see App. 77124 (never mentioning §402.03).  Left with this unfavorable administrative record, EPA can only lean on the fact that the Department of the Interior has recently clarified its position regarding §402.03 in a <em>different</em> administrative proceeding.  See Pet. for Cert. in No. 06549, pp. 2425; <em>id</em>., at 26 (The recent F[ish and Wildlife Service] and N[ational Marine Fisheries Service] communications regarding Alaskas pending transfer application reflect those agencies considered interpretations . . . of [50 CFR] 402.03); App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06340, pp. 103a116a; see also <em>ante</em>, at 12 n. 5.  We have long held, however, that courts may not affirm an agency action on grounds other than those adopted by the agency in the administrative proceedings.  See <em>SEC</em> v. <em>Chenery Corp.</em>,

.  The majority ignores this hoary principle of administrative law and substitutes a post-hoc interpretation of §7(a)(2) and §402.03 for that of the relevant agency.  For that reason alone, these cases should be remanded to the agency.  And for the other reasons I have given, §402.03 cannot be used to harmonize the CWA and the ESA.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">III</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    There are at least two ways in which the CWA and the ESA can be given full effect without privileging one statute over the other.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">A</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The text of §7(a)(2) itself provides the first possible way of reconciling that provision with §402(b) of the CWA.   The subsection reads:</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> Each Federal agency shall, <em>in consultation with and with the assistance of the Secretary</em>, insure that any action authorized, funded, or carried out by such agency (hereinafter in this section referred to as an agency action) is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of habitat of such species which is determined by the Secretary, after consultation as appropriate with affected States, to be critical, unless such agency has been granted an exemption for such action by the Committee pursuant to subsection (h) of this section.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#a_2" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(a)(2)</a> (emphasis added).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court is certainly correct that the use of the word shall in §7(a)(2) imposes a mandatory requirement on the federal agencies.  See <em>ante</em>, at 14.  It is also correct that the ESAs mandate is to be carried out through consultation and may require the agency to adopt an alternative course of action.  <em>Ante,</em> at 15.  The Court is too quick to conclude, however, that this consultation requirement creates an irreconcilable conflict between this provision and §402(b) of the CWA.  It rushes to this flawed judgment because of a basic conceptual erroran error that is revealed as early as the first paragraph of its opinion.  Rather than attempting to find a way to give effect to §7(a)(2)s consultation requirement, the Court frames the question presented as whether §7(a)(2) effectively operates as a tenth criterion on which the transfer of permitting power under the first statute must be conditioned.   <em>Ante</em>, at 12.  The Court is not alone in this.  The author of the Ninth Circuit opinion below also stated that the ESA <em>adds</em> one requirement to the list of considerations under the Clean Water Act permitting transfer provision.  450 F. 3d, at 404 n. 2 (2006) (Berzon, J., concurring in denial of rehearing en banc) (emphasis in original).  But while the ESA does mandate that the relevant agencies consul[t] with the Interior Department, that consultation process also provides a way for the agencies to give effect to both statutes.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The first step in the statutory consultation process is to identify whether any endangered species will be affected by an agency action.  An agency proposing a particular action, such as an NPDES transfer, will typically ask the Secretary of the Interior whether any listed species may be present in the area of the proposed action and whether that action will affect those species.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#c" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(c)</a>.  It is entirely possible that no listed species will be affected, and any anticipated conflict between the ESA and another statute will have been avoided at this threshold stage.  If, however, the Secretary determines that a proposed action may affect an endangered species or its critical habitat, the agency must formally consult with the Secretary.  This consultation culminates in the issuance of a biological opinion, which detail[s] how the agency action affects the species or its critical habitat.  §1536(b)(3)(A); see also 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.14</a>(h).  Even at this stage, it is still possible that formal consultation will reveal that the agency action will not jeopardize any species.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 
63Fed. Reg.
51199 (1998) (noting that FWS rendered a no jeopardy finding with respect to the transfer of permitting authority to Texas).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    If the biological opinion concludes that the agency action would put a listed species in jeopardy, however, the ESA contains a process for resolving the competing demands of agency action and species protection.  The ESA provides that the Secretary shall suggest those reasonable and prudent alternatives which he believes would not violate subsection (a)(2) and can be taken by the Federal agency or applicant in implementing the agency action.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#b_3_A" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(b)(3)(A)</a>; see also 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.14</a>(h)(3).  The agencys regulations define [r]easonable and prudent alternatives as</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> alternative actions identified during formal consultation that can be implemented in a manner consistent with the intended purpose of the action, that can be implemented consistent with the scope of the Federal agencys legal authority and jurisdiction, that is economically and technologically feasible, and that the Director [of FWS] believes would avoid the likelihood of jeopardizing the continued existence of listed species or resulting in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat.   
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.02</a>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
Thus, in the face of any conflict between the ESA and another federal statute, the ESA and its implementing regulations encourage federal agencies to work out a reasonable alternative that would let the proposed action move forward consistent with [its] intended purpose and the agencys legal authority, while also avoiding any violation of  §7(a)(2).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    When applied to the NPDES transfer program, the reasonable and prudent alternatives process would enable EPA and the Department of the Interior to develop a substitute that would allow a transfer of permitting authority <em>and</em> would not jeopardize endangered species.  Stated differently, the consultation process would generate an alternative course of action whereby the transfer could still take placeas required by §402(b) of the CWAbut in such a way that would honor the mandatory requirements of §7(a)(2) of the ESA.  This should come as no surprise to EPA, as it has engaged in pre-transfer consultations at least six times in the past and has stated that it is not barred from doing so by the CWA.<a name="ZD-7ref" href="#ZD-7" class="">

        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Finally, for the rare case in which no reasonable and prudent alternative can be found, Congress has provided yet another mechanism for resolving any conflicts between the ESA and a proposed agency action.  In 1978, shortly after our decision in <em>Hill</em>, Congress amended the ESA to create the Endangered Species Committee, which it authorized to grant exemptions from §7(a)(2).  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/1536.html#e" class="subref" title="subref">16 U. S. C. §1536(e)</a>.  Because it has the authority to approve the extinction of an endangered species, the Endangered Species Committee is colloquially described as the God Squad or God Committee.  In light of this weighty responsibility, Congress carefully laid out requirements for the God Committees membership,<a name="ZD-8ref" href="#ZD-8" class="">

        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    As the final arbiter in situations in which the ESA conflicts with a proposed agency action, the God Committee embodies the primacy of the ESAs mandate and serves as the final mechanism for harmonizing that Act with other federal statutes.  By creating this Committee, Congress recognized that some conflicts with the ESA may not be capable of resolution without having to forever sacrifice some endangered species.  At the same time, the creation of this last line of defense reflects Congress view that the ESA should not yield to another federal action except as a final resort and except when authorized by high level officials after serious consideration.  In short, when all else has failed and two federal statutes are incapable of resolution, Congress left the choice to the Committeenot to this Court; it did not limit the ESA in the way the majority does today.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">B</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    EPAs regulations offer a second way to harmonize the CWA with the ESA.  After EPA has transferred NPDES permitting authority to a State, the agency continues to oversee the States permitting program.  See <em>Arkansas</em> v. <em>Oklahoma</em>,

11206 (2001).  Given these ongoing responsibilities, EPA has enacted a regulation that requires a State to enter into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) that sets forth the particulars of the agencys oversight duties.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/40/123" class="subref" title="subref">40 CFR §123.24</a>(a) (2006).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">The regulation governing MOAs contains several detailed requirements.  For instance, the regulation states that an MOA must contain [p]rovisions specifying classes and categories of permit applications, draft permits and proposed permits that the State will send to the [EPA] Regional Administrator for review, comment and, where applicable, objection, §123.24(b)(2); [p]rovisions specifying the frequency and content of reports, documents and other information which the State is required to submit to the EPA, §123.24(b)(3); and [p]rovisions for coordination of compliance monitoring activities by the State and by EPA, §123.24(b)(4)(i).  More generally, the regulation provides that an MOA may include other terms, conditions, or agreements that are relevant to the administration and enforcement of the States regulatory program.  §123.24(a).  Under the MOA regulation, furthermore, EPA will not approve any MOA that restricts its statutory oversight responsibility.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Like the §7(a)(2) consultation process described above, MOAs provide a potential mechanism for giving effect to §7 of the ESA while also allowing the transfer of permitting authority to a State.  It is important to remember that EPA must approve an MOA <em>prior to</em> the transfer of NPDES authority.  As such, EPA can useand in fact has usedthe MOA process to structure its later oversight in a way that will allow it to protect endangered species in accordance with §7(a)(2) of the ESA.  EPA might negotiate a provision in the MOA that would require a State to abide by the ESA requirements when issuing pollution permits.  See Brief for American Fisheries Society et al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 28. (In the Maine MOA, for example, EPA and the state agreed that state permits would protect ESA-listed species by ensuring compliance with state water quality standards).  Alternatively, EPA could require the state to provide copies of draft permits for discharges in particularly sensitive habitats such as those of ESA-listed species or for discharges that contain a pollutant that threatens ESA-listed wildlife.  <em>Id</em>., at 10.  Or the MOA might be drafted in a way that would allow the agency to object to state permits that would jeopardize any and all endangered species.  See<em> id</em>., at 28 (explaining that the Maine MOA includes a provision allowing EPA to object to any state permit that risks harm to a listed species by threatening water quality).  These are just three of many possibilities.  I need not identify other ways EPA could use the MOA process to comply with the ESA; it is enough to observe that MOAs provide a straightforward way to give the ESA its full effect without restricting §7(a)(2) in the way the Court does.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">IV</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    As discussed above, I believe that the Court incorrectly restricts the reach of §7(a)(2) to discretionary federal actions.  See Part II, <em>supra.</em>  Even if such a limitation were permissible, however, it is clear that EPAs authority to transfer permitting authority under §402(b) <em>is </em>discretionary.<a name="ZD-11ref" href="#ZD-11" class="">

            </a>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The EPA Administrators authority to approve state permit programs pursuant to §402(b) of the CWA does not even fit within the Courts description of the category of mandatory actions that the Court holds are covered by the ESA.  In the Courts words, that category includes actions that an agency is <em>required </em>by statute to undertake once certain specified triggering events have occurred.  <em>Ante</em>, at 22.  The triggering event for EPAs approval is simply the filing of a satisfactory description of the States proposed program.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1342.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §1342(b)</a>.  The statute then commands that the EPA Administrator shall approve the submitted program unless he determines that state law does not satisfy nine specified conditions.  Those conditions are not triggering events; they are potential objections to the exercise of the Administrators authority.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    What is more, §402(b) is a perfect example of why our analysis should not end simply because a statute uses the word shall.  Instead, we must look more closely at its listed criteria to determine whether they allow for discretion, despite the use of shall.  After all, as then-Justice Rehnquists dissenting opinion in the snail darter case explains, a federal statute using the word shall will sometimes allow room for discretion.  See <em>Hill</em>, 437 U. S. at 211212 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).<a name="ZD-12ref" href="#ZD-12" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>12</b>
                </sup>
            </a>  In these cases, there is significant room for discretion in EPAs evaluation of §402(b)s nine conditions.  The first criterion, for example, requires the EPA Administrator to examine five other statutes and ensure that the State has adequate authority to comply with each.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1342.html#b_1_A" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §1342(b)(1)(A)</a>.  One of those five statutes, in turn, expressly directs the Administrator to exercise his judgment.  §1312.  Even the Court acknowledges that EPA must exercise some judgment in determining whether a State has demonstrated that it has the authority to carry out §402(b)s enumerated statutory criteria.  <em>Ante</em>, at 24.  However, in the very same breath, the Court states that the dispositive fact is that the statute clearly does not grant it the discretion to add another entirely separate prerequisite to that list.  <em>Ibid</em>.  This reasoning flouts the Courts own logic.  Under the Courts reading of §402.03, §7(a)(2) applies to discretionary federal actions of any kind.  The Court plainly acknowledges that EPA exercises discretion when deciding whether to transfer permitting authority to a State.  If we are to take the Courts approach seriously, once <em>any</em> discretion has been identifiedas it has here§7(a)(2) must apply.<a name="ZD-13ref" href="#ZD-13" class="">

            </a>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The MOA regulation described in Part IIIB, <em>supra,</em> also demonstrates that an NPDES transfer is not as ministerial a task as the Court would suggest.  The agency retains significant discretion under §123.24 over the content of an MOA, which of course must be approved prior to a transfer. For instance, EPA may require a State to file reports on a weekly basis or a monthly basis.  It may require a State to submit only certain classes and categories of permit applications.  And it may include any additional terms and conditions that are relevant to the enforcement of the NPDES program.  There is ample room for judgment in all of these areas, and EPA has exercised such judgment in the past when approving MOAs from many States.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Approval of Application by Maine to Administer the NPDES Program, 66 Fed. Reg. 12791, (2001); Approval of Application by Maine to Administer the NPDES Program; Texas, 
63Fed. Reg.
51165 (1998).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In fact, in an earlier case raising a question similar to this one, see <em>American Forest &amp; Paper Assn.</em> v. <em>EPA</em>, 137 F. 3d 291, 298299 (CA5 1998), EPA itself explained how 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/40/123" class="subref" title="subref">40 CFR §123.24</a> gives it discretion over the approval of a State pollution control program, see Brief for EPA in No. 9660874 (CA5).  Arguing that [i]ndicia of discretionary involvement or control abound in [its] regulations, the agency listed its MOA regulation as a prime example.<a name="ZD-14ref" href="#ZD-14" class="">

                </sup>
            </a>  Again, because EPAs approval of a State application to administer an NPDES program entails significantindeed, aboundingdiscretion, I would find that §7(a)(2) of the ESA applies even under the Courts own flawed theory of these cases.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    Mindful that judges must always remain faithful to the intent of the legislature, Chief Justice Burger closed his opinion in the snail darter case with a reminder that [o]nce the meaning of an enactment is discerned and its constitutionality determined, the judicial process comes to an end.  <em>Hill</em>, 437 U. S., at 194.  This Court offered a definitive interpretation of the Endangered Species Act nearly 30 years ago in that very case.  Today the Court turns its back on our decision in <em>Hill</em> and places a great number of endangered species in jeopardy, including the cactus ferruginous pygmy-owl and Pima pineapple cactus at issue here.  At the risk of plagiarizing Chief Justice Burgers fine opinion, I think it is appropriate to end my opinion just as he didwith a quotation attributed to Sir Thomas More that has as much relevance today as it did three decades ago.  This quotation illustrates not only the fundamental character of the rule of law embodied in §7 of the ESA but also the pernicious consequences of official disobedience of such a rule.  Repetition of that literary allusion is especially appropriate today:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">The law, Roper, the law.  I know whats legal, not whats right.  And Ill stick to whats legal. . . . Im <em>not</em> God.  The currents and eddies of right and wrong, which you find such plain-sailing, I cant navigate, Im no voyager.  But in the thickets of the law, oh there Im a forester. . . . What would you do?  Cut a great road through the law to get after the Devil? . . . And when the last law was down, and the Devil turned round on youwhere would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat? . . . This country's planted thick with laws from coast to coastMans laws, not Godsand if you cut them down . . . dyou really think you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then? . . . Yes, Id give the Devil benefit of law, for my own safetys sake.  R. Bolt, A Man for All Seasons, Act I, p. 147 (Three Plays, Heinemann ed. 1967) (quoted in <em>Hill</em>, 437 U. S., at 195).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Although its reasons have shifted over time, at both the administrative level and in the federal courts, EPA has insisted that the requirements of §7(a)(2) of the ESA do not apply to its decision to transfer permitting authority under §402(b) of the CWA.  See App. 114; Brief for Petitioner EPA 16, 42.  As I have explained above, that conclusion is contrary to the text of §7(a)(2), our decision in the <em>TVA</em> v. <em>Hill</em>, and the regulation on which the agency has since relied and upon which the Court relies on today.  Accordingly, I would hold that EPAs decision was arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/5/706.html#2_A" class="subref" title="subref">5 U. S. C. §706(2)(A)</a>, and would remand to the agency for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>

But Hill said no such thing.  That case only held that the subsequent appropriation of funds for the Tellico Dam Project could not overcome the mandatory requirements of §7 of the ESA; it did not hold that the TVA would not have been required to spend any and all appropriated funds if the ESA had never been passed.  See Hill, 437 U. S., at 189190.

,that an agency cannot be considered the legal cause of an action that it has no statutory discretion not to takesupports its reliance on §402.03.  Ante, at 20.  First of all, the Court itself recognizes that it must distance itself from that case, ibid., because Public Citizen dealt with a procedural requirement under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), not a substantive requirement like that imposed by §7(a)(2) of the ESA, see TVA v. Hill, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/437/158" class="subref" title="subref">437 U. S. 158</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">188</a>, n. 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">34</a> (1978)
 (holding that NEPA cases are completely inapposite to the ESA context).  What the Court does not recognize, however, is that what it views as the basic principle of Public Citizen is stated too broadly and therefore inapplicable to this case.  Ante, at 20.


Our decision in Public Citizen turned on what we called a critical feature of the case: that the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) had no ability to countermand the Presidents lifting a moratorium that prohibited certain motor carriers from obtaining authority to operate within the United States.  541 U. S., at 766.  Once the President decided to lift that moratorium, and once the relevant vehicles had entered the United States, FMCSA was required by statute to register the vehicles if certain conditions were met.  Ibid. (Under FMCSAs entirely reasonable reading of this provision, it must certify any motor carrier that can show that it is willing and able to comply with the various substantive requirements for safety and financial responsibility contained in DOT regulations; only the moratorium prevented it from doing so for Mexican motor carriers before 2001 (emphasis deleted)).  Therefore, any potential NEPA concerns were generated by another decisionmaker, the President, and not the FMCSA.  Here, by contrast, EPA is not required to act ministerially once another person or agency has made a decision.  Instead, EPA must exercise its own judgment when considering the transfer of NPDES authority to a State; it also has its own authority to deny such a transfer.  Any effect on endangered species will be caused, even if indirectly, by the agencys own decision to transfer NPDES authority.  Cf. 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/402" class="subref" title="subref">50 CFR §402.02</a> (providing that the ESA will apply to all agency activities that directly or indirectly caus[e] modifications to the land, water, or air (emphasis added)).

        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-14" href="#ZD-14ref">14</a> EPA also discussed several other regulations that give it discretion.  For example, under 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/40/123" class="subref" title="subref">40 CFR §123.61</a>(b), EPA is required to solicit public comments on a States transfer application, and it must approve or disapprove the program after taking into consideration all comments received.  As EPA explained in its Fifth Circuit brief, if it were simply acting in a ministerial fashion, such weighing of the merits of public comments would be unnecessary.  Brief for EPA in No. 9660874 (CA5).

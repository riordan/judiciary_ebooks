				To ensure disabled children a free appropriate public education, 
20 U. S. C. A. §1400(d)(1)(A), the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA or Act) requires school districts to create an individualized education program (IEP) for each disabled child, §1414(d), and authorizes parents challenging their childs IEP to request an impartial due process hearing, §1415(f), but does not specify which party bears the burden of persuasion at that hearing.  After an IDEA hearing initiated by petitioners, the Administrative Law Judge held that they bore the burden of persuasion and ruled in favor of respondents.  The District Court reversed, concluding that the burden of persuasion is on the school district.  The Fourth Circuit reversed the District Court, concluding that petitioners had offered no persuasive reason to depart from the normal rule of allocating the burden to the party seeking relief.

            <em>
					Held:&lt;font b="1" i="1"&gt; 
				</em>
				The burden of persuasion in an administrative hearing challenging an IEP is properly placed upon the party seeking relief, whether that is the disabled child or the school district.  Pp. 612.
			</p>
        <p class="SYLCTF">
				
				    
				(a) Because IDEA is silent on the allocation of the burden of persuasion, this Court begins with the ordinary default rule that plaintiffs bear the burden regarding the essential aspects of their claims.  Although the ordinary rule admits  of exceptions, decisions that place the 
				<em>
					entire 
				</em>
				burden of persuasion on the opposing party at the 
				<em>
					outset
				</em>
				 of a proceedingas petitioners urge the Court to do hereare extremely rare.  Absent some reason to believe that Congress intended otherwise, the Court will conclude that the burden of persuasion lies where it usually falls, upon the party seeking relief.  Pp. 68.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				(b) Petitioners arguments for departing from the ordinary default rule are rejected.  Petitioners assertion that putting the burden of persuasion on school districts will help ensure that children receive a free appropriate public education is unavailing.  Assigning the burden to schools might encourage them to put more resources into preparing IEPs and presenting their evidence, but IDEA is silent about whether marginal dollars should be allocated to litigation and administrative expenditures or to educational services.  There is reason to believe that a great deal is already spent on IDEA administration, and Congress has repeatedly amended the Act to reduce its administrative and litigation-related costs.  The Act also does not support petitioners conclusion, in effect, that every IEP should be assumed to be invalid until the school district demonstrates that it is not.  Petitioners most plausible argumentthat ordinary fairness requires that a litigant not have the burden of establishing facts peculiarly within the knowledge of his adversary,

175, as amended, 
20 U. S. C. A. §1400<em>

				</em>
				 (main ed. and Supp. 2005), is a Spending Clause statute that seeks to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education,  §1400(d)(1)(A).  Under IDEA, school districts must create an individualized education program (IEP) for each disabled child.  §1414(d).  If parents believe their childs IEP is inappropriate, they may request an impartial due process hearing.  §1415(f).  The Act is silent, however, as to which party bears the burden of persuasion at such a hearing.  We hold that the burden lies, as it typically does, on the party seeking relief.

				Congress first passed IDEA as part of the Education of the Handicapped Act in 1970,

175, and amended it substantially in the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975,

At the time the majority of disabled children in America were either totally excluded from schools or sitting idly in regular classrooms awaiting the time when they were old enough to drop out,  H. R. Rep. No. 94332, p. 2 (1975).  IDEA was intended to reverse this history of neglect.  As of 2003, the Act governed the provision of special education services to nearly 7 million children across the country.  See Dept. of Education, Office of Special Education Programs, Data Analysis System, http://www.ideadata.org/tables27th/ar_ aa9.htm (as visited Nov. 9, 2005, and available in Clerk of Courts case file).

				The core of the statute, however, is the cooperative process that it establishes between parents and schools.  
				<em>
					Rowley, supra
				</em>
				, at 205206 (Congress placed every bit as much emphasis upon compliance with procedures giving parents and guardians a large measure of participation at every stage of the administrative process, . . . as it did upon the measurement of the resulting IEP against a substantive standard).  The central vehicle for this collaboration is the IEP process.  State educational authorities must identify and evaluate disabled children, §§1414(a)(c), develop an IEP for each one, §1414(d)(2), and review every IEP at least once a year, §1414(d)(4).  Each IEP must include an assessment of the childs current educational performance, must articulate measurable educational goals, and must specify the nature of the special services that the school will provide. §1414(d)(1)(A).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Parents and guardians play a significant role in the IEP process.  They must be informed about and consent to evaluations of their child under the Act.  §1414(c)(3).  Parents are included as members of IEP teams.  §1414(d)(1)(B).  They have the right to examine any records relating to their child, and to obtain an independent educational evaluation of the[ir] child.  §1415(b)(1).  They must be given written prior notice of any changes in an IEP, §1415(b)(3), and be notified in writing of the procedural safeguards available to them under the Act, §1415(d)(1).  If parents believe that an IEP is not appropriate, they may seek an administrative impartial due process hearing.  §1415(f).  School districts may also seek such hearings, as Congress clarified in the 2004 amendments.  See S. Rep. No. 108185, p. 37 (2003).  They may do so, for example, if they wish to change an existing IEP but the parents do not consent, or if parents refuse to allow their child to be evaluated.  As a practical matter, it appears that most hearing requests come from parents rather than schools.  Brief for Petitioners 7.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Although state authorities have limited discretion to determine who conducts the hearings, §1415(f)(1)), and responsibility generally for establishing fair hearing procedures, §1415(a), Congress has chosen to legislate the central components of due process hearings.  It has imposed minimal pleading standards, requiring parties to file complaints setting forth a description of the nature of the problem, §1415(b)(7)(B)(ii), and a proposed resolution of the problem to the extent known and available . . . at the time, §1415(b)(7)(B)(iii).  At the hearing, all parties may be accompanied by counsel, and may present evidence and confront, cross-examine, and compel the attendance of witnesses.  §§1415(h)(1)(2).  After the hearing, any aggrieved party may bring a civil action in state or federal court.  §1415(i)(2).  Prevailing parents may also recover attorneys fees.  §1415(i)(3)(B).  Congress has never explicitly stated, however, which party should bear the burden of proof at IDEA hearings.

				This case concerns the educational services that were due, under IDEA, to petitioner Brian Schaffer.  Brian suffers from learning disabilities and speech-language impairments.  From prekindergarten through seventh grade he attended a private school and struggled academically.  In 1997, school officials informed Brians mother that he needed a school that could better accommodate his needs.  Brians parents contacted respondent Montgomery County Public Schools System (MCPS) seeking a placement for him for the following school year.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				MCPS evaluated Brian and convened an IEP team.  The committee generated an initial IEP offering Brian a place in either of two MCPS middle schools.  Brians parents were not satisfied with the arrangement, believing that Brian needed smaller classes and more intensive services.  The Schaffers thus enrolled Brian in another private school, and initiated a due process hearing challenging the IEP and seeking compensation for the cost of Brians subsequent private education.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In Maryland, IEP hearings are conducted by administrative law judges (ALJs).  See Md. Educ. Code Ann. §8413(c) (Lexis 2004).  After a 3-day hearing, the ALJ deemed the evidence close, held that the parents bore the burden of persuasion, and ruled in favor of the school district.  The parents brought a civil action challenging the result.  The United States District Court for the District of Maryland reversed and remanded, after concluding that the burden of persuasion is on the school district.  
				<em>
					Brian S. 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					Vance
				</em>
				, 86 F. Supp. 2d 538 (2000). 
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				Around the same time, MCPS offered Brian a placement in a high school with a special learning center.  Brians parents accepted, and Brian was educated in that program until he graduated from high school.  The suit remained alive, however, because the parents sought compensation for the private school tuition and related expenses.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Respondents appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.  While the appeal was pending, the ALJ reconsidered the case, deemed the evidence truly in equipoise, and ruled in favor of the parents.  The Fourth Circuit vacated and remanded the appeal so that it could consider the burden of proof issue along with the merits on a later appeal.  The District Court reaffirmed its ruling that the school district has the burden of proof.  240 F. Supp. 2d 396 (Md. 2002).  On appeal, a divided panel of the Fourth Circuit reversed.  Judge Michael, writing for the majority, concluded that petitioners offered no persuasive reason to depart from the normal rule of allocating the burden to the party seeking relief.  377 F. 3d 449, 453 (2004).  We granted certiorari,

				The term burden of proof is one of the slipperiest member[s] of the family of legal terms.  2 J. Strong, McCormick on Evidence §342, p. 433 (5th ed. 1999) (hereinafter McCormick).  Part of the confusion surrounding the term arises from the fact that historically, the concept encompassed two distinct burdens: the burden of persuasion, 
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, which party loses if the evidence is closely balanced, and the burden of production, 
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, which party bears the obligation to come forward with the evidence at different points in the proceeding.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">272</a> (1994)
.  We note at the outset that this case concerns only the burden of persuasion, as the parties agree, Brief for Respondents 14; Reply Brief for Petitioners 15, and when we speak of burden of proof in this opinion, it is this to which we refer.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				When we are determining the burden of proof under a statutory cause of action, the touchstone of our inquiry is, of course, the statute.  The plain text of IDEA is silent on the allocation of the burden of persuasion.  We therefore begin with the ordinary default rule that plaintiffs bear the risk of failing to prove their claims.  McCormick §337, at 412 (The burdens of pleading and proof with regard to most facts have and should be assigned to the plaintiff who generally seeks to change the present state of affairs and who therefore naturally should be expected to bear the risk of failure or proof or persuasion); C. Mueller &amp; L. Kirkpatrick, Evidence §3.1, p. 104 (3d ed. 2003) (Perhaps the broadest and most accepted idea is that the person who seeks court action should justify the request, which means that the plaintiffs bear the burdens on the elements in their claims).  
				    
				
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Thus, we have usually assumed without comment that plaintiffs bear the burden of persuasion regarding the essential aspects of their claims.  For example, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/2000e-2.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §2000e2</a>
            <em>
					et seq.
				</em>
				, does not directly state that plaintiffs bear the ultimate burden of persuasion, but we have so concluded.

				The ordinary default rule, of course, admits of exceptions.  See McCormick §337, at 412415.  For example, the burden of persuasion as to certain elements of a plantiffs claim may be shifted to defendants, when such elements can fairly be characterized as affirmative defenses or exemptions.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					FTC
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Morton Salt Co.,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">44</a>45 (1948)

				<em>

				</em>
				 of a proceedingas petitioners urge us to do hereare extremely rare.  Absent some reason to believe that Congress intended otherwise, therefore, we will conclude that the burden of persuasion lies where it usually falls, upon the party seeking relief.

				Petitioners also urge that putting the burden of persuasion on school districts will further IDEAs purposes because it will help ensure that children receive a free appropriate public education.  In truth, however, very few cases will be in evidentiary equipoise.  Assigning the burden of persuasion to school districts might encourage schools to put more resources into preparing IEPs and presenting their evidence.  But IDEA is silent about whether marginal dollars should be allocated to litigation and administrative expenditures or to educational services.  Moreover, there is reason to believe that a great deal is already spent on the administration of the Act.  Litigating a due process complaint is an expensive affair, costing schools approximately $8,000-to-$12,000 per hearing.  See Department of Education, J. Chambers, J. Harr, &amp; A. Dhanani, What Are We Spending on Procedural Safeguards in Special Education 19992000, p. 8 (May 2003) (prepared under contract by American Institute for Research, Special Education Expenditure Project).  Congress has also repeatedly amended the Act in order to reduce its administrative and litigation-related costs.  For example, in 1997 Congress mandated that States offer mediation for IDEA disputes.  Individuals with Disabilities Education Act Amendments of 1997, Pub. L. 10517, §615(e), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">111</a>Stat.

It also made new findings that [p]arents and schools should be given expanded opportunities to resolve their disagreements in positive and constructive ways, and that [t]eachers, schools, local educational agencies, and States should be relieved of irrelevant and unnecessary paperwork burdens that do not lead to improved educational outcomes.  §§1400(c)(8)(9).

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Petitioners in effect ask this Court to assume that every IEP is invalid until the school district demonstrates that it is not.  The Act does not support this conclusion.  IDEA relies heavily upon the expertise of school districts to meet its goals.  It also includes a so-called stay-put provision, which requires a child to remain in his or her then-current educational placement during the pendency of an IDEA hearing. §1415(j).  Congress could have required that a child be given the educational placement that a parent
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				requested during a dispute, but it did no such thing.  Congress appears to have presumed instead that, if the Acts procedural requirements are respected, parents will prevail when they have legitimate grievances.  See 
				<em>
					Rowley, supra
				</em>
				, at 206 (noting the legislative conviction that adequate compliance with the procedures prescribed would in most cases assure much if not all of what Congress wished in the way of substantive content in an IEP).

				 6 Pet. 302, 312 (1832); see also McCormick §337, at 413 (Very often one must plead and prove matters as to which his adversary has superior access to the proof).  School districts have a natural advantage in information and expertise, but Congress addressed this when it obliged schools to safeguard the procedural rights of parents and to share information with them.  See 
				<em>
					School Comm. of Burlington
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Department of Ed. of Mass.,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/471/359" class="subref" title="subref">471 U. S. 359</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">368</a> (1985)
.  As noted above, parents have the right to review all records that the school possesses in relation to their child. §1415(b)(1).  They also have the right to an independent educational evaluation of the[ir] child.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  The regulations clarify this entitlement by providing that a parent has the right to an independent educational evaluation at public expense if the parent disagrees with an evaluation obtained by the public agency.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/34/300" class="subref" title="subref">34 CFR §300.502</a>(b)(1) (2005).  IDEA thus ensures parents access to an expert who can evaluate all the materials that the school must make available, and who can give an independent opinion.  They are not left to challenge the government without a realistic opportunity to access the necessary evidence, or without an expert with the firepower to match the opposition.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Additionally, in 2004, Congress added provisions requiring school districts to answer the subject matter of a complaint in writing, and to provide parents with the reasoning behind the disputed action, details about the other options considered and rejected by the IEP team, and a description of all evaluations, reports, and other factors that the school used in coming to its decision.

20 U. S. C. A. §1415(c)(2)(B)(i)(I) (Supp. 2005).  Prior to a hearing, the parties must disclose evaluations and recommendations that they intend to rely upon.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/20/1415.html#f_2" class="subref" title="subref">20 U. S. C. §1415(f)(2)</a>.  IDEA hearings are deliberately informal and intended to give ALJs the flexibility that they need to ensure that each side can fairly present its evidence.  IDEA, in fact, requires state authorities to organize hearings in a way that guarantees parents and children the procedural protections of the Act.  See §1415(a).  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, parents may recover attorneys fees if they prevail.  §1415(i)(3)(B).  These protections ensure that the school bears no unique informational advantage.

				Finally, respondents and several States urge us to decide that States may, if they wish, override the default rule and put the burden always on the school district.  Several States have laws or regulations purporting to do so, at least under some circumstances.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 Minn. Stat. §125A.091, subd. 16 (2004); Ala. Admin. Code Rule 29089.08(8)(c)(6) (Supp. 2004); Alaska Admin. Code tit. 4, §52.550(e)(9) (2003); Del. Code Ann., Tit. 14, §3140 (1999).  Because no such law or regulation exists in Maryland, we need not decide this issue today.  
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Breyer
				</span>
				 contends that the allocation of the burden ought to be left 
				<em>
					entirely
				</em>
				 up to the States.  But neither party made this argument before this Court or the courts below.  We therefore decline to address it.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				
				We hold no more than we must to resolve the case at hand: The burden of proof in an administrative hearing challenging an IEP is properly placed upon the party seeking relief.  In this case, that party is Brian, as represented by his parents.  But the rule applies with equal effect to school districts: If they seek to challenge an IEP, they will in turn bear the burden of persuasion before an ALJ.  The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit is, therefore, affirmed.

Under IDEA, school districts must create an individualized education program (IEP) for each disabled child.  §1414(d).  If parents believe their childs IEP is inappropriate, they may request an impartial due process hearing.  §1415(f).  The Act is silent, however, as to which party bears the burden of persuasion at such a hearing.  We hold that the burden lies, as it typically does, on the party seeking relief.

R. Rep. No. 94332, p. 2 (1975).  IDEA was intended to reverse this history of neglect.  As of 2003, the Act governed the provision of special education services to nearly 7 million children across the country.

				The core of the statute, however, is the cooperative process that it establishes between parents and schools.  
				<em>
					Rowley, supra
				</em>
				, at 205206 (Congress placed every bit as much emphasis upon compliance with procedures giving parents and guardians a large measure of participation at every stage of the administrative process, . . . as it did upon the measurement of the resulting IEP against a substantive standard).  The central vehicle for this collaboration is the IEP process.  State educational authorities must identify and evaluate disabled children, §§1414(a)(c), develop an IEP for each one, §1414(d)(2), and review every IEP at least once a year, §1414(d)(4).  Each IEP must include an assessment of the childs current educational performance, must articulate measurable educational goals, and must specify the nature of the special services that the school will provide. §1414(d)(1)(A).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Parents and guardians play a significant role in the IEP process.  They must be informed about and consent to evaluations of their child under the Act.  §1414(c)(3).  Parents are included as members of IEP teams.  §1414(d)(1)(B).  They have the right to examine any records relating to their child, and to obtain an independent educational evaluation of the[ir] child.  §1415(b)(1).  They must be given written prior notice of any changes in an IEP, §1415(b)(3), and be notified in writing of the procedural safeguards available to them under the Act, §1415(d)(1).  If parents believe that an IEP is not appropriate, they may seek an administrative impartial due process hearing.  §1415(f).  School districts may also seek such hearings, as Congress clarified in the 2004 amendments.  See S. Rep. No. 108185, p. 37 (2003).  They may do so, for example, if they wish to change an existing IEP but the parents do not consent, or if parents refuse to allow their child to be evaluated.  As a practical matter, it appears that most hearing requests come from parents rather than schools.  Brief for Petitioners 7.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Although state authorities have limited discretion to determine who conducts the hearings, §1415(f)(1)), and responsibility generally for establishing fair hearing procedures, §1415(a), Congress has chosen to legislate the central components of due process hearings.  It has imposed minimal pleading standards, requiring parties to file complaints setting forth a description of the nature of the problem, §1415(b)(7)(B)(ii), and a proposed resolution of the problem to the extent known and available . . . at the time, §1415(b)(7)(B)(iii).  At the hearing, all parties may be accompanied by counsel, and may present evidence and confront, cross-examine, and compel the attendance of witnesses.  §§1415(h)(1)(2).  After the hearing, any aggrieved party may bring a civil action in state or federal court.  §1415(i)(2).  Prevailing parents may also recover attorneys fees.  §1415(i)(3)(B).  Congress has never explicitly stated, however, which party should bear the burden of proof at IDEA hearings.

				This case concerns the educational services that were due, under IDEA, to petitioner Brian Schaffer.  Brian suffers from learning disabilities and speech-language impairments.  From prekindergarten through seventh grade he attended a private school and struggled academically.  In 1997, school officials informed Brians mother that he needed a school that could better accommodate his needs.  Brians parents contacted respondent Montgomery County Public Schools System (MCPS) seeking a placement for him for the following school year.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				MCPS evaluated Brian and convened an IEP team.  The committee generated an initial IEP offering Brian a place in either of two MCPS middle schools.  Brians parents were not satisfied with the arrangement, believing that Brian needed smaller classes and more intensive services.  The Schaffers thus enrolled Brian in another private school, and initiated a due process hearing challenging the IEP and seeking compensation for the cost of Brians subsequent private education.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In Maryland, IEP hearings are conducted by administrative law judges (ALJs).  See Md. Educ. Code Ann. §8413(c) (Lexis 2004).  After a 3-day hearing, the ALJ deemed the evidence close, held that the parents bore the burden of persuasion, and ruled in favor of the school district.  The parents brought a civil action challenging the result.  The United States District Court for the District of Maryland reversed and remanded, after concluding that the burden of persuasion is on the school district.

				Around the same time, MCPS offered Brian a placement in a high school with a special learning center.  Brians parents accepted, and Brian was educated in that program until he graduated from high school.  The suit remained alive, however, because the parents sought compensation for the private school tuition and related expenses.

				Respondents appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.  While the appeal was pending, the ALJ reconsidered the case, deemed the evidence truly in equipoise, and ruled in favor of the parents.  The Fourth Circuit vacated and remanded the appeal so that it could consider the burden of proof issue along with the merits on a later appeal.  The District Court reaffirmed its ruling that the school district has the burden of proof.  240 F. Supp. 2d 396 (Md. 2002).  On appeal, a divided panel of the Fourth Circuit reversed.  Judge Michael, writing for the majority, concluded that petitioners offered no persuasive reason to depart from the normal rule of allocating the burden to the party seeking relief.  377 F. 3d 449, 453 (2004).

				The term burden of proof is one of the slipperiest member[s] of the family of legal terms.  2 J. Strong, McCormick on Evidence §342, p. 433 (5th ed. 1999) (hereinafter McCormick).  Part of the confusion surrounding the term arises from the fact that historically, the concept encompassed two distinct burdens: the burden of persuasion, 
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, which party loses if the evidence is closely balanced, and the burden of production, 
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, which party bears the obligation to come forward with the evidence at different points in the proceeding.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">272</a> (1994)
.  We note at the outset that this case concerns only the burden of persuasion, as the parties agree, Brief for Respondents 14; Reply Brief for Petitioners 15, and when we speak of burden of proof in this opinion, it is this to which we refer.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				When we are determining the burden of proof under a statutory cause of action, the touchstone of our inquiry is, of course, the statute.  The plain text of IDEA is silent on the allocation of the burden of persuasion.  We therefore begin with the ordinary default rule that plaintiffs bear the risk of failing to prove their claims.  McCormick §337, at 412 (The burdens of pleading and proof with regard to most facts have and should be assigned to the plaintiff who generally seeks to change the present state of affairs and who therefore naturally should be expected to bear the risk of failure or proof or persuasion); C. Mueller &amp; L. Kirkpatrick, Evidence §3.1, p. 104 (3d ed. 2003) (Perhaps the broadest and most accepted idea is that the person who seeks court action should justify the request, which means that the plaintiffs bear the burdens on the elements in their claims).  
				    
				
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Thus, we have usually assumed without comment that plaintiffs bear the burden of persuasion regarding the essential aspects of their claims.  For example, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/2000e-2.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §2000e2</a>
            <em>

				The ordinary default rule, of course, admits of exceptions.  See McCormick §337, at 412415.  For example, the burden of persuasion as to certain elements of a plantiffs claim may be shifted to defendants, when such elements can fairly be characterized as affirmative defenses or exemptions.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					FTC
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Morton Salt Co.,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/334/37" class="subref" title="subref">334 U. S. 37</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">44</a>45 (1948)
.  Under some circumstances this Court has even placed the burden of persuasion over an entire claim on the defendant.  See 
				<em>
					Alaska Dept. of Environmental Conservation
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					EPA, 
				</em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">494</a> (2004)
.  But while the normal default rule does not solve all cases, it certainly solves most of them.  Decisions that place the 
				<em>
					entire 
				</em>
				burden of persuasion on the opposing party at the 
				<em>
					outset
				</em>
				 of a proceedingas petitioners urge us to do hereare extremely rare.  Absent some reason to believe that Congress intended otherwise, therefore, we will conclude that the burden of persuasion lies where it usually falls, upon the party seeking relief.

				<em>

				<em>
					Rowley,
				</em>
				 458 U. S., at 194.  As the court below noted, however, the fact that Congress took a number of the procedural safeguards from 
				<em>

				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Mills
				</em>
				 and wrote them directly into the Act does not allow us to conclude . . . that Congress intended to adopt the ideas that it failed to write into the text of the statute.  377 F. 3d, at 455.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Petitioners also urge that putting the burden of persuasion on school districts will further IDEAs purposes because it will help ensure that children receive a free appropriate public education.  In truth, however, very few cases will be in evidentiary equipoise.  Assigning the burden of persuasion to school districts might encourage schools to put more resources into preparing IEPs and presenting their evidence.  But IDEA is silent about whether marginal dollars should be allocated to litigation and administrative expenditures or to educational services.  Moreover, there is reason to believe that a great deal is already spent on the administration of the Act.  Litigating a due process complaint is an expensive affair, costing schools approximately $8,000-to-$12,000 per hearing.  See Department of Education, J. Chambers, J. Harr, &amp; A. Dhanani, What Are We Spending on Procedural Safeguards in Special Education 19992000, p. 8 (May 2003) (prepared under contract by American Institute for Research, Special Education Expenditure Project).  Congress has also repeatedly amended the Act in order to reduce its administrative and litigation-related costs.  For example, in 1997 Congress mandated that States offer mediation for IDEA disputes.  Individuals with Disabilities Education Act Amendments of 1997, Pub. L. 10517, §615(e), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">111</a>Stat.

It also made new findings that [p]arents and schools should be given expanded opportunities to resolve their disagreements in positive and constructive ways, and that [t]eachers, schools, local educational agencies, and States should be relieved of irrelevant and unnecessary paperwork burdens that do not lead to improved educational outcomes.  §§1400(c)(8)(9).

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Petitioners in effect ask this Court to assume that every IEP is invalid until the school district demonstrates that it is not.  The Act does not support this conclusion.  IDEA relies heavily upon the expertise of school districts to meet its goals.  It also includes a so-called stay-put provision, which requires a child to remain in his or her then-current educational placement during the pendency of an IDEA hearing. §1415(j).  Congress could have required that a child be given the educational placement that a parent
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				requested during a dispute, but it did no such thing.  Congress appears to have presumed instead that, if the Acts procedural requirements are respected, parents will prevail when they have legitimate grievances.  See 
				<em>
					Rowley, supra
				</em>
				, at 206 (noting the legislative conviction that adequate compliance with the procedures prescribed would in most cases assure much if not all of what Congress wished in the way of substantive content in an IEP).

				</em>
				 6 Pet. 302, 312 (1832); see also McCormick §337, at 413 (Very often one must plead and prove matters as to which his adversary has superior access to the proof).  School districts have a natural advantage in information and expertise, but Congress addressed this when it obliged schools to safeguard the procedural rights of parents and to share information with them.  See 
				<em>
					School Comm. of Burlington
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Department of Ed. of Mass.,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/471/359" class="subref" title="subref">471 U. S. 359</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">368</a> (1985)
.  As noted above, parents have the right to review all records that the school possesses in relation to their child. §1415(b)(1).  They also have the right to an independent educational evaluation of the[ir] child.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  The regulations clarify this entitlement by providing that a parent has the right to an independent educational evaluation at public expense if the parent disagrees with an evaluation obtained by the public agency.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/34/300" class="subref" title="subref">34 CFR §300.502</a>(b)(1) (2005).  IDEA thus ensures parents access to an expert who can evaluate all the materials that the school must make available, and who can give an independent opinion.  They are not left to challenge the government without a realistic opportunity to access the necessary evidence, or without an expert with the firepower to match the opposition.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Additionally, in 2004, Congress added provisions requiring school districts to answer the subject matter of a complaint in writing, and to provide parents with the reasoning behind the disputed action, details about the other options considered and rejected by the IEP team, and a description of all evaluations, reports, and other factors that the school used in coming to its decision.  Pub. L. 108446, §615(c)(2)(B)(i)(I), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">118</a>Stat.
2718, 
20 U. S. C. A. §1415(c)(2)(B)(i)(I) (Supp. 2005).  Prior to a hearing, the parties must disclose evaluations and recommendations that they intend to rely upon.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/20/1415.html#f_2" class="subref" title="subref">20 U. S. C. §1415(f)(2)</a>.  IDEA hearings are deliberately informal and intended to give ALJs the flexibility that they need to ensure that each side can fairly present its evidence.  IDEA, in fact, requires state authorities to organize hearings in a way that guarantees parents and children the procedural protections of the Act.  See §1415(a).  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, parents may recover attorneys fees if they prevail.  §1415(i)(3)(B).  These protections ensure that the school bears no unique informational advantage.

				Finally, respondents and several States urge us to decide that States may, if they wish, override the default rule and put the burden always on the school district.  Several States have laws or regulations purporting to do so, at least under some circumstances.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 Minn. Stat. §125A.091, subd. 16 (2004); Ala. Admin. Code Rule 29089.08(8)(c)(6) (Supp. 2004); Alaska Admin. Code tit. 4, §52.550(e)(9) (2003); Del. Code Ann., Tit. 14, §3140 (1999).  Because no such law or regulation exists in Maryland, we need not decide this issue today.  
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Breyer
				</span>
				 contends that the allocation of the burden ought to be left 
				<em>
					entirely
				</em>
				 up to the States.  But neither party made this argument before this Court or the courts below.  We therefore decline to address it.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				
				We hold no more than we must to resolve the case at hand: The burden of proof in an administrative hearing challenging an IEP is properly placed upon the party seeking relief.  In this case, that party is Brian, as represented by his parents.  But the rule applies with equal effect to school districts: If they seek to challenge an IEP, they will in turn bear the burden of persuasion before an ALJ.  The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit is, therefore, affirmed.

175, as amended, 
20 U. S. C. A. §1400<em>

				 (main ed. and Supp. 2005), is a Spending Clause statute that seeks to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education,  §1400(d)(1)(A).  Under IDEA, school districts must create an individualized education program (IEP) for each disabled child.  §1414(d).  If parents believe their childs IEP is inappropriate, they may request an impartial due process hearing.  §1415(f).  The Act is silent, however, as to which party bears the burden of persuasion at such a hearing.  We hold that the burden lies, as it typically does, on the party seeking relief.

				, at 205206 (Congress placed every bit as much emphasis upon compliance with procedures giving parents and guardians a large measure of participation at every stage of the administrative process, . . . as it did upon the measurement of the resulting IEP against a substantive standard).  The central vehicle for this collaboration is the IEP process.  State educational authorities must identify and evaluate disabled children, §§1414(a)(c), develop an IEP for each one, §1414(d)(2), and review every IEP at least once a year, §1414(d)(4).  Each IEP must include an assessment of the childs current educational performance, must articulate measurable educational goals, and must specify the nature of the special services that the school will provide. §1414(d)(1)(A).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Parents and guardians play a significant role in the IEP process.  They must be informed about and consent to evaluations of their child under the Act.  §1414(c)(3).  Parents are included as members of IEP teams.  §1414(d)(1)(B).  They have the right to examine any records relating to their child, and to obtain an independent educational evaluation of the[ir] child.  §1415(b)(1).  They must be given written prior notice of any changes in an IEP, §1415(b)(3), and be notified in writing of the procedural safeguards available to them under the Act, §1415(d)(1).  If parents believe that an IEP is not appropriate, they may seek an administrative impartial due process hearing.  §1415(f).  School districts may also seek such hearings, as Congress clarified in the 2004 amendments.  See S. Rep. No. 108185, p. 37 (2003).  They may do so, for example, if they wish to change an existing IEP but the parents do not consent, or if parents refuse to allow their child to be evaluated.  As a practical matter, it appears that most hearing requests come from parents rather than schools.  Brief for Petitioners 7.

				Although state authorities have limited discretion to determine who conducts the hearings, §1415(f)(1)), and responsibility generally for establishing fair hearing procedures, §1415(a), Congress has chosen to legislate the central components of due process hearings.  It has imposed minimal pleading standards, requiring parties to file complaints setting forth a description of the nature of the problem, §1415(b)(7)(B)(ii), and a proposed resolution of the problem to the extent known and available . . . at the time, §1415(b)(7)(B)(iii).  At the hearing, all parties may be accompanied by counsel, and may present evidence and confront, cross-examine, and compel the attendance of witnesses.  §§1415(h)(1)(2).  After the hearing, any aggrieved party may bring a civil action in state or federal court.  §1415(i)(2).  Prevailing parents may also recover attorneys fees.  §1415(i)(3)(B).  Congress has never explicitly stated, however, which party should bear the burden of proof at IDEA hearings.

				This case concerns the educational services that were due, under IDEA, to petitioner Brian Schaffer.  Brian suffers from learning disabilities and speech-language impairments.  From prekindergarten through seventh grade he attended a private school and struggled academically.  In 1997, school officials informed Brians mother that he needed a school that could better accommodate his needs.  Brians parents contacted respondent Montgomery County Public Schools System (MCPS) seeking a placement for him for the following school year.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				MCPS evaluated Brian and convened an IEP team.  The committee generated an initial IEP offering Brian a place in either of two MCPS middle schools.  Brians parents were not satisfied with the arrangement, believing that Brian needed smaller classes and more intensive services.  The Schaffers thus enrolled Brian in another private school, and initiated a due process hearing challenging the IEP and seeking compensation for the cost of Brians subsequent private education.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In Maryland, IEP hearings are conducted by administrative law judges (ALJs).  See Md. Educ. Code Ann. §8413(c) (Lexis 2004).  After a 3-day hearing, the ALJ deemed the evidence close, held that the parents bore the burden of persuasion, and ruled in favor of the school district.  The parents brought a civil action challenging the result.  The United States District Court for the District of Maryland reversed and remanded, after concluding that the burden of persuasion is on the school district.

				Around the same time, MCPS offered Brian a placement in a high school with a special learning center.  Brians parents accepted, and Brian was educated in that program until he graduated from high school.  The suit remained alive, however, because the parents sought compensation for the private school tuition and related expenses.

				Respondents appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.  While the appeal was pending, the ALJ reconsidered the case, deemed the evidence truly in equipoise, and ruled in favor of the parents.  The Fourth Circuit vacated and remanded the appeal so that it could consider the burden of proof issue along with the merits on a later appeal.  The District Court reaffirmed its ruling that the school district has the burden of proof.  240 F. Supp. 2d 396 (Md. 2002).  On appeal, a divided panel of the Fourth Circuit reversed.  Judge Michael, writing for the majority, concluded that petitioners offered no persuasive reason to depart from the normal rule of allocating the burden to the party seeking relief.  377 F. 3d 449, 453 (2004).

				The term burden of proof is one of the slipperiest member[s] of the family of legal terms.  2 J. Strong, McCormick on Evidence §342, p. 433 (5th ed. 1999) (hereinafter McCormick).  Part of the confusion surrounding the term arises from the fact that historically, the concept encompassed two distinct burdens: the burden of persuasion, 
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, which party loses if the evidence is closely balanced, and the burden of production, 
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, which party bears the obligation to come forward with the evidence at different points in the proceeding.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">272</a> (1994)
.  We note at the outset that this case concerns only the burden of persuasion, as the parties agree, Brief for Respondents 14; Reply Brief for Petitioners 15, and when we speak of burden of proof in this opinion, it is this to which we refer.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				When we are determining the burden of proof under a statutory cause of action, the touchstone of our inquiry is, of course, the statute.  The plain text of IDEA is silent on the allocation of the burden of persuasion.  We therefore begin with the ordinary default rule that plaintiffs bear the risk of failing to prove their claims.  McCormick §337, at 412 (The burdens of pleading and proof with regard to most facts have and should be assigned to the plaintiff who generally seeks to change the present state of affairs and who therefore naturally should be expected to bear the risk of failure or proof or persuasion); C. Mueller &amp; L. Kirkpatrick, Evidence §3.1, p. 104 (3d ed. 2003) (Perhaps the broadest and most accepted idea is that the person who seeks court action should justify the request, which means that the plaintiffs bear the burdens on the elements in their claims).  
				    
				
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Thus, we have usually assumed without comment that plaintiffs bear the burden of persuasion regarding the essential aspects of their claims.  For example, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/2000e-2.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §2000e2</a>
            <em>

				The ordinary default rule, of course, admits of exceptions.  See McCormick §337, at 412415.  For example, the burden of persuasion as to certain elements of a plantiffs claim may be shifted to defendants, when such elements can fairly be characterized as affirmative defenses or exemptions.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					FTC
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Morton Salt Co.,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">44</a>45 (1948)
.  Under some circumstances this Court has even placed the burden of persuasion over an entire claim on the defendant.  See 
				<em>
					Alaska Dept. of Environmental Conservation
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					EPA,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">494</a> (2004)
.  But while the normal default rule does not solve all cases, it certainly solves most of them.  Decisions that place the 
				<em>
					entire 
				</em>
				burden of persuasion on the opposing party at the 
				<em>
					outset
				</em>
				 of a proceedingas petitioners urge us to do hereare extremely rare.  Absent some reason to believe that Congress intended otherwise, therefore, we will conclude that the burden of persuasion lies where it usually falls, upon the party seeking relief.

				<em>

				<em>

				</em>
				 and wrote them directly into the Act does not allow us to conclude . . . that Congress intended to adopt the ideas that it failed to write into the text of the statute.  377 F. 3d, at 455.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Petitioners also urge that putting the burden of persuasion on school districts will further IDEAs purposes because it will help ensure that children receive a free appropriate public education.  In truth, however, very few cases will be in evidentiary equipoise.  Assigning the burden of persuasion to school districts might encourage schools to put more resources into preparing IEPs and presenting their evidence.  But IDEA is silent about whether marginal dollars should be allocated to litigation and administrative expenditures or to educational services.  Moreover, there is reason to believe that a great deal is already spent on the administration of the Act.  Litigating a due process complaint is an expensive affair, costing schools approximately $8,000-to-$12,000 per hearing.  See Department of Education, J. Chambers, J. Harr, &amp; A. Dhanani, What Are We Spending on Procedural Safeguards in Special Education 19992000, p. 8 (May 2003) (prepared under contract by American Institute for Research, Special Education Expenditure Project).  Congress has also repeatedly amended the Act in order to reduce its administrative and litigation-related costs.  For example, in 1997 Congress mandated that States offer mediation for IDEA disputes.  Individuals with Disabilities Education Act Amendments of 1997, Pub. L. 10517, §615(e), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">111</a>Stat.

It also made new findings that [p]arents and schools should be given expanded opportunities to resolve their disagreements in positive and constructive ways, and that [t]eachers, schools, local educational agencies, and States should be relieved of irrelevant and unnecessary paperwork burdens that do not lead to improved educational outcomes.  §§1400(c)(8)(9).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Petitioners in effect ask this Court to assume that every IEP is invalid until the school district demonstrates that it is not.  The Act does not support this conclusion.  IDEA relies heavily upon the expertise of school districts to meet its goals.  It also includes a so-called stay-put provision, which requires a child to remain in his or her then-current educational placement during the pendency of an IDEA hearing. §1415(j).  Congress could have required that a child be given the educational placement that a parent
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				requested during a dispute, but it did no such thing.  Congress appears to have presumed instead that, if the Acts procedural requirements are respected, parents will prevail when they have legitimate grievances.  See 
				<em>
					Rowley, supra
				</em>
				, at 206 (noting the legislative conviction that adequate compliance with the procedures prescribed would in most cases assure much if not all of what Congress wished in the way of substantive content in an IEP).

School districts have a natural advantage in information and expertise, but Congress addressed this when it obliged schools to safeguard the procedural rights of parents and to share information with them.  See 
				<em>
					School Comm. of Burlington
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">368</a> (1985)
.  As noted above, parents have the right to review all records that the school possesses in relation to their child. §1415(b)(1).  They also have the right to an independent educational evaluation of the[ir] child.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  The regulations clarify this entitlement by providing that a parent has the right to an independent educational evaluation at public expense if the parent disagrees with an evaluation obtained by the public agency.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/34/300" class="subref" title="subref">34 CFR §300.502</a>(b)(1) (2005).  IDEA thus ensures parents access to an expert who can evaluate all the materials that the school must make available, and who can give an independent opinion.  They are not left to challenge the government without a realistic opportunity to access the necessary evidence, or without an expert with the firepower to match the opposition.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Additionally, in 2004, Congress added provisions requiring school districts to answer the subject matter of a complaint in writing, and to provide parents with the reasoning behind the disputed action, details about the other options considered and rejected by the IEP team, and a description of all evaluations, reports, and other factors that the school used in coming to its decision.

IDEA hearings are deliberately informal and intended to give ALJs the flexibility that they need to ensure that each side can fairly present its evidence.  IDEA, in fact, requires state authorities to organize hearings in a way that guarantees parents and children the procedural protections of the Act.  See §1415(a).  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, parents may recover attorneys fees if they prevail.  §1415(i)(3)(B).  These protections ensure that the school bears no unique informational advantage.

				The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA or Act),

175, as amended, 
20 U. S. C. A. §1400<em>
					et seq.
				</em>
				 (main ed. and Supp. 2005), is a Spending Clause statute that seeks to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education,  §1400(d)(1)(A).  Under IDEA, school districts must create an individualized education program (IEP) for each disabled child.  §1414(d).  If parents believe their childs IEP is inappropriate, they may request an impartial due process hearing.  §1415(f).  The Act is silent, however, as to which party bears the burden of persuasion at such a hearing.  We hold that the burden lies, as it typically does, on the party seeking relief.

				Congress first passed IDEA as part of the Education of the Handicapped Act in 1970,

175, and amended it substantially in the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975,

At the time the majority of disabled children in America were either totally excluded from schools or sitting idly in regular classrooms awaiting the time when they were old enough to drop out,  H. R. Rep. No. 94332, p. 2 (1975).  IDEA was intended to reverse this history of neglect.  As of 2003, the Act governed the provision of special education services to nearly 7 million children across the country.

				The core of the statute, however, is the cooperative process that it establishes between parents and schools.  
				<em>
					Rowley, supra
				</em>
				, at 205206 (Congress placed every bit as much emphasis upon compliance with procedures giving parents and guardians a large measure of participation at every stage of the administrative process, . . . as it did upon the measurement of the resulting IEP against a substantive standard).  The central vehicle for this collaboration is the IEP process.  State educational authorities must identify and evaluate disabled children, §§1414(a)(c), develop an IEP for each one, §1414(d)(2), and review every IEP at least once a year, §1414(d)(4).  Each IEP must include an assessment of the childs current educational performance, must articulate measurable educational goals, and must specify the nature of the special services that the school will provide. §1414(d)(1)(A).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Parents and guardians play a significant role in the IEP process.  They must be informed about and consent to evaluations of their child under the Act.  §1414(c)(3).  Parents are included as members of IEP teams.  §1414(d)(1)(B).  They have the right to examine any records relating to their child, and to obtain an independent educational evaluation of the[ir] child.  §1415(b)(1).  They must be given written prior notice of any changes in an IEP, §1415(b)(3), and be notified in writing of the procedural safeguards available to them under the Act, §1415(d)(1).  If parents believe that an IEP is not appropriate, they may seek an administrative impartial due process hearing.  §1415(f).  School districts may also seek such hearings, as Congress clarified in the 2004 amendments.  See S. Rep. No. 108185, p. 37 (2003).  They may do so, for example, if they wish to change an existing IEP but the parents do not consent, or if parents refuse to allow their child to be evaluated.  As a practical matter, it appears that most hearing requests come from parents rather than schools.  Brief for Petitioners 7.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Although state authorities have limited discretion to determine who conducts the hearings, §1415(f)(1)), and responsibility generally for establishing fair hearing procedures, §1415(a), Congress has chosen to legislate the central components of due process hearings.  It has imposed minimal pleading standards, requiring parties to file complaints setting forth a description of the nature of the problem, §1415(b)(7)(B)(ii), and a proposed resolution of the problem to the extent known and available . . . at the time, §1415(b)(7)(B)(iii).  At the hearing, all parties may be accompanied by counsel, and may present evidence and confront, cross-examine, and compel the attendance of witnesses.  §§1415(h)(1)(2).  After the hearing, any aggrieved party may bring a civil action in state or federal court.  §1415(i)(2).  Prevailing parents may also recover attorneys fees.  §1415(i)(3)(B).  Congress has never explicitly stated, however, which party should bear the burden of proof at IDEA hearings.

				This case concerns the educational services that were due, under IDEA, to petitioner Brian Schaffer.  Brian suffers from learning disabilities and speech-language impairments.  From prekindergarten through seventh grade he attended a private school and struggled academically.  In 1997, school officials informed Brians mother that he needed a school that could better accommodate his needs.  Brians parents contacted respondent Montgomery County Public Schools System (MCPS) seeking a placement for him for the following school year.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				MCPS evaluated Brian and convened an IEP team.  The committee generated an initial IEP offering Brian a place in either of two MCPS middle schools.  Brians parents were not satisfied with the arrangement, believing that Brian needed smaller classes and more intensive services.  The Schaffers thus enrolled Brian in another private school, and initiated a due process hearing challenging the IEP and seeking compensation for the cost of Brians subsequent private education.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In Maryland, IEP hearings are conducted by administrative law judges (ALJs).  See Md. Educ. Code Ann. §8413(c) (Lexis 2004).  After a 3-day hearing, the ALJ deemed the evidence close, held that the parents bore the burden of persuasion, and ruled in favor of the school district.  The parents brought a civil action challenging the result.  The United States District Court for the District of Maryland reversed and remanded, after concluding that the burden of persuasion is on the school district.

					Brian S. 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					Vance
				</em>
				, 86 F. Supp. 2d 538 (2000). 
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				Around the same time, MCPS offered Brian a placement in a high school with a special learning center.  Brians parents accepted, and Brian was educated in that program until he graduated from high school.  The suit remained alive, however, because the parents sought compensation for the private school tuition and related expenses.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Respondents appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.  While the appeal was pending, the ALJ reconsidered the case, deemed the evidence truly in equipoise, and ruled in favor of the parents.  The Fourth Circuit vacated and remanded the appeal so that it could consider the burden of proof issue along with the merits on a later appeal.  The District Court reaffirmed its ruling that the school district has the burden of proof.  240 F. Supp. 2d 396 (Md. 2002).  On appeal, a divided panel of the Fourth Circuit reversed.  Judge Michael, writing for the majority, concluded that petitioners offered no persuasive reason to depart from the normal rule of allocating the burden to the party seeking relief.  377 F. 3d 449, 453 (2004).

				The term burden of proof is one of the slipperiest member[s] of the family of legal terms.  2 J. Strong, McCormick on Evidence §342, p. 433 (5th ed. 1999) (hereinafter McCormick).  Part of the confusion surrounding the term arises from the fact that historically, the concept encompassed two distinct burdens: the burden of persuasion, 
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, which party loses if the evidence is closely balanced, and the burden of production, 
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, which party bears the obligation to come forward with the evidence at different points in the proceeding.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">272</a> (1994)
.  We note at the outset that this case concerns only the burden of persuasion, as the parties agree, Brief for Respondents 14; Reply Brief for Petitioners 15, and when we speak of burden of proof in this opinion, it is this to which we refer.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				When we are determining the burden of proof under a statutory cause of action, the touchstone of our inquiry is, of course, the statute.  The plain text of IDEA is silent on the allocation of the burden of persuasion.  We therefore begin with the ordinary default rule that plaintiffs bear the risk of failing to prove their claims.  McCormick §337, at 412 (The burdens of pleading and proof with regard to most facts have and should be assigned to the plaintiff who generally seeks to change the present state of affairs and who therefore naturally should be expected to bear the risk of failure or proof or persuasion); C. Mueller &amp; L. Kirkpatrick, Evidence §3.1, p. 104 (3d ed. 2003) (Perhaps the broadest and most accepted idea is that the person who seeks court action should justify the request, which means that the plaintiffs bear the burdens on the elements in their claims).  
				    
				
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Thus, we have usually assumed without comment that plaintiffs bear the burden of persuasion regarding the essential aspects of their claims.  For example, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/2000e-2.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §2000e2</a>
            <em>

				The ordinary default rule, of course, admits of exceptions.  See McCormick §337, at 412415.  For example, the burden of persuasion as to certain elements of a plantiffs claim may be shifted to defendants, when such elements can fairly be characterized as affirmative defenses or exemptions.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					FTC
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Morton Salt Co.,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/334/37" class="subref" title="subref">334 U. S. 37</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">44</a>45 (1948)
.  Under some circumstances this Court has even placed the burden of persuasion over an entire claim on the defendant.  See 
				<em>
					Alaska Dept. of Environmental Conservation
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					EPA, 
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/540/461" class="subref" title="subref">540 U. S. 461</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">494</a> (2004)
.  But while the normal default rule does not solve all cases, it certainly solves most of them.  Decisions that place the 
				<em>
					entire 
				</em>
				burden of persuasion on the opposing party at the 
				<em>
					outset
				</em>
				 of a proceedingas petitioners urge us to do hereare extremely rare.  Absent some reason to believe that Congress intended otherwise, therefore, we will conclude that the burden of persuasion lies where it usually falls, upon the party seeking relief.

				<em>

				</em>
				 and wrote them directly into the Act does not allow us to conclude . . . that Congress intended to adopt the ideas that it failed to write into the text of the statute.  377 F. 3d, at 455.

				Petitioners also urge that putting the burden of persuasion on school districts will further IDEAs purposes because it will help ensure that children receive a free appropriate public education.  In truth, however, very few cases will be in evidentiary equipoise.  Assigning the burden of persuasion to school districts might encourage schools to put more resources into preparing IEPs and presenting their evidence.  But IDEA is silent about whether marginal dollars should be allocated to litigation and administrative expenditures or to educational services.  Moreover, there is reason to believe that a great deal is already spent on the administration of the Act.  Litigating a due process complaint is an expensive affair, costing schools approximately $8,000-to-$12,000 per hearing.  See Department of Education, J. Chambers, J. Harr, &amp; A. Dhanani, What Are We Spending on Procedural Safeguards in Special Education 19992000, p. 8 (May 2003) (prepared under contract by American Institute for Research, Special Education Expenditure Project).  Congress has also repeatedly amended the Act in order to reduce its administrative and litigation-related costs.  For example, in 1997 Congress mandated that States offer mediation for IDEA disputes.  Individuals with Disabilities Education Act Amendments of 1997, Pub. L. 10517, §615(e),

It also made new findings that [p]arents and schools should be given expanded opportunities to resolve their disagreements in positive and constructive ways, and that [t]eachers, schools, local educational agencies, and States should be relieved of irrelevant and unnecessary paperwork burdens that do not lead to improved educational outcomes.  §§1400(c)(8)(9).

				Petitioners in effect ask this Court to assume that every IEP is invalid until the school district demonstrates that it is not.  The Act does not support this conclusion.  IDEA relies heavily upon the expertise of school districts to meet its goals.  It also includes a so-called stay-put provision, which requires a child to remain in his or her then-current educational placement during the pendency of an IDEA hearing. §1415(j).  Congress could have required that a child be given the educational placement that a parent
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				requested during a dispute, but it did no such thing.  Congress appears to have presumed instead that, if the Acts procedural requirements are respected, parents will prevail when they have legitimate grievances.  See 
				<em>
					Rowley, supra

				, at 206 (noting the legislative conviction that adequate compliance with the procedures prescribed would in most cases assure much if not all of what Congress wished in the way of substantive content in an IEP).

.  As noted above, parents have the right to review all records that the school possesses in relation to their child. §1415(b)(1).  They also have the right to an independent educational evaluation of the[ir] child.  
				<em>
					Ibid.

				  The regulations clarify this entitlement by providing that a parent has the right to an independent educational evaluation at public expense if the parent disagrees with an evaluation obtained by the public agency.

IDEA thus ensures parents access to an expert who can evaluate all the materials that the school must make available, and who can give an independent opinion.  They are not left to challenge the government without a realistic opportunity to access the necessary evidence, or without an expert with the firepower to match the opposition.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Additionally, in 2004, Congress added provisions requiring school districts to answer the subject matter of a complaint in writing, and to provide parents with the reasoning behind the disputed action, details about the other options considered and rejected by the IEP team, and a description of all evaluations, reports, and other factors that the school used in coming to its decision.

IDEA hearings are deliberately informal and intended to give ALJs the flexibility that they need to ensure that each side can fairly present its evidence.  IDEA, in fact, requires state authorities to organize hearings in a way that guarantees parents and children the procedural protections of the Act.  See §1415(a).  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, parents may recover attorneys fees if they prevail.  §1415(i)(3)(B).  These protections ensure that the school bears no unique informational advantage.

				Finally, respondents and several States urge us to decide that States may, if they wish, override the default rule and put the burden always on the school district.  Several States have laws or regulations purporting to do so, at least under some circumstances.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 Minn. Stat. §125A.091, subd. 16 (2004); Ala. Admin. Code Rule 29089.08(8)(c)(6) (Supp. 2004); Alaska Admin. Code tit. 4, §52.550(e)(9) (2003); Del. Code Ann., Tit. 14, §3140 (1999).  Because no such law or regulation exists in Maryland, we need not decide this issue today.

				We hold no more than we must to resolve the case at hand: The burden of proof in an administrative hearing challenging an IEP is properly placed upon the party seeking relief.

175, as amended, 
20 U. S. C. A. §1400<em>

				 (main ed. and Supp. 2005), is a Spending Clause statute that seeks to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education,  §1400(d)(1)(A).  Under IDEA, school districts must create an individualized education program (IEP) for each disabled child.  §1414(d).  If parents believe their childs IEP is inappropriate, they may request an impartial due process hearing.  §1415(f).  The Act is silent, however, as to which party bears the burden of persuasion at such a hearing.  We hold that the burden lies, as it typically does, on the party seeking relief.

At the time the majority of disabled children in America were either totally excluded from schools or sitting idly in regular classrooms awaiting the time when they were old enough to drop out,  H. R. Rep. No. 94332, p. 2 (1975).  IDEA was intended to reverse this history of neglect.  As of 2003, the Act governed the provision of special education services to nearly 7 million children across the country.

				The core of the statute, however, is the cooperative process that it establishes between parents and schools.  
				<em>
					Rowley, supra
				</em>
				, at 205206 (Congress placed every bit as much emphasis upon compliance with procedures giving parents and guardians a large measure of participation at every stage of the administrative process, . . . as it did upon the measurement of the resulting IEP against a substantive standard).  The central vehicle for this collaboration is the IEP process.  State educational authorities must identify and evaluate disabled children, §§1414(a)(c), develop an IEP for each one, §1414(d)(2), and review every IEP at least once a year, §1414(d)(4).  Each IEP must include an assessment of the childs current educational performance, must articulate measurable educational goals, and must specify the nature of the special services that the school will provide. §1414(d)(1)(A).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Parents and guardians play a significant role in the IEP process.  They must be informed about and consent to evaluations of their child under the Act.  §1414(c)(3).  Parents are included as members of IEP teams.  §1414(d)(1)(B).  They have the right to examine any records relating to their child, and to obtain an independent educational evaluation of the[ir] child.  §1415(b)(1).  They must be given written prior notice of any changes in an IEP, §1415(b)(3), and be notified in writing of the procedural safeguards available to them under the Act, §1415(d)(1).  If parents believe that an IEP is not appropriate, they may seek an administrative impartial due process hearing.  §1415(f).  School districts may also seek such hearings, as Congress clarified in the 2004 amendments.  See S. Rep. No. 108185, p. 37 (2003).  They may do so, for example, if they wish to change an existing IEP but the parents do not consent, or if parents refuse to allow their child to be evaluated.  As a practical matter, it appears that most hearing requests come from parents rather than schools.  Brief for Petitioners 7.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Although state authorities have limited discretion to determine who conducts the hearings, §1415(f)(1)), and responsibility generally for establishing fair hearing procedures, §1415(a), Congress has chosen to legislate the central components of due process hearings.  It has imposed minimal pleading standards, requiring parties to file complaints setting forth a description of the nature of the problem, §1415(b)(7)(B)(ii), and a proposed resolution of the problem to the extent known and available . . . at the time, §1415(b)(7)(B)(iii).  At the hearing, all parties may be accompanied by counsel, and may present evidence and confront, cross-examine, and compel the attendance of witnesses.  §§1415(h)(1)(2).  After the hearing, any aggrieved party may bring a civil action in state or federal court.  §1415(i)(2).  Prevailing parents may also recover attorneys fees.  §1415(i)(3)(B).  Congress has never explicitly stated, however, which party should bear the burden of proof at IDEA hearings.

				This case concerns the educational services that were due, under IDEA, to petitioner Brian Schaffer.  Brian suffers from learning disabilities and speech-language impairments.  From prekindergarten through seventh grade he attended a private school and struggled academically.  In 1997, school officials informed Brians mother that he needed a school that could better accommodate his needs.  Brians parents contacted respondent Montgomery County Public Schools System (MCPS) seeking a placement for him for the following school year.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				MCPS evaluated Brian and convened an IEP team.  The committee generated an initial IEP offering Brian a place in either of two MCPS middle schools.  Brians parents were not satisfied with the arrangement, believing that Brian needed smaller classes and more intensive services.  The Schaffers thus enrolled Brian in another private school, and initiated a due process hearing challenging the IEP and seeking compensation for the cost of Brians subsequent private education.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In Maryland, IEP hearings are conducted by administrative law judges (ALJs).  See Md. Educ. Code Ann. §8413(c) (Lexis 2004).  After a 3-day hearing, the ALJ deemed the evidence close, held that the parents bore the burden of persuasion, and ruled in favor of the school district.  The parents brought a civil action challenging the result.  The United States District Court for the District of Maryland reversed and remanded, after concluding that the burden of persuasion is on the school district.

					Brian S. 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					Vance
				</em>
				, 86 F. Supp. 2d 538 (2000). 
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				Around the same time, MCPS offered Brian a placement in a high school with a special learning center.  Brians parents accepted, and Brian was educated in that program until he graduated from high school.  The suit remained alive, however, because the parents sought compensation for the private school tuition and related expenses.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Respondents appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.  While the appeal was pending, the ALJ reconsidered the case, deemed the evidence truly in equipoise, and ruled in favor of the parents.  The Fourth Circuit vacated and remanded the appeal so that it could consider the burden of proof issue along with the merits on a later appeal.  The District Court reaffirmed its ruling that the school district has the burden of proof.  240 F. Supp. 2d 396 (Md. 2002).  On appeal, a divided panel of the Fourth Circuit reversed.  Judge Michael, writing for the majority, concluded that petitioners offered no persuasive reason to depart from the normal rule of allocating the burden to the party seeking relief.  377 F. 3d 449, 453 (2004).

				The term burden of proof is one of the slipperiest member[s] of the family of legal terms.  2 J. Strong, McCormick on Evidence §342, p. 433 (5th ed. 1999) (hereinafter McCormick).  Part of the confusion surrounding the term arises from the fact that historically, the concept encompassed two distinct burdens: the burden of persuasion, 
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, which party loses if the evidence is closely balanced, and the burden of production, 
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, which party bears the obligation to come forward with the evidence at different points in the proceeding.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">272</a> (1994)
.  We note at the outset that this case concerns only the burden of persuasion, as the parties agree, Brief for Respondents 14; Reply Brief for Petitioners 15, and when we speak of burden of proof in this opinion, it is this to which we refer.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				When we are determining the burden of proof under a statutory cause of action, the touchstone of our inquiry is, of course, the statute.  The plain text of IDEA is silent on the allocation of the burden of persuasion.  We therefore begin with the ordinary default rule that plaintiffs bear the risk of failing to prove their claims.  McCormick §337, at 412 (The burdens of pleading and proof with regard to most facts have and should be assigned to the plaintiff who generally seeks to change the present state of affairs and who therefore naturally should be expected to bear the risk of failure or proof or persuasion); C. Mueller &amp; L. Kirkpatrick, Evidence §3.1, p. 104 (3d ed. 2003) (Perhaps the broadest and most accepted idea is that the person who seeks court action should justify the request, which means that the plaintiffs bear the burdens on the elements in their claims).  
				    
				
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Thus, we have usually assumed without comment that plaintiffs bear the burden of persuasion regarding the essential aspects of their claims.  For example, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/2000e-2.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §2000e2</a>

				<em>

				</em>
				 and wrote them directly into the Act does not allow us to conclude . . . that Congress intended to adopt the ideas that it failed to write into the text of the statute.  377 F. 3d, at 455.

				Petitioners also urge that putting the burden of persuasion on school districts will further IDEAs purposes because it will help ensure that children receive a free appropriate public education.  In truth, however, very few cases will be in evidentiary equipoise.  Assigning the burden of persuasion to school districts might encourage schools to put more resources into preparing IEPs and presenting their evidence.  But IDEA is silent about whether marginal dollars should be allocated to litigation and administrative expenditures or to educational services.  Moreover, there is reason to believe that a great deal is already spent on the administration of the Act.  Litigating a due process complaint is an expensive affair, costing schools approximately $8,000-to-$12,000 per hearing.  See Department of Education, J. Chambers, J. Harr, &amp; A. Dhanani, What Are We Spending on Procedural Safeguards in Special Education 19992000, p. 8 (May 2003) (prepared under contract by American Institute for Research, Special Education Expenditure Project).  Congress has also repeatedly amended the Act in order to reduce its administrative and litigation-related costs.  For example, in 1997 Congress mandated that States offer mediation for IDEA disputes.  Individuals with Disabilities Education Act Amendments of 1997, Pub. L. 10517, §615(e),

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Petitioners in effect ask this Court to assume that every IEP is invalid until the school district demonstrates that it is not.  The Act does not support this conclusion.  IDEA relies heavily upon the expertise of school districts to meet its goals.  It also includes a so-called stay-put provision, which requires a child to remain in his or her then-current educational placement during the pendency of an IDEA hearing. §1415(j).  Congress could have required that a child be given the educational placement that a parent
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				requested during a dispute, but it did no such thing.  Congress appears to have presumed instead that, if the Acts procedural requirements are respected, parents will prevail when they have legitimate grievances.  See 
				<em>
					Rowley, supra
				</em>
				, at 206 (noting the legislative conviction that adequate compliance with the procedures prescribed would in most cases assure much if not all of what Congress wished in the way of substantive content in an IEP).

				 6 Pet. 302, 312 (1832); see also McCormick §337, at 413 (Very often one must plead and prove matters as to which his adversary has superior access to the proof).  School districts have a natural advantage in information and expertise, but Congress addressed this when it obliged schools to safeguard the procedural rights of parents and to share information with them.  See 
				<em>
					School Comm. of Burlington
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Department of Ed. of Mass.,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/471/359" class="subref" title="subref">471 U. S. 359</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">368</a> (1985)
.  As noted above, parents have the right to review all records that the school possesses in relation to their child. §1415(b)(1).  They also have the right to an independent educational evaluation of the[ir] child.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  The regulations clarify this entitlement by providing that a parent has the right to an independent educational evaluation at public expense if the parent disagrees with an evaluation obtained by the public agency.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/34/300" class="subref" title="subref">34 CFR §300.502</a>(b)(1) (2005).  IDEA thus ensures parents access to an expert who can evaluate all the materials that the school must make available, and who can give an independent opinion.  They are not left to challenge the government without a realistic opportunity to access the necessary evidence, or without an expert with the firepower to match the opposition.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Additionally, in 2004, Congress added provisions requiring school districts to answer the subject matter of a complaint in writing, and to provide parents with the reasoning behind the disputed action, details about the other options considered and rejected by the IEP team, and a description of all evaluations, reports, and other factors that the school used in coming to its decision.  Pub. L. 108446, §615(c)(2)(B)(i)(I),

2718, 
20 U. S. C. A. §1415(c)(2)(B)(i)(I) (Supp. 2005).  Prior to a hearing, the parties must disclose evaluations and recommendations that they intend to rely upon.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/20/1415.html#f_2" class="subref" title="subref">20 U. S. C. §1415(f)(2)</a>.  IDEA hearings are deliberately informal and intended to give ALJs the flexibility that they need to ensure that each side can fairly present its evidence.  IDEA, in fact, requires state authorities to organize hearings in a way that guarantees parents and children the procedural protections of the Act.  See §1415(a).  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, parents may recover attorneys fees if they prevail.  §1415(i)(3)(B).  These protections ensure that the school bears no unique informational advantage.

				Finally, respondents and several States urge us to decide that States may, if they wish, override the default rule and put the burden always on the school district.  Several States have laws or regulations purporting to do so, at least under some circumstances.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 Minn. Stat. §125A.091, subd. 16 (2004); Ala. Admin. Code Rule 29089.08(8)(c)(6) (Supp. 2004); Alaska Admin. Code tit. 4, §52.550(e)(9) (2003); Del. Code Ann., Tit. 14, §3140 (1999).  Because no such law or regulation exists in Maryland, we need not decide this issue today.  
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Breyer

				<em>

				 up to the States.  But neither party made this argument before this Court or the courts below.  We therefore decline to address it.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				
				We hold no more than we must to resolve the case at hand: The burden of proof in an administrative hearing challenging an IEP is properly placed upon the party seeking relief.  In this case, that party is Brian, as represented by his parents.  But the rule applies with equal effect to school districts: If they seek to challenge an IEP, they will in turn bear the burden of persuasion before an ALJ.  The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit is, therefore, affirmed.

				When the legislature is silent on the burden of proof, courts ordinarily allocate the burden to the party initiating the proceeding and seeking relief.  As the Fourth Circuit recognized, however, other factors, prime among them policy considerations, convenience, and fairness, may warrant a different allocation.  377 F. 3d 449, 452 (2004) (citing 2 J. Strong, McCormick on Evidence §337, p. 415 (5th ed. 1999) (allocation of proof burden will depend upon the weight … given to any one or more of several factors, including: … special policy considerations …[,] convenience, … [and] fairness)); see also 9 J. Wigmore, Evidence §2486, p. 291 (J. Chadbourn rev. ed. 1981) (assigning proof burden presents a question of policy and fairness based on experience in the different situations).  The Court has followed the same counsel.  See

				<em>

				</em>
				, §2486, p. 288; emphasis deleted)).  For reasons well stated by Circuit Judge Luttig, dissenting in the Court of Appeals, 377 F. 3d, at 456459, I am persuaded that policy considerations, convenience, and fairness call for assigning the burden of proof to the school district in this case.

				The Court acknowledges that [a]ssigning the burden of persuasion to school districts might encourage schools to put more resources into preparing IEPs.

				<em>
					Ibid

				.  Costs entailed in the preparation of suitable IEPs, however, are the very expenditures necessary to ensure each child covered by IDEA access to a free appropriate education.  These outlays surely relate to educational services.  Indeed, a carefully designed IEP may ward off disputes productive of large administrative or litigation expenses.

        <p class="bodytext">

						 The Court suggests that the IDEAs stay-put provision, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/20/1415.html#j" class="subref" title="subref">20 U. S. C. §1415(j)</a>, supports placement of the burden of persuasion on the parents.  Ante, at 10.  The stay-put provision, however, merely preserves the status quo.  It would work to the advantage of the child and the parents when the school seeks to cut services offered under a previously established IEP.  True, Congress did not require that a child be given the educational placement that a parent requested during a dispute.  Ibid.  But neither did Congress require that the IEP advanced by the school district go into effect during the pendency of a dispute.

In cases of this order, however, the persuasion burden is indivisible.

				When the legislature is silent on the burden of proof, courts ordinarily allocate the burden to the party initiating the proceeding and seeking relief.  As the Fourth Circuit recognized, however, other factors, prime among them policy considerations, convenience, and fairness, may warrant a different allocation.  377 F. 3d 449, 452 (2004) (citing 2 J. Strong, McCormick on Evidence §337, p. 415 (5th ed. 1999) (allocation of proof burden will depend upon the weight … given to any one or more of several factors, including: … special policy considerations …[,] convenience, … [and] fairness)); see also 9 J. Wigmore, Evidence §2486, p. 291 (J. Chadbourn rev. ed. 1981) (assigning proof burden presents a question of policy and fairness based on experience in the different situations).  The Court has followed the same counsel.  See

				<em>

				, §2486, p. 288; emphasis deleted)).  For reasons well stated by Circuit Judge Luttig, dissenting in the Court of Appeals, 377 F. 3d, at 456459, I am persuaded that policy considerations, convenience, and fairness call for assigning the burden of proof to the school district in this case.

				The Court acknowledges that [a]ssigning the burden of persuasion to school districts might encourage schools to put more resources into preparing IEPs.  
				<em>
					Ante

				, at 9.  Curiously, the Court next suggests that resources spent on developing IEPs rank as administrative expenditures not as expenditures for educational services.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  Costs entailed in the preparation of suitable IEPs, however, are the very expenditures necessary to ensure each child covered by IDEA access to a free appropriate education.  These outlays surely relate to educational services.  Indeed, a carefully designed IEP may ward off disputes productive of large administrative or litigation expenses.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				This case is illustrative.  Not until the District Court ruled that the school district had the burden of persuasion did the school design an IEP that met Brian Schaffers special educational needs.  See 
				<em>

				, at 5; Tr. of Oral Arg. 2122 (Counsel for the Schaffers observed that Montgomery County … gave [Brian] the kind of services he had sought from the beginning … once [the school district was] given the burden of proof.).

				One can demur to the Fourth Circuits observation that courts do not automatically assign the burden of proof to the side with the bigger guns, 377 F. 3d, at 453, for no such reflexive action is at issue here.  It bears emphasis that the vast majority of parents whose children require the benefits and protections provided in the IDEA lack knowledg[e] about the educational resources available to their [child] and the sophisticat[ion] to mount an effective case against a district-proposed IEP.

				One can demur to the Fourth Circuits observation that courts do not automatically assign the burden of proof to the side with the bigger guns, 377 F. 3d, at 453, for no such reflexive action is at issue here.  It bears emphasis that the vast majority of parents whose children require the benefits and protections provided in the IDEA lack knowledg[e] about the educational resources available to their [child] and the sophisticat[ion] to mount an effective case against a district-proposed IEP.

The stay-put provision, however, merely preserves the status quo.  It would work to the advantage of the child and the parents when the school seeks to cut services offered under a previously established IEP.  True, Congress did not require that a child be given the educational placement that a parent requested during a dispute.  Ibid.  But neither did Congress require that the IEP advanced by the school district go into effect during the pendency of a dispute.

				When the legislature is silent on the burden of proof, courts ordinarily allocate the burden to the party initiating the proceeding and seeking relief.  As the Fourth Circuit recognized, however, other factors, prime among them policy considerations, convenience, and fairness, may warrant a different allocation.  377 F. 3d 449, 452 (2004) (citing 2 J. Strong, McCormick on Evidence §337, p. 415 (5th ed. 1999) (allocation of proof burden will depend upon the weight … given to any one or more of several factors, including: … special policy considerations …[,] convenience, … [and] fairness)); see also 9 J. Wigmore, Evidence §2486, p. 291 (J. Chadbourn rev. ed. 1981) (assigning proof burden presents a question of policy and fairness based on experience in the different situations).  The Court has followed the same counsel.  See

				<em>

				</em>
				, §2486, p. 288; emphasis deleted)).  For reasons well stated by Circuit Judge Luttig, dissenting in the Court of Appeals, 377 F. 3d, at 456459, I am persuaded that policy considerations, convenience, and fairness call for assigning the burden of proof to the school district in this case.

				One can demur to the Fourth Circuits observation that courts do not automatically assign the burden of proof to the side with the bigger guns, 377 F. 3d, at 453, for no such reflexive action is at issue here.  It bears emphasis that the vast majority of parents whose children require the benefits and protections provided in the IDEA lack knowledg[e] about the educational resources available to their [child] and the sophisticat[ion] to mount an effective case against a district-proposed IEP.

In this setting, the party with the bigger guns also has better access to information, greater expertise, and an affirmative obligation to provide the contested services.  377 F. 3d, at 458 (Luttig, J., dissenting).  Policy considerations, convenience, and fairness, I think it plain, point in the same direction.  Their collective weight warrants a rule requiring a school district, in due process hearings, to explain persuasively why its proposed IEP satisfies IDEAs standards.

						 The Court suggests that the IDEAs stay-put provision, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/20/1415.html#j" class="subref" title="subref">20 U. S. C. §1415(j)</a>, supports placement of the burden of persuasion on the parents.  Ante, at 10.  The stay-put provision, however, merely preserves the status quo.  It would work to the advantage of the child and the parents when the school seeks to cut services offered under a previously established IEP.  True, Congress did not require that a child be given the educational placement that a parent requested during a dispute.  Ibid.  But neither did Congress require that the IEP advanced by the school district go into effect during the pendency of a dispute.

						 The Court observes that decisions placing the entire burden of persuasion on the opposing party at the outset of a proceeding … are extremely rare.  Ante, at 8.  In cases of this order, however, the persuasion burden is indivisible.  It must be borne entirely by one side or the other:  Either the school district must establish the adequacy of the IEP it has proposed or the parents must demonstrate the plans inadequacy.

				When the legislature is silent on the burden of proof, courts ordinarily allocate the burden to the party initiating the proceeding and seeking relief.  As the Fourth Circuit recognized, however, other factors, prime among them policy considerations, convenience, and fairness, may warrant a different allocation.  377 F. 3d 449, 452 (2004) (citing 2 J. Strong, McCormick on Evidence §337, p. 415 (5th ed. 1999) (allocation of proof burden will depend upon the weight … given to any one or more of several factors, including: … special policy considerations …[,] convenience, … [and] fairness)); see also 9 J. Wigmore, Evidence §2486, p. 291 (J. Chadbourn rev. ed. 1981) (assigning proof burden presents a question of policy and fairness based on experience in the different situations).  The Court has followed the same counsel.  See

In this setting, the party with the bigger guns also has better access to information, greater expertise, and an affirmative obligation to provide the contested services.  377 F. 3d, at 458 (Luttig, J., dissenting).  Policy considerations, convenience, and fairness, I think it plain, point in the same direction.  Their collective weight warrants a rule requiring a school district, in due process hearings, to explain persuasively why its proposed IEP satisfies IDEAs standards.

						 The Court suggests that the IDEAs stay-put provision, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/20/1415.html#j" class="subref" title="subref">20 U. S. C. §1415(j)</a>, supports placement of the burden of persuasion on the parents.  Ante, at 10.  The stay-put provision, however, merely preserves the status quo.  It would work to the advantage of the child and the parents when the school seeks to cut services offered under a previously established IEP.  True, Congress did not require that a child be given the educational placement that a parent requested during a dispute.  Ibid.  But neither did Congress require that the IEP advanced by the school district go into effect during the pendency of a dispute.

						 The Court observes that decisions placing the entire burden of persuasion on the opposing party at the outset of a proceeding … are extremely rare.  Ante, at 8.  In cases of this order, however, the persuasion burden is indivisible.  It must be borne entirely by one side or the other:  Either the school district must establish the adequacy of the IEP it has proposed or the parents must demonstrate the plans inadequacy.

				When the legislature is silent on the burden of proof, courts ordinarily allocate the burden to the party initiating the proceeding and seeking relief.  As the Fourth Circuit recognized, however, other factors, prime among them policy considerations, convenience, and fairness, may warrant a different allocation.  377 F. 3d 449, 452 (2004) (citing 2 J. Strong, McCormick on Evidence §337, p. 415 (5th ed. 1999) (allocation of proof burden will depend upon the weight … given to any one or more of several factors, including: … special policy considerations …[,] convenience, … [and] fairness)); see also 9 J. Wigmore, Evidence §2486, p. 291 (J. Chadbourn rev. ed. 1981) (assigning proof burden presents a question of policy and fairness based on experience in the different situations).  The Court has followed the same counsel.  See

				<em>

				, §2486, p. 288; emphasis deleted)).  For reasons well stated by Circuit Judge Luttig, dissenting in the Court of Appeals, 377 F. 3d, at 456459, I am persuaded that policy considerations, convenience, and fairness call for assigning the burden of proof to the school district in this case.

				The Court acknowledges that [a]ssigning the burden of persuasion to school districts might encourage schools to put more resources into preparing IEPs.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 9.  Curiously, the Court next suggests that resources spent on developing IEPs rank as administrative expenditures not as expenditures for educational services.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  Costs entailed in the preparation of suitable IEPs, however, are the very expenditures necessary to ensure each child covered by IDEA access to a free appropriate education.  These outlays surely relate to educational services.  Indeed, a carefully designed IEP may ward off disputes productive of large administrative or litigation expenses.  
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				This case is illustrative.  Not until the District Court ruled that the school district had the burden of persuasion did the school design an IEP that met Brian Schaffers special educational needs.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 5; Tr. of Oral Arg. 2122 (Counsel for the Schaffers observed that Montgomery County … gave [Brian] the kind of services he had sought from the beginning … once [the school district was] given the burden of proof.).  Had the school district, in the first instance, offered Brian a public or private school placement equivalent to the one the district ultimately provided, this entire litigation and its attendant costs could have been avoided.

				One can demur to the Fourth Circuits observation that courts do not automatically assign the burden of proof to the side with the bigger guns, 377 F. 3d, at 453, for no such reflexive action is at issue here.  It bears emphasis that the vast majority of parents whose children require the benefits and protections provided in the IDEA lack knowledg[e] about the educational resources available to their [child] and the sophisticat[ion] to mount an effective case against a district-proposed IEP.

				The Court acknowledges that [a]ssigning the burden of persuasion to school districts might encourage schools to put more resources into preparing IEPs.

				.  Costs entailed in the preparation of suitable IEPs, however, are the very expenditures necessary to ensure each child covered by IDEA access to a free appropriate education.

				This case is illustrative.  Not until the District Court ruled that the school district had the burden of persuasion did the school design an IEP that met Brian Schaffers special educational needs.  See

				One can demur to the Fourth Circuits observation that courts do not automatically assign the burden of proof to the side with the bigger guns, 377 F. 3d, at 453, for no such reflexive action is at issue here.  It bears emphasis that the vast majority of parents whose children require the benefits and protections provided in the IDEA lack knowledg[e] about the educational resources available to their [child] and the sophisticat[ion] to mount an effective case against a district-proposed IEP.

The stay-put provision, however, merely preserves the status quo.  It would work to the advantage of the child and the parents when the school seeks to cut services offered under a previously established IEP.  True, Congress did not require that a child be given the educational placement that a parent requested during a dispute.  Ibid.  But neither did Congress require that the IEP advanced by the school district go into effect during the pendency of a dispute.

				When the legislature is silent on the burden of proof, courts ordinarily allocate the burden to the party initiating the proceeding and seeking relief.  As the Fourth Circuit recognized, however, other factors, prime among them policy considerations, convenience, and fairness, may warrant a different allocation.  377 F. 3d 449, 452 (2004) (citing 2 J. Strong, McCormick on Evidence §337, p. 415 (5th ed. 1999) (allocation of proof burden will depend upon the weight … given to any one or more of several factors, including: … special policy considerations …[,] convenience, … [and] fairness)); see also 9 J. Wigmore, Evidence §2486, p. 291 (J. Chadbourn rev. ed. 1981) (assigning proof burden presents a question of policy and fairness based on experience in the different situations).  The Court has followed the same counsel.  See

				<em>

				</em>
				, §2486, p. 288; emphasis deleted)).  For reasons well stated by Circuit Judge Luttig, dissenting in the Court of Appeals, 377 F. 3d, at 456459, I am persuaded that policy considerations, convenience, and fairness call for assigning the burden of proof to the school district in this case.

				One can demur to the Fourth Circuits observation that courts do not automatically assign the burden of proof to the side with the bigger guns, 377 F. 3d, at 453, for no such reflexive action is at issue here.  It bears emphasis that the vast majority of parents whose children require the benefits and protections provided in the IDEA lack knowledg[e] about the educational resources available to their [child] and the sophisticat[ion] to mount an effective case against a district-proposed IEP.

Their collective weight warrants a rule requiring a school district, in due process hearings, to explain persuasively why its proposed IEP satisfies IDEAs standards.

						 The Court suggests that the IDEAs stay-put provision, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/20/1415.html#j" class="subref" title="subref">20 U. S. C. §1415(j)</a>, supports placement of the burden of persuasion on the parents.  Ante, at 10.  The stay-put provision, however, merely preserves the status quo.  It would work to the advantage of the child and the parents when the school seeks to cut services offered under a previously established IEP.  True, Congress did not require that a child be given the educational placement that a parent requested during a dispute.  Ibid.  But neither did Congress require that the IEP advanced by the school district go into effect during the pendency of a dispute.

						 The Court observes that decisions placing the entire burden of persuasion on the opposing party at the outset of a proceeding … are extremely rare.  Ante, at 8.  In cases of this order, however, the persuasion burden is indivisible.  It must be borne entirely by one side or the other:  Either the school district must establish the adequacy of the IEP it has proposed or the parents must demonstrate the plans inadequacy.

				When the legislature is silent on the burden of proof, courts ordinarily allocate the burden to the party initiating the proceeding and seeking relief.  As the Fourth Circuit recognized, however, other factors, prime among them policy considerations, convenience, and fairness, may warrant a different allocation.  377 F. 3d 449, 452 (2004) (citing 2 J. Strong, McCormick on Evidence §337, p. 415 (5th ed. 1999) (allocation of proof burden will depend upon the weight … given to any one or more of several factors, including: … special policy considerations …[,] convenience, … [and] fairness)); see also 9 J. Wigmore, Evidence §2486, p. 291 (J. Chadbourn rev. ed. 1981) (assigning proof burden presents a question of policy and fairness based on experience in the different situations).  The Court has followed the same counsel.  See

Their collective weight warrants a rule requiring a school district, in due process hearings, to explain persuasively why its proposed IEP satisfies IDEAs standards.

						 The Court suggests that the IDEAs stay-put provision, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/20/1415.html#j" class="subref" title="subref">20 U. S. C. §1415(j)</a>, supports placement of the burden of persuasion on the parents.  Ante, at 10.  The stay-put provision, however, merely preserves the status quo.  It would work to the advantage of the child and the parents when the school seeks to cut services offered under a previously established IEP.  True, Congress did not require that a child be given the educational placement that a parent requested during a dispute.  Ibid.  But neither did Congress require that the IEP advanced by the school district go into effect during the pendency of a dispute.

In cases of this order, however, the persuasion burden is indivisible.  It must be borne entirely by one side or the other:  Either the school district must establish the adequacy of the IEP it has proposed or the parents must demonstrate the plans inadequacy.

				When the legislature is silent on the burden of proof, courts ordinarily allocate the burden to the party initiating the proceeding and seeking relief.  As the Fourth Circuit recognized, however, other factors, prime among them policy considerations, convenience, and fairness, may warrant a different allocation.  377 F. 3d 449, 452 (2004) (citing 2 J. Strong, McCormick on Evidence §337, p. 415 (5th ed. 1999) (allocation of proof burden will depend upon the weight … given to any one or more of several factors, including: … special policy considerations …[,] convenience, … [and] fairness)); see also 9 J. Wigmore, Evidence §2486, p. 291 (J. Chadbourn rev. ed. 1981) (assigning proof burden presents a question of policy and fairness based on experience in the different situations).  The Court has followed the same counsel.  See

				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, §2486, p. 288; emphasis deleted)).  For reasons well stated by Circuit Judge Luttig, dissenting in the Court of Appeals, 377 F. 3d, at 456459, I am persuaded that policy considerations, convenience, and fairness call for assigning the burden of proof to the school district in this case.

				The Court acknowledges that [a]ssigning the burden of persuasion to school districts might encourage schools to put more resources into preparing IEPs.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 9.  Curiously, the Court next suggests that resources spent on developing IEPs rank as administrative expenditures not as expenditures for educational services.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  Costs entailed in the preparation of suitable IEPs, however, are the very expenditures necessary to ensure each child covered by IDEA access to a free appropriate education.  These outlays surely relate to educational services.  Indeed, a carefully designed IEP may ward off disputes productive of large administrative or litigation expenses.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				This case is illustrative.  Not until the District Court ruled that the school district had the burden of persuasion did the school design an IEP that met Brian Schaffers special educational needs.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 5; Tr. of Oral Arg. 2122 (Counsel for the Schaffers observed that Montgomery County … gave [Brian] the kind of services he had sought from the beginning … once [the school district was] given the burden of proof.).  Had the school district, in the first instance, offered Brian a public or private school placement equivalent to the one the district ultimately provided, this entire litigation and its attendant costs could have been avoided.

				One can demur to the Fourth Circuits observation that courts do not automatically assign the burden of proof to the side with the bigger guns, 377 F. 3d, at 453, for no such reflexive action is at issue here.  It bears emphasis that the vast majority of parents whose children require the benefits and protections provided in the IDEA lack knowledg[e] about the educational resources available to their [child] and the sophisticat[ion] to mount an effective case against a district-proposed IEP.

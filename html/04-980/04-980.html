				In convicting respondent Sanders of, 
				<em>
					inter alia, 
				</em>
				first-degree murder, the jury found four special circumstances, each of which rendered him death eligible under Cal. Penal Code Ann. §190.2.  At the penalty phase, the jury was instructed to consider a list of sentencing factors, including [t]he circumstances of the crime … and the existence of any special circumstances found to be true, §190.3(a), and sentenced him to death.  The State Supreme Court invalidated two of the special circumstances on direct appeal, but nonetheless affirmed the conviction and sentence.  The Federal District Court subsequently denied Sanders habeas relief, rejecting his claim that the jurys consideration of invalid special circumstances rendered his death sentence unconstitutional.  Reversing, the Ninth Circuit applied the rules for weighing States, see

				is usually met when the trier of fact finds at least one statutory eligibility factor at either the guilt or penalty phase.  Once this narrowing requirement has been satisfied, the sentencer must determine whether an eligible defendant should receive the death penalty; many States channel this function by specifying aggravating factors (sometimes identical to the eligibility factors) that are to be weighed against mitigating considerations.  In answering the question confronted herewhat happens when the sentencer imposes the death penalty after finding a valid eligibility factor, but under a scheme in which another eligibility factor is later held invalidthis Court has set forth different rules for so-called weighing and non-weighing States.  In a weighing State, the sentencer could consider as aggravation only specified eligibility factors.  Where the sentencer relied on an eligibility factor that was later invalidated, the sentencer was erroneously invited to count the invalid factor as weighing in favor of death, thus skewing the weighing process,

				<em>

				</em>
				 at 232.  Such automatic skewing would not necessarily occur in a non-weighing State, however, which permitted the sentencer to consider aggravating factors different from, or in addition to, the eligibility factors.  This weighing/non-weighing scheme seems needlessly complex and incapable of providing for the full range of variations.  This Court is henceforth guided by the following rule: An invalidated sentencing factor (whether an eligibility factor or not) will render the sentence unconstitutional by reason of its adding an improper element to the aggravation scale in the weighing process unless one of the other sentencing factors enables the sentencer to give aggravating weight to the same facts and circumstances.

				2. The jurys consideration of invalid special circumstances in Sanders case gave rise to no constitutional violation.  In California, the special circumstances listed in §190.2 are the eligibility factors designed to satisfy 
				<em>
					Furman
				</em>
				s narrowing requirement
				<em>
					.  
				</em>
				If the jury finds the existence of one of those circumstances, it must take into account a 
				<em>
					separate
				</em>
				 list of sentencing factors, including §190.3(a)s circumstances of the crime factor.  That factor has the effect of rendering all the specified factors nonexclusive, thus making California (in this Courts prior terminology) a non-weighing State.  Setting aside the weighing/non-weighing dichotomy and applying the more direct analysis set out here, two of the four special circumstances were invalidated, but the remaining two are sufficient to satisfy 
				<em>
					Furman
				</em>
				s narrowing requirement and alone rendered Sanders death eligible.  Moreover, all of the facts and circumstances admissible to prove the invalid eligibility factors were also properly adduced as aggravating facts and circumstances under the circumstances of the crime sentencing factor.  Even if §190.3(a)s direction to consider the existence of any special circumstances found to be true placed special emphasis upon the facts and circumstances relevant to the invalid factors, that impact cannot fairly be regarded as a constitutional defect in the sentencing process,

				  Once the narrowing requirement has been satisfied, the sentencer is called upon to determine whether a defendant thus found eligible for the death penalty should in fact receive it.  Most States channel this function by specifying the aggravating factors (sometimes identical to the eligibility factors) that are to be weighed against mitigating considerations.  The issue in the line of cases we confront here is what happens when the sentencer imposes the death penalty after at least one valid eligibility factor has been found, but under a scheme in which an eligibility factor or a specified aggravating factor is later held to be invalid.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				To answer that question, our jurisprudence has distinguished between so-called weighing and non-weighing States.  The terminology is somewhat misleading, since we have held that in 
				<em>
					all 
				</em>
				capital cases the sentencer must be allowed to weigh the facts and circumstances that arguably justify a death sentence against the defendants mitigating evidence.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Eddings
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Oklahoma,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/455/104" class="subref" title="subref">455 U. S. 104</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">110</a> (1982)
.  The terminology was adopted, moreover, relatively early in the development of our death-penalty jurisprudence, when we were perhaps unaware of the great variety of forms that state capital-sentencing legislation would ultimately take.  We identified as weighing State[s] those in which the only aggravating factors permitted to be considered by the sentencer were the specified eligibility factors.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Parker
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Dugger
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/498/308" class="subref" title="subref">498 U. S. 308</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">313</a>,

				<em>
					Lewis
				</em>
				,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">47</a> (1992)
 (quoting Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §13703(E) (1989)).  Since the eligibility factors by definition identified distinct and particular aggravating features, if one of them was invalid the jury could not consider the facts and circumstances relevant to that factor as aggravating in some other capacityfor example, as relevant to an omnibus circumstances of the crime sentencing factor such as the one in the present case.  In a weighing State, therefore, the sentencers consideration of an invalid eligibility factor necessarily skewed its balancing of aggravators with mitigators, 
				<em>
					Stringer
				</em>
				, 503 U. S., at 232, and required reversal of the sentence (unless a state appellate court determined the error was harmless or reweighed the mitigating evidence against the valid aggravating factors), 
				<em>
					ibid
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				By contrast, in a non-weighing Statea State that permitted the sentencer to consider aggravating factors different from, or in addition to, the eligibility factorsthis automatic skewing would not necessarily occur.  It would never occur if the aggravating factors were entirely different from the eligibility factors.  Nor would it occur if the aggravating factors 
				<em>
					added
				</em>
				 to the eligibility factors a category (such as an omnibus circumstances of the crime factor, which is quite common) that would allow the very facts and circumstances relevant to the invalidated eligibility factor to be weighed in aggravation under a different rubric.  We therefore set forth different rules governing the consequences of an invalidated eligibility factor in a non-weighing State.

                </sup>
            </a>
				  The sentencers consideration of an invalid eligibility factor amounts to constitutional error in a non-weighing State in two situations.  First, due process requires a defendants death sentence to be set aside if the reason for the invalidity of the eligibility factor is that it authorizes a jury to draw adverse inferences from conduct that is constitutionally protected, or that it attache[s] the aggravating label to factors that are constitutionally impermissible or totally irrelevant to the sentencing process, … or to conduct that actually should militate in favor of a lesser penalty.  
				<em>
					Zant,
				</em>
				 462 U. S., at 885.  Second, the death sentence must be set aside if the jurys consideration of the invalidated eligibility factor allowed it to hear evidence that would not otherwise have been before it.  See

				This weighing/non-weighing scheme is accurate as far as it goes, but it now seems to us needlessly complex and incapable of providing for the full range of possible variations.  For example, the same problem that gave rise to our weighing-State jurisprudence would arise if it were a sentencing factor, and 
				<em>
					not 
				</em>
				an eligibility factor, that was later found to be invalid.  The weighing process would just as clearly have been prima facie skewed, and skewed for the same basic reason: The sentencer might have given weight to a statutorily or constitutionally invalid aggravator.

				  And the prima facie skewing could in appropriate cases be shown to be illusory for the same reason that separates weighing States from non-weighing States: One of the 
				<em>
					other

				aggravating factors, usually an omnibus factor but conceivably another one, made it entirely proper for the jury to consider as aggravating the facts and circumstances underlying the invalidated factor.

				In California, a defendant convicted of first-degree murder is eligible for the death penalty if the jury finds one of the special circumstances listed in Cal. Penal Code Ann. §190.2 (West Supp. 2005) to be true.  These are the eligibility factors designed to satisfy

				<em>
					.
				</em>
				  If the jury finds the existence of one of the special circumstances, it is instructed to take into account a 
				<em>
					separate
				</em>
				 list of sentencing factors describing aspects of the defendant and the crime.  Cal. Penal Code Ann. §190.3 (West 1999).  These sentencing factors include, as we have said, [t]he circumstances of the crime
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				of which the defendant was convicted in the present
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				proceeding.

				The Court of Appeals held that California is a weighing State because  the sentencer [is] restricted to a weighing of aggravation against mitigation and the sentencer [is] prevented from considering evidence in aggravation other than discrete, statutorily-defined factors.   373 F. 3d, at 1061 (brackets in original) (quoting 
				<em>
					Williams
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Calderon
				</em>
				, 52 F. 3d 1465, 1478 (CA9 1995)).  The last statement is inaccurate.  The circumstances of the crime factor can hardly be called discrete.  It has the effect of rendering all the specified factors nonexclusive, thus causing California to be (in our prior terminology) a non-weighing State.  Contrary to Sanders contention, and 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Stevens
				</span>
				 views in dissent, the mere fact that the sentencing factors included the existence of any special circumstances [eligibility factors] found to be true, Cal. Penal Code Ann. §190.3(a), did not make California a weighing State.  That fact was redundant for purposes of our weighing jurisprudence because it in no way narrowed the universe of aggravating facts the jury was entitled to consider in determining a sentence.

				  But leaving aside the weighing/non-weighing dichotomy and proceeding to the more direct analysis set forth earlier in this opinion: All of the aggravating facts and circumstances that the invalidated factor permitted the jury to consider were also open to their proper consideration under one of the other factors.  The erroneous factor could not have skewed the sentence, and no constitutional violation occurred.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				More specifically, Sanders jury found four special circumstances to be true: that [t]he murder was committed while the defendant was engaged in … Robbery, §190.2(a)(17)(A) (West Supp. 2005); that it was committed while the defendant was engaged in … Burglary in the first or second degree, §190.2(a)(17)(G); that [t]he victim [Allen] was a witness to a crime who was intentionally killed for the purpose of preventing … her testimony in any criminal … proceeding, §190.2(a)(10); and that [t]he murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel, §190.2(a)(14).  The California Supreme Court set aside the burglary-murder special circumstance under state merger law because the instructions permitted the jury to find a burglary (and thus the burglary-murder special circumstance) based on Sanders intent to commit assault, which is already an element of homicide, see

				<em>
					Furman
				</em>
				s narrowing requirement, and alone rendered Sanders eligible for the death penalty.  Moreover, the jurys consideration of the invalid eligibility factors in the weighing process did not produce constitutional error because all of the facts and circumstances admissible to establish the heinous, atrocious, or cruel and burglary-murder eligibility factors were also properly adduced as aggravating facts bearing upon the circumstances of the crime sentencing factor.  They were properly considered whether or not they bore upon the invalidated eligibility factors.  See 51 Cal. 3d, at 521, 797 P. 2d, at 590.

				Sanders argues that the weighing process was skewed by the fact that the jury was asked to consider, as one of the sentencing factors, the existence of any special circumstances [eligibility factors] found to be true.  Cal. Penal Code Ann. §190.3(a) (West 1999).  In Sanders view, that placed special emphasis upon those facts and circumstances relevant to the invalid eligibility factor.  Virtually the same thing happened in 
				<em>

				<em>
					Stephens
				</em>
				, 250 Ga. 97, 99100, 297 S.

This instruction gave the facts underlying the eligibility factors special prominence.  Yet, even though one of the three factors (that the defendant had substantial history of serious assaultive convictions, 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 867) was later invalidated, we upheld the sentence.  We acknowledged that the erroneous instruction might have caused the jury to give somewhat greater weight to respondents prior criminal record than it otherwise would have given,

						 Our cases have frequently employed the terms aggravating circumstance or aggravating factor to refer to those statutory factors which determine death eligibility in satisfaction of Furmans narrowing requirement.  See, e.g., Tuilaepa v. California, 512 U. S., at 972.  This terminology becomes confusing when, as in this case, a State employs the term aggravating circumstance to refer to factors that play a different role, determining which defendants eligible for the death penalty will actually receive that penalty.  See Cal. Penal Code Ann. §190.3 (West 1999).  To avoid confusion, this opinion will use the term eligibility factor to describe a factor that performs the constitutional narrowing function.

 Justice Breyer contends that harmless-error review applies in both weighing and non-weighing States.  See post, at 812 (dissenting opinion).  It would be strange indeed to discover at this late stage that our long-held distinction between the two sorts of States for purposes of reviewing invalid eligibility factors in fact made no difference.  Cf., e.g., Stringer v. Black, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/503/222" class="subref" title="subref">503 U. S. 222</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">232</a> (1992)
 (weighing/non-weighing distinction is of critical importance).  Not surprisingly, the Courts of Appeals have uniformly understood that different rules apply to weighing and non-weighing States, and that harmless-error review is necessary only in the former.  See, e.g., Sanders v. Woodford, 373 F. 3d 1054, 10591060 (CA9 2004); Flamer v. Delaware, 68 F. 3d 736, 746749 (CA3 1995); Williams v. Cain, 125 F. 3d 269, 281 (CA5 1997).


Our own cases, moreover, are flatly inconsistent with requiring harmless-error review in both types of States.  As Justice Breyer notes, post, at 8, Zant v. Stephens, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/462/862" class="subref" title="subref">462 U. S. 862</a> (1983)
, did endorse the Georgia Supreme Courts holding that attaching the statutory label aggravating to the invalid eligibility factor had an inconsequential impact on the jurys decision regarding the death penalty, id., at 889 (internal quotation marks omitted).  But the core holding is what we said next:  More importantly, … any possible impact cannot fairly be regarded as a constitutional defect in the sentencing process.  Ibid. (emphasis added); see also post, at 1112.  Zant must therefore be read not as holding that any constitutional error was harmless, but as rejecting respondents claim of constitutional error.


Neither Clemons v. Mississippi, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/494/738" class="subref" title="subref">494 U. S. 738</a> (1990)
, nor Stringer says anything to the contrary.  Justice Breyer points out that Clemons harmless-error discussion focused on the emphasis given to the invalid factor, rather than on the fact that Mississippi is a weighing State, but that is hardly relevant: Our discussion of how harmless-error analysis should be conducted (the issue in the passage from Clemons that Justice Breyer cites, 494 U. S., at 753754) says nothing about when that analysis should be conducted (the issue addressed by the weighing/non-weighing distinction).  On the latter question, Clemons maintains the distinction envisioned in Zant, see 462 U. S., at 890891, between Georgia (a non-weighing State) and Mississippi (a weighing State), see Clemons, supra, at 745.  Likewise, Stringer specifically distinguishes between non-weighing States, in which the fact that [the jury] also finds an invalid aggravating factor does not infect the formal process of deciding whether death is an appropriate penalty, 503 U. S., at 232, and weighing States, in which constitutional harmless-error analysis or reweighing at the trial or appellate level is required, ibid.

					</a>
						 The fact that a sentencers consideration of an invalid eligibility factor in a non-weighing State may nonetheless amount to constitutional error explains Tuggles characterization of Zant as holding that a death sentence supported by multiple aggravating circumstances need not always be set aside if one aggravator is found to be invalid, 516 U. S., at 11 (emphasis added); cf. post, at 12 (Breyer, J., dissenting), as well as our related comment in Clemons that, [i]n a [non-weighing] State like Georgia, . . . the invalidation of one aggravating circumstance does not necessarily require an appellate court to vacate a death sentence and remand to a jury, 494 U. S., at 745 (emphasis added); cf. post, at 1415 (Breyer, J., dissenting).

						 This very problem may have been present in Stringer v. Black, supra.  There, although the Mississippi courts invalidated an aggravating circumstancewhether the murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel, Miss. Code Ann. §9919101(h) (1993 Cum. Supp.)that was not one of the specified eligibility factors, see §97319(2) (1994), we nonetheless treated Mississippi as a weighing State.  Since, however, Mississippi law provided that the jury could not impose a death sentence unless it found the existence of at least one statutory aggravating factor, see §9919101(3)(b) (1993 Cum. Supp.), it could be argued that the additional aggravating factors were converted into de facto eligibility factors.

        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-6" href="#ZO-6ref">
						6
					</a>
						 There may be other distortions caused by the invalidated factor beyond the mere addition of an improper aggravating element.  For example, what the jury was instructed to consider as an aggravating factor might have actually . . . militate[d] in favor of a lesser penalty, Zant, supra, at 885.  See supra, at 56.

        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-7" href="#ZO-7ref">

					</a>
						 This explains the footnote in Clemons v. Mississippi, supra, at 754, n. 5, on which Justice Breyer relies, see post, at 14.  That footnote addressed petitioners argument that the Mississippi Supreme Court had arbitrarily refused to order jury resentencing, even though it had done so in an earlier case, Johnson v. State, 511 So. 2d 1333 (1987), revd, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/486/578" class="subref" title="subref">486 U. S. 578</a> (1988)
, on remand, 547 So. 2d 59 (1989).  We distinguished the two cases, noting that in Johnson, the jury was permitted to consider inadmissible evidence in determining the defendants sentence, 494 U. S., at 754755, n. 5, whereas in Clemons, there is no serious suggestion that the States reliance on the [invalid] factor led to the introduction of any evidence that was not otherwise admissible in either the guilt or sentencing phases of the proceeding, id., at 755, n. 5.  The crux of this distinction is that the sentencers consideration of improper evidence is an error distinct from the one at issue here and in Clemons, to-wit, the jurys weighing in favor of death a factor that should not have been part of its calculus.

						 Justice Stevens argues that §190.3(a) may have affected the jurys deliberations in other ways, but we rejected each of these theories in Zant v. Stephens, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/462/862" class="subref" title="subref">462 U. S. 862</a> (1983)
.  The possibility that the jury would coun[t] the nature of the crime twice, post, at 2 (Stevens, J., dissenting), if it were instructed to consider both the facts of the crime and the eligibility circumstances was present in Zant.  The jury there was told it could take into account all relevant circumstances, but alsomuch like the jury herewas instructed to consider  any of [the] statutory aggravating circumstances [i.e., eligibility factors] which you find are supported by the evidence.   462 U. S., at 866.  Likewise, the jury in Zant might have give[n] greater weight, post, at 2 (Stevens, J., dissenting), to the facts underlying the eligibility circumstances, but we explicitly held that any such effect cannot fairly be regarded as a constitutional defect in the sentencing process, 462 U. S., at 889.  See infra, at 1112.

				  Once the narrowing requirement has been satisfied, the sentencer is called upon to determine whether a defendant thus found eligible for the death penalty should in fact receive it.  Most States channel this function by specifying the aggravating factors (sometimes identical to the eligibility factors) that are to be weighed against mitigating considerations.  The issue in the line of cases we confront here is what happens when the sentencer imposes the death penalty after at least one valid eligibility factor has been found, but under a scheme in which an eligibility factor or a specified aggravating factor is later held to be invalid.

				To answer that question, our jurisprudence has distinguished between so-called weighing and non-weighing States.  The terminology is somewhat misleading, since we have held that in 
				<em>
					all 
				</em>
				capital cases the sentencer must be allowed to weigh the facts and circumstances that arguably justify a death sentence against the defendants mitigating evidence.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Eddings
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Oklahoma,

            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/455/104" class="subref" title="subref">455 U. S. 104</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">110</a> (1982)
.  The terminology was adopted, moreover, relatively early in the development of our death-penalty jurisprudence, when we were perhaps unaware of the great variety of forms that state capital-sentencing legislation would ultimately take.  We identified as weighing State[s] those in which the only aggravating factors permitted to be considered by the sentencer were the specified eligibility factors.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Parker
				</em>

				<em>
					Dugger

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">47</a> (1992)
 (quoting Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §13703(E) (1989)).  Since the eligibility factors by definition identified distinct and particular aggravating features, if one of them was invalid the jury could not consider the facts and circumstances relevant to that factor as aggravating in some other capacityfor example, as relevant to an omnibus circumstances of the crime sentencing factor such as the one in the present case.  In a weighing State, therefore, the sentencers consideration of an invalid eligibility factor necessarily skewed its balancing of aggravators with mitigators, 
				<em>
					Stringer
				</em>
				, 503 U. S., at 232, and required reversal of the sentence (unless a state appellate court determined the error was harmless or reweighed the mitigating evidence against the valid aggravating factors), 
				<em>
					ibid
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				By contrast, in a non-weighing Statea State that permitted the sentencer to consider aggravating factors different from, or in addition to, the eligibility factorsthis automatic skewing would not necessarily occur.  It would never occur if the aggravating factors were entirely different from the eligibility factors.  Nor would it occur if the aggravating factors 
				<em>
					added
				</em>
				 to the eligibility factors a category (such as an omnibus circumstances of the crime factor, which is quite common) that would allow the very facts and circumstances relevant to the invalidated eligibility factor to be weighed in aggravation under a different rubric.  We therefore set forth different rules governing the consequences of an invalidated eligibility factor in a non-weighing State.

            </a>
				  The sentencers consideration of an invalid eligibility factor amounts to constitutional error in a non-weighing State in two situations.  First, due process requires a defendants death sentence to be set aside if the reason for the invalidity of the eligibility factor is that it authorizes a jury to draw adverse inferences from conduct that is constitutionally protected, or that it attache[s] the aggravating label to factors that are constitutionally impermissible or totally irrelevant to the sentencing process, … or to conduct that actually should militate in favor of a lesser penalty.  
				<em>
					Zant,
				</em>

				This weighing/non-weighing scheme is accurate as far as it goes, but it now seems to us needlessly complex and incapable of providing for the full range of possible variations.  For example, the same problem that gave rise to our weighing-State jurisprudence would arise if it were a sentencing factor, and 
				<em>
					not 
				</em>
				an eligibility factor, that was later found to be invalid.  The weighing process would just as clearly have been prima facie skewed, and skewed for the same basic reason: The sentencer might have given weight to a statutorily or constitutionally invalid aggravator.

				  And the prima facie skewing could in appropriate cases be shown to be illusory for the same reason that separates weighing States from non-weighing States: One of the

				In California, a defendant convicted of first-degree murder is eligible for the death penalty if the jury finds one of the special circumstances listed in Cal. Penal Code Ann. §190.2 (West Supp. 2005) to be true.  These are the eligibility factors designed to satisfy

				<em>
					.
				</em>
				  If the jury finds the existence of one of the special circumstances, it is instructed to take into account a 
				<em>
					separate
				</em>
				 list of sentencing factors describing aspects of the defendant and the crime.  Cal. Penal Code Ann. §190.3 (West 1999).  These sentencing factors include, as we have said, [t]he circumstances of the crime

				The Court of Appeals held that California is a weighing State because  the sentencer [is] restricted to a weighing of aggravation against mitigation and the sentencer [is] prevented from considering evidence in aggravation other than discrete, statutorily-defined factors.   373 F. 3d, at 1061 (brackets in original) (quoting

The circumstances of the crime factor can hardly be called discrete.  It has the effect of rendering all the specified factors nonexclusive, thus causing California to be (in our prior terminology) a non-weighing State.  Contrary to Sanders contention, and 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Stevens
				</span>
				 views in dissent, the mere fact that the sentencing factors included the existence of any special circumstances [eligibility factors] found to be true, Cal. Penal Code Ann. §190.3(a), did not make California a weighing State.  That fact was redundant for purposes of our weighing jurisprudence because it in no way narrowed the universe of aggravating facts the jury was entitled to consider in determining a sentence.

				  But leaving aside the weighing/non-weighing dichotomy and proceeding to the more direct analysis set forth earlier in this opinion: All of the aggravating facts and circumstances that the invalidated factor permitted the jury to consider were also open to their proper consideration under one of the other factors.

				More specifically, Sanders jury found four special circumstances to be true: that [t]he murder was committed while the defendant was engaged in … Robbery, §190.2(a)(17)(A) (West Supp. 2005); that it was committed while the defendant was engaged in … Burglary in the first or second degree, §190.2(a)(17)(G); that [t]he victim [Allen] was a witness to a crime who was intentionally killed for the purpose of preventing … her testimony in any criminal … proceeding, §190.2(a)(10); and that [t]he murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel, §190.2(a)(14).  The California Supreme Court set aside the burglary-murder special circumstance under state merger law because the instructions permitted the jury to find a burglary (and thus the burglary-murder special circumstance) based on Sanders intent to commit assault, which is already an element of homicide, see

				<em>
					Furman
				</em>
				s narrowing requirement, and alone rendered Sanders eligible for the death penalty.  Moreover, the jurys consideration of the invalid eligibility factors in the weighing process did not produce constitutional error because all of the facts and circumstances admissible to establish the heinous, atrocious, or cruel and burglary-murder eligibility factors were also properly adduced as aggravating facts bearing upon the circumstances of the crime sentencing factor.

This instruction gave the facts underlying the eligibility factors special prominence.  Yet, even though one of the three factors (that the defendant had substantial history of serious assaultive convictions,

 Justice Breyer contends that harmless-error review applies in both weighing and non-weighing States.  See post, at 812 (dissenting opinion).  It would be strange indeed to discover at this late stage that our long-held distinction between the two sorts of States for purposes of reviewing invalid eligibility factors in fact made no difference.  Cf., e.g., Stringer v. Black, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/503/222" class="subref" title="subref">503 U. S. 222</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">232</a> (1992)
 (weighing/non-weighing distinction is of critical importance).  Not surprisingly, the Courts of Appeals have uniformly understood that different rules apply to weighing and non-weighing States, and that harmless-error review is necessary only in the former.  See, e.g., Sanders v. Woodford, 373 F. 3d 1054, 10591060 (CA9 2004); Flamer v. Delaware, 68 F. 3d 736, 746749 (CA3 1995); Williams v. Cain, 125 F. 3d 269, 281 (CA5 1997).


Our own cases, moreover, are flatly inconsistent with requiring harmless-error review in both types of States.  As Justice Breyer notes, post, at 8, Zant v. Stephens, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/462/862" class="subref" title="subref">462 U. S. 862</a> (1983)
, did endorse the Georgia Supreme Courts holding that attaching the statutory label aggravating to the invalid eligibility factor had an inconsequential impact on the jurys decision regarding the death penalty, id., at 889 (internal quotation marks omitted).  But the core holding is what we said next:  More importantly, … any possible impact cannot fairly be regarded as a constitutional defect in the sentencing process.  Ibid. (emphasis added); see also post, at 1112.  Zant must therefore be read not as holding that any constitutional error was harmless, but as rejecting respondents claim of constitutional error.


Neither Clemons v. Mississippi, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/494/738" class="subref" title="subref">494 U. S. 738</a> (1990)
, nor Stringer says anything to the contrary.  Justice Breyer points out that Clemons harmless-error discussion focused on the emphasis given to the invalid factor, rather than on the fact that Mississippi is a weighing State, but that is hardly relevant: Our discussion of how harmless-error analysis should be conducted (the issue in the passage from Clemons that Justice Breyer cites, 494 U. S., at 753754) says nothing about when that analysis should be conducted (the issue addressed by the weighing/non-weighing distinction).  On the latter question, Clemons maintains the distinction envisioned in Zant, see 462 U. S., at 890891, between Georgia (a non-weighing State) and Mississippi (a weighing State), see Clemons, supra, at 745.  Likewise, Stringer specifically distinguishes between non-weighing States, in which the fact that [the jury] also finds an invalid aggravating factor does not infect the formal process of deciding whether death is an appropriate penalty, 503 U. S., at 232, and weighing States, in which constitutional harmless-error analysis or reweighing at the trial or appellate level is required, ibid.

						 The fact that a sentencers consideration of an invalid eligibility factor in a non-weighing State may nonetheless amount to constitutional error explains Tuggles characterization of Zant as holding that a death sentence supported by multiple aggravating circumstances need not always be set aside if one aggravator is found to be invalid, 516 U. S., at 11 (emphasis added); cf. post, at 12 (Breyer, J., dissenting), as well as our related comment in Clemons that, [i]n a [non-weighing] State like Georgia, . . . the invalidation of one aggravating circumstance does not necessarily require an appellate court to vacate a death sentence and remand to a jury, 494 U. S., at 745 (emphasis added); cf. post, at 1415 (Breyer, J., dissenting).

						 This very problem may have been present in Stringer v. Black, supra.  There, although the Mississippi courts invalidated an aggravating circumstancewhether the murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel, Miss. Code Ann. §9919101(h) (1993 Cum. Supp.)that was not one of the specified eligibility factors, see §97319(2) (1994), we nonetheless treated Mississippi as a weighing State.  Since, however, Mississippi law provided that the jury could not impose a death sentence unless it found the existence of at least one statutory aggravating factor, see §9919101(3)(b) (1993 Cum. Supp.), it could be argued that the additional aggravating factors were converted into de facto eligibility factors.

For example, what the jury was instructed to consider as an aggravating factor might have actually . . . militate[d] in favor of a lesser penalty, Zant, supra, at 885.  See supra, at 56.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/486/578" class="subref" title="subref">486 U. S. 578</a> (1988)
, on remand, 547 So. 2d 59 (1989).  We distinguished the two cases, noting that in Johnson, the jury was permitted to consider inadmissible evidence in determining the defendants sentence, 494 U. S., at 754755, n. 5, whereas in Clemons, there is no serious suggestion that the States reliance on the [invalid] factor led to the introduction of any evidence that was not otherwise admissible in either the guilt or sentencing phases of the proceeding, id., at 755, n. 5.  The crux of this distinction is that the sentencers consideration of improper evidence is an error distinct from the one at issue here and in Clemons, to-wit, the jurys weighing in favor of death a factor that should not have been part of its calculus.

The possibility that the jury would coun[t] the nature of the crime twice, post, at 2 (Stevens, J., dissenting), if it were instructed to consider both the facts of the crime and the eligibility circumstances was present in Zant.  The jury there was told it could take into account all relevant circumstances, but alsomuch like the jury herewas instructed to consider  any of [the] statutory aggravating circumstances [i.e., eligibility factors] which you find are supported by the evidence.   462 U. S., at 866.  Likewise, the jury in Zant might have give[n] greater weight, post, at 2 (Stevens, J., dissenting), to the facts underlying the eligibility circumstances, but we explicitly held that any such effect cannot fairly be regarded as a constitutional defect in the sentencing process, 462 U.

            </a>
				  Once the narrowing requirement has been satisfied, the sentencer is called upon to determine whether a defendant thus found eligible for the death penalty should in fact receive it.  Most States channel this function by specifying the aggravating factors (sometimes identical to the eligibility factors) that are to be weighed against mitigating considerations.  The issue in the line of cases we confront here is what happens when the sentencer imposes the death penalty after at least one valid eligibility factor has been found, but under a scheme in which an eligibility factor or a specified aggravating factor is later held to be invalid.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				To answer that question, our jurisprudence has distinguished between so-called weighing and non-weighing States.  The terminology is somewhat misleading, since we have held that in 
				<em>
					all 
				</em>
				capital cases the sentencer must be allowed to weigh the facts and circumstances that arguably justify a death sentence against the defendants mitigating evidence.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Eddings
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Oklahoma,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/455/104" class="subref" title="subref">455 U. S. 104</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">110</a> (1982)
.  The terminology was adopted, moreover, relatively early in the development of our death-penalty jurisprudence, when we were perhaps unaware of the great variety of forms that state capital-sentencing legislation would ultimately take.  We identified as weighing State[s] those in which the only aggravating factors permitted to be considered by the sentencer were the specified eligibility factors.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Parker
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Dugger
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/498/308" class="subref" title="subref">498 U. S. 308</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">313</a>,

				<em>
					Lewis

				,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">47</a> (1992)
 (quoting Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §13703(E) (1989)).  Since the eligibility factors by definition identified distinct and particular aggravating features, if one of them was invalid the jury could not consider the facts and circumstances relevant to that factor as aggravating in some other capacityfor example, as relevant to an omnibus circumstances of the crime sentencing factor such as the one in the present case.  In a weighing State, therefore, the sentencers consideration of an invalid eligibility factor necessarily skewed its balancing of aggravators with mitigators, 
				<em>
					Stringer
				</em>
				, 503 U. S., at 232, and required reversal of the sentence (unless a state appellate court determined the error was harmless or reweighed the mitigating evidence against the valid aggravating factors), 
				<em>
					ibid
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				By contrast, in a non-weighing Statea State that permitted the sentencer to consider aggravating factors different from, or in addition to, the eligibility factorsthis automatic skewing would not necessarily occur.  It would never occur if the aggravating factors were entirely different from the eligibility factors.  Nor would it occur if the aggravating factors 
				<em>
					added
				</em>
				 to the eligibility factors a category (such as an omnibus circumstances of the crime factor, which is quite common) that would allow the very facts and circumstances relevant to the invalidated eligibility factor to be weighed in aggravation under a different rubric.  We therefore set forth different rules governing the consequences of an invalidated eligibility factor in a non-weighing State.

                </sup>
            </a>
				  The sentencers consideration of an invalid eligibility factor amounts to constitutional error in a non-weighing State in two situations.  First, due process requires a defendants death sentence to be set aside if the reason for the invalidity of the eligibility factor is that it authorizes a jury to draw adverse inferences from conduct that is constitutionally protected, or that it attache[s] the aggravating label to factors that are constitutionally impermissible or totally irrelevant to the sentencing process, … or to conduct that actually should militate in favor of a lesser penalty.  
				<em>
					Zant,
				</em>
				 462 U. S., at 885.  Second, the death sentence must be set aside if the jurys consideration of the invalidated eligibility factor allowed it to hear evidence that would not otherwise have been before it.  See

				This weighing/non-weighing scheme is accurate as far as it goes, but it now seems to us needlessly complex and incapable of providing for the full range of possible variations.  For example, the same problem that gave rise to our weighing-State jurisprudence would arise if it were a sentencing factor, and 
				<em>
					not 
				</em>
				an eligibility factor, that was later found to be invalid.  The weighing process would just as clearly have been prima facie skewed, and skewed for the same basic reason: The sentencer might have given weight to a statutorily or constitutionally invalid aggravator.

				  And the prima facie skewing could in appropriate cases be shown to be illusory for the same reason that separates weighing States from non-weighing States: One of the

				In California, a defendant convicted of first-degree murder is eligible for the death penalty if the jury finds one of the special circumstances listed in Cal. Penal Code Ann. §190.2 (West Supp. 2005) to be true.  These are the eligibility factors designed to satisfy

					.
				</em>
				  If the jury finds the existence of one of the special circumstances, it is instructed to take into account a 
				<em>
					separate
				</em>
				 list of sentencing factors describing aspects of the defendant and the crime.  Cal. Penal Code Ann. §190.3 (West 1999).  These sentencing factors include, as we have said, [t]he circumstances of the crime

				The Court of Appeals held that California is a weighing State because  the sentencer [is] restricted to a weighing of aggravation against mitigation and the sentencer [is] prevented from considering evidence in aggravation other than discrete, statutorily-defined factors.   373 F. 3d, at 1061 (brackets in original) (quoting

				, 52 F. 3d 1465, 1478 (CA9 1995)).  The last statement is inaccurate.  The circumstances of the crime factor can hardly be called discrete.  It has the effect of rendering all the specified factors nonexclusive, thus causing California to be (in our prior terminology) a non-weighing State.  Contrary to Sanders contention, and 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Stevens
				</span>
				 views in dissent, the mere fact that the sentencing factors included the existence of any special circumstances [eligibility factors] found to be true, Cal. Penal Code Ann. §190.3(a), did not make California a weighing State.  That fact was redundant for purposes of our weighing jurisprudence because it in no way narrowed the universe of aggravating facts the jury was entitled to consider in determining a sentence.

				  But leaving aside the weighing/non-weighing dichotomy and proceeding to the more direct analysis set forth earlier in this opinion: All of the aggravating facts and circumstances that the invalidated factor permitted the jury to consider were also open to their proper consideration under one of the other factors.  The erroneous factor could not have skewed the sentence, and no constitutional violation occurred.

				More specifically, Sanders jury found four special circumstances to be true: that [t]he murder was committed while the defendant was engaged in … Robbery, §190.2(a)(17)(A) (West Supp. 2005); that it was committed while the defendant was engaged in … Burglary in the first or second degree, §190.2(a)(17)(G); that [t]he victim [Allen] was a witness to a crime who was intentionally killed for the purpose of preventing … her testimony in any criminal … proceeding, §190.2(a)(10); and that [t]he murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel, §190.2(a)(14).  The California Supreme Court set aside the burglary-murder special circumstance under state merger law because the instructions permitted the jury to find a burglary (and thus the burglary-murder special circumstance) based on Sanders intent to commit assault, which is already an element of homicide, see

				<em>
					Furman
				</em>
				s narrowing requirement, and alone rendered Sanders eligible for the death penalty.  Moreover, the jurys consideration of the invalid eligibility factors in the weighing process did not produce constitutional error because all of the facts and circumstances admissible to establish the heinous, atrocious, or cruel and burglary-murder eligibility factors were also properly adduced as aggravating facts bearing upon the circumstances of the crime sentencing factor.

Yet, even though one of the three factors (that the defendant had substantial history of serious assaultive convictions, 
				<em>

				, at 867) was later invalidated, we upheld the sentence.  We acknowledged that the erroneous instruction might have caused the jury to give somewhat greater weight to respondents prior criminal record than it otherwise would have given,

						 Our cases have frequently employed the terms aggravating circumstance or aggravating factor to refer to those statutory factors which determine death eligibility in satisfaction of Furmans narrowing requirement.  See, e.g., Tuilaepa v. California, 512 U. S., at 972.  This terminology becomes confusing when, as in this case, a State employs the term aggravating circumstance to refer to factors that play a different role, determining which defendants eligible for the death penalty will actually receive that penalty.  See Cal. Penal Code Ann. §190.3 (West 1999).  To avoid confusion, this opinion will use the term eligibility factor to describe a factor that performs the constitutional narrowing function.

 Justice Breyer contends that harmless-error review applies in both weighing and non-weighing States.  See post, at 812 (dissenting opinion).  It would be strange indeed to discover at this late stage that our long-held distinction between the two sorts of States for purposes of reviewing invalid eligibility factors in fact made no difference.  Cf., e.g., Stringer v. Black, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/503/222" class="subref" title="subref">503 U. S. 222</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">232</a> (1992)
 (weighing/non-weighing distinction is of critical importance).  Not surprisingly, the Courts of Appeals have uniformly understood that different rules apply to weighing and non-weighing States, and that harmless-error review is necessary only in the former.  See, e.g., Sanders v. Woodford, 373 F. 3d 1054, 10591060 (CA9 2004); Flamer v. Delaware, 68 F. 3d 736, 746749 (CA3 1995); Williams v. Cain, 125 F. 3d 269, 281 (CA5 1997).


Our own cases, moreover, are flatly inconsistent with requiring harmless-error review in both types of States.  As Justice Breyer notes, post, at 8, Zant v. Stephens, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/462/862" class="subref" title="subref">462 U. S. 862</a> (1983)
, did endorse the Georgia Supreme Courts holding that attaching the statutory label aggravating to the invalid eligibility factor had an inconsequential impact on the jurys decision regarding the death penalty, id., at 889 (internal quotation marks omitted).  But the core holding is what we said next:  More importantly, … any possible impact cannot fairly be regarded as a constitutional defect in the sentencing process.  Ibid. (emphasis added); see also post, at 1112.  Zant must therefore be read not as holding that any constitutional error was harmless, but as rejecting respondents claim of constitutional error.


Neither Clemons v. Mississippi, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/494/738" class="subref" title="subref">494 U. S. 738</a> (1990)
, nor Stringer says anything to the contrary.  Justice Breyer points out that Clemons harmless-error discussion focused on the emphasis given to the invalid factor, rather than on the fact that Mississippi is a weighing State, but that is hardly relevant: Our discussion of how harmless-error analysis should be conducted (the issue in the passage from Clemons that Justice Breyer cites, 494 U. S., at 753754) says nothing about when that analysis should be conducted (the issue addressed by the weighing/non-weighing distinction).  On the latter question, Clemons maintains the distinction envisioned in Zant, see 462 U. S., at 890891, between Georgia (a non-weighing State) and Mississippi (a weighing State), see Clemons, supra, at 745.  Likewise, Stringer specifically distinguishes between non-weighing States, in which the fact that [the jury] also finds an invalid aggravating factor does not infect the formal process of deciding whether death is an appropriate penalty, 503 U. S., at 232, and weighing States, in which constitutional harmless-error analysis or reweighing at the trial or appellate level is required, ibid.

						 The fact that a sentencers consideration of an invalid eligibility factor in a non-weighing State may nonetheless amount to constitutional error explains Tuggles characterization of Zant as holding that a death sentence supported by multiple aggravating circumstances need not always be set aside if one aggravator is found to be invalid, 516 U. S., at 11 (emphasis added); cf. post, at 12 (Breyer, J., dissenting), as well as our related comment in Clemons that, [i]n a [non-weighing] State like Georgia, . . . the invalidation of one aggravating circumstance does not necessarily require an appellate court to vacate a death sentence and remand to a jury, 494 U. S., at 745 (emphasis added); cf. post, at 1415 (Breyer, J., dissenting).

						 This very problem may have been present in Stringer v. Black, supra.  There, although the Mississippi courts invalidated an aggravating circumstancewhether the murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel, Miss. Code Ann. §9919101(h) (1993 Cum. Supp.)that was not one of the specified eligibility factors, see §97319(2) (1994), we nonetheless treated Mississippi as a weighing State.  Since, however, Mississippi law provided that the jury could not impose a death sentence unless it found the existence of at least one statutory aggravating factor, see §9919101(3)(b) (1993 Cum. Supp.), it could be argued that the additional aggravating factors were converted into de facto eligibility factors.

					</a>
						 There may be other distortions caused by the invalidated factor beyond the mere addition of an improper aggravating element.  For example, what the jury was instructed to consider as an aggravating factor might have actually . . . militate[d] in favor of a lesser penalty, Zant, supra, at 885.  See supra, at 56.

						 This explains the footnote in Clemons v. Mississippi, supra, at 754, n. 5, on which Justice Breyer relies, see post, at 14.  That footnote addressed petitioners argument that the Mississippi Supreme Court had arbitrarily refused to order jury resentencing, even though it had done so in an earlier case, Johnson v. State, 511 So. 2d 1333 (1987), revd, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/486/578" class="subref" title="subref">486 U. S. 578</a> (1988)
, on remand, 547 So. 2d 59 (1989).  We distinguished the two cases, noting that in Johnson, the jury was permitted to consider inadmissible evidence in determining the defendants sentence, 494 U. S., at 754755, n. 5, whereas in Clemons, there is no serious suggestion that the States reliance on the [invalid] factor led to the introduction of any evidence that was not otherwise admissible in either the guilt or sentencing phases of the proceeding, id., at 755, n. 5.  The crux of this distinction is that the sentencers consideration of improper evidence is an error distinct from the one at issue here and in Clemons, to-wit, the jurys weighing in favor of death a factor that should not have been part of its calculus.

						 Justice Stevens argues that §190.3(a) may have affected the jurys deliberations in other ways, but we rejected each of these theories in Zant v. Stephens, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/462/862" class="subref" title="subref">462 U. S. 862</a> (1983)
.  The possibility that the jury would coun[t] the nature of the crime twice, post, at 2 (Stevens, J., dissenting), if it were instructed to consider both the facts of the crime and the eligibility circumstances was present in Zant.  The jury there was told it could take into account all relevant circumstances, but alsomuch like the jury herewas instructed to consider  any of [the] statutory aggravating circumstances [i.e., eligibility factors] which you find are supported by the evidence.   462 U. S., at 866.  Likewise, the jury in Zant might have give[n] greater weight, post, at 2 (Stevens, J., dissenting), to the facts underlying the eligibility circumstances, but we explicitly held that any such effect cannot fairly be regarded as a constitutional defect in the sentencing process, 462 U. S., at 889.  See infra, at 1112.

            </a>
				  Once the narrowing requirement has been satisfied, the sentencer is called upon to determine whether a defendant thus found eligible for the death penalty should in fact receive it.  Most States channel this function by specifying the aggravating factors (sometimes identical to the eligibility factors) that are to be weighed against mitigating considerations.  The issue in the line of cases we confront here is what happens when the sentencer imposes the death penalty after at least one valid eligibility factor has been found, but under a scheme in which an eligibility factor or a specified aggravating factor is later held to be invalid.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				To answer that question, our jurisprudence has distinguished between so-called weighing and non-weighing States.  The terminology is somewhat misleading, since we have held that in 
				<em>
					all 
				</em>
				capital cases the sentencer must be allowed to weigh the facts and circumstances that arguably justify a death sentence against the defendants mitigating evidence.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Eddings
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Oklahoma,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/455/104" class="subref" title="subref">455 U. S. 104</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">110</a> (1982)
.  The terminology was adopted, moreover, relatively early in the development of our death-penalty jurisprudence, when we were perhaps unaware of the great variety of forms that state capital-sentencing legislation would ultimately take.  We identified as weighing State[s] those in which the only aggravating factors permitted to be considered by the sentencer were the specified eligibility factors.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Parker
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Dugger
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/498/308" class="subref" title="subref">498 U. S. 308</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">313</a>,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">47</a> (1992)
 (quoting Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §13703(E) (1989)).  Since the eligibility factors by definition identified distinct and particular aggravating features, if one of them was invalid the jury could not consider the facts and circumstances relevant to that factor as aggravating in some other capacityfor example, as relevant to an omnibus circumstances of the crime sentencing factor such as the one in the present case.  In a weighing State, therefore, the sentencers consideration of an invalid eligibility factor necessarily skewed its balancing of aggravators with mitigators, 
				<em>
					Stringer
				</em>
				, 503 U. S., at 232, and required reversal of the sentence (unless a state appellate court determined the error was harmless or reweighed the mitigating evidence against the valid aggravating factors), 
				<em>
					ibid
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				By contrast, in a non-weighing Statea State that permitted the sentencer to consider aggravating factors different from, or in addition to, the eligibility factorsthis automatic skewing would not necessarily occur.  It would never occur if the aggravating factors were entirely different from the eligibility factors.  Nor would it occur if the aggravating factors 
				<em>
					added
				</em>
				 to the eligibility factors a category (such as an omnibus circumstances of the crime factor, which is quite common) that would allow the very facts and circumstances relevant to the invalidated eligibility factor to be weighed in aggravation under a different rubric.  We therefore set forth different rules governing the consequences of an invalidated eligibility factor in a non-weighing State.

            </a>
				  The sentencers consideration of an invalid eligibility factor amounts to constitutional error in a non-weighing State in two situations.  First, due process requires a defendants death sentence to be set aside if the reason for the invalidity of the eligibility factor is that it authorizes a jury to draw adverse inferences from conduct that is constitutionally protected, or that it attache[s] the aggravating label to factors that are constitutionally impermissible or totally irrelevant to the sentencing process, … or to conduct that actually should militate in favor of a lesser penalty.  
				<em>
					Zant,
				</em>
				 462 U. S., at 885.  Second, the death sentence must be set aside if the jurys consideration of the invalidated eligibility factor allowed it to hear evidence that would not otherwise have been before it.  See

				This weighing/non-weighing scheme is accurate as far as it goes, but it now seems to us needlessly complex and incapable of providing for the full range of possible variations.  For example, the same problem that gave rise to our weighing-State jurisprudence would arise if it were a sentencing factor, and 
				<em>
					not 
				</em>
				an eligibility factor, that was later found to be invalid.  The weighing process would just as clearly have been prima facie skewed, and skewed for the same basic reason: The sentencer might have given weight to a statutorily or constitutionally invalid aggravator.

				  And the prima facie skewing could in appropriate cases be shown to be illusory for the same reason that separates weighing States from non-weighing States: One of the

				In California, a defendant convicted of first-degree murder is eligible for the death penalty if the jury finds one of the special circumstances listed in Cal. Penal Code Ann. §190.2 (West Supp. 2005) to be true.  These are the eligibility factors designed to satisfy

				<em>
					.
				</em>
				  If the jury finds the existence of one of the special circumstances, it is instructed to take into account a 
				<em>
					separate
				</em>
				 list of sentencing factors describing aspects of the defendant and the crime.  Cal. Penal Code Ann. §190.3 (West 1999).  These sentencing factors include, as we have said, [t]he circumstances of the crime
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				of which the defendant was convicted in the present
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				proceeding.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The Court of Appeals held that California is a weighing State because  the sentencer [is] restricted to a weighing of aggravation against mitigation and the sentencer [is] prevented from considering evidence in aggravation other than discrete, statutorily-defined factors.   373 F. 3d, at 1061 (brackets in original) (quoting 
				<em>
					Williams
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Calderon
				</em>
				, 52 F. 3d 1465, 1478 (CA9 1995)).  The last statement is inaccurate.  The circumstances of the crime factor can hardly be called discrete.  It has the effect of rendering all the specified factors nonexclusive, thus causing California to be (in our prior terminology) a non-weighing State.  Contrary to Sanders contention, and 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Stevens
				</span>
				 views in dissent, the mere fact that the sentencing factors included the existence of any special circumstances [eligibility factors] found to be true, Cal. Penal Code Ann. §190.3(a), did not make California a weighing State.  That fact was redundant for purposes of our weighing jurisprudence because it in no way narrowed the universe of aggravating facts the jury was entitled to consider in determining a sentence.

            </a>
				  But leaving aside the weighing/non-weighing dichotomy and proceeding to the more direct analysis set forth earlier in this opinion: All of the aggravating facts and circumstances that the invalidated factor permitted the jury to consider were also open to their proper consideration under one of the other factors.  The erroneous factor could not have skewed the sentence, and no constitutional violation occurred.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				More specifically, Sanders jury found four special circumstances to be true: that [t]he murder was committed while the defendant was engaged in … Robbery, §190.2(a)(17)(A) (West Supp. 2005); that it was committed while the defendant was engaged in … Burglary in the first or second degree, §190.2(a)(17)(G); that [t]he victim [Allen] was a witness to a crime who was intentionally killed for the purpose of preventing … her testimony in any criminal … proceeding, §190.2(a)(10); and that [t]he murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel, §190.2(a)(14).  The California Supreme Court set aside the burglary-murder special circumstance under state merger law because the instructions permitted the jury to find a burglary (and thus the burglary-murder special circumstance) based on Sanders intent to commit assault, which is already an element of homicide, see

				<em>
					Furman
				</em>
				s narrowing requirement, and alone rendered Sanders eligible for the death penalty.  Moreover, the jurys consideration of the invalid eligibility factors in the weighing process did not produce constitutional error because all of the facts and circumstances admissible to establish the heinous, atrocious, or cruel and burglary-murder eligibility factors were also properly adduced as aggravating facts bearing upon the circumstances of the crime sentencing factor.  They were properly considered whether or not they bore upon the invalidated eligibility factors.  See 51 Cal. 3d, at 521, 797 P. 2d, at 590.

				Sanders argues that the weighing process was skewed by the fact that the jury was asked to consider, as one of the sentencing factors, the existence of any special circumstances [eligibility factors] found to be true.  Cal. Penal Code Ann. §190.3(a) (West 1999).  In Sanders view, that placed special emphasis upon those facts and circumstances relevant to the invalid eligibility factor.  Virtually the same thing happened in 
				<em>
					Zant.

				 v. 
				<em>
					Stephens
				</em>
				, 250 Ga. 97, 99100, 297 S.

This instruction gave the facts underlying the eligibility factors special prominence.  Yet, even though one of the three factors (that the defendant had substantial history of serious assaultive convictions, 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 867) was later invalidated, we upheld the sentence.  We acknowledged that the erroneous instruction might have caused the jury to give somewhat greater weight to respondents prior criminal record than it otherwise would have given,

				such an effect,

						 Our cases have frequently employed the terms aggravating circumstance or aggravating factor to refer to those statutory factors which determine death eligibility in satisfaction of Furmans narrowing requirement.  See, e.g., Tuilaepa v. California, 512 U. S., at 972.  This terminology becomes confusing when, as in this case, a State employs the term aggravating circumstance to refer to factors that play a different role, determining which defendants eligible for the death penalty will actually receive that penalty.  See Cal. Penal Code Ann. §190.3 (West 1999).  To avoid confusion, this opinion will use the term eligibility factor to describe a factor that performs the constitutional narrowing function.

 Justice Breyer contends that harmless-error review applies in both weighing and non-weighing States.  See post, at 812 (dissenting opinion).  It would be strange indeed to discover at this late stage that our long-held distinction between the two sorts of States for purposes of reviewing invalid eligibility factors in fact made no difference.  Cf., e.g., Stringer v. Black, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/503/222" class="subref" title="subref">503 U. S. 222</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">232</a> (1992)
 (weighing/non-weighing distinction is of critical importance).  Not surprisingly, the Courts of Appeals have uniformly understood that different rules apply to weighing and non-weighing States, and that harmless-error review is necessary only in the former.  See, e.g., Sanders v. Woodford, 373 F. 3d 1054, 10591060 (CA9 2004); Flamer v. Delaware, 68 F. 3d 736, 746749 (CA3 1995); Williams v. Cain, 125 F. 3d 269, 281 (CA5 1997).


Our own cases, moreover, are flatly inconsistent with requiring harmless-error review in both types of States.  As Justice Breyer notes, post, at 8, Zant v. Stephens, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/462/862" class="subref" title="subref">462 U. S. 862</a> (1983)
, did endorse the Georgia Supreme Courts holding that attaching the statutory label aggravating to the invalid eligibility factor had an inconsequential impact on the jurys decision regarding the death penalty, id., at 889 (internal quotation marks omitted).  But the core holding is what we said next:  More importantly, … any possible impact cannot fairly be regarded as a constitutional defect in the sentencing process.  Ibid. (emphasis added); see also post, at 1112.  Zant must therefore be read not as holding that any constitutional error was harmless, but as rejecting respondents claim of constitutional error.


Neither Clemons v. Mississippi, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/494/738" class="subref" title="subref">494 U. S. 738</a> (1990)
, nor Stringer says anything to the contrary.  Justice Breyer points out that Clemons harmless-error discussion focused on the emphasis given to the invalid factor, rather than on the fact that Mississippi is a weighing State, but that is hardly relevant: Our discussion of how harmless-error analysis should be conducted (the issue in the passage from Clemons that Justice Breyer cites, 494 U. S., at 753754) says nothing about when that analysis should be conducted (the issue addressed by the weighing/non-weighing distinction).  On the latter question, Clemons maintains the distinction envisioned in Zant, see 462 U. S., at 890891, between Georgia (a non-weighing State) and Mississippi (a weighing State), see Clemons, supra, at 745.  Likewise, Stringer specifically distinguishes between non-weighing States, in which the fact that [the jury] also finds an invalid aggravating factor does not infect the formal process of deciding whether death is an appropriate penalty, 503 U. S., at 232, and weighing States, in which constitutional harmless-error analysis or reweighing at the trial or appellate level is required, ibid.

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-4" href="#ZO-4ref">

					</a>
						 The fact that a sentencers consideration of an invalid eligibility factor in a non-weighing State may nonetheless amount to constitutional error explains Tuggles characterization of Zant as holding that a death sentence supported by multiple aggravating circumstances need not always be set aside if one aggravator is found to be invalid, 516 U. S., at 11 (emphasis added); cf. post, at 12 (Breyer, J., dissenting), as well as our related comment in Clemons that, [i]n a [non-weighing] State like Georgia, . . . the invalidation of one aggravating circumstance does not necessarily require an appellate court to vacate a death sentence and remand to a jury, 494 U. S., at 745 (emphasis added); cf. post, at 1415 (Breyer, J., dissenting).

						 This very problem may have been present in Stringer v. Black, supra.  There, although the Mississippi courts invalidated an aggravating circumstancewhether the murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel, Miss. Code Ann. §9919101(h) (1993 Cum. Supp.)that was not one of the specified eligibility factors, see §97319(2) (1994), we nonetheless treated Mississippi as a weighing State.  Since, however, Mississippi law provided that the jury could not impose a death sentence unless it found the existence of at least one statutory aggravating factor, see §9919101(3)(b) (1993 Cum. Supp.), it could be argued that the additional aggravating factors were converted into de facto eligibility factors.

        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-6" href="#ZO-6ref">
						6
					</a>
						 There may be other distortions caused by the invalidated factor beyond the mere addition of an improper aggravating element.  For example, what the jury was instructed to consider as an aggravating factor might have actually . . . militate[d] in favor of a lesser penalty, Zant, supra, at 885.  See supra, at 56.

        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-7" href="#ZO-7ref">

					</a>
						 This explains the footnote in Clemons v. Mississippi, supra, at 754, n. 5, on which Justice Breyer relies, see post, at 14.  That footnote addressed petitioners argument that the Mississippi Supreme Court had arbitrarily refused to order jury resentencing, even though it had done so in an earlier case, Johnson v. State, 511 So. 2d 1333 (1987), revd, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/486/578" class="subref" title="subref">486 U. S. 578</a> (1988)
, on remand, 547 So. 2d 59 (1989).  We distinguished the two cases, noting that in Johnson, the jury was permitted to consider inadmissible evidence in determining the defendants sentence, 494 U. S., at 754755, n. 5, whereas in Clemons, there is no serious suggestion that the States reliance on the [invalid] factor led to the introduction of any evidence that was not otherwise admissible in either the guilt or sentencing phases of the proceeding, id., at 755, n. 5.  The crux of this distinction is that the sentencers consideration of improper evidence is an error distinct from the one at issue here and in Clemons, to-wit, the jurys weighing in favor of death a factor that should not have been part of its calculus.

						 Justice Stevens argues that §190.3(a) may have affected the jurys deliberations in other ways, but we rejected each of these theories in Zant v. Stephens, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/462/862" class="subref" title="subref">462 U. S. 862</a> (1983)
.  The possibility that the jury would coun[t] the nature of the crime twice, post, at 2 (Stevens, J., dissenting), if it were instructed to consider both the facts of the crime and the eligibility circumstances was present in Zant.  The jury there was told it could take into account all relevant circumstances, but alsomuch like the jury herewas instructed to consider  any of [the] statutory aggravating circumstances [i.e., eligibility factors] which you find are supported by the evidence.   462 U. S., at 866.  Likewise, the jury in Zant might have give[n] greater weight, post, at 2 (Stevens, J., dissenting), to the facts underlying the eligibility circumstances, but we explicitly held that any such effect cannot fairly be regarded as a constitutional defect in the sentencing process, 462 U. S., at 889.  See infra, at 1112.

Since, it continued, the state courts had done neither, Sanders had been unconstitutionally deprived of an individualized death sentence.  373 F. 3d, at 1064.  We granted certiorari.  544 U.

				  Once the narrowing requirement has been satisfied, the sentencer is called upon to determine whether a defendant thus found eligible for the death penalty should in fact receive it.  Most States channel this function by specifying the aggravating factors (sometimes identical to the eligibility factors) that are to be weighed against mitigating considerations.  The issue in the line of cases we confront here is what happens when the sentencer imposes the death penalty after at least one valid eligibility factor has been found, but under a scheme in which an eligibility factor or a specified aggravating factor is later held to be invalid.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				To answer that question, our jurisprudence has distinguished between so-called weighing and non-weighing States.  The terminology is somewhat misleading, since we have held that in 
				<em>
					all 
				</em>
				capital cases the sentencer must be allowed to weigh the facts and circumstances that arguably justify a death sentence against the defendants mitigating evidence.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Eddings
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Oklahoma,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/455/104" class="subref" title="subref">455 U. S. 104</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">110</a> (1982)
.  The terminology was adopted, moreover, relatively early in the development of our death-penalty jurisprudence, when we were perhaps unaware of the great variety of forms that state capital-sentencing legislation would ultimately take.  We identified as weighing State[s] those in which the only aggravating factors permitted to be considered by the sentencer were the specified eligibility factors.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Parker
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Dugger
				</em>
				,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">47</a> (1992)
 (quoting Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §13703(E) (1989)).  Since the eligibility factors by definition identified distinct and particular aggravating features, if one of them was invalid the jury could not consider the facts and circumstances relevant to that factor as aggravating in some other capacityfor example, as relevant to an omnibus circumstances of the crime sentencing factor such as the one in the present case.  In a weighing State, therefore, the sentencers consideration of an invalid eligibility factor necessarily skewed its balancing of aggravators with mitigators, 
				<em>
					Stringer
				</em>
				, 503 U. S., at 232, and required reversal of the sentence (unless a state appellate court determined the error was harmless or reweighed the mitigating evidence against the valid aggravating factors), 
				<em>
					ibid
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				By contrast, in a non-weighing Statea State that permitted the sentencer to consider aggravating factors different from, or in addition to, the eligibility factorsthis automatic skewing would not necessarily occur.  It would never occur if the aggravating factors were entirely different from the eligibility factors.  Nor would it occur if the aggravating factors 
				<em>
					added
				</em>
				 to the eligibility factors a category (such as an omnibus circumstances of the crime factor, which is quite common) that would allow the very facts and circumstances relevant to the invalidated eligibility factor to be weighed in aggravation under a different rubric.  We therefore set forth different rules governing the consequences of an invalidated eligibility factor in a non-weighing State.

            </a>
				  The sentencers consideration of an invalid eligibility factor amounts to constitutional error in a non-weighing State in two situations.  First, due process requires a defendants death sentence to be set aside if the reason for the invalidity of the eligibility factor is that it authorizes a jury to draw adverse inferences from conduct that is constitutionally protected, or that it attache[s] the aggravating label to factors that are constitutionally impermissible or totally irrelevant to the sentencing process, … or to conduct that actually should militate in favor of a lesser penalty.  
				<em>
					Zant,
				</em>

				This weighing/non-weighing scheme is accurate as far as it goes, but it now seems to us needlessly complex and incapable of providing for the full range of possible variations.  For example, the same problem that gave rise to our weighing-State jurisprudence would arise if it were a sentencing factor, and 
				<em>
					not 
				</em>
				an eligibility factor, that was later found to be invalid.  The weighing process would just as clearly have been prima facie skewed, and skewed for the same basic reason: The sentencer might have given weight to a statutorily or constitutionally invalid aggravator.

				  And the prima facie skewing could in appropriate cases be shown to be illusory for the same reason that separates weighing States from non-weighing States: One of the

				In California, a defendant convicted of first-degree murder is eligible for the death penalty if the jury finds one of the special circumstances listed in Cal. Penal Code Ann. §190.2 (West Supp. 2005) to be true.  These are the eligibility factors designed to satisfy

				<em>
					.
				</em>
				  If the jury finds the existence of one of the special circumstances, it is instructed to take into account a 
				<em>
					separate
				</em>
				 list of sentencing factors describing aspects of the defendant and the crime.  Cal. Penal Code Ann. §190.3 (West 1999).  These sentencing factors include, as we have said, [t]he circumstances of the crime

				The Court of Appeals held that California is a weighing State because  the sentencer [is] restricted to a weighing of aggravation against mitigation and the sentencer [is] prevented from considering evidence in aggravation other than discrete, statutorily-defined factors.   373 F. 3d, at 1061 (brackets in original) (quoting

The circumstances of the crime factor can hardly be called discrete.  It has the effect of rendering all the specified factors nonexclusive, thus causing California to be (in our prior terminology) a non-weighing State.  Contrary to Sanders contention, and 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Stevens
				</span>
				 views in dissent, the mere fact that the sentencing factors included the existence of any special circumstances [eligibility factors] found to be true, Cal. Penal Code Ann. §190.3(a), did not make California a weighing State.  That fact was redundant for purposes of our weighing jurisprudence because it in no way narrowed the universe of aggravating facts the jury was entitled to consider in determining a sentence.

				  But leaving aside the weighing/non-weighing dichotomy and proceeding to the more direct analysis set forth earlier in this opinion: All of the aggravating facts and circumstances that the invalidated factor permitted the jury to consider were also open to their proper consideration under one of the other factors.  The erroneous factor could not have skewed the sentence, and no constitutional violation occurred.

				More specifically, Sanders jury found four special circumstances to be true: that [t]he murder was committed while the defendant was engaged in … Robbery, §190.2(a)(17)(A) (West Supp. 2005); that it was committed while the defendant was engaged in … Burglary in the first or second degree, §190.2(a)(17)(G); that [t]he victim [Allen] was a witness to a crime who was intentionally killed for the purpose of preventing … her testimony in any criminal … proceeding, §190.2(a)(10); and that [t]he murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel, §190.2(a)(14).  The California Supreme Court set aside the burglary-murder special circumstance under state merger law because the instructions permitted the jury to find a burglary (and thus the burglary-murder special circumstance) based on Sanders intent to commit assault, which is already an element of homicide, see

				<em>
					Furman
				</em>
				s narrowing requirement, and alone rendered Sanders eligible for the death penalty.  Moreover, the jurys consideration of the invalid eligibility factors in the weighing process did not produce constitutional error because all of the facts and circumstances admissible to establish the heinous, atrocious, or cruel and burglary-murder eligibility factors were also properly adduced as aggravating facts bearing upon the circumstances of the crime sentencing factor.

This instruction gave the facts underlying the eligibility factors special prominence.  Yet, even though one of the three factors (that the defendant had substantial history of serious assaultive convictions, 
				<em>

 Justice Breyer contends that harmless-error review applies in both weighing and non-weighing States.  See post, at 812 (dissenting opinion).  It would be strange indeed to discover at this late stage that our long-held distinction between the two sorts of States for purposes of reviewing invalid eligibility factors in fact made no difference.  Cf., e.g., Stringer v. Black, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/503/222" class="subref" title="subref">503 U. S. 222</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">232</a> (1992)
 (weighing/non-weighing distinction is of critical importance).  Not surprisingly, the Courts of Appeals have uniformly understood that different rules apply to weighing and non-weighing States, and that harmless-error review is necessary only in the former.  See, e.g., Sanders v. Woodford, 373 F. 3d 1054, 10591060 (CA9 2004); Flamer v. Delaware, 68 F. 3d 736, 746749 (CA3 1995); Williams v. Cain, 125 F. 3d 269, 281 (CA5 1997).


Our own cases, moreover, are flatly inconsistent with requiring harmless-error review in both types of States.  As Justice Breyer notes, post, at 8, Zant v. Stephens, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/462/862" class="subref" title="subref">462 U. S. 862</a> (1983)
, did endorse the Georgia Supreme Courts holding that attaching the statutory label aggravating to the invalid eligibility factor had an inconsequential impact on the jurys decision regarding the death penalty, id., at 889 (internal quotation marks omitted).  But the core holding is what we said next:  More importantly, … any possible impact cannot fairly be regarded as a constitutional defect in the sentencing process.  Ibid. (emphasis added); see also post, at 1112.  Zant must therefore be read not as holding that any constitutional error was harmless, but as rejecting respondents claim of constitutional error.


Neither Clemons v. Mississippi, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/494/738" class="subref" title="subref">494 U. S. 738</a> (1990)
, nor Stringer says anything to the contrary.  Justice Breyer points out that Clemons harmless-error discussion focused on the emphasis given to the invalid factor, rather than on the fact that Mississippi is a weighing State, but that is hardly relevant: Our discussion of how harmless-error analysis should be conducted (the issue in the passage from Clemons that Justice Breyer cites, 494 U. S., at 753754) says nothing about when that analysis should be conducted (the issue addressed by the weighing/non-weighing distinction).  On the latter question, Clemons maintains the distinction envisioned in Zant, see 462 U. S., at 890891, between Georgia (a non-weighing State) and Mississippi (a weighing State), see Clemons, supra, at 745.  Likewise, Stringer specifically distinguishes between non-weighing States, in which the fact that [the jury] also finds an invalid aggravating factor does not infect the formal process of deciding whether death is an appropriate penalty, 503 U. S., at 232, and weighing States, in which constitutional harmless-error analysis or reweighing at the trial or appellate level is required, ibid.

						 The fact that a sentencers consideration of an invalid eligibility factor in a non-weighing State may nonetheless amount to constitutional error explains Tuggles characterization of Zant as holding that a death sentence supported by multiple aggravating circumstances need not always be set aside if one aggravator is found to be invalid, 516 U. S., at 11 (emphasis added); cf. post, at 12 (Breyer, J., dissenting), as well as our related comment in Clemons that, [i]n a [non-weighing] State like Georgia, . . . the invalidation of one aggravating circumstance does not necessarily require an appellate court to vacate a death sentence and remand to a jury, 494 U. S., at 745 (emphasis added); cf. post, at 1415 (Breyer, J., dissenting).

						 This very problem may have been present in Stringer v. Black, supra.  There, although the Mississippi courts invalidated an aggravating circumstancewhether the murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel, Miss. Code Ann. §9919101(h) (1993 Cum. Supp.)that was not one of the specified eligibility factors, see §97319(2) (1994), we nonetheless treated Mississippi as a weighing State.  Since, however, Mississippi law provided that the jury could not impose a death sentence unless it found the existence of at least one statutory aggravating factor, see §9919101(3)(b) (1993 Cum. Supp.), it could be argued that the additional aggravating factors were converted into de facto eligibility factors.

						 There may be other distortions caused by the invalidated factor beyond the mere addition of an improper aggravating element.  For example, what the jury was instructed to consider as an aggravating factor might have actually . . . militate[d] in favor of a lesser penalty, Zant, supra, at 885.  See supra, at 56.

						 This explains the footnote in Clemons v. Mississippi, supra, at 754, n. 5, on which Justice Breyer relies, see post, at 14.  That footnote addressed petitioners argument that the Mississippi Supreme Court had arbitrarily refused to order jury resentencing, even though it had done so in an earlier case, Johnson v. State, 511 So. 2d 1333 (1987), revd, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/486/578" class="subref" title="subref">486 U. S. 578</a> (1988)
, on remand, 547 So. 2d 59 (1989).  We distinguished the two cases, noting that in Johnson, the jury was permitted to consider inadmissible evidence in determining the defendants sentence, 494 U. S., at 754755, n. 5, whereas in Clemons, there is no serious suggestion that the States reliance on the [invalid] factor led to the introduction of any evidence that was not otherwise admissible in either the guilt or sentencing phases of the proceeding, id., at 755, n. 5.  The crux of this distinction is that the sentencers consideration of improper evidence is an error distinct from the one at issue here and in Clemons, to-wit, the jurys weighing in favor of death a factor that should not have been part of its calculus.

						 Justice Stevens argues that §190.3(a) may have affected the jurys deliberations in other ways, but we rejected each of these theories in Zant v. Stephens, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/462/862" class="subref" title="subref">462 U. S. 862</a> (1983)
.  The possibility that the jury would coun[t] the nature of the crime twice, post, at 2 (Stevens, J., dissenting), if it were instructed to consider both the facts of the crime and the eligibility circumstances was present in Zant.  The jury there was told it could take into account all relevant circumstances, but alsomuch like the jury herewas instructed to consider  any of [the] statutory aggravating circumstances [i.e., eligibility factors] which you find are supported by the evidence.   462 U. S., at 866.  Likewise, the jury in Zant might have give[n] greater weight, post, at 2 (Stevens, J., dissenting), to the facts underlying the eligibility circumstances, but we explicitly held that any such effect cannot fairly be regarded as a constitutional defect in the sentencing process, 462 U. S., at 889.  See infra, at 1112.

				Our prior cases have drawn a simple categorical distinction between a nonweighing State and a weighing State.  In the former, the sole function of an aggravating circumstance finding is to make the defendant eligible for the death penalty.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Zant
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Stephens
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/462/862" class="subref" title="subref">462 U. S. 862</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">874</a> (1983)
 ([I]n Georgia, the finding of an aggravating circumstance does not play any role in guiding the sentencing body in the exercise of its discretion [to impose the death penalty], apart from its function of narrowing the class of persons convicted of murder who are eligible for the death penalty).  In the latter, such a finding performs a second functionit provides a reason for deciding to impose that sentence on an eligible defendant.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g., Clemons 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					Mississippi
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/494/738" class="subref" title="subref">494 U. S. 738</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">745</a> (1990)
 (In Mississippi, unlike the Georgia scheme considered in 
				<em>
					Zant
				</em>
				, the finding of aggravating factors is part of the jurys sentencing determination, and the jury is required to weigh any mitigating factors against the aggravating circumstances). 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Thus, in a nonweighing State, the finding of four aggravating circumstances has the same legal significance as a finding of three, and invalidation of one is presumptively harmless.  See 
				<em>
					Stringer
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Black
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/503/222" class="subref" title="subref">503 U. S. 222</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">232</a> (1992)
 (In a nonweighing State, so long as the sentencing body finds at least one valid aggravating factor, the fact that it also finds an invalid aggravating factor does not infect the formal process of deciding whether death is an appropriate penalty).  By contrast, when a jury is told to weigh aggravating circumstances against mitigating evidence in making its penalty decision, four aggravators presumptively are more weighty than three.  See 
				<em>
					ibid.
				</em>
				 ([W]hen the sentencing body is told to weigh an invalid factor in its decision, a reviewing court may not assume it would have made no difference if the thumb had been removed from deaths side of the scale).  For example, when a jury, as here, is incorrectly informed that its finding that a killing was heinous, atrocious, or cruel provides a reason for imposing death, see generally Cal. Penal Code Ann. §190.2(a)(14) (West Supp. 2005), that error may well affect the jurys deliberations.  Having been told to weigh [t]he circumstances of the crime … 
				<em>
					and
				</em>
				 the existence of any [aggravating] circumstances found to be true, §190.3(a) (West 1999) (emphasis added), the jury may consider its conclusion that the killing was heinous separately from the circumstances of the crime underlying that erroneous conclusion, improperly counting the nature of the crime twice in determining whether a sentence of death is warranted.  Or the jury, recognizing that the legislature has decided that a heinous, atrocious, or cruel murder, without more, can be worthy of the death penalty, may consider this a legislative imprimatur on a decision to impose death and therefore give greater weight to its improper heinousness finding than the circumstances of the crime would otherwise dictate.
				 
				 Under either scenario a weight has been added to deaths side of the scale, and one cannot presume that this weight made no difference to the jurys ultimate conclusion. 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				There are, of course, different weighing systems.  If a jury is told that only those specific aggravating circumstances making the defendant eligible for the death penalty may provide reasons for imposing that penalty, its consideration of an invalid factor is obviously more prejudicial than if the jury is told that it may also consider all of the circumstances of the crime.  The fact that California sentencing juries may consider these circumstances increases the likelihood that their consideration of a subsequently invalidated aggravating circumstance will be harmless, but it does not take California out of the weighing State category.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The majority, however, has decided to convert the weighing/nonweighing distinction from one focused on the 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

role aggravating circumstances play in a jurys sentencing deliberations to one focused on the evidence the jury may consider during those deliberations. Compare 
				<em>
					Stringer
				</em>
				, 503 U. S., at 229 (explaining that Mississippi is a weighing State because the jury must weigh aggravating circumstances against mitigating evidence in choosing whether to impose the death penalty, while Georgia is a nonweighing State because aggravating factors as such have no specific function in [that] decision), with 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 78 (An invalidated sentencing factor (whether an eligibility factor or not) will render the sentence unconstitutional by reason of its adding an improper element to the aggravation scale in the weighing process 
				<em>
					unless
				</em>
				 one of the other sentencing factors enables the sentencer to give aggravating weight to the same facts and circumstances (footnote omitted)).  But whether an aggravating circumstance finding plays a role in the jurys decision to impose the death penalty has nothing to do with whether the jury may separately consider all the circumstances of the crime. 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In this case, if the question had been presented to us, I might well have concluded that the error here was harmless.  See generally

But the State has merely asked us to decide whether California is a weighing State, see Pet. for Cert. i, and the Court of Appeals correctly decided that the statutory text has unambiguously answered that question.  Cf. §190.3 (enumerating aggravating and mitigating circumstances and requiring the trier of fact [to] impose a sentence of death if [it] concludes that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances).

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Instead of heeding this plain language, the Court has chosen to modify our settled law, ignoring the dual role played by aggravating circumstances in Californias death penalty regime.  Because this decision is more likely to complicate than to clarify our capital sentencing jurisprudence, I respectfully dissent.

				Our prior cases have drawn a simple categorical distinction between a nonweighing State and a weighing State.  In the former, the sole function of an aggravating circumstance finding is to make the defendant eligible for the death penalty.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Zant
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Stephens
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/462/862" class="subref" title="subref">462 U. S. 862</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">874</a> (1983)
 ([I]n Georgia, the finding of an aggravating circumstance does not play any role in guiding the sentencing body in the exercise of its discretion [to impose the death penalty], apart from its function of narrowing the class of persons convicted of murder who are eligible for the death penalty).  In the latter, such a finding performs a second functionit provides a reason for deciding to impose that sentence on an eligible defendant.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g., Clemons 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					Mississippi
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/494/738" class="subref" title="subref">494 U. S. 738</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">745</a> (1990)
 (In Mississippi, unlike the Georgia scheme considered in 
				<em>
					Zant
				</em>
				, the finding of aggravating factors is part of the jurys sentencing determination, and the jury is required to weigh any mitigating factors against the aggravating circumstances). 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Thus, in a nonweighing State, the finding of four aggravating circumstances has the same legal significance as a finding of three, and invalidation of one is presumptively harmless.  See 
				<em>
					Stringer
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Black
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/503/222" class="subref" title="subref">503 U. S. 222</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">232</a> (1992)
 (In a nonweighing State, so long as the sentencing body finds at least one valid aggravating factor, the fact that it also finds an invalid aggravating factor does not infect the formal process of deciding whether death is an appropriate penalty).  By contrast, when a jury is told to weigh aggravating circumstances against mitigating evidence in making its penalty decision, four aggravators presumptively are more weighty than three.  See 
				<em>
					ibid.
				</em>
				 ([W]hen the sentencing body is told to weigh an invalid factor in its decision, a reviewing court may not assume it would have made no difference if the thumb had been removed from deaths side of the scale).  For example, when a jury, as here, is incorrectly informed that its finding that a killing was heinous, atrocious, or cruel provides a reason for imposing death, see generally Cal. Penal Code Ann. §190.2(a)(14) (West Supp. 2005), that error may well affect the jurys deliberations.  Having been told to weigh [t]he circumstances of the crime … 
				<em>
					and
				</em>
				 the existence of any [aggravating] circumstances found to be true, §190.3(a) (West 1999) (emphasis added), the jury may consider its conclusion that the killing was heinous separately from the circumstances of the crime underlying that erroneous conclusion, improperly counting the nature of the crime twice in determining whether a sentence of death is warranted.  Or the jury, recognizing that the legislature has decided that a heinous, atrocious, or cruel murder, without more, can be worthy of the death penalty, may consider this a legislative imprimatur on a decision to impose death and therefore give greater weight to its improper heinousness finding than the circumstances of the crime would otherwise dictate.
				 
				 Under either scenario a weight has been added to deaths side of the scale, and one cannot presume that this weight made no difference to the jurys ultimate conclusion. 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				There are, of course, different weighing systems.  If a jury is told that only those specific aggravating circumstances making the defendant eligible for the death penalty may provide reasons for imposing that penalty, its consideration of an invalid factor is obviously more prejudicial than if the jury is told that it may also consider all of the circumstances of the crime.  The fact that California sentencing juries may consider these circumstances increases the likelihood that their consideration of a subsequently invalidated aggravating circumstance will be harmless, but it does not take California out of the weighing State category.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The majority, however, has decided to convert the weighing/nonweighing distinction from one focused on the 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

role aggravating circumstances play in a jurys sentencing deliberations to one focused on the evidence the jury may consider during those deliberations. Compare 
				<em>
					Stringer
				</em>
				, 503 U. S., at 229 (explaining that Mississippi is a weighing State because the jury must weigh aggravating circumstances against mitigating evidence in choosing whether to impose the death penalty, while Georgia is a nonweighing State because aggravating factors as such have no specific function in [that] decision), with 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 78 (An invalidated sentencing factor (whether an eligibility factor or not) will render the sentence unconstitutional by reason of its adding an improper element to the aggravation scale in the weighing process 
				<em>
					unless
				</em>
				 one of the other sentencing factors enables the sentencer to give aggravating weight to the same facts and circumstances (footnote omitted)).  But whether an aggravating circumstance finding plays a role in the jurys decision to impose the death penalty has nothing to do with whether the jury may separately consider all the circumstances of the crime. 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In this case, if the question had been presented to us, I might well have concluded that the error here was harmless.  See generally 
				<em>

					Abrahamson

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">638</a> (1993)
.  But the State has merely asked us to decide whether California is a weighing State, see Pet. for Cert. i, and the Court of Appeals correctly decided that the statutory text has unambiguously answered that question.  Cf. §190.3 (enumerating aggravating and mitigating circumstances and requiring the trier of fact [to] impose a sentence of death if [it] concludes that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances). 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Instead of heeding this plain language, the Court has chosen to modify our settled law, ignoring the dual role played by aggravating circumstances in Californias death penalty regime.  Because this decision is more likely to complicate than to clarify our capital sentencing jurisprudence, I respectfully dissent.

 (In a nonweighing State, so long as the sentencing body finds at least one valid aggravating factor, the fact that it also finds an invalid aggravating factor does not infect the formal process of deciding whether death is an appropriate penalty).  By contrast, when a jury is told to weigh aggravating circumstances against mitigating evidence in making its penalty decision, four aggravators presumptively are more weighty than three.  See

				 ([W]hen the sentencing body is told to weigh an invalid factor in its decision, a reviewing court may not assume it would have made no difference if the thumb had been removed from deaths side of the scale).  For example, when a jury, as here, is incorrectly informed that its finding that a killing was heinous, atrocious, or cruel provides a reason for imposing death, see generally Cal. Penal Code Ann. §190.2(a)(14) (West Supp. 2005), that error may well affect the jurys deliberations.  Having been told to weigh [t]he circumstances of the crime … 
				<em>
					and
				</em>
				 the existence of any [aggravating] circumstances found to be true, §190.3(a) (West 1999) (emphasis added), the jury may consider its conclusion that the killing was heinous separately from the circumstances of the crime underlying that erroneous conclusion, improperly counting the nature of the crime twice in determining whether a sentence of death is warranted.  Or the jury, recognizing that the legislature has decided that a heinous, atrocious, or cruel murder, without more, can be worthy of the death penalty, may consider this a legislative imprimatur on a decision to impose death and therefore give greater weight to its improper heinousness finding than the circumstances of the crime would otherwise dictate.
				 
				 Under either scenario a weight has been added to deaths side of the scale, and one cannot presume that this weight made no difference to the jurys ultimate conclusion.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				There are, of course, different weighing systems.  If a jury is told that only those specific aggravating circumstances making the defendant eligible for the death penalty may provide reasons for imposing that penalty, its consideration of an invalid factor is obviously more prejudicial than if the jury is told that it may also consider all of the circumstances of the crime.  The fact that California sentencing juries may consider these circumstances increases the likelihood that their consideration of a subsequently invalidated aggravating circumstance will be harmless, but it does not take California out of the weighing State category.

				Our prior cases have drawn a simple categorical distinction between a nonweighing State and a weighing State.  In the former, the sole function of an aggravating circumstance finding is to make the defendant eligible for the death penalty.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Zant
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Stephens
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/462/862" class="subref" title="subref">462 U. S. 862</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">874</a> (1983)
 ([I]n Georgia, the finding of an aggravating circumstance does not play any role in guiding the sentencing body in the exercise of its discretion [to impose the death penalty], apart from its function of narrowing the class of persons convicted of murder who are eligible for the death penalty).  In the latter, such a finding performs a second functionit provides a reason for deciding to impose that sentence on an eligible defendant.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g., Clemons 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					Mississippi
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/494/738" class="subref" title="subref">494 U. S. 738</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">745</a> (1990)
 (In Mississippi, unlike the Georgia scheme considered in 
				<em>
					Zant
				</em>
				, the finding of aggravating factors is part of the jurys sentencing determination, and the jury is required to weigh any mitigating factors against the aggravating circumstances). 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Thus, in a nonweighing State, the finding of four aggravating circumstances has the same legal significance as a finding of three, and invalidation of one is presumptively harmless.  See 
				<em>
					Stringer
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Black
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/503/222" class="subref" title="subref">503 U. S. 222</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">232</a> (1992)
 (In a nonweighing State, so long as the sentencing body finds at least one valid aggravating factor, the fact that it also finds an invalid aggravating factor does not infect the formal process of deciding whether death is an appropriate penalty).  By contrast, when a jury is told to weigh aggravating circumstances against mitigating evidence in making its penalty decision, four aggravators presumptively are more weighty than three.  See 
				<em>
					ibid.
				</em>
				 ([W]hen the sentencing body is told to weigh an invalid factor in its decision, a reviewing court may not assume it would have made no difference if the thumb had been removed from deaths side of the scale).  For example, when a jury, as here, is incorrectly informed that its finding that a killing was heinous, atrocious, or cruel provides a reason for imposing death, see generally Cal. Penal Code Ann. §190.2(a)(14) (West Supp. 2005), that error may well affect the jurys deliberations.  Having been told to weigh [t]he circumstances of the crime … 
				<em>
					and
				</em>
				 the existence of any [aggravating] circumstances found to be true, §190.3(a) (West 1999) (emphasis added), the jury may consider its conclusion that the killing was heinous separately from the circumstances of the crime underlying that erroneous conclusion, improperly counting the nature of the crime twice in determining whether a sentence of death is warranted.  Or the jury, recognizing that the legislature has decided that a heinous, atrocious, or cruel murder, without more, can be worthy of the death penalty, may consider this a legislative imprimatur on a decision to impose death and therefore give greater weight to its improper heinousness finding than the circumstances of the crime would otherwise dictate.
				 
				 Under either scenario a weight has been added to deaths side of the scale, and one cannot presume that this weight made no difference to the jurys ultimate conclusion. 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				There are, of course, different weighing systems.  If a jury is told that only those specific aggravating circumstances making the defendant eligible for the death penalty may provide reasons for imposing that penalty, its consideration of an invalid factor is obviously more prejudicial than if the jury is told that it may also consider all of the circumstances of the crime.  The fact that California sentencing juries may consider these circumstances increases the likelihood that their consideration of a subsequently invalidated aggravating circumstance will be harmless, but it does not take California out of the weighing State category.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The majority, however, has decided to convert the weighing/nonweighing distinction from one focused on the 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

role aggravating circumstances play in a jurys sentencing deliberations to one focused on the evidence the jury may consider during those deliberations. Compare 
				<em>
					Stringer
				</em>
				, 503 U. S., at 229 (explaining that Mississippi is a weighing State because the jury must weigh aggravating circumstances against mitigating evidence in choosing whether to impose the death penalty, while Georgia is a nonweighing State because aggravating factors as such have no specific function in [that] decision), with 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 78 (An invalidated sentencing factor (whether an eligibility factor or not) will render the sentence unconstitutional by reason of its adding an improper element to the aggravation scale in the weighing process 
				<em>
					unless
				</em>
				 one of the other sentencing factors enables the sentencer to give aggravating weight to the same facts and circumstances (footnote omitted)).  But whether an aggravating circumstance finding plays a role in the jurys decision to impose the death penalty has nothing to do with whether the jury may separately consider all the circumstances of the crime. 

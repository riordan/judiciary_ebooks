						 The harassment alleged in this case occurred intermittently over a 5-year period between 1985 and 1990; the District Courts factual findings do not indicate when in 1990 it ceased.  It was only in March 1990 that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) issued a policy statement enjoining employers to establish complaint procedures for sexual harassment.  See ante, at 28.  The 1980 Guideline on which the Court reliesbecause the EEOC has no substantive rulemaking authority under Title VII, the Court is inaccurate to refer to it as a regulation, see ante, at 32,was wholly precatory and as such cannot establish negligence per se.  See

						 The harassment alleged in this case occurred intermittently over a 5-year period between 1985 and 1990; the District Courts factual findings do not indicate when in 1990 it ceased.

The 1980 Guideline on which the Court reliesbecause the EEOC has no substantive rulemaking authority under Title VII, the Court is inaccurate to refer to it as a regulation, see ante, at 32,was wholly precatory and as such cannot establish negligence per se.

						 The harassment alleged in this case occurred intermittently over a 5-year period between 1985 and 1990; the District Courts factual findings do not indicate when in 1990 it ceased.  It was only in March 1990 that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) issued a policy statement enjoining employers to establish complaint procedures for sexual harassment.  See ante, at 28.  The 1980 Guideline on which the Court reliesbecause the EEOC has no substantive rulemaking authority under Title VII, the Court is inaccurate to refer to it as a regulation, see ante, at 32,was wholly precatory and as such cannot establish negligence per se.

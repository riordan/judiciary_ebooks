, we reviewed a challenge to an Arkansas law that prohibited the name of an otherwise eligible candidate for the United States Congress from appearing on the general election ballot if he or she had already served three terms in the House of Representatives or two terms in the Senate.  We held that the ballot restriction was an indirect attempt to impose term limits on congressional incumbents that violated the Qualifications Clauses in Article I of the Constitution rather than a permissible exercise of the States power to regulate the Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives within the meaning of Article I, §4, cl. 1.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The District Court decided the case on the pleadings, granting Gralikes motion for summary judgment.  The court first held that Article VIII contravened the Qualifications Clauses of Article I of the Federal Constitution because it has the sole purpose of creating additional qualifications for Congress indirectly and has the likely effect of handicapping a class of candidates for Congress. 996 F. Supp. 917, 920 (1998); see 996 F. Supp. 901, 905
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				909 (1998).  The court further held that Article VIII places an impermissible burden on the candidates 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> right to speak freely on the issue of term limits by punish[ing] candidates for speaking out against term limits through putting negative words next to their names on the ballot, and by us[ing] the threat of being disadvantaged in the election to coerce candidates into taking a position on the term limits issue.  996 F. Supp., at 910; see 996 F. Supp., at 920.  Lastly, the court found Article VIII to be an indirect and unconstitutional attempt by the people of Missouri to interject themselves into the amending process authorized by Article V of the Federal Constitution.  In doing so, the court endorsed the reasoning of other decisions invalidating provisions similar to Article VIII on the ground that negative ballot designations place an undue influence on the legislator to vote in favor of term limits rather than exercise his or her own independent judgment as is contemplated by Article V.  996 F. Supp., at 916; see 996 F. Supp., at 920.

				  Like the District Court, it found that Article VIII threatens a penalty that is serious enough to compel candidates to speakthe potential political damage of the ballot labels; seeks to impose an additional qualification for candidacy for Congress and does so in a manner which is highly likely to handicap term limit opponents and other labeled candidates; and coerce[s] legislators into proposing or ratifying a particular constitutional amendment in violation of Article V

				  191 F. 3d 911, 918, 924, 925 (1999).  The Court of Appeals also observed that, contrary to the Speech or Debate Clause in Art. I, §6, cl. 1, of the Federal Constitution, Article VIII establishes a regime in which a state officerthe secretary of stateis permitted to judge and punish Members of Congress for their legislative actions or positions.  191 F. 3d., at 922.

				Article VIII furthers the States interest in adding a  term limits amendment to the Federal Constitution in two ways.  It encourages Missouris congressional delegation to support such an amendment in order to avoid an unfavorable ballot designation when running for reelection.  And it encourages the election of representatives who favor such an amendment.  Petitioner argues that Article VIII is an exercise of the right of the people to instruct their representatives reserved by the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentx" class="subref" title="subref">Tenth Amendment</a>,

				 and that it is a permissible regulation of the manner of electing federal legislators within the authority delegated to the States by the Elections Clause, Art. I, §4, cl. 1.

            </a>
				   Because these two arguments rely on different sources of state power, it is appropriate at the outset to review the distinction in kind between powers reserved to the States and those delegated to the States by the Constitution.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				As we discussed at length in 
				<em>
					U. S. Term Limits
				</em>
				, the Constitution draws a basic distinction between the powers of the newly created Federal Government and the powers retained by the pre-existing sovereign States.  514 U. S., at 801.  On the one hand, in the words of Chief Justice Marshall, it was neither necessary nor proper to define the powers retained by the States.  These powers proceed, not from the people of America, but from the people of the several States; and remain, after the adoption of the constitution, what they were before, except so far as they may be abridged by that instrument.

				 4 Wheat. 122, 193 (1819).  The text of the

        <p class="bodytext">
				

The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				On the other hand, as Justice Story observed, the states can exercise no powers whatsoever, which exclusively spring out of the existence of the national government, which the constitution did not delegate to them.  1 Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States §627 (3d ed. 1858) (hereinafter Story).

				To be persuasive, petitioners argument that Article VIII is a valid exercise of the States reserved power to give binding instructions to its representatives would have to overcome three hurdles.  First, the historical precedents on which she relies for the proposition that the States have such a reserved power are distinguishable.  Second, there is countervailing historical evidence.  Third, and of decisive significance, the means employed to issue the instructions, ballots for congressional elections, are unacceptable unless Article VIII is a permissible exercise of the States power to regulate the manner of holding elections for Senators and Representatives.  Only a brief comment on the first two points is necessary.

				Petitioner relies heavily on the part instructions played in the Second Continental Congress, the Constitutional Convention, the early Congress, the selection of United States Senators before the passage of the

				  At best, as an

				  This evidence falls short of demonstrating that either the people or the States had a right to give legally binding, 
				<em>
					i.e

				., nonadvisory, instructions to their representatives that the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentx" class="subref" title="subref">Tenth Amendment</a> reserved, much less that such a right would apply to federal representatives.  See

				Indeed, contrary evidence is provided by the fact that the First Congress rejected a proposal to insert a right of the people to instruct their representatives into what would become the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.  1 Annals of Cong. 732 (1789).  The fact that the proposal was made suggests that its proponents thought it necessary, and the fact that it was rejected by a vote of 41 to 10, 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 747, suggests that we should give weight to the views of those who opposed the proposal.  It was their view that binding instructions would undermine an essential attribute of Congress by eviscerating the deliberative nature of that National Assembly.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g
				</em>
				.,

Sherman) ([W]hen the people have chosen a representative, it is his duty to meet others from the different parts of the Union, and consult, and agree with them to such acts as are for the general benefit of the whole community.  If they were to be guided by instructions, there would be no use in deliberation; all that a man would have to do, would be to produce his instructions, and lay them on the table, and let them speak for him).  As a result, James Madison, then a Representative from Virginia, concluded that a right to issue binding instructions would run the risk of losing the whole system.

 (It cannot be doubted that these comprehensive words embrace authority to provide a complete code for congressional elections).  Nevertheless, Article VIII falls outside of that grant of authority.  As we made clear in 
				<em>
					U. S. Term Limits
				</em>
				, the Framers understood the Elections Clause as a grant of authority to issue procedural regulations, and not as a source of power to dictate electoral outcomes, to favor or disfavor a class of candidates, or to evade important constitutional restraints.  514 U.

It does not regulate the time of elections; it does not regulate the place of elections; nor, we believe, does it regulate the manner of elections.

				  As to the last point, Article VIII bears no relation to the manner of elections as we understand it, for in our commonsense view that term encompasses matters like notices, registration, supervision of voting, protection of voters, prevention of fraud and corrupt practices, counting of votes, duties of inspectors and canvassers, and making and publication of election returns.

It also attaches a concrete consequence to noncompliancethe printing of the statement DISREGARDED VOTERS INSTRUCTIONS ON TERM LIMITS by the candidates name on all primary and general election ballots.  Likewise, a nonincumbent candidate who does not pledge to follow the instruction receives the ballot designation DECLINED TO PLEDGE TO SUPPORT TERM LIMITS.

In describing the two labels, the courts below have employed terms such as pejorative, negative, derogatory,  intentionally intimidating,  particularly harmful, politically damaging, a serious sanction, a penalty, and official denunciation.  191 F. 3d, at 918, 919, 922, 925; 996 F.

They convey the substantial political risk the ballot labels impose on current and prospective congressional members who, for one reason or another, fail to comply with the conditions set forth in Article VIII for passing its term limits amendment.

.  At the same time, by directing the citizens attention to the single consideration of the candidates fidelity to term limits, the labels imply that the issue is an importantperhaps paramountconsideration in the citizens choice, which may decisively influence the citizen to cast his ballot against candidates branded as unfaithful.

Congressional Term Limits Amendment


(a)No person shall serve in the office of United States Representative for more than three terms, but upon ratification of this amendment no person who has held the office of the United States Representative or who then holds the office shall serve for more than two additional terms.

(a)fails to vote in favor of the proposed Congressional Term Limits Amendment set forth above when brought to a vote or;


(b)fails to second the proposed Congressional Term Limits Amendment set forth above if it lacks for a second before any proceeding of the legislative body or;

						 Section 19(5) permits a voter to appeal to the Missouri Supreme Court a determination that a statement should not be placed next to a candidates name, and §19(6) allows a candidate to appeal to the States highest court a determination that such a statement should be printed.  In either case, clear and convincing evidence is required to demonstrate that the statement does not belong on the ballot adjacent to the candidates name.


The remainder of Article VIII provides for automatic repeal of the Article should the specified Congressional Term Limits Amendment be ratified, §20; exclusive jurisdiction of challenges to the Amendment in the Supreme Court of Missouri, §21; and severance of any portion, clause, or phrase of Article VIII that is declared invalid, §22.

						 Of course, whether the members of a representative assembly should be bound by the views of their constituents, or by their own judgment, is a matter that has been the subject of debate since even before the Federal Union was established.  For instance, in his classic speech to the electors of Bristol, Edmund Burke set forth the latter view:


To deliver an opinion is the right of all men; that of constituents is a weighty and respectable opinion, which a representative ought always to rejoice to hear; and which he ought always most seriously to consider.  But authoritative instructions; mandates issued, which the member is bound blindly and implicitly to obey, to vote, and to argue for, though contrary to the clearest conviction of his judgment and conscience, these are things utterly unknown to the laws of this land, and which arise from a fundamental mistake of the whole order and tenor of our constitution.  The Speeches of the Right Hon. Edmund Burke 130 (J. Burke ed. 1867).

						 That much, apparently, also seemed clear to many Members of Congress operating under Article VIII or similar label laws adopted by other States, who consequently tailored their behavior to avoid the ballot designations.  For example, in 1997, the House of Representatives voted on 11 different proposals to adopt a term limits amendment to the Constitution; 7 of those proposals were dictated by voter initiatives in 7 different States.  Representative Blunt of Missouri introduced the Article VIII version to ensure that members of the Missouri delegation have the ability to vote for language that meets a verbatim test of [the] Missouri Amendment and thereby avoid the scarlet letter provision.  143 Cong. Rec. H494 (Feb. 12, 1997).  However, because each of the state initiatives provided a sanction similar to the ballot labels included in Article VIII, some Representatives explained that they were constrained to vote only for the version endorsed by the voters of their States, and to vote against differing versions proposed by congressional members from other States, even though they were supportive of term limits generally.  See, e.g., id., at H486 (remarks of Rep. Hutchinson) (I will vote against the bill of the gentleman from Florida [Mr. McCollum], not because I am opposed to term limits but because this particular resolution does not comply with the term limit instructions approved by the voters and the people of Arkansas); id., at H490 (remarks of Rep. Crapo) (Last Congress I supported the McCollum term limits bill that, as I said, supported a 12-year term limit.  However, in this Congress I must oppose this bill because of the initiative passed by the people of the State of Idaho which requires me to oppose any term limits measure that does not have the same set of term limit conditions that are included in the initiative that was passed in the State).  As Representative Frank of Massachusetts put it, [e]very States Members get to vote on their States term limits so they make them feel better and they do not get the scarlet letter.  Id., at H487.  Consequently, the most popular proposal for such an amendment, that of Representative McCollum of Florida, received 217 votes, 10 fewer than it had in the preceding Congress.  Id., at H511.  As for the Missouri version, it suffered a 353-to-72 defeat.  Id., at H497.

						 At the margins, the parties have fought over whether the Elections Clause is even applicable because it is a grant of power to each State by the Legislature thereof and Article VIII is the product of referendum.  Compare Brief for Petitioner 38, n. 46, with Brief for Respondents 1213, n. 8.  Of course, [w]henever the term legislature is used in the Constitution, it is necessary to consider the nature of the particular action in view. Smiley v. Holm, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/285/355" class="subref" title="subref">285 U. S. 355</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">366</a> (1932)
.  Nevertheless, we need not delve into this inquiry, as it is clear, for the reasons stated in the text, that Article VIII is not authorized by the Elections Clause.


In discussing the Elections Clause issue, respondents have also relied in part on 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> cases upholding time, place, and manner regulations of speech.  Brief for Respondents 1314.  Although the Elections Clause uses the same phrase as that branch of our 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> jurisprudence, it by no means follows that such cases have any relevance to our disposition of this case.

, we reviewed a challenge to an Arkansas law that prohibited the name of an otherwise eligible candidate for the United States Congress from appearing on the general election ballot if he or she had already served three terms in the House of Representatives or two terms in the Senate.  We held that the ballot restriction was an indirect attempt to impose term limits on congressional incumbents that violated the Qualifications Clauses in Article I of the Constitution rather than a permissible exercise of the States power to regulate the Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives within the meaning of Article I, §4, cl. 1.

				The District Court decided the case on the pleadings, granting Gralikes motion for summary judgment.

Supp., at 910; see 996 F. Supp., at 920.  Lastly, the court found Article VIII to be an indirect and unconstitutional attempt by the people of Missouri to interject themselves into the amending process authorized by Article V of the Federal Constitution.  In doing so, the court endorsed the reasoning of other decisions invalidating provisions similar to Article VIII on the ground that negative ballot designations place an undue influence on the legislator to vote in favor of term limits rather than exercise his or her own independent judgment as is contemplated by Article V.  996 F. Supp., at 916; see 996 F. Supp., at 920.

				Article VIII furthers the States interest in adding a  term limits amendment to the Federal Constitution in two ways.  It encourages Missouris congressional delegation to support such an amendment in order to avoid an unfavorable ballot designation when running for reelection.  And it encourages the election of representatives who favor such an amendment.  Petitioner argues that Article VIII is an exercise of the right of the people to instruct their representatives reserved by the

				   Because these two arguments rely on different sources of state power, it is appropriate at the outset to review the distinction in kind between powers reserved to the States and those delegated to the States by the Constitution.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				As we discussed at length in 
				<em>
					U. S. Term Limits
				</em>
				, the Constitution draws a basic distinction between the powers of the newly created Federal Government and the powers retained by the pre-existing sovereign States.  514 U. S., at 801.  On the one hand, in the words of Chief Justice Marshall, it was neither necessary nor proper to define the powers retained by the States.  These powers proceed, not from the people of America, but from the people of the several States; and remain, after the adoption of the constitution, what they were before, except so far as they may be abridged by that instrument.

				On the other hand, as Justice Story observed, the states can exercise no powers whatsoever, which exclusively spring out of the existence of the national government, which the constitution did not delegate to them.  1 Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States §627 (3d ed. 1858) (hereinafter Story).

				To be persuasive, petitioners argument that Article VIII is a valid exercise of the States reserved power to give binding instructions to its representatives would have to overcome three hurdles.  First, the historical precedents on which she relies for the proposition that the States have such a reserved power are distinguishable.  Second, there is countervailing historical evidence.  Third, and of decisive significance, the means employed to issue the instructions, ballots for congressional elections, are unacceptable unless Article VIII is a permissible exercise of the States power to regulate the manner of holding elections for Senators and Representatives.  Only a brief comment on the first two points is necessary.

If they were to be guided by instructions, there would be no use in deliberation; all that a man would have to do, would be to produce his instructions, and lay them on the table, and let them speak for him).  As a result, James Madison, then a Representative from Virginia, concluded that a right to issue binding instructions would run the risk of losing the whole system.

 (It cannot be doubted that these comprehensive words embrace authority to provide a complete code for congressional elections).  Nevertheless, Article VIII falls outside of that grant of authority.  As we made clear in 
				<em>

				, the Framers understood the Elections Clause as a grant of authority to issue procedural regulations, and not as a source of power to dictate electoral outcomes, to favor or disfavor a class of candidates, or to evade important constitutional restraints.  514 U.

				  As to the last point, Article VIII bears no relation to the manner of elections as we understand it, for in our commonsense view that term encompasses matters like notices, registration, supervision of voting, protection of voters, prevention of fraud and corrupt practices, counting of votes, duties of inspectors and canvassers, and making and publication of election returns.

As noted, the state provision does not just instruct each member of Missouris congressional delegation to promote in certain ways the passage of the specified term limits amendment.  It also attaches a concrete consequence to noncompliancethe printing of the statement DISREGARDED VOTERS INSTRUCTIONS ON TERM LIMITS by the candidates name on all primary and general election ballots.  Likewise, a nonincumbent candidate who does not pledge to follow the instruction receives the ballot designation DECLINED TO PLEDGE TO SUPPORT TERM LIMITS.

        <p class="bodytext">
				

In describing the two labels, the courts below have employed terms such as pejorative, negative, derogatory,  intentionally intimidating,  particularly harmful, politically damaging, a serious sanction, a penalty, and official denunciation.  191 F. 3d, at 918, 919, 922, 925; 996 F.

.  At the same time, by directing the citizens attention to the single consideration of the candidates fidelity to term limits, the labels imply that the issue is an importantperhaps paramountconsideration in the citizens choice, which may decisively influence the citizen to cast his ballot against candidates branded as unfaithful.

						 Section 19(5) permits a voter to appeal to the Missouri Supreme Court a determination that a statement should not be placed next to a candidates name, and §19(6) allows a candidate to appeal to the States highest court a determination that such a statement should be printed.  In either case, clear and convincing evidence is required to demonstrate that the statement does not belong on the ballot adjacent to the candidates name.


The remainder of Article VIII provides for automatic repeal of the Article should the specified Congressional Term Limits Amendment be ratified, §20; exclusive jurisdiction of challenges to the Amendment in the Supreme Court of Missouri, §21; and severance of any portion, clause, or phrase of Article VIII that is declared invalid, §22.

						 Of course, whether the members of a representative assembly should be bound by the views of their constituents, or by their own judgment, is a matter that has been the subject of debate since even before the Federal Union was established.  For instance, in his classic speech to the electors of Bristol, Edmund Burke set forth the latter view:


To deliver an opinion is the right of all men; that of constituents is a weighty and respectable opinion, which a representative ought always to rejoice to hear; and which he ought always most seriously to consider.  But authoritative instructions; mandates issued, which the member is bound blindly and implicitly to obey, to vote, and to argue for, though contrary to the clearest conviction of his judgment and conscience, these are things utterly unknown to the laws of this land, and which arise from a fundamental mistake of the whole order and tenor of our constitution.  The Speeches of the Right Hon. Edmund Burke 130 (J. Burke ed. 1867).

						 That much, apparently, also seemed clear to many Members of Congress operating under Article VIII or similar label laws adopted by other States, who consequently tailored their behavior to avoid the ballot designations.  For example, in 1997, the House of Representatives voted on 11 different proposals to adopt a term limits amendment to the Constitution; 7 of those proposals were dictated by voter initiatives in 7 different States.  Representative Blunt of Missouri introduced the Article VIII version to ensure that members of the Missouri delegation have the ability to vote for language that meets a verbatim test of [the] Missouri Amendment and thereby avoid the scarlet letter provision.  143 Cong. Rec. H494 (Feb. 12, 1997).  However, because each of the state initiatives provided a sanction similar to the ballot labels included in Article VIII, some Representatives explained that they were constrained to vote only for the version endorsed by the voters of their States, and to vote against differing versions proposed by congressional members from other States, even though they were supportive of term limits generally.  See, e.g., id., at H486 (remarks of Rep. Hutchinson) (I will vote against the bill of the gentleman from Florida [Mr. McCollum], not because I am opposed to term limits but because this particular resolution does not comply with the term limit instructions approved by the voters and the people of Arkansas); id., at H490 (remarks of Rep. Crapo) (Last Congress I supported the McCollum term limits bill that, as I said, supported a 12-year term limit.  However, in this Congress I must oppose this bill because of the initiative passed by the people of the State of Idaho which requires me to oppose any term limits measure that does not have the same set of term limit conditions that are included in the initiative that was passed in the State).  As Representative Frank of Massachusetts put it, [e]very States Members get to vote on their States term limits so they make them feel better and they do not get the scarlet letter.  Id., at H487.  Consequently, the most popular proposal for such an amendment, that of Representative McCollum of Florida, received 217 votes, 10 fewer than it had in the preceding Congress.  Id., at H511.  As for the Missouri version, it suffered a 353-to-72 defeat.  Id., at H497.

						 At the margins, the parties have fought over whether the Elections Clause is even applicable because it is a grant of power to each State by the Legislature thereof and Article VIII is the product of referendum.  Compare Brief for Petitioner 38, n. 46, with Brief for Respondents 1213, n. 8.  Of course, [w]henever the term legislature is used in the Constitution, it is necessary to consider the nature of the particular action in view. Smiley v. Holm, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/285/355" class="subref" title="subref">285 U. S. 355</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">366</a> (1932)
.  Nevertheless, we need not delve into this inquiry, as it is clear, for the reasons stated in the text, that Article VIII is not authorized by the Elections Clause.


In discussing the Elections Clause issue, respondents have also relied in part on 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> cases upholding time, place, and manner regulations of speech.  Brief for Respondents 1314.  Although the Elections Clause uses the same phrase as that branch of our 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> jurisprudence, it by no means follows that such cases have any relevance to our disposition of this case.

, we reviewed a challenge to an Arkansas law that prohibited the name of an otherwise eligible candidate for the United States Congress from appearing on the general election ballot if he or she had already served three terms in the House of Representatives or two terms in the Senate.  We held that the ballot restriction was an indirect attempt to impose term limits on congressional incumbents that violated the Qualifications Clauses in Article I of the Constitution rather than a permissible exercise of the States power to regulate the Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives within the meaning of Article I, §4, cl. 1.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The District Court decided the case on the pleadings, granting Gralikes motion for summary judgment.  The court first held that Article VIII contravened the Qualifications Clauses of Article I of the Federal Constitution because it has the sole purpose of creating additional qualifications for Congress indirectly and has the likely effect of handicapping a class of candidates for Congress. 996 F. Supp. 917, 920 (1998); see 996 F. Supp. 901, 905
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				909 (1998).  The court further held that Article VIII places an impermissible burden on the candidates 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> right to speak freely on the issue of term limits by punish[ing] candidates for speaking out against term limits through putting negative words next to their names on the ballot, and by us[ing] the threat of being disadvantaged in the election to coerce candidates into taking a position on the term limits issue.  996 F. Supp., at 910; see 996 F. Supp., at 920.  Lastly, the court found Article VIII to be an indirect and unconstitutional attempt by the people of Missouri to interject themselves into the amending process authorized by Article V of the Federal Constitution.  In doing so, the court endorsed the reasoning of other decisions invalidating provisions similar to Article VIII on the ground that negative ballot designations place an undue influence on the legislator to vote in favor of term limits rather than exercise his or her own independent judgment as is contemplated by Article V.  996 F. Supp., at 916; see 996 F. Supp., at 920.

				  Like the District Court, it found that Article VIII threatens a penalty that is serious enough to compel candidates to speakthe potential political damage of the ballot labels; seeks to impose an additional qualification for candidacy for Congress and does so in a manner which is highly likely to handicap term limit opponents and other labeled candidates; and coerce[s] legislators into proposing or ratifying a particular constitutional amendment in violation of Article V

				Article VIII furthers the States interest in adding a  term limits amendment to the Federal Constitution in two ways.  It encourages Missouris congressional delegation to support such an amendment in order to avoid an unfavorable ballot designation when running for reelection.  And it encourages the election of representatives who favor such an amendment.  Petitioner argues that Article VIII is an exercise of the right of the people to instruct their representatives reserved by the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentx" class="subref" title="subref">Tenth Amendment</a>,

				 and that it is a permissible regulation of the manner of electing federal legislators within the authority delegated to the States by the Elections Clause, Art. I, §4, cl. 1.

				   Because these two arguments rely on different sources of state power, it is appropriate at the outset to review the distinction in kind between powers reserved to the States and those delegated to the States by the Constitution.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				As we discussed at length in 
				<em>
					U. S. Term Limits
				</em>
				, the Constitution draws a basic distinction between the powers of the newly created Federal Government and the powers retained by the pre-existing sovereign States.  514 U. S., at 801.  On the one hand, in the words of Chief Justice Marshall, it was neither necessary nor proper to define the powers retained by the States.  These powers proceed, not from the people of America, but from the people of the several States; and remain, after the adoption of the constitution, what they were before, except so far as they may be abridged by that instrument.

				To be persuasive, petitioners argument that Article VIII is a valid exercise of the States reserved power to give binding instructions to its representatives would have to overcome three hurdles.  First, the historical precedents on which she relies for the proposition that the States have such a reserved power are distinguishable.  Second, there is countervailing historical evidence.  Third, and of decisive significance, the means employed to issue the instructions, ballots for congressional elections, are unacceptable unless Article VIII is a permissible exercise of the States power to regulate the manner of holding elections for Senators and Representatives.  Only a brief comment on the first two points is necessary.

				Petitioner relies heavily on the part instructions played in the Second Continental Congress, the Constitutional Convention, the early Congress, the selection of United States Senators before the passage of the

				Indeed, contrary evidence is provided by the fact that the First Congress rejected a proposal to insert a right of the people to instruct their representatives into what would become the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.  1 Annals of Cong. 732 (1789).  The fact that the proposal was made suggests that its proponents thought it necessary, and the fact that it was rejected by a vote of 41 to 10,

If they were to be guided by instructions, there would be no use in deliberation; all that a man would have to do, would be to produce his instructions, and lay them on the table, and let them speak for him).  As a result, James Madison, then a Representative from Virginia, concluded that a right to issue binding instructions would run the risk of losing the whole system.

 (It cannot be doubted that these comprehensive words embrace authority to provide a complete code for congressional elections).  Nevertheless, Article VIII falls outside of that grant of authority.  As we made clear in 
				<em>
					U. S. Term Limits
				</em>
				, the Framers understood the Elections Clause as a grant of authority to issue procedural regulations, and not as a source of power to dictate electoral outcomes, to favor or disfavor a class of candidates, or to evade important constitutional restraints.  514 U.

It does not regulate the time of elections; it does not regulate the place of elections; nor, we believe, does it regulate the manner of elections.

				  As to the last point, Article VIII bears no relation to the manner of elections as we understand it, for in our commonsense view that term encompasses matters like notices, registration, supervision of voting, protection of voters, prevention of fraud and corrupt practices, counting of votes, duties of inspectors and canvassers, and making and publication of election returns.

As noted, the state provision does not just instruct each member of Missouris congressional delegation to promote in certain ways the passage of the specified term limits amendment.  It also attaches a concrete consequence to noncompliancethe printing of the statement DISREGARDED VOTERS INSTRUCTIONS ON TERM LIMITS by the candidates name on all primary and general election ballots.  Likewise, a nonincumbent candidate who does not pledge to follow the instruction receives the ballot designation DECLINED TO PLEDGE TO SUPPORT TERM LIMITS.

        <p class="bodytext">
				

In describing the two labels, the courts below have employed terms such as pejorative, negative, derogatory,  intentionally intimidating,  particularly harmful, politically damaging, a serious sanction, a penalty, and official denunciation.  191 F. 3d, at 918, 919, 922, 925; 996 F.

They convey the substantial political risk the ballot labels impose on current and prospective congressional members who, for one reason or another, fail to comply with the conditions set forth in Article VIII for passing its term limits amendment.  Although petitioner now claims that the labels merely inform Missouri voters about a candidates compliance with Article VIII, she has acknowledged under oath that the ballot designations would handicap candidates for the United States Congress.

.  At the same time, by directing the citizens attention to the single consideration of the candidates fidelity to term limits, the labels imply that the issue is an importantperhaps paramountconsideration in the citizens choice, which may decisively influence the citizen to cast his ballot against candidates branded as unfaithful.

						 Of course, whether the members of a representative assembly should be bound by the views of their constituents, or by their own judgment, is a matter that has been the subject of debate since even before the Federal Union was established.  For instance, in his classic speech to the electors of Bristol, Edmund Burke set forth the latter view:


To deliver an opinion is the right of all men; that of constituents is a weighty and respectable opinion, which a representative ought always to rejoice to hear; and which he ought always most seriously to consider.  But authoritative instructions; mandates issued, which the member is bound blindly and implicitly to obey, to vote, and to argue for, though contrary to the clearest conviction of his judgment and conscience, these are things utterly unknown to the laws of this land, and which arise from a fundamental mistake of the whole order and tenor of our constitution.  The Speeches of the Right Hon. Edmund Burke 130 (J. Burke ed. 1867).

						 That much, apparently, also seemed clear to many Members of Congress operating under Article VIII or similar label laws adopted by other States, who consequently tailored their behavior to avoid the ballot designations.  For example, in 1997, the House of Representatives voted on 11 different proposals to adopt a term limits amendment to the Constitution; 7 of those proposals were dictated by voter initiatives in 7 different States.  Representative Blunt of Missouri introduced the Article VIII version to ensure that members of the Missouri delegation have the ability to vote for language that meets a verbatim test of [the] Missouri Amendment and thereby avoid the scarlet letter provision.  143 Cong. Rec. H494 (Feb. 12, 1997).  However, because each of the state initiatives provided a sanction similar to the ballot labels included in Article VIII, some Representatives explained that they were constrained to vote only for the version endorsed by the voters of their States, and to vote against differing versions proposed by congressional members from other States, even though they were supportive of term limits generally.  See, e.g., id., at H486 (remarks of Rep. Hutchinson) (I will vote against the bill of the gentleman from Florida [Mr. McCollum], not because I am opposed to term limits but because this particular resolution does not comply with the term limit instructions approved by the voters and the people of Arkansas); id., at H490 (remarks of Rep. Crapo) (Last Congress I supported the McCollum term limits bill that, as I said, supported a 12-year term limit.  However, in this Congress I must oppose this bill because of the initiative passed by the people of the State of Idaho which requires me to oppose any term limits measure that does not have the same set of term limit conditions that are included in the initiative that was passed in the State).  As Representative Frank of Massachusetts put it, [e]very States Members get to vote on their States term limits so they make them feel better and they do not get the scarlet letter.  Id., at H487.  Consequently, the most popular proposal for such an amendment, that of Representative McCollum of Florida, received 217 votes, 10 fewer than it had in the preceding Congress.  Id., at H511.  As for the Missouri version, it suffered a 353-to-72 defeat.  Id., at H497.

						 At the margins, the parties have fought over whether the Elections Clause is even applicable because it is a grant of power to each State by the Legislature thereof and Article VIII is the product of referendum.  Compare Brief for Petitioner 38, n. 46, with Brief for Respondents 1213, n. 8.  Of course, [w]henever the term legislature is used in the Constitution, it is necessary to consider the nature of the particular action in view. Smiley v. Holm, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/285/355" class="subref" title="subref">285 U. S. 355</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">366</a> (1932)
.  Nevertheless, we need not delve into this inquiry, as it is clear, for the reasons stated in the text, that Article VIII is not authorized by the Elections Clause.


In discussing the Elections Clause issue, respondents have also relied in part on 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> cases upholding time, place, and manner regulations of speech.  Brief for Respondents 1314.  Although the Elections Clause uses the same phrase as that branch of our 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> jurisprudence, it by no means follows that such cases have any relevance to our disposition of this case.

, we reviewed a challenge to an Arkansas law that prohibited the name of an otherwise eligible candidate for the United States Congress from appearing on the general election ballot if he or she had already served three terms in the House of Representatives or two terms in the Senate.  We held that the ballot restriction was an indirect attempt to impose term limits on congressional incumbents that violated the Qualifications Clauses in Article I of the Constitution rather than a permissible exercise of the States power to regulate the Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives within the meaning of Article I, §4, cl. 1.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The District Court decided the case on the pleadings, granting Gralikes motion for summary judgment.  The court first held that Article VIII contravened the Qualifications Clauses of Article I of the Federal Constitution because it has the sole purpose of creating additional qualifications for Congress indirectly and has the likely effect of handicapping a class of candidates for Congress. 996 F. Supp. 917, 920 (1998); see 996 F. Supp. 901, 905
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				909 (1998).  The court further held that Article VIII places an impermissible burden on the candidates 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> right to speak freely on the issue of term limits by punish[ing] candidates for speaking out against term limits through putting negative words next to their names on the ballot, and by us[ing] the threat of being disadvantaged in the election to coerce candidates into taking a position on the term limits issue.  996 F. Supp., at 910; see 996 F. Supp., at 920.  Lastly, the court found Article VIII to be an indirect and unconstitutional attempt by the people of Missouri to interject themselves into the amending process authorized by Article V of the Federal Constitution.  In doing so, the court endorsed the reasoning of other decisions invalidating provisions similar to Article VIII on the ground that negative ballot designations place an undue influence on the legislator to vote in favor of term limits rather than exercise his or her own independent judgment as is contemplated by Article V.  996 F. Supp., at 916; see 996 F. Supp., at 920.

				  Like the District Court, it found that Article VIII threatens a penalty that is serious enough to compel candidates to speakthe potential political damage of the ballot labels; seeks to impose an additional qualification for candidacy for Congress and does so in a manner which is highly likely to handicap term limit opponents and other labeled candidates; and coerce[s] legislators into proposing or ratifying a particular constitutional amendment in violation of Article V

				Article VIII furthers the States interest in adding a  term limits amendment to the Federal Constitution in two ways.  It encourages Missouris congressional delegation to support such an amendment in order to avoid an unfavorable ballot designation when running for reelection.  And it encourages the election of representatives who favor such an amendment.  Petitioner argues that Article VIII is an exercise of the right of the people to instruct their representatives reserved by the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentx" class="subref" title="subref">Tenth Amendment</a>,

				   Because these two arguments rely on different sources of state power, it is appropriate at the outset to review the distinction in kind between powers reserved to the States and those delegated to the States by the Constitution.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				As we discussed at length in 
				<em>
					U. S. Term Limits
				</em>
				, the Constitution draws a basic distinction between the powers of the newly created Federal Government and the powers retained by the pre-existing sovereign States.  514 U. S., at 801.  On the one hand, in the words of Chief Justice Marshall, it was neither necessary nor proper to define the powers retained by the States.  These powers proceed, not from the people of America, but from the people of the several States; and remain, after the adoption of the constitution, what they were before, except so far as they may be abridged by that instrument.

				On the other hand, as Justice Story observed, the states can exercise no powers whatsoever, which exclusively spring out of the existence of the national government, which the constitution did not delegate to them.  1 Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States §627 (3d ed. 1858) (hereinafter Story).

				To be persuasive, petitioners argument that Article VIII is a valid exercise of the States reserved power to give binding instructions to its representatives would have to overcome three hurdles.  First, the historical precedents on which she relies for the proposition that the States have such a reserved power are distinguishable.  Second, there is countervailing historical evidence.  Third, and of decisive significance, the means employed to issue the instructions, ballots for congressional elections, are unacceptable unless Article VIII is a permissible exercise of the States power to regulate the manner of holding elections for Senators and Representatives.  Only a brief comment on the first two points is necessary.

				  This evidence falls short of demonstrating that either the people or the States had a right to give legally binding,

				., nonadvisory, instructions to their representatives that the

				Indeed, contrary evidence is provided by the fact that the First Congress rejected a proposal to insert a right of the people to instruct their representatives into what would become the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.  1 Annals of Cong. 732 (1789).  The fact that the proposal was made suggests that its proponents thought it necessary, and the fact that it was rejected by a vote of 41 to 10,

If they were to be guided by instructions, there would be no use in deliberation; all that a man would have to do, would be to produce his instructions, and lay them on the table, and let them speak for him).  As a result, James Madison, then a Representative from Virginia, concluded that a right to issue binding instructions would run the risk of losing the whole system.

 (It cannot be doubted that these comprehensive words embrace authority to provide a complete code for congressional elections).  Nevertheless, Article VIII falls outside of that grant of authority.  As we made clear in 
				<em>
					U. S. Term Limits
				</em>
				, the Framers understood the Elections Clause as a grant of authority to issue procedural regulations, and not as a source of power to dictate electoral outcomes, to favor or disfavor a class of candidates, or to evade important constitutional restraints.  514 U. S., at 833834.  Article VIII is not a procedural regulation.  It does not regulate the time of elections; it does not regulate the place of elections; nor, we believe, does it regulate the manner of elections.

				  As to the last point, Article VIII bears no relation to the manner of elections as we understand it, for in our commonsense view that term encompasses matters like notices, registration, supervision of voting, protection of voters, prevention of fraud and corrupt practices, counting of votes, duties of inspectors and canvassers, and making and publication of election returns.

S. 780</a>, n. 9 (1983) (We have upheld generally applicable and evenhanded [ballot access] restrictions that protect the integrity and reliability of the electoral process itself).  As noted, the state provision does not just instruct each member of Missouris congressional delegation to promote in certain ways the passage of the specified term limits amendment.  It also attaches a concrete consequence to noncompliancethe printing of the statement DISREGARDED VOTERS INSTRUCTIONS ON TERM LIMITS by the candidates name on all primary and general election ballots.  Likewise, a nonincumbent candidate who does not pledge to follow the instruction receives the ballot designation DECLINED TO PLEDGE TO SUPPORT TERM LIMITS.

        <p class="bodytext">
				

In describing the two labels, the courts below have employed terms such as pejorative, negative, derogatory,  intentionally intimidating,  particularly harmful, politically damaging, a serious sanction, a penalty, and official denunciation.  191 F. 3d, at 918, 919, 922, 925; 996 F.

				., at 910, 916.  The general counsel to petitioners office, no less, has denominated the labels as the Scarlet Letter.  App. 3435.  We agree with the sense of these descriptions.  They convey the substantial political risk the ballot labels impose on current and prospective congressional members who, for one reason or another, fail to comply with the conditions set forth in Article VIII for passing its term limits amendment.  Although petitioner now claims that the labels merely inform Missouri voters about a candidates compliance with Article VIII, she has acknowledged under oath that the ballot designations would handicap candidates for the United States Congress.  
				<em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">402</a> (1964)
.  At the same time, by directing the citizens attention to the single consideration of the candidates fidelity to term limits, the labels imply that the issue is an importantperhaps paramountconsideration in the citizens choice, which may decisively influence the citizen to cast his ballot against candidates branded as unfaithful.

(b)fails to second the proposed Congressional Term Limits Amendment set forth above if it lacks for a second before any proceeding of the legislative body or;

						 Section 19(5) permits a voter to appeal to the Missouri Supreme Court a determination that a statement should not be placed next to a candidates name, and §19(6) allows a candidate to appeal to the States highest court a determination that such a statement should be printed.  In either case, clear and convincing evidence is required to demonstrate that the statement does not belong on the ballot adjacent to the candidates name.


The remainder of Article VIII provides for automatic repeal of the Article should the specified Congressional Term Limits Amendment be ratified, §20; exclusive jurisdiction of challenges to the Amendment in the Supreme Court of Missouri, §21; and severance of any portion, clause, or phrase of Article VIII that is declared invalid, §22.

						 Of course, whether the members of a representative assembly should be bound by the views of their constituents, or by their own judgment, is a matter that has been the subject of debate since even before the Federal Union was established.  For instance, in his classic speech to the electors of Bristol, Edmund Burke set forth the latter view:


To deliver an opinion is the right of all men; that of constituents is a weighty and respectable opinion, which a representative ought always to rejoice to hear; and which he ought always most seriously to consider.  But authoritative instructions; mandates issued, which the member is bound blindly and implicitly to obey, to vote, and to argue for, though contrary to the clearest conviction of his judgment and conscience, these are things utterly unknown to the laws of this land, and which arise from a fundamental mistake of the whole order and tenor of our constitution.  The Speeches of the Right Hon. Edmund Burke 130 (J. Burke ed. 1867).

						 That much, apparently, also seemed clear to many Members of Congress operating under Article VIII or similar label laws adopted by other States, who consequently tailored their behavior to avoid the ballot designations.  For example, in 1997, the House of Representatives voted on 11 different proposals to adopt a term limits amendment to the Constitution; 7 of those proposals were dictated by voter initiatives in 7 different States.  Representative Blunt of Missouri introduced the Article VIII version to ensure that members of the Missouri delegation have the ability to vote for language that meets a verbatim test of [the] Missouri Amendment and thereby avoid the scarlet letter provision.  143 Cong. Rec. H494 (Feb. 12, 1997).  However, because each of the state initiatives provided a sanction similar to the ballot labels included in Article VIII, some Representatives explained that they were constrained to vote only for the version endorsed by the voters of their States, and to vote against differing versions proposed by congressional members from other States, even though they were supportive of term limits generally.  See, e.g., id., at H486 (remarks of Rep. Hutchinson) (I will vote against the bill of the gentleman from Florida [Mr. McCollum], not because I am opposed to term limits but because this particular resolution does not comply with the term limit instructions approved by the voters and the people of Arkansas); id., at H490 (remarks of Rep. Crapo) (Last Congress I supported the McCollum term limits bill that, as I said, supported a 12-year term limit.  However, in this Congress I must oppose this bill because of the initiative passed by the people of the State of Idaho which requires me to oppose any term limits measure that does not have the same set of term limit conditions that are included in the initiative that was passed in the State).  As Representative Frank of Massachusetts put it, [e]very States Members get to vote on their States term limits so they make them feel better and they do not get the scarlet letter.  Id., at H487.  Consequently, the most popular proposal for such an amendment, that of Representative McCollum of Florida, received 217 votes, 10 fewer than it had in the preceding Congress.  Id., at H511.  As for the Missouri version, it suffered a 353-to-72 defeat.  Id., at H497.

						 At the margins, the parties have fought over whether the Elections Clause is even applicable because it is a grant of power to each State by the Legislature thereof and Article VIII is the product of referendum.  Compare Brief for Petitioner 38, n. 46, with Brief for Respondents 1213, n. 8.  Of course, [w]henever the term legislature is used in the Constitution, it is necessary to consider the nature of the particular action in view. Smiley v. Holm, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/285/355" class="subref" title="subref">285 U. S. 355</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">366</a> (1932)
.  Nevertheless, we need not delve into this inquiry, as it is clear, for the reasons stated in the text, that Article VIII is not authorized by the Elections Clause.


In discussing the Elections Clause issue, respondents have also relied in part on 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> cases upholding time, place, and manner regulations of speech.  Brief for Respondents 1314.  Although the Elections Clause uses the same phrase as that branch of our 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> jurisprudence, it by no means follows that such cases have any relevance to our disposition of this case.

, we reviewed a challenge to an Arkansas law that prohibited the name of an otherwise eligible candidate for the United States Congress from appearing on the general election ballot if he or she had already served three terms in the House of Representatives or two terms in the Senate.  We held that the ballot restriction was an indirect attempt to impose term limits on congressional incumbents that violated the Qualifications Clauses in Article I of the Constitution rather than a permissible exercise of the States power to regulate the Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives within the meaning of Article I, §4, cl. 1.

				Three provisions in Article VIII combine to advance its purpose.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The District Court decided the case on the pleadings, granting Gralikes motion for summary judgment.  The court first held that Article VIII contravened the Qualifications Clauses of Article I of the Federal Constitution because it has the sole purpose of creating additional qualifications for Congress indirectly and has the likely effect of handicapping a class of candidates for Congress. 996 F. Supp. 917, 920 (1998); see 996 F. Supp. 901, 905
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				909 (1998).  The court further held that Article VIII places an impermissible burden on the candidates 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> right to speak freely on the issue of term limits by punish[ing] candidates for speaking out against term limits through putting negative words next to their names on the ballot, and by us[ing] the threat of being disadvantaged in the election to coerce candidates into taking a position on the term limits issue.  996 F. Supp., at 910; see 996 F. Supp., at 920.  Lastly, the court found Article VIII to be an indirect and unconstitutional attempt by the people of Missouri to interject themselves into the amending process authorized by Article V of the Federal Constitution.  In doing so, the court endorsed the reasoning of other decisions invalidating provisions similar to Article VIII on the ground that negative ballot designations place an undue influence on the legislator to vote in favor of term limits rather than exercise his or her own independent judgment as is contemplated by Article V.  996 F. Supp., at 916; see 996 F. Supp., at 920.

				Article VIII furthers the States interest in adding a  term limits amendment to the Federal Constitution in two ways.  It encourages Missouris congressional delegation to support such an amendment in order to avoid an unfavorable ballot designation when running for reelection.  And it encourages the election of representatives who favor such an amendment.  Petitioner argues that Article VIII is an exercise of the right of the people to instruct their representatives reserved by the

				   Because these two arguments rely on different sources of state power, it is appropriate at the outset to review the distinction in kind between powers reserved to the States and those delegated to the States by the Constitution.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				As we discussed at length in 
				<em>
					U. S. Term Limits
				</em>
				, the Constitution draws a basic distinction between the powers of the newly created Federal Government and the powers retained by the pre-existing sovereign States.  514 U. S., at 801.  On the one hand, in the words of Chief Justice Marshall, it was neither necessary nor proper to define the powers retained by the States.  These powers proceed, not from the people of America, but from the people of the several States; and remain, after the adoption of the constitution, what they were before, except so far as they may be abridged by that instrument.

				On the other hand, as Justice Story observed, the states can exercise no powers whatsoever, which exclusively spring out of the existence of the national government, which the constitution did not delegate to them.  1 Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States §627 (3d ed. 1858) (hereinafter Story).

				To be persuasive, petitioners argument that Article VIII is a valid exercise of the States reserved power to give binding instructions to its representatives would have to overcome three hurdles.  First, the historical precedents on which she relies for the proposition that the States have such a reserved power are distinguishable.  Second, there is countervailing historical evidence.  Third, and of decisive significance, the means employed to issue the instructions, ballots for congressional elections, are unacceptable unless Article VIII is a permissible exercise of the States power to regulate the manner of holding elections for Senators and Representatives.  Only a brief comment on the first two points is necessary.

				Petitioner relies heavily on the part instructions played in the Second Continental Congress, the Constitutional Convention, the early Congress, the selection of United States Senators before the passage of the

				Indeed, contrary evidence is provided by the fact that the First Congress rejected a proposal to insert a right of the people to instruct their representatives into what would become the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.  1 Annals of Cong. 732 (1789).  The fact that the proposal was made suggests that its proponents thought it necessary, and the fact that it was rejected by a vote of 41 to 10, 
				<em>

				at 747, suggests that we should give weight to the views of those who opposed the proposal.  It was their view that binding instructions would undermine an essential attribute of Congress by eviscerating the deliberative nature of that National Assembly.  See,

If they were to be guided by instructions, there would be no use in deliberation; all that a man would have to do, would be to produce his instructions, and lay them on the table, and let them speak for him).  As a result, James Madison, then a Representative from Virginia, concluded that a right to issue binding instructions would run the risk of losing the whole system.

 (It cannot be doubted that these comprehensive words embrace authority to provide a complete code for congressional elections).  Nevertheless, Article VIII falls outside of that grant of authority.  As we made clear in 
				<em>

				  As to the last point, Article VIII bears no relation to the manner of elections as we understand it, for in our commonsense view that term encompasses matters like notices, registration, supervision of voting, protection of voters, prevention of fraud and corrupt practices, counting of votes, duties of inspectors and canvassers, and making and publication of election returns.

As noted, the state provision does not just instruct each member of Missouris congressional delegation to promote in certain ways the passage of the specified term limits amendment.  It also attaches a concrete consequence to noncompliancethe printing of the statement DISREGARDED VOTERS INSTRUCTIONS ON TERM LIMITS by the candidates name on all primary and general election ballots.  Likewise, a nonincumbent candidate who does not pledge to follow the instruction receives the ballot designation DECLINED TO PLEDGE TO SUPPORT TERM LIMITS.

        <p class="bodytext">
				

In describing the two labels, the courts below have employed terms such as pejorative, negative, derogatory,  intentionally intimidating,  particularly harmful, politically damaging, a serious sanction, a penalty, and official denunciation.  191 F. 3d, at 918, 919, 922, 925; 996 F.

.  At the same time, by directing the citizens attention to the single consideration of the candidates fidelity to term limits, the labels imply that the issue is an importantperhaps paramountconsideration in the citizens choice, which may decisively influence the citizen to cast his ballot against candidates branded as unfaithful.

Congressional Term Limits Amendment


(a)No person shall serve in the office of United States Representative for more than three terms, but upon ratification of this amendment no person who has held the office of the United States Representative or who then holds the office shall serve for more than two additional terms.


(b)No person shall serve in the office of United States Senator for more than two terms, but upon ratification of this amendment no person who has held the office of United States Senator or who then holds the office shall serve in the office for more than one additional term.


(c)Any state may enact by state constitutional amendment longer or shorter limits than those specified in section a or b herein.


(d)This article shall have no time limit within which it must be ratified to become operative upon the ratification of the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States.

						 Section 17(2) provides that the statement shall be printed adjacent to the name of any United States Senator or Representative who:


(a)fails to vote in favor of the proposed Congressional Term Limits Amendment set forth above when brought to a vote or;


(b)fails to second the proposed Congressional Term Limits Amendment set forth above if it lacks for a second before any proceeding of the legislative body or;


(c)fails to propose or otherwise bring to a vote of the full legislative body the proposed Congressional Term Limits Amendment set forth above if it otherwise lacks a legislator who so proposes or brings to a vote of the full legislative body the proposed Congressional Term Limits Amendment set forth above or;


(d)fails to vote in favor of all votes bringing the proposed Congressional Term Limits Amendment set forth above before any committee or subcommittee of the respective house upon which he or she serves or;


(e)fails to reject any attempt to delay, table or otherwise prevent a vote by the full legislative body of the proposed Congressional Term Limits Amendment set forth above or;


(f)fails to vote against any proposed constitutional amendment that would establish longer term limits than those in the proposed Congressional Term Limits Amendment set forth above regardless of any other actions in support of the proposed Congressional Term Limits Amendment set forth above or;


(g)sponsors or cosponsors any proposed constitutional amendment or law that would increase term limits beyond those in the proposed Congressional Term Limits Amendment set forth above or;


(h)fails to ensure that all votes on Congressional Term Limits are recorded and made available to the public.

						 The pledge, contained in §18(3), reads:


I support term limits and pledge to use all my legislative powers to enact the proposed Constitutional Amendment set forth in the Term Limits Act of 1996.  If elected, I pledge to vote in such a way that the designation DISREGARDED VOTERS INSTRUCTION ON TERM LIMITS will not appear adjacent to my name.

						 Section 19(5) permits a voter to appeal to the Missouri Supreme Court a determination that a statement should not be placed next to a candidates name, and §19(6) allows a candidate to appeal to the States highest court a determination that such a statement should be printed.  In either case, clear and convincing evidence is required to demonstrate that the statement does not belong on the ballot adjacent to the candidates name.


The remainder of Article VIII provides for automatic repeal of the Article should the specified Congressional Term Limits Amendment be ratified, §20; exclusive jurisdiction of challenges to the Amendment in the Supreme Court of Missouri, §21; and severance of any portion, clause, or phrase of Article VIII that is declared invalid, §22.

						 Of course, whether the members of a representative assembly should be bound by the views of their constituents, or by their own judgment, is a matter that has been the subject of debate since even before the Federal Union was established.  For instance, in his classic speech to the electors of Bristol, Edmund Burke set forth the latter view:


To deliver an opinion is the right of all men; that of constituents is a weighty and respectable opinion, which a representative ought always to rejoice to hear; and which he ought always most seriously to consider.  But authoritative instructions; mandates issued, which the member is bound blindly and implicitly to obey, to vote, and to argue for, though contrary to the clearest conviction of his judgment and conscience, these are things utterly unknown to the laws of this land, and which arise from a fundamental mistake of the whole order and tenor of our constitution.  The Speeches of the Right Hon. Edmund Burke 130 (J. Burke ed. 1867).

						 That much, apparently, also seemed clear to many Members of Congress operating under Article VIII or similar label laws adopted by other States, who consequently tailored their behavior to avoid the ballot designations.  For example, in 1997, the House of Representatives voted on 11 different proposals to adopt a term limits amendment to the Constitution; 7 of those proposals were dictated by voter initiatives in 7 different States.  Representative Blunt of Missouri introduced the Article VIII version to ensure that members of the Missouri delegation have the ability to vote for language that meets a verbatim test of [the] Missouri Amendment and thereby avoid the scarlet letter provision.  143 Cong. Rec. H494 (Feb. 12, 1997).  However, because each of the state initiatives provided a sanction similar to the ballot labels included in Article VIII, some Representatives explained that they were constrained to vote only for the version endorsed by the voters of their States, and to vote against differing versions proposed by congressional members from other States, even though they were supportive of term limits generally.  See, e.g., id., at H486 (remarks of Rep. Hutchinson) (I will vote against the bill of the gentleman from Florida [Mr. McCollum], not because I am opposed to term limits but because this particular resolution does not comply with the term limit instructions approved by the voters and the people of Arkansas); id., at H490 (remarks of Rep. Crapo) (Last Congress I supported the McCollum term limits bill that, as I said, supported a 12-year term limit.  However, in this Congress I must oppose this bill because of the initiative passed by the people of the State of Idaho which requires me to oppose any term limits measure that does not have the same set of term limit conditions that are included in the initiative that was passed in the State).  As Representative Frank of Massachusetts put it, [e]very States Members get to vote on their States term limits so they make them feel better and they do not get the scarlet letter.  Id., at H487.  Consequently, the most popular proposal for such an amendment, that of Representative McCollum of Florida, received 217 votes, 10 fewer than it had in the preceding Congress.  Id., at H511.  As for the Missouri version, it suffered a 353-to-72 defeat.  Id., at H497.

						 At the margins, the parties have fought over whether the Elections Clause is even applicable because it is a grant of power to each State by the Legislature thereof and Article VIII is the product of referendum.  Compare Brief for Petitioner 38, n. 46, with Brief for Respondents 1213, n. 8.  Of course, [w]henever the term legislature is used in the Constitution, it is necessary to consider the nature of the particular action in view. Smiley v. Holm, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/285/355" class="subref" title="subref">285 U. S. 355</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">366</a> (1932)
.  Nevertheless, we need not delve into this inquiry, as it is clear, for the reasons stated in the text, that Article VIII is not authorized by the Elections Clause.


In discussing the Elections Clause issue, respondents have also relied in part on 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> cases upholding time, place, and manner regulations of speech.  Brief for Respondents 1314.  Although the Elections Clause uses the same phrase as that branch of our 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> jurisprudence, it by no means follows that such cases have any relevance to our disposition of this case.

				I join the opinion of the Court, holding §15 
				<em>
					et seq.
				</em>
				 of Article VIII of the Missouri Constitution violative of the Constitution of the United States.  It seems appropriate, however, to add these brief observations with respect to Part III of the opinion.  The Court does not say the States are disabled from requesting specific action from Congress or from expressing their concerns to it.  As the Court holds, however, the mechanism the State seeks to employ here goes well beyond this prerogative.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				A State is not permitted to interpose itself between the people and their National Government as it seeks to do here.  Whether a States concern is with the proposed enactment of a constitutional amendment or an ordinary federal statute it simply lacks the power to impose any conditions on the election of Senators and Representatives, save neutral provisions as to the time, place, and manner of elections pursuant to Article I, §4.  As the Court observed in 
				<em>
					U. S. Term Limits, Inc.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Thornton,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/514/779" class="subref" title="subref">514 U. S. 779</a> (1995)
, the Elections Clause is a grant of authority to issue procedural regulations, and not a source of power to dictate electoral outcomes, to favor or disfavor a class of candidates, or to evade important constitutional restraints.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 833834.  The Elections Clause thus delegates but limited power over federal elections to the States.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 804.  The Court rules, as it must, that the amendments to Article VIII of the Missouri Constitution do not regulate the time or place of federal elections; rather, those provisions are an attempt to control the actions of the States congressional delegation.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The dispositive principle in this case is fundamental to the Constitution, to the idea of federalism, and to the theory of representative government.  The principle is that Senators and Representatives in the National Government are responsible to the people who elect them, not to the States in which they reside.  The Constitution was ratified by Conventions in the several States, not by the States themselves, U. S. Const., Art. VII, a historical fact and a constitutional imperative which underscore the proposition that the Constitution was ordained and established by the people of the United States.  U. S. Const., preamble.  The idea of federalism is that a National Legislature enacts laws which bind the people as individuals, not as citizens of a State; and, it follows, freedom is most secure if the people themselves, not the States as intermediaries, hold their federal legislators to account for the conduct of their office.  If state enactments were allowed to condition or control certain actions of federal legislators, accountability would be blurred, with the legislators having the excuse of saying that they did not act in the exercise of their best judgment but simply in conformance with a state mandate.  As noted in the concurring opinion in 
				<em>
					Thornton
				</em>
				, [n]othing in the Constitution or The Federalist Papers … supports the idea of state interference with the most basic relation between the National Government and its citizens, the selection of legislative representatives.  514 U. S.,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				at 842.  Yet that is just what Missouri seeks to do through its lawto wield the power granted to it by the Elections Clause to handicap those who seek federal office by affixing pejorative labels next to their names on the ballot if they do not pledge to support the States preferred position on a certain issue.  Neither the design of the Constitution nor sound principles of representative government are consistent with the right or power of a State to interfere with the direct line of accountability between the National Legislature and the people who elect it.  For these reasons Article VIII is void.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				This said, it must be noted that when the Constitution was enacted, respectful petitions to legislators were an accepted mode of urging legislative action.  See W. Miller, Arguing About Slavery 105107 (1995).  This right is preserved to individuals (the people) in the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.  Even if a State, as an entity, is not itself protected by the Petition Clause, there is no principle prohibiting a state legislature from following a parallel course and by a memorial resolution requesting the Congress of the United States to pay heed to certain state concerns.  From the earliest days of our Republic to the present time, States have done so in the context of federal legislation.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 22 Annals of Cong. 153154 (1811) (reprinting a resolution by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania requesting that the charter of the Bank of the United States not be renewed); 2000 Ala. Acts 66 (requesting targeted relief for Medicare cuts); 2000 Kan. Sess. Laws ch. 186 (urging Congress to allow state-inspected meat to be shipped in interstate commerce).  Indeed, the situation was even more complex in the early days of our Nation, when Senators were appointed by state legislatures rather than directly elected.  At that time, it appears that some state legislatures followed a practice of instructing the Senators whom they had appointed to pass legislation, while only requesting that the Representatives, who had been elected by the people, do so.  See 22 Annals of Cong. 153154 (1811).  I do not believe that the situation should be any different with respect to a proposed constitutional amendment, and indeed history bears this out.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 13 Annals of Cong. 9596 (1803) (reprinting a resolution from the State of Vermont and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts requesting that Congress propose to the legislatures of the States a constitutional amendment akin to the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxii" class="subref" title="subref">Twelfth Amendment</a>).  The fact that the Members of the First Congress decided not to codify a right to instruct legislative representatives does not, in my view, prove that they intended to prohibit nonbinding petitions or memorials by the State as an entity.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				If there are to be cases in which a close question exists regarding whether the State has exceeded its constitutional authority in attempting to influence congressional action, this case is not one of them.  In todays case the question is not close.  Here the State attempts to intrude upon the relationship between the people and their congressional delegates by seeking to control or confine the discretion of those delegates, and the interference is not permissible.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				With these observations, I concur in the Courts opinion.

				The dispositive principle in this case is fundamental to the Constitution, to the idea of federalism, and to the theory of representative government.  The principle is that Senators and Representatives in the National Government are responsible to the people who elect them, not to the States in which they reside.  The Constitution was ratified by Conventions in the several States, not by the States themselves, U. S. Const., Art. VII, a historical fact and a constitutional imperative which underscore the proposition that the Constitution was ordained and established by the people of the United States.  U. S. Const., preamble.  The idea of federalism is that a National Legislature enacts laws which bind the people as individuals, not as citizens of a State; and, it follows, freedom is most secure if the people themselves, not the States as intermediaries, hold their federal legislators to account for the conduct of their office.  If state enactments were allowed to condition or control certain actions of federal legislators, accountability would be blurred, with the legislators having the excuse of saying that they did not act in the exercise of their best judgment but simply in conformance with a state mandate.  As noted in the concurring opinion in

Yet that is just what Missouri seeks to do through its lawto wield the power granted to it by the Elections Clause to handicap those who seek federal office by affixing pejorative labels next to their names on the ballot if they do not pledge to support the States preferred position on a certain issue.  Neither the design of the Constitution nor sound principles of representative government are consistent with the right or power of a State to interfere with the direct line of accountability between the National Legislature and the people who elect it.  For these reasons Article VIII is void.

				This said, it must be noted that when the Constitution was enacted, respectful petitions to legislators were an accepted mode of urging legislative action.  See W. Miller, Arguing About Slavery 105107 (1995).  This right is preserved to individuals (the people) in the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.  Even if a State, as an entity, is not itself protected by the Petition Clause, there is no principle prohibiting a state legislature from following a parallel course and by a memorial resolution requesting the Congress of the United States to pay heed to certain state concerns.  From the earliest days of our Republic to the present time, States have done so in the context of federal legislation.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 22 Annals of Cong. 153154 (1811) (reprinting a resolution by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania requesting that the charter of the Bank of the United States not be renewed); 2000 Ala. Acts 66 (requesting targeted relief for Medicare cuts); 2000 Kan. Sess. Laws ch. 186 (urging Congress to allow state-inspected meat to be shipped in interstate commerce).  Indeed, the situation was even more complex in the early days of our Nation, when Senators were appointed by state legislatures rather than directly elected.  At that time, it appears that some state legislatures followed a practice of instructing the Senators whom they had appointed to pass legislation, while only requesting that the Representatives, who had been elected by the people, do so.  See 22 Annals of Cong. 153154 (1811).  I do not believe that the situation should be any different with respect to a proposed constitutional amendment, and indeed history bears this out.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 13 Annals of Cong. 9596 (1803) (reprinting a resolution from the State of Vermont and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts requesting that Congress propose to the legislatures of the States a constitutional amendment akin to the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxii" class="subref" title="subref">Twelfth Amendment</a>).  The fact that the Members of the First Congress decided not to codify a right to instruct legislative representatives does not, in my view, prove that they intended to prohibit nonbinding petitions or memorials by the State as an entity.

				If there are to be cases in which a close question exists regarding whether the State has exceeded its constitutional authority in attempting to influence congressional action, this case is not one of them.  In todays case the question is not close.  Here the State attempts to intrude upon the relationship between the people and their congressional delegates by seeking to control or confine the discretion of those delegates, and the interference is not permissible.

				I join the opinion of the Court, holding §15

				 of Article VIII of the Missouri Constitution violative of the Constitution of the United States.  It seems appropriate, however, to add these brief observations with respect to Part III of the opinion.

				A State is not permitted to interpose itself between the people and their National Government as it seeks to do here.  Whether a States concern is with the proposed enactment of a constitutional amendment or an ordinary federal statute it simply lacks the power to impose any conditions on the election of Senators and Representatives, save neutral provisions as to the time, place, and manner of elections pursuant to Article I, §4.

				The dispositive principle in this case is fundamental to the Constitution, to the idea of federalism, and to the theory of representative government.  The principle is that Senators and Representatives in the National Government are responsible to the people who elect them, not to the States in which they reside.  The Constitution was ratified by Conventions in the several States, not by the States themselves, U. S. Const., Art. VII, a historical fact and a constitutional imperative which underscore the proposition that the Constitution was ordained and established by the people of the United States.  U. S. Const., preamble.  The idea of federalism is that a National Legislature enacts laws which bind the people as individuals, not as citizens of a State; and, it follows, freedom is most secure if the people themselves, not the States as intermediaries, hold their federal legislators to account for the conduct of their office.  If state enactments were allowed to condition or control certain actions of federal legislators, accountability would be blurred, with the legislators having the excuse of saying that they did not act in the exercise of their best judgment but simply in conformance with a state mandate.  As noted in the concurring opinion in 
				<em>
					Thornton
				</em>
				, [n]othing in the Constitution or The Federalist Papers … supports the idea of state interference with the most basic relation between the National Government and its citizens, the selection of legislative representatives.  514 U. S.,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				at 842.  Yet that is just what Missouri seeks to do through its lawto wield the power granted to it by the Elections Clause to handicap those who seek federal office by affixing pejorative labels next to their names on the ballot if they do not pledge to support the States preferred position on a certain issue.  Neither the design of the Constitution nor sound principles of representative government are consistent with the right or power of a State to interfere with the direct line of accountability between the National Legislature and the people who elect it.  For these reasons Article VIII is void.

				This said, it must be noted that when the Constitution was enacted, respectful petitions to legislators were an accepted mode of urging legislative action.  See W. Miller, Arguing About Slavery 105107 (1995).  This right is preserved to individuals (the people) in the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.  Even if a State, as an entity, is not itself protected by the Petition Clause, there is no principle prohibiting a state legislature from following a parallel course and by a memorial resolution requesting the Congress of the United States to pay heed to certain state concerns.  From the earliest days of our Republic to the present time, States have done so in the context of federal legislation.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 22 Annals of Cong. 153154 (1811) (reprinting a resolution by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania requesting that the charter of the Bank of the United States not be renewed); 2000 Ala. Acts 66 (requesting targeted relief for Medicare cuts); 2000 Kan. Sess. Laws ch. 186 (urging Congress to allow state-inspected meat to be shipped in interstate commerce).  Indeed, the situation was even more complex in the early days of our Nation, when Senators were appointed by state legislatures rather than directly elected.  At that time, it appears that some state legislatures followed a practice of instructing the Senators whom they had appointed to pass legislation, while only requesting that the Representatives, who had been elected by the people, do so.  See 22 Annals of Cong. 153154 (1811).  I do not believe that the situation should be any different with respect to a proposed constitutional amendment, and indeed history bears this out.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 13 Annals of Cong. 9596 (1803) (reprinting a resolution from the State of Vermont and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts requesting that Congress propose to the legislatures of the States a constitutional amendment akin to the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxii" class="subref" title="subref">Twelfth Amendment</a>).  The fact that the Members of the First Congress decided not to codify a right to instruct legislative representatives does not, in my view, prove that they intended to prohibit nonbinding petitions or memorials by the State as an entity.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				If there are to be cases in which a close question exists regarding whether the State has exceeded its constitutional authority in attempting to influence congressional action, this case is not one of them.  In todays case the question is not close.  Here the State attempts to intrude upon the relationship between the people and their congressional delegates by seeking to control or confine the discretion of those delegates, and the interference is not permissible.

				This said, it must be noted that when the Constitution was enacted, respectful petitions to legislators were an accepted mode of urging legislative action.  See W. Miller, Arguing About Slavery 105107 (1995).  This right is preserved to individuals (the people) in the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.  Even if a State, as an entity, is not itself protected by the Petition Clause, there is no principle prohibiting a state legislature from following a parallel course and by a memorial resolution requesting the Congress of the United States to pay heed to certain state concerns.  From the earliest days of our Republic to the present time, States have done so in the context of federal legislation.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 22 Annals of Cong. 153154 (1811) (reprinting a resolution by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania requesting that the charter of the Bank of the United States not be renewed); 2000 Ala. Acts 66 (requesting targeted relief for Medicare cuts); 2000 Kan. Sess. Laws ch. 186 (urging Congress to allow state-inspected meat to be shipped in interstate commerce).  Indeed, the situation was even more complex in the early days of our Nation, when Senators were appointed by state legislatures rather than directly elected.  At that time, it appears that some state legislatures followed a practice of instructing the Senators whom they had appointed to pass legislation, while only requesting that the Representatives, who had been elected by the people, do so.  See 22 Annals of Cong. 153154 (1811).  I do not believe that the situation should be any different with respect to a proposed constitutional amendment, and indeed history bears this out.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 13 Annals of Cong. 9596 (1803) (reprinting a resolution from the State of Vermont and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts requesting that Congress propose to the legislatures of the States a constitutional amendment akin to the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxii" class="subref" title="subref">Twelfth Amendment</a>).  The fact that the Members of the First Congress decided not to codify a right to instruct legislative representatives does not, in my view, prove that they intended to prohibit nonbinding petitions or memorials by the State as an entity.

				If there are to be cases in which a close question exists regarding whether the State has exceeded its constitutional authority in attempting to influence congressional action, this case is not one of them.  In todays case the question is not close.  Here the State attempts to intrude upon the relationship between the people and their congressional delegates by seeking to control or confine the discretion of those delegates, and the interference is not permissible.

				 of Article VIII of the Missouri Constitution violative of the Constitution of the United States.

				A State is not permitted to interpose itself between the people and their National Government as it seeks to do here.  Whether a States concern is with the proposed enactment of a constitutional amendment or an ordinary federal statute it simply lacks the power to impose any conditions on the election of Senators and Representatives, save neutral provisions as to the time, place, and manner of elections pursuant to Article I, §4.

				The dispositive principle in this case is fundamental to the Constitution, to the idea of federalism, and to the theory of representative government.  The principle is that Senators and Representatives in the National Government are responsible to the people who elect them, not to the States in which they reside.  The Constitution was ratified by Conventions in the several States, not by the States themselves, U. S. Const., Art. VII, a historical fact and a constitutional imperative which underscore the proposition that the Constitution was ordained and established by the people of the United States.  U. S. Const., preamble.  The idea of federalism is that a National Legislature enacts laws which bind the people as individuals, not as citizens of a State; and, it follows, freedom is most secure if the people themselves, not the States as intermediaries, hold their federal legislators to account for the conduct of their office.  If state enactments were allowed to condition or control certain actions of federal legislators, accountability would be blurred, with the legislators having the excuse of saying that they did not act in the exercise of their best judgment but simply in conformance with a state mandate.  As noted in the concurring opinion in 
				<em>
					Thornton
				</em>
				, [n]othing in the Constitution or The Federalist Papers … supports the idea of state interference with the most basic relation between the National Government and its citizens, the selection of legislative representatives.  514 U. S.,

Yet that is just what Missouri seeks to do through its lawto wield the power granted to it by the Elections Clause to handicap those who seek federal office by affixing pejorative labels next to their names on the ballot if they do not pledge to support the States preferred position on a certain issue.

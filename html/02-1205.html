Petitioners, African-American former employees of respondent, filed a class action alleging violations of §1981, as amended by the Civil Rights Act of 1991.  Respondent sought summary judgment, claiming that the applicable state 2-year statute of limitations barred their claims, but the District Court held that petitioners wrongful discharge, refusal to transfer, and hostile work environment claims arose under the 1991 Act and therefore are governed by §1658.  The Seventh Circuit reversed, concluding that §1658 does not apply to a cause of action based on a post-1990 amendment to a pre-existing statute.

				(a) Because the meaning of arising under in §1658 is ambiguous, Congress intent must be ascertained by looking beyond the sections bare text to the context in which it was enacted and the purposes it was designed to accomplish.  Pp. 57.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				(b) Before §1658s enactment, Congress failure to pass a uniform limitations statute for federal causes of action had created a void that spawned a vast amount of litigation.  The settled practice of borrowing state statutes of limitations generated a host of issues, such as which of the forum States statutes was the most appropriate, whether the forum States law or that of the situs of the injury controlled, and when a statute of limitations could be tolled.  Congress was keenly aware of these problems, and a central purpose of §1658 was to minimize the need for borrowing.  That purpose would not be served if §1658 were interpreted to reach only entirely new sections of the United States Code.  An amendment to an existing statute is no less an Act of Congress than a new, stand-alone statute.  What matters is the new rights of action and corresponding liabilities created by the enactment.  Thus, a cause of action aris[es] under an Act of Congress enacted after December 1, 1990and therefore is governed by §1658s 4-year statute of limitationsif the plaintiffs claim against the defendant was made possible by a post-1990 enactment.  This construction best serves Congress interest in alleviating the uncertainty inherent in the practice of borrowing state statutes of limitations, while protecting litigants settled expectations by applying only to causes of actions not available until after December 1, 1990.  It also is consistent with the common usage of arise and with this Courts interpretations of arising under as it is used in statutes governing the scope of federal subject-matter jurisdiction.  Pp. 713.

				(c) Petitioners hostile work environment, wrongful termination, and failure-to-transfer claims all ar[rose] under the 1991 Act in the sense that they were made possible by that Act.  The 1991 Act overturned this Courts decision in

				Petitioners are African-American former employees of respondents Chicago manufacturing division.  On November 26, 1994, petitioners filed this class action alleging violations of their rights under §1981, as amended by the 1991 Act.  Specifically, the three classes of plaintiffs alleged that they were subjected to a racially hostile work environment, given an inferior employee status, and wrongfully terminated or denied a transfer in connection with the closing of the Chicago plant.  Respondent sought summary judgment on the ground that petitioners claims are barred by the applicable Illinois statute of limitations because they arose more than two years before the complaint was filed.  Petitioners responded that their claims are governed by §1658, which provides: Except as otherwise provided by law, a civil action arising under an Act of Congress enacted after the date of enactment of this section may not be commenced later than 4 years after the cause of action accrues.

, but its basic coverage did not change prior to 1991.  As first enacted, §1981 provided in relevant part that all persons [within the jurisdiction of the United States] shall have the same right in every State and Territory to make and enforce contracts … as is enjoyed by white citizens.

, that the statutory right to make and enforce contracts did not protect against harassing conduct that occurred after the formation of the contract.  Under that holding, it is clear that petitioners hostile work environment, wrongful discharge, and refusal to transfer claims do not state violations of the original version of §1981.  In 1991, however, Congress responded to 
				<em>

				 by adding a new subsection to §1981 that defines the term make and enforce contacts to include the termination of contracts and the enjoyment of all benefits, privileges, terms, and conditions of the contractual relationship.

				  In its view, the plain text of §1658 compels the conclusion that, whenever Congress, after December 1990, passes legislation that creates a new cause of action, the catch-all statute of limitations applies to that cause of action.

				, at 464.  The 1991 amendment to §1981 falls within that category, the court reasoned, because it opened the door to claims of postcontract discrimination that, under

				The District Court certified its ruling for an interlocutory appeal pursuant to 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1292.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1292(b)</a>, and the Court of Appeals reversed.  305 F. 3d 717 (CA7 2002).  It concluded that §1658 applies only when an act of Congress creates a wholly new cause of action, one that does not depend on the continued existence of a statutory cause of action previously enacted and kept in force by the amendment.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 726.  The 1991 amendment does not satisfy that test, the court explained, because the text of §1981(b) simply cannot stand on its own; instead, it merely redefines a term in the original statute without altering the text that provides the basic right of recovery for an individual whose constitutional rights have been violated.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court of Appeals conclusion that §1658 does not apply to a cause of action based on a post-1990 amendment to a pre-existing statute is consistent with decisions from the Third and Eighth Circuits.  See

				Petitioners, supported by the United States as 
				<em>
					amicus curiae,
				</em>
				 argue that reversal is required by the plain language of §1658, which prescribes a 4-year statute of limitations for civil action[s] arising under an Act of Congress enacted after December 1, 1990.  They point out that the 1991 Act is, by its own terms, an Act of Congress that was enacted after December 1, 1990.  See Pub. L. 102166, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">105</a>Stat.
1071.  Moreover, citing our interpretations of the term arising under in other federal statutes and in Article III of the Constitution, petitioners maintain that their causes of action arose under the 1991 Act.

				Respondent concedes that the 1991 Act qualifies as an Act of Congress enacted after 1991, but argues that the meaning of the term arising under is not so clear.  We agree.  Although our expositions of the arising under concept in other contexts are helpful in interpreting the term as it is used in §1658, they do not point the way to one obvious answer.  For example, Chief Justice Marshalls statement that a case arises under federal law for purposes of Article III jurisdiction whenever federal law forms an ingredient of the original cause, 
				<em>
					Osborn
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Bank of United States,
				</em>
				 9 Wheat. 738, 823 (1824), supports petitioners view that their causes of action arose under the 1991 amendment to §1981, because the 1991 Act clearly forms an ingredient of petitioners claims.

            </a>
				  But the same could be said of the original version of §1981.  Thus, reliance on 
				<em>
					Osborn
				</em>
				 would suggest that petitioners causes of action arose under the pre-1991 version of §1981 as well as under
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				the 1991 Act, just as a cause of action may arise under both state and federal law.  As the Court of Appeals observed, however, §1658 does not expressly address the eventuality when a cause of action arises under two different Acts, one enacted before and one enacted after the effective date of §1658.  305 F. 3d, at 724.

				Petitioners argue that we should look not at Article III, but at how Congress has used the term arising under in federal legislation.  They point in particular to the statutes in Title 28 that define the scope of federal subject-matter jurisdiction.

            </a>
				 but argue that the placement of §1658 in Title 28 suggests that Congress meant to invoke our interpretation of the neighboring jurisdictional rules.  We hesitate to place too much significance on the location of a statute in the United States Code.  But even if we accepted the proposition that Congress intended the term arising under to have the same meaning in §1658 as in other sections of Title 28, it would not follow that the text is unambiguous.  We have said that [t]he most familiar definition of the statutory arising under limitation is the statement by Justice Holmes that a suit  arises under the law that creates the cause of action, 

On the other hand, it also could support respondents claim that petitioners causes of action arose under the original version of §1981, which contains the operative language setting forth the elements of their claims.  Justice Holmes formulation even could support the view that petitioners claims arose under both versions of the statute.  Cf.

				  Even when courts were able to identify the appropriate state statute, limitation borrowing resulted in uncertainty for both plaintiffs and defendants, as a plaintiff alleging a federal claim in State A would find herself barred by the local statute of limitations while a plaintiff raising precisely the same claim in State B would be permitted to proceed.

				  As we have noted, §1658 applies only to claims arising under statutes enacted after December 1, 1990, but it otherwise follows the Committees recommendation.  The House Report accompanying the final bill confirms that Congress was keenly aware of the problems associated with the practice of borrowing state statutes of limitations, and that a central purpose of §1658 was to minimize the occasions for that practice.

				  The interpretation favored by respondent and the Court of Appeals subverts that goal by restricting §1658 to cases in which the plaintiffs cause of action is based solely on a post-1990 statute that  establishes a new cause of action without reference to preexisting law.   305 F. 3d, at 727 (quoting 
				<em>
					Zubi
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					AT&amp;T Corp.
				</em>
				, 219 F. 3d, at 222).  On that view, §1658 would apply only to a small fraction of post-1990 enactments.  Congress routinely creates new rights of action by amending existing statutes, and [a]ltering statutory definitions, or adding new definitions of terms previously undefined, is a common way of amending statutes.  
				<em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">308</a> (1994)
.  Nothing in the text or history of §1658 supports an interpretation that would limit its reach to entirely new sections of the United States Code.  An amendment to an existing statute is no less an Act of Congress than a new, stand-alone statute.  What matters is the substantive effect of an enactmentthe creation of new rights of action and corresponding liabilitiesnot the format in which it appears in the Code.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court of Appeals reasoned that §1658 must be given a narrow scope lest it disrupt litigants settled expectations.  The court observed that Congress refused to make §1658 retroactive because,  with respect to many statutes that have no explicit limitations provision, the relevant limitations period has long since been resolved by judicial decision,  and  retroactively imposing a four year statute of limitations on legislation that the courts have previously ruled is subject to a six month limitations period in one [State], and a ten year period in another, would threaten to disrupt the settled expectations of … many parties.   305 F. 3d, at 725 (quoting H. R. Rep. No. 101734, p. 24 (1990)).  Concerns about settled expectations provide a valid reason to reject an interpretation of §1658 under which any new amendment to federal law would suffice to trigger the 4-year statute of limitations, regardless of whether the plaintiffs claim would have been availableand subject to a state statute of limitationsprior to December 1, 1990.  Such concerns do not, however, carry any weight against the reading of §1658 adopted by the District Court and urged by petitioners, under which the catchall limitations period applies only to causes of action that 
				<em>
					were not available
				</em>
				 until after §1658 was enacted.  If a cause of action did not exist prior to 1990, potential litigants could not have formed settled expectations as to the relevant statute of limitations that would then be disrupted by application of §1658.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				
				We conclude that a cause of action aris[es] under an Act of Congress enacted after December 1, 1990and therefore is governed by §1658s 4-year statute of limitationsif the plaintiffs claim against the defendant was made possible by a post-1990 enactment.  That construction best serves Congress interest in alleviating the uncertainty inherent in the practice of borrowing state statutes of limitations while at the same time protecting settled interests.  It spares federal judges and litigants the need to identify the appropriate state statute of limitations to apply to new claims but leaves in place the borrowed limitations periods for preexisting causes of action, with respect to which the difficult work already has been done.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Interpreting §1658 to apply whenever a post-1990 enactment creates a new right to maintain an action also is consistent with the common usage of the word arise to mean come into being; originate

            </a>
				  Finally, that construction is consistent with our interpretations of the term arising under as it is used in statutes governing the scope of federal subject-matter jurisdiction.  By contrast, nothing in our case law supports an interpretation as narrow as that endorsed by the Court of Appeals, under which arising under means something akin to based solely upon.  We should avoid reading §1658 in such a way as to give the familiar statutory language a meaning foreign to every other context in which it is used.

						 The House Report notes a number of practical problems created by the practice of borrowing statutes of limitations:  It obligates judges and lawyers to determine the most analogous state law claim; it imposes uncertainty on litigants; reliance on varying state laws results in undesirable variance among the federal courts and disrupts the development of federal doctrine on the suspension of limitation periods.   H.

						 Indeed, respondent concedes that, [i]n this case, the nature of the new claim is clear.

						  Respondent argues that the question whether a plaintiffs cause of action would have been viable prior to a post-1991 amendment will be particularly complicated in cases in which there was a split of authority regarding the scope of the original statute.  In such cases, courts will have to determine whether the amendment clarified existing law or created new rights and liabilities.  Such analysis is hardly beyond the judicial ken: Courts must answer precisely the same question when deciding whether an amendment may be applied retrospectively.  See, e.g., Hughes Aircraft Co. v. United States ex rel. Schumer, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/520/939" class="subref" title="subref">520 U. S. 939</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">948</a>950 (1997)
.  The substantial overlap between the retroactivity and statute-of-limitations inquiries undermines respondents claim that application of §1658 to post-1991 amendments will generate additional work for federal judges.

				Petitioners are African-American former employees of respondents Chicago manufacturing division.  On November 26, 1994, petitioners filed this class action alleging violations of their rights under §1981, as amended by the 1991 Act.  Specifically, the three classes of plaintiffs alleged that they were subjected to a racially hostile work environment, given an inferior employee status, and wrongfully terminated or denied a transfer in connection with the closing of the Chicago plant.  Respondent sought summary judgment on the ground that petitioners claims are barred by the applicable Illinois statute of limitations because they arose more than two years before the complaint was filed.  Petitioners responded that their claims are governed by §1658, which provides: Except as otherwise provided by law, a civil action arising under an Act of Congress enacted after the date of enactment of this section may not be commenced later than 4 years after the cause of action accrues.

In 1991, however, Congress responded to

				, at 726.  The 1991 amendment does not satisfy that test, the court explained, because the text of §1981(b) simply cannot stand on its own; instead, it merely redefines a term in the original statute without altering the text that provides the basic right of recovery for an individual whose constitutional rights have been violated.

				Petitioners, supported by the United States as 
				<em>
					amicus curiae,
				</em>
				 argue that reversal is required by the plain language of §1658, which prescribes a 4-year statute of limitations for civil action[s] arising under an Act of Congress enacted after December 1, 1990.  They point out that the 1991 Act is, by its own terms, an Act of Congress that was enacted after December 1, 1990.  See Pub. L. 102166, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">105</a>Stat.
1071.  Moreover, citing our interpretations of the term arising under in other federal statutes and in Article III of the Constitution, petitioners maintain that their causes of action arose under the 1991 Act.

				Respondent concedes that the 1991 Act qualifies as an Act of Congress enacted after 1991, but argues that the meaning of the term arising under is not so clear.  We agree.  Although our expositions of the arising under concept in other contexts are helpful in interpreting the term as it is used in §1658, they do not point the way to one obvious answer.  For example, Chief Justice Marshalls statement that a case arises under federal law for purposes of Article III jurisdiction whenever federal law forms an ingredient of the original cause, 
				<em>
					Osborn
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Bank of United States,
				</em>
				 9 Wheat. 738, 823 (1824), supports petitioners view that their causes of action arose under the 1991 amendment to §1981, because the 1991 Act clearly forms an ingredient of petitioners claims.

				  But the same could be said of the original version of §1981.  Thus, reliance on 
				<em>
					Osborn
				</em>
				 would suggest that petitioners causes of action arose under the pre-1991 version of §1981 as well as under
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				the 1991 Act, just as a cause of action may arise under both state and federal law.  As the Court of Appeals observed, however, §1658 does not expressly address the eventuality when a cause of action arises under two different Acts, one enacted before and one enacted after the effective date of §1658.  305 F. 3d, at 724.

				Petitioners argue that we should look not at Article III, but at how Congress has used the term arising under in federal legislation.  They point in particular to the statutes in Title 28 that define the scope of federal subject-matter jurisdiction.

				 but argue that the placement of §1658 in Title 28 suggests that Congress meant to invoke our interpretation of the neighboring jurisdictional rules.  We hesitate to place too much significance on the location of a statute in the United States Code.  But even if we accepted the proposition that Congress intended the term arising under to have the same meaning in §1658 as in other sections of Title 28, it would not follow that the text is unambiguous.  We have said that [t]he most familiar definition of the statutory arising under limitation is the statement by Justice Holmes that a suit  arises under the law that creates the cause of action, 

).  On one hand, that statement could support petitioners view that their causes of action arose under the 1991 Act, which created a statutory right that did not previously exist.  On the other hand, it also could support respondents claim that petitioners causes of action arose under the original version of §1981, which contains the operative language setting forth the elements of their claims.  Justice Holmes formulation even could support the view that petitioners claims arose under both versions of the statute.  Cf.

				  Even when courts were able to identify the appropriate state statute, limitation borrowing resulted in uncertainty for both plaintiffs and defendants, as a plaintiff alleging a federal claim in State A would find herself barred by the local statute of limitations while a plaintiff raising precisely the same claim in State B would be permitted to proceed.

				  As we have noted, §1658 applies only to claims arising under statutes enacted after December 1, 1990, but it otherwise follows the Committees recommendation.  The House Report accompanying the final bill confirms that Congress was keenly aware of the problems associated with the practice of borrowing state statutes of limitations, and that a central purpose of §1658 was to minimize the occasions for that practice.

				  The interpretation favored by respondent and the Court of Appeals subverts that goal by restricting §1658 to cases in which the plaintiffs cause of action is based solely on a post-1990 statute that  establishes a new cause of action without reference to preexisting law.   305 F. 3d, at 727 (quoting 
				<em>
					Zubi
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					AT&amp;T Corp.
				</em>
				, 219 F. 3d, at 222).  On that view, §1658 would apply only to a small fraction of post-1990 enactments.  Congress routinely creates new rights of action by amending existing statutes, and [a]ltering statutory definitions, or adding new definitions of terms previously undefined, is a common way of amending statutes.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">308</a> (1994)
.  Nothing in the text or history of §1658 supports an interpretation that would limit its reach to entirely new sections of the United States Code.  An amendment to an existing statute is no less an Act of Congress than a new, stand-alone statute.  What matters is the substantive effect of an enactmentthe creation of new rights of action and corresponding liabilitiesnot the format in which it appears in the Code.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court of Appeals reasoned that §1658 must be given a narrow scope lest it disrupt litigants settled expectations.  The court observed that Congress refused to make §1658 retroactive because,  with respect to many statutes that have no explicit limitations provision, the relevant limitations period has long since been resolved by judicial decision,  and  retroactively imposing a four year statute of limitations on legislation that the courts have previously ruled is subject to a six month limitations period in one [State], and a ten year period in another, would threaten to disrupt the settled expectations of … many parties.   305 F. 3d, at 725 (quoting H. R. Rep. No. 101734, p. 24 (1990)).  Concerns about settled expectations provide a valid reason to reject an interpretation of §1658 under which any new amendment to federal law would suffice to trigger the 4-year statute of limitations, regardless of whether the plaintiffs claim would have been availableand subject to a state statute of limitationsprior to December 1, 1990.  Such concerns do not, however, carry any weight against the reading of §1658 adopted by the District Court and urged by petitioners, under which the catchall limitations period applies only to causes of action that 
				<em>
					were not available
				</em>
				 until after §1658 was enacted.  If a cause of action did not exist prior to 1990, potential litigants could not have formed settled expectations as to the relevant statute of limitations that would then be disrupted by application of §1658.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				
				We conclude that a cause of action aris[es] under an Act of Congress enacted after December 1, 1990and therefore is governed by §1658s 4-year statute of limitationsif the plaintiffs claim against the defendant was made possible by a post-1990 enactment.  That construction best serves Congress interest in alleviating the uncertainty inherent in the practice of borrowing state statutes of limitations while at the same time protecting settled interests.  It spares federal judges and litigants the need to identify the appropriate state statute of limitations to apply to new claims but leaves in place the borrowed limitations periods for preexisting causes of action, with respect to which the difficult work already has been done.

				Interpreting §1658 to apply whenever a post-1990 enactment creates a new right to maintain an action also is consistent with the common usage of the word arise to mean come into being; originate

            </a>
				  Finally, that construction is consistent with our interpretations of the term arising under as it is used in statutes governing the scope of federal subject-matter jurisdiction.  By contrast, nothing in our case law supports an interpretation as narrow as that endorsed by the Court of Appeals, under which arising under means something akin to based solely upon.  We should avoid reading §1658 in such a way as to give the familiar statutory language a meaning foreign to every other context in which it is used.

				 respondent has posited various hypothetical cases in which it might be difficult to determine whether a particular claim arose under the amended or the unamended version of a statute.  Similarly, the Court of Appeals reasoned that applying §1658 to post-1990 amendments could be problematic in some cases because  the line between an amendment that modifies an existing right and one that creates a new right is often difficult to draw.   305 F. 3d, at 725 (quoting

We are not persuaded that any guess work, 305 F. 3d, at 725, is required to determine whether the plaintiff has alleged a violation of the relevant statute as it stood prior to December 1, 1990, or whether her claims necessarily depend on a subsequent amendment.

						  Respondent argues that the question whether a plaintiffs cause of action would have been viable prior to a post-1991 amendment will be particularly complicated in cases in which there was a split of authority regarding the scope of the original statute.  In such cases, courts will have to determine whether the amendment clarified existing law or created new rights and liabilities.  Such analysis is hardly beyond the judicial ken: Courts must answer precisely the same question when deciding whether an amendment may be applied retrospectively.  See, e.g., Hughes Aircraft Co. v. United States ex rel. Schumer, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/520/939" class="subref" title="subref">520 U. S. 939</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">948</a>950 (1997)
.  The substantial overlap between the retroactivity and statute-of-limitations inquiries undermines respondents claim that application of §1658 to post-1991 amendments will generate additional work for federal judges.

				Petitioners are African-American former employees of respondents Chicago manufacturing division.  On November 26, 1994, petitioners filed this class action alleging violations of their rights under §1981, as amended by the 1991 Act.  Specifically, the three classes of plaintiffs alleged that they were subjected to a racially hostile work environment, given an inferior employee status, and wrongfully terminated or denied a transfer in connection with the closing of the Chicago plant.  Respondent sought summary judgment on the ground that petitioners claims are barred by the applicable Illinois statute of limitations because they arose more than two years before the complaint was filed.  Petitioners responded that their claims are governed by §1658, which provides: Except as otherwise provided by law, a civil action arising under an Act of Congress enacted after the date of enactment of this section may not be commenced later than 4 years after the cause of action accrues.

In 1991, however, Congress responded to

The 1991 amendment does not satisfy that test, the court explained, because the text of §1981(b) simply cannot stand on its own; instead, it merely redefines a term in the original statute without altering the text that provides the basic right of recovery for an individual whose constitutional rights have been violated.

				Petitioners, supported by the United States as 
				<em>
					amicus curiae,
				</em>
				 argue that reversal is required by the plain language of §1658, which prescribes a 4-year statute of limitations for civil action[s] arising under an Act of Congress enacted after December 1, 1990.  They point out that the 1991 Act is, by its own terms, an Act of Congress that was enacted after December 1, 1990.  See Pub. L. 102166, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">105</a>Stat.
1071.  Moreover, citing our interpretations of the term arising under in other federal statutes and in Article III of the Constitution, petitioners maintain that their causes of action arose under the 1991 Act.

				Respondent concedes that the 1991 Act qualifies as an Act of Congress enacted after 1991, but argues that the meaning of the term arising under is not so clear.  We agree.  Although our expositions of the arising under concept in other contexts are helpful in interpreting the term as it is used in §1658, they do not point the way to one obvious answer.  For example, Chief Justice Marshalls statement that a case arises under federal law for purposes of Article III jurisdiction whenever federal law forms an ingredient of the original cause, 
				<em>
					Osborn
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Bank of United States,
				</em>
				 9 Wheat. 738, 823 (1824), supports petitioners view that their causes of action arose under the 1991 amendment to §1981, because the 1991 Act clearly forms an ingredient of petitioners claims.

            </a>
				  But the same could be said of the original version of §1981.  Thus, reliance on 
				<em>
					Osborn
				</em>
				 would suggest that petitioners causes of action arose under the pre-1991 version of §1981 as well as under
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				the 1991 Act, just as a cause of action may arise under both state and federal law.  As the Court of Appeals observed, however, §1658 does not expressly address the eventuality when a cause of action arises under two different Acts, one enacted before and one enacted after the effective date of §1658.  305 F. 3d, at 724.

				Petitioners argue that we should look not at Article III, but at how Congress has used the term arising under in federal legislation.  They point in particular to the statutes in Title 28 that define the scope of federal subject-matter jurisdiction.

				 but argue that the placement of §1658 in Title 28 suggests that Congress meant to invoke our interpretation of the neighboring jurisdictional rules.  We hesitate to place too much significance on the location of a statute in the United States Code.  But even if we accepted the proposition that Congress intended the term arising under to have the same meaning in §1658 as in other sections of Title 28, it would not follow that the text is unambiguous.  We have said that [t]he most familiar definition of the statutory arising under limitation is the statement by Justice Holmes that a suit  arises under the law that creates the cause of action, 

).  On one hand, that statement could support petitioners view that their causes of action arose under the 1991 Act, which created a statutory right that did not previously exist.  On the other hand, it also could support respondents claim that petitioners causes of action arose under the original version of §1981, which contains the operative language setting forth the elements of their claims.  Justice Holmes formulation even could support the view that petitioners claims arose under both versions of the statute.  Cf.

In order to ascertain Congress intent, therefore, we must look beyond the bare text of §1658 to the context in which it was enacted and the purposes it was designed to accomplish.

				  Even when courts were able to identify the appropriate state statute, limitation borrowing resulted in uncertainty for both plaintiffs and defendants, as a plaintiff alleging a federal claim in State A would find herself barred by the local statute of limitations while a plaintiff raising precisely the same claim in State B would be permitted to proceed.

				  The interpretation favored by respondent and the Court of Appeals subverts that goal by restricting §1658 to cases in which the plaintiffs cause of action is based solely on a post-1990 statute that  establishes a new cause of action without reference to preexisting law.   305 F. 3d, at 727 (quoting 
				<em>
					Zubi
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					AT&amp;T Corp.
				</em>
				, 219 F. 3d, at 222).  On that view, §1658 would apply only to a small fraction of post-1990 enactments.

.  Nothing in the text or history of §1658 supports an interpretation that would limit its reach to entirely new sections of the United States Code.  An amendment to an existing statute is no less an Act of Congress than a new, stand-alone statute.  What matters is the substantive effect of an enactmentthe creation of new rights of action and corresponding liabilitiesnot the format in which it appears in the Code.

				The Court of Appeals reasoned that §1658 must be given a narrow scope lest it disrupt litigants settled expectations.  The court observed that Congress refused to make §1658 retroactive because,  with respect to many statutes that have no explicit limitations provision, the relevant limitations period has long since been resolved by judicial decision,  and  retroactively imposing a four year statute of limitations on legislation that the courts have previously ruled is subject to a six month limitations period in one [State], and a ten year period in another, would threaten to disrupt the settled expectations of … many parties.   305 F. 3d, at 725 (quoting H. R. Rep. No. 101734, p. 24 (1990)).  Concerns about settled expectations provide a valid reason to reject an interpretation of §1658 under which any new amendment to federal law would suffice to trigger the 4-year statute of limitations, regardless of whether the plaintiffs claim would have been availableand subject to a state statute of limitationsprior to December 1, 1990.  Such concerns do not, however, carry any weight against the reading of §1658 adopted by the District Court and urged by petitioners, under which the catchall limitations period applies only to causes of action that 
				<em>
					were not available
				</em>
				 until after §1658 was enacted.  If a cause of action did not exist prior to 1990, potential litigants could not have formed settled expectations as to the relevant statute of limitations that would then be disrupted by application of §1658.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				
				We conclude that a cause of action aris[es] under an Act of Congress enacted after December 1, 1990and therefore is governed by §1658s 4-year statute of limitationsif the plaintiffs claim against the defendant was made possible by a post-1990 enactment.  That construction best serves Congress interest in alleviating the uncertainty inherent in the practice of borrowing state statutes of limitations while at the same time protecting settled interests.  It spares federal judges and litigants the need to identify the appropriate state statute of limitations to apply to new claims but leaves in place the borrowed limitations periods for preexisting causes of action, with respect to which the difficult work already has been done.

				Interpreting §1658 to apply whenever a post-1990 enactment creates a new right to maintain an action also is consistent with the common usage of the word arise to mean come into being; originate

            </a>
				  Finally, that construction is consistent with our interpretations of the term arising under as it is used in statutes governing the scope of federal subject-matter jurisdiction.  By contrast, nothing in our case law supports an interpretation as narrow as that endorsed by the Court of Appeals, under which arising under means something akin to based solely upon.  We should avoid reading §1658 in such a way as to give the familiar statutory language a meaning foreign to every other context in which it is used.

				 respondent has posited various hypothetical cases in which it might be difficult to determine whether a particular claim arose under the amended or the unamended version of a statute.  Similarly, the Court of Appeals reasoned that applying §1658 to post-1990 amendments could be problematic in some cases because  the line between an amendment that modifies an existing right and one that creates a new right is often difficult to draw.   305 F. 3d, at 725 (quoting 
				<em>
					Zubi
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					AT&amp;T Corp.

				, 219 F. 3d, at 224).  We are not persuaded that any guess work, 305 F. 3d, at 725, is required to determine whether the plaintiff has alleged a violation of the relevant statute as it stood prior to December 1, 1990, or whether her claims necessarily depend on a subsequent amendment.  Courts routinely make such determinations when dealing with amendments (such as the 1991 amendment to §1981) that do not apply retroactively.

						  Respondent argues that the question whether a plaintiffs cause of action would have been viable prior to a post-1991 amendment will be particularly complicated in cases in which there was a split of authority regarding the scope of the original statute.  In such cases, courts will have to determine whether the amendment clarified existing law or created new rights and liabilities.  Such analysis is hardly beyond the judicial ken: Courts must answer precisely the same question when deciding whether an amendment may be applied retrospectively.  See, e.g., Hughes Aircraft Co. v. United States ex rel. Schumer, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/520/939" class="subref" title="subref">520 U. S. 939</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">948</a>950 (1997)
.  The substantial overlap between the retroactivity and statute-of-limitations inquiries undermines respondents claim that application of §1658 to post-1991 amendments will generate additional work for federal judges.

				Petitioners are African-American former employees of respondents Chicago manufacturing division.  On November 26, 1994, petitioners filed this class action alleging violations of their rights under §1981, as amended by the 1991 Act.  Specifically, the three classes of plaintiffs alleged that they were subjected to a racially hostile work environment, given an inferior employee status, and wrongfully terminated or denied a transfer in connection with the closing of the Chicago plant.  Respondent sought summary judgment on the ground that petitioners claims are barred by the applicable Illinois statute of limitations because they arose more than two years before the complaint was filed.  Petitioners responded that their claims are governed by §1658, which provides: Except as otherwise provided by law, a civil action arising under an Act of Congress enacted after the date of enactment of this section may not be commenced later than 4 years after the cause of action accrues.

				Petitioners, supported by the United States as 
				<em>
					amicus curiae,
				</em>
				 argue that reversal is required by the plain language of §1658, which prescribes a 4-year statute of limitations for civil action[s] arising under an Act of Congress enacted after December 1, 1990.  They point out that the 1991 Act is, by its own terms, an Act of Congress that was enacted after December 1, 1990.  See Pub. L. 102166, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">105</a>Stat.

				Respondent concedes that the 1991 Act qualifies as an Act of Congress enacted after 1991, but argues that the meaning of the term arising under is not so clear.  We agree.  Although our expositions of the arising under concept in other contexts are helpful in interpreting the term as it is used in §1658, they do not point the way to one obvious answer.  For example, Chief Justice Marshalls statement that a case arises under federal law for purposes of Article III jurisdiction whenever federal law forms an ingredient of the original cause, 
				<em>
					Osborn
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Bank of United States,
				</em>
				 9 Wheat. 738, 823 (1824), supports petitioners view that their causes of action arose under the 1991 amendment to §1981, because the 1991 Act clearly forms an ingredient of petitioners claims.

				  But the same could be said of the original version of §1981.  Thus, reliance on 
				<em>

				</em>
				 would suggest that petitioners causes of action arose under the pre-1991 version of §1981 as well as under
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				the 1991 Act, just as a cause of action may arise under both state and federal law.  As the Court of Appeals observed, however, §1658 does not expressly address the eventuality when a cause of action arises under two different Acts, one enacted before and one enacted after the effective date of §1658.  305 F. 3d, at 724.

				Petitioners argue that we should look not at Article III, but at how Congress has used the term arising under in federal legislation.  They point in particular to the statutes in Title 28 that define the scope of federal subject-matter jurisdiction.

				 but argue that the placement of §1658 in Title 28 suggests that Congress meant to invoke our interpretation of the neighboring jurisdictional rules.  We hesitate to place too much significance on the location of a statute in the United States Code.  But even if we accepted the proposition that Congress intended the term arising under to have the same meaning in §1658 as in other sections of Title 28, it would not follow that the text is unambiguous.  We have said that [t]he most familiar definition of the statutory arising under limitation is the statement by Justice Holmes that a suit  arises under the law that creates the cause of action, 

).  On one hand, that statement could support petitioners view that their causes of action arose under the 1991 Act, which created a statutory right that did not previously exist.  On the other hand, it also could support respondents claim that petitioners causes of action arose under the original version of §1981, which contains the operative language setting forth the elements of their claims.  Justice Holmes formulation even could support the view that petitioners claims arose under both versions of the statute.  Cf.

				  Even when courts were able to identify the appropriate state statute, limitation borrowing resulted in uncertainty for both plaintiffs and defendants, as a plaintiff alleging a federal claim in State A would find herself barred by the local statute of limitations while a plaintiff raising precisely the same claim in State B would be permitted to proceed.

				  The interpretation favored by respondent and the Court of Appeals subverts that goal by restricting §1658 to cases in which the plaintiffs cause of action is based solely on a post-1990 statute that  establishes a new cause of action without reference to preexisting law.   305 F. 3d, at 727 (quoting 
				<em>
					Zubi
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					AT&amp;T Corp.
				</em>
				, 219 F. 3d, at 222).  On that view, §1658 would apply only to a small fraction of post-1990 enactments.  Congress routinely creates new rights of action by amending existing statutes, and [a]ltering statutory definitions, or adding new definitions of terms previously undefined, is a common way of amending statutes.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">308</a> (1994)
.  Nothing in the text or history of §1658 supports an interpretation that would limit its reach to entirely new sections of the United States Code.  An amendment to an existing statute is no less an Act of Congress than a new, stand-alone statute.  What matters is the substantive effect of an enactmentthe creation of new rights of action and corresponding liabilitiesnot the format in which it appears in the Code.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court of Appeals reasoned that §1658 must be given a narrow scope lest it disrupt litigants settled expectations.  The court observed that Congress refused to make §1658 retroactive because,  with respect to many statutes that have no explicit limitations provision, the relevant limitations period has long since been resolved by judicial decision,  and  retroactively imposing a four year statute of limitations on legislation that the courts have previously ruled is subject to a six month limitations period in one [State], and a ten year period in another, would threaten to disrupt the settled expectations of … many parties.   305 F. 3d, at 725 (quoting H. R. Rep. No. 101734, p. 24 (1990)).  Concerns about settled expectations provide a valid reason to reject an interpretation of §1658 under which any new amendment to federal law would suffice to trigger the 4-year statute of limitations, regardless of whether the plaintiffs claim would have been availableand subject to a state statute of limitationsprior to December 1, 1990.  Such concerns do not, however, carry any weight against the reading of §1658 adopted by the District Court and urged by petitioners, under which the catchall limitations period applies only to causes of action that 
				<em>
					were not available
				</em>
				 until after §1658 was enacted.  If a cause of action did not exist prior to 1990, potential litigants could not have formed settled expectations as to the relevant statute of limitations that would then be disrupted by application of §1658.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				
				We conclude that a cause of action aris[es] under an Act of Congress enacted after December 1, 1990and therefore is governed by §1658s 4-year statute of limitationsif the plaintiffs claim against the defendant was made possible by a post-1990 enactment.  That construction best serves Congress interest in alleviating the uncertainty inherent in the practice of borrowing state statutes of limitations while at the same time protecting settled interests.  It spares federal judges and litigants the need to identify the appropriate state statute of limitations to apply to new claims but leaves in place the borrowed limitations periods for preexisting causes of action, with respect to which the difficult work already has been done.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Interpreting §1658 to apply whenever a post-1990 enactment creates a new right to maintain an action also is consistent with the common usage of the word arise to mean come into being; originate

            </a>
				  Finally, that construction is consistent with our interpretations of the term arising under as it is used in statutes governing the scope of federal subject-matter jurisdiction.  By contrast, nothing in our case law supports an interpretation as narrow as that endorsed by the Court of Appeals, under which arising under means something akin to based solely upon.  We should avoid reading §1658 in such a way as to give the familiar statutory language a meaning foreign to every other context in which it is used.

				 respondent has posited various hypothetical cases in which it might be difficult to determine whether a particular claim arose under the amended or the unamended version of a statute.  Similarly, the Court of Appeals reasoned that applying §1658 to post-1990 amendments could be problematic in some cases because  the line between an amendment that modifies an existing right and one that creates a new right is often difficult to draw.   305 F. 3d, at 725 (quoting

We are not persuaded that any guess work, 305 F. 3d, at 725, is required to determine whether the plaintiff has alleged a violation of the relevant statute as it stood prior to December 1, 1990, or whether her claims necessarily depend on a subsequent amendment.

All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every State and Territory to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be subject to like punishment, pains, penalties, taxes, licenses, and exactions of every kind, and to no other.


(b) Make and enforce contracts defined

						 Indeed, respondent concedes that, [i]n this case, the nature of the new claim is clear.

						  Respondent argues that the question whether a plaintiffs cause of action would have been viable prior to a post-1991 amendment will be particularly complicated in cases in which there was a split of authority regarding the scope of the original statute.  In such cases, courts will have to determine whether the amendment clarified existing law or created new rights and liabilities.  Such analysis is hardly beyond the judicial ken: Courts must answer precisely the same question when deciding whether an amendment may be applied retrospectively.  See, e.g., Hughes Aircraft Co. v. United States ex rel. Schumer, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/520/939" class="subref" title="subref">520 U. S. 939</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">948</a>950 (1997)
.  The substantial overlap between the retroactivity and statute-of-limitations inquiries undermines respondents claim that application of §1658 to post-1991 amendments will generate additional work for federal judges.

				Petitioners are African-American former employees of respondents Chicago manufacturing division.  On November 26, 1994, petitioners filed this class action alleging violations of their rights under §1981, as amended by the 1991 Act.  Specifically, the three classes of plaintiffs alleged that they were subjected to a racially hostile work environment, given an inferior employee status, and wrongfully terminated or denied a transfer in connection with the closing of the Chicago plant.  Respondent sought summary judgment on the ground that petitioners claims are barred by the applicable Illinois statute of limitations because they arose more than two years before the complaint was filed.  Petitioners responded that their claims are governed by §1658, which provides: Except as otherwise provided by law, a civil action arising under an Act of Congress enacted after the date of enactment of this section may not be commenced later than 4 years after the cause of action accrues.

				, at 726.  The 1991 amendment does not satisfy that test, the court explained, because the text of §1981(b) simply cannot stand on its own; instead, it merely redefines a term in the original statute without altering the text that provides the basic right of recovery for an individual whose constitutional rights have been violated.

				Respondent concedes that the 1991 Act qualifies as an Act of Congress enacted after 1991, but argues that the meaning of the term arising under is not so clear.  We agree.  Although our expositions of the arising under concept in other contexts are helpful in interpreting the term as it is used in §1658, they do not point the way to one obvious answer.  For example, Chief Justice Marshalls statement that a case arises under federal law for purposes of Article III jurisdiction whenever federal law forms an ingredient of the original cause, 
				<em>

				 v. 
				<em>
					Bank of United States,

				 9 Wheat. 738, 823 (1824), supports petitioners view that their causes of action arose under the 1991 amendment to §1981, because the 1991 Act clearly forms an ingredient of petitioners claims.

We hesitate to place too much significance on the location of a statute in the United States Code.  But even if we accepted the proposition that Congress intended the term arising under to have the same meaning in §1658 as in other sections of Title 28, it would not follow that the text is unambiguous.

).  On one hand, that statement could support petitioners view that their causes of action arose under the 1991 Act, which created a statutory right that did not previously exist.  On the other hand, it also could support respondents claim that petitioners causes of action arose under the original version of §1981, which contains the operative language setting forth the elements of their claims.

				  Even when courts were able to identify the appropriate state statute, limitation borrowing resulted in uncertainty for both plaintiffs and defendants, as a plaintiff alleging a federal claim in State A would find herself barred by the local statute of limitations while a plaintiff raising precisely the same claim in State B would be permitted to proceed.

				  The interpretation favored by respondent and the Court of Appeals subverts that goal by restricting §1658 to cases in which the plaintiffs cause of action is based solely on a post-1990 statute that  establishes a new cause of action without reference to preexisting law.   305 F. 3d, at 727 (quoting 
				<em>
					Zubi
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					AT&amp;T Corp.
				</em>
				, 219 F. 3d, at 222).  On that view, §1658 would apply only to a small fraction of post-1990 enactments.  Congress routinely creates new rights of action by amending existing statutes, and [a]ltering statutory definitions, or adding new definitions of terms previously undefined, is a common way of amending statutes.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">308</a> (1994)
.  Nothing in the text or history of §1658 supports an interpretation that would limit its reach to entirely new sections of the United States Code.  An amendment to an existing statute is no less an Act of Congress than a new, stand-alone statute.  What matters is the substantive effect of an enactmentthe creation of new rights of action and corresponding liabilitiesnot the format in which it appears in the Code.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court of Appeals reasoned that §1658 must be given a narrow scope lest it disrupt litigants settled expectations.  The court observed that Congress refused to make §1658 retroactive because,  with respect to many statutes that have no explicit limitations provision, the relevant limitations period has long since been resolved by judicial decision,  and  retroactively imposing a four year statute of limitations on legislation that the courts have previously ruled is subject to a six month limitations period in one [State], and a ten year period in another, would threaten to disrupt the settled expectations of … many parties.   305 F. 3d, at 725 (quoting H. R. Rep. No. 101734, p. 24 (1990)).  Concerns about settled expectations provide a valid reason to reject an interpretation of §1658 under which any new amendment to federal law would suffice to trigger the 4-year statute of limitations, regardless of whether the plaintiffs claim would have been availableand subject to a state statute of limitationsprior to December 1, 1990.  Such concerns do not, however, carry any weight against the reading of §1658 adopted by the District Court and urged by petitioners, under which the catchall limitations period applies only to causes of action that 
				<em>
					were not available
				</em>
				 until after §1658 was enacted.  If a cause of action did not exist prior to 1990, potential litigants could not have formed settled expectations as to the relevant statute of limitations that would then be disrupted by application of §1658.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				
				We conclude that a cause of action aris[es] under an Act of Congress enacted after December 1, 1990and therefore is governed by §1658s 4-year statute of limitationsif the plaintiffs claim against the defendant was made possible by a post-1990 enactment.  That construction best serves Congress interest in alleviating the uncertainty inherent in the practice of borrowing state statutes of limitations while at the same time protecting settled interests.  It spares federal judges and litigants the need to identify the appropriate state statute of limitations to apply to new claims but leaves in place the borrowed limitations periods for preexisting causes of action, with respect to which the difficult work already has been done.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Interpreting §1658 to apply whenever a post-1990 enactment creates a new right to maintain an action also is consistent with the common usage of the word arise to mean come into being; originate

            </a>
				  Finally, that construction is consistent with our interpretations of the term arising under as it is used in statutes governing the scope of federal subject-matter jurisdiction.  By contrast, nothing in our case law supports an interpretation as narrow as that endorsed by the Court of Appeals, under which arising under means something akin to based solely upon.  We should avoid reading §1658 in such a way as to give the familiar statutory language a meaning foreign to every other context in which it is used.

						 The House Report notes a number of practical problems created by the practice of borrowing statutes of limitations:  It obligates judges and lawyers to determine the most analogous state law claim; it imposes uncertainty on litigants; reliance on varying state laws results in undesirable variance among the federal courts and disrupts the development of federal doctrine on the suspension of limitation periods.   H. R. Rep. No. 101734, p. 24 (1990).

						 A few years after §1658 was enacted, we described it as supplying a general, 4-year limitations period for any federal statute subsequently enacted without one of its own.  North Star Steel Co. v. Thomas, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/515/29" class="subref" title="subref">515 U. S. 29</a>, n. (1995).  In his separate opinion in that case, Justice Scalia captured the basic purpose of §1658 when he observed that a uniform nationwide limitations period for a federal cause of action is always more appropriate than a rule that applies in some States but not in others.  Id., at 37 (opinion concurring in judgment).

						 Indeed, respondent concedes that, [i]n this case, the nature of the new claim is clear.  It is recognized that liability under §1981 was expanded, because this Court had spoken on the scope of §1981 and Congress reversed the Courts interpretation in the Civil Rights Act of 1991.  Brief for Respondent 26.

						  Respondent argues that the question whether a plaintiffs cause of action would have been viable prior to a post-1991 amendment will be particularly complicated in cases in which there was a split of authority regarding the scope of the original statute.  In such cases, courts will have to determine whether the amendment clarified existing law or created new rights and liabilities.  Such analysis is hardly beyond the judicial ken: Courts must answer precisely the same question when deciding whether an amendment may be applied retrospectively.  See, e.g., Hughes Aircraft Co. v. United States ex rel. Schumer, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/520/939" class="subref" title="subref">520 U. S. 939</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">948</a>950 (1997)
.  The substantial overlap between the retroactivity and statute-of-limitations inquiries undermines respondents claim that application of §1658 to post-1991 amendments will generate additional work for federal judges.

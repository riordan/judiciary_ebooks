				No. 961279. Argued November 5, 1997Decided January 14, 1998
			</div>
        <hr>
        <p class="bodytext">
				Petitioner was charged with the knowing possession of an unregistered and unserialized firearm in violation of 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/26/5861.html#d" class="subref" title="subref">26 U. S. C. §§5861(d)</a> and (i) as a result of the discovery of a silencer in his truck.  A silencer is included within the meaning of firearm under §5845(a)(7).  Petitioner repeatedly admitted during his arrest and trial that he knew that the item found in his truck was in fact a silencer.  The District Court denied petitioners request for an instruction that defined the Governments burden of establishing knowing possession as proof that he had willfully and consciously possessed an item he knew to be a firearm.  Petitioner was convicted.  Under 
				<em>
					Staples
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					United States,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/511/600" class="subref" title="subref">511 U. S. 600</a>, decided after this case was submitted to the jury, the 
				<em>
					mens rea
				</em>
				 element of a violation of §5861(d) requires the Government to prove that the defendant knew that the item he possessed had the characteristics that brought it within the statutory definition of a firearm.  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed petitioners conviction because the omission related to an element admitted by petitioner and, in light of his repeated admissions, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

				<span class="smallcaps">

				, concluded that the question on which this Court granted certiorariwhether failure to instruct on an element of an offense is harmless error where, at trial, the defendant admitted that elementis not fairly presented by the record, and that, accordingly, the writ must be dismissed as improvidently granted.  The Eleventh Circuits conclusion that the denial of petitioners requested instruction effectively omitted an essential element of the §5861 offenses was unwarranted for two reasons.  First, the tendered instruction was ambiguous.  It might have been interpreted to require proof that petitioner knew that his silencer was a firearm as defined by §5845(a)(7), not merely that the item possessed certain offending characteristics.  Second, and more important, a fair reading of the instructions as actually given did require the jury to find that petitioner knew that he possessed a silencer.  The trial judge first explained to the jury that the statute defined firearm to include a silencer and then instructed that petitioner could not be found guilty without proof beyond a reasonable doubt that he knowingly possessed a firearm, as defined above.  Since the term firearm had been defined above to include a silencer, that instruction required the jury to determine that petitioner knew that the item he possessed was a silencer.  The instruction telling the jury that the Government need not prove that petitioner knew that his gun was a firearm which the law requires to be registered is best read as merely explaining that a conviction did not require the jury to find that petitioner knew that the law required registration of the silencer.  Under

As a result, it is at least unclear whether the question the Court intended to address in this case is squarely presented.  P. 1.

The trial court explained to the jury: What must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt is that the Defendant knowingly possessed the item as charged, that such item was a firearm as defined above, and that [it] was not then registered to the Defendant in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record.

				Under the trial courts instructions, the defendant could be found guilty if he knowingly possessed a firearm, as defined above.  App. 104.  The word knowingly in the instruction modifies the word which follows it, viz., possessed, rather than the instructions further reference to the statutory definition of firearm.  Although in other circumstances one might argue the instruction was ambiguous, here the trial court agreed with the defendants understanding of it.  The trial court explained to the jury: What must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt is that the Defendant knowingly possessed the item as charged, that such item was a firearm as defined above, and that [it] was not then registered to the Defendant in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record.

The petitioner, whose conviction now stands based on what is for practical purposes an affirmance on a theory no one has suggested until now, will be hard put to understand the plurality's cavalier refusal to address his substantive arguments.

				As the Court explains, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) developed the concept of constructive discharge to address situations in which employers coerced employees into resigning because of the employees involvement in union activities.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 910.  In light of this specific focus, the NLRB requires employees to establish two elements to prove a constructive discharge.  First, the employer must impose burdens upon the employee that cause, and [are] intended to cause, a change in his working conditions so difficult or unpleasant as to force him to resign.  Second, it must be shown that those burdens were imposed because of the employees union activities.

				When the constructive discharge concept was first imported into Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, some courts imposed similar requirements.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Muller
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					United States Steel Corp.
				</em>
				, 509 F. 2d 923, 929 (CA10 1975) (requiring a showing that an employer deliberately render[ed] the employees working conditions intolerable and thus force[d] him to quit his job).  Moreover, because the Court had not yet recognized the hostile work environment cause of action, the first successful Title VII constructive discharge claims typically involved adverse employment actions.  See, 
				<em>
					Muller
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra

				<em>
					Derr
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Gulf Oil Corp.

				, 796 F. 2d 340, 344 (CA10 1986) (demotion).  If, in order to establish a constructive discharge, an employee must prove that his employer subjected him to an adverse employment action with the specific intent of forcing the employee to quit, it makes sense to attach the same legal consequences to a constructive discharge as to an actual discharge.

				The Court has now adopted a definition of constructive discharge, however, that does not in the least resemble actual discharge.

				<em>
					Ante

				, at 1.  Under this rule, it is possible to allege a constructive discharge absent any adverse employment action.  Moreover, a majority of Courts of Appeals have declined to impose a specific intent or reasonable foreseeability requirement.  See,

				As the Court explains, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) developed the concept of constructive discharge to address situations in which employers coerced employees into resigning because of the employees involvement in union activities.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 910.  In light of this specific focus, the NLRB requires employees to establish two elements to prove a constructive discharge.  First, the employer must impose burdens upon the employee that cause, and [are] intended to cause, a change in his working conditions so difficult or unpleasant as to force him to resign.  Second, it must be shown that those burdens were imposed because of the employees union activities.

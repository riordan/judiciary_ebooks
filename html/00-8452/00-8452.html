				Those mentally retarded persons who meet the laws requirements for criminal responsibility should be tried and punished when they commit crimes.  Because of their disabilities in areas of reasoning, judgment, and control of their impulses, however, they do not act with the level of moral culpability that characterizes the most serious adult criminal conduct.  Moreover, their impairments can jeopardize the reliability and fairness of capital proceedings against mentally retarded defendants.  Presumably for these reasons, in the 13 years since we decided

, the American public, legislators, scholars, and judges have deliberated over the question whether the death penalty should ever be imposed on a mentally retarded criminal.  The consensus reflected in those deliberations informs our answer to the question presented by this case: whether such executions are cruel and unusual punishments prohibited by the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentviii" class="subref" title="subref">Eighth Amendment</a> to the Federal Constitution.

				Petitioner, Daryl Renard Atkins, was convicted of abduction, armed robbery, and capital murder, and sentenced to death.  At approximately midnight on August 16, 1996, Atkins and William Jones, armed with a semiautomatic handgun, abducted Eric Nesbitt, robbed him of the money on his person, drove him to an automated teller machine in his pickup truck where cameras recorded their withdrawal of additional cash, then took him to an isolated location where he was shot eight times and killed.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Jones and Atkins both testified in the guilt phase of Atkins trial.

				  Each confirmed most of the details in the others account of the incident, with the important exception that each stated that the other had actually shot and killed Nesbitt.  Jones testimony, which was both more coherent and credible than Atkins, was obviously credited by the jury and was sufficient to establish Atkins guilt.

				  At the penalty phase of the trial, the State introduced victim impact evidence and proved two aggravating circumstances: future dangerousness and vileness of the offense.  To prove future dangerousness, the State relied on Atkins prior felony convictions as well as the testimony of four victims of earlier robberies and assaults.  To prove the second aggravator, the prosecution relied upon the trial record, including pictures of the deceaseds body and the autopsy report.

				In the penalty phase, the defense relied on one witness, Dr. Evan Nelson, a forensic psychologist who had evaluated Atkins before trial and concluded that he was mildly mentally retarded.

				The jury sentenced Atkins to death, but the Virginia Supreme Court ordered a second sentencing hearing because the trial court had used a misleading verdict form.  257 Va. 160, 510 S. E. 2d 445 (1999).  At the resentencing, Dr. Nelson again testified.  The State presented an expert rebuttal witness, Dr. Stanton Samenow, who expressed the opinion that Atkins was not mentally retarded, but rather was of average intelligence, at least, and diagnosable as having antisocial personality disorder.

				The Supreme Court of Virginia affirmed the imposition of the death penalty.  260 Va. 375, 385, 534 S. E. 2d 312, 318 (2000).  Atkins did not argue before the Virginia Supreme Court that his sentence was disproportionate to penalties imposed for similar crimes in Virginia, but he did contend that he is mentally retarded and thus cannot be sentenced to death.

				Justice Hassell and Justice Koontz dissented.  They rejected Dr. Samenows opinion that Atkins possesses average intelligence as incredulous as a matter of law, and concluded that the imposition of the sentence of death upon a criminal defendant who has the mental age of a child between the ages of 9 and 12 is excessive.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 394, 395396, 534 S. E. 2d, at 323324.  In their opinion, it is indefensible to conclude that individuals who are mentally retarded are not to some degree less culpable for their criminal acts.  By definition, such individuals have substantial limitations not shared by the general population.  A moral and civilized society diminishes itself if its system of justice does not afford recognition and consideration of those limitations in a meaningful way.

        <p class="bodytext">
				For purposes of imposing the death penalty, Enmunds criminal 
				<em>
					culpability
				</em>
				 must be limited to his participation in the robbery, and his punishment must be tailored to his personal responsibility and moral guilt.  Putting Enmund to death to avenge two killings that he did not commit and had no intention of committing or causing does not measurably contribute to the retributive end of ensuring that the criminal gets his just deserts.  This is the judgment of most of

				  Given the well-known fact that anticrime legislation is far more popular than legislation providing protections for persons guilty of violent crime, the large number of States prohibiting the execution of mentally retarded persons (and the complete absence of States passing legislation reinstating the power to conduct such executions) provides powerful evidence that today our society views mentally retarded offenders as categorically less culpable than the average criminal.  The evidence carries even greater force when it is noted that the legislatures that have addressed the issue have voted overwhelmingly in favor of the prohibition.

            </a>
				  Moreover, even in those States that allow the execution of mentally retarded offenders, the practice is uncommon.  Some States, for example New Hampshire and New Jersey, continue to authorize executions, but none have been carried out in decades.  Thus there is little need to pursue legislation barring the execution of the mentally retarded in those States.  And it appears that even among those States that regularly execute offenders and that have no prohibition with regard to the mentally retarded, only five have executed offenders possessing a known IQ less than 70 since we decided

				  The practice, therefore, has become truly unusual, and it is fair to say that a national consensus has developed against it.

				To the extent there is serious disagreement about the execution of mentally retarded offenders, it is in determining which offenders are in fact retarded.  In this case, for instance, the Commonwealth of Virginia disputes that Atkins suffers from mental retardation.  Not all people who claim to be mentally retarded will be so impaired as to fall within the range of mentally retarded offenders about whom there is a national consensus.  As was our approach in 
				<em>

				v. 
				<em>

				This consensus unquestionably reflects widespread judgment about the relative culpability of mentally retarded offenders, and the relationship between mental retardation and the penological purposes served by the death penalty.  Additionally, it suggests that some characteristics of mental retardation undermine the strength of the procedural protections that our capital jurisprudence steadfastly guards.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				As discussed above, clinical definitions of mental retardation require not only subaverage intellectual functioning, but also significant limitations in adaptive skills such as communication, self-care, and self-direction that became manifest before age 18.  Mentally retarded persons frequently know the difference between right and wrong and are competent to stand trial.  Because of their impairments, however, by definition they have diminished capacities to understand and process information, to communicate, to abstract from mistakes and learn from experience, to engage in logical reasoning, to control impulses, and to understand the reactions of others.

				  There is no evidence that they are more likely to engage in criminal conduct than others, but there is abundant evidence that they often act on impulse rather than pursuant to a premeditated plan, and that in group settings they are followers rather than leaders.

				  Their deficiencies do not warrant an exemption from criminal sanctions, but they do diminish their personal culpability.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In light of these deficiencies, our death penalty jurisprudence provides two reasons consistent with the legislative consensus that the mentally retarded should be categorically excluded from execution.  First, there is a serious question as to whether either justification that we have recognized as a basis for the death penalty applies to mentally retarded offenders.

, identified retribution and deterrence of capital crimes by prospective offenders as the social purposes served by the death penalty.  Unless the imposition of the death penalty on a mentally retarded person measurably contributes to one or both of these goals, it is nothing more than the purposeless and needless imposition of pain and suffering, and hence an unconstitutional punishment.

				With respect to retributionthe interest in seeing that the offender gets his just desertsthe severity of the appropriate punishment necessarily depends on the culpability of the offender.  Since 
				<em>
					Gregg, 
				</em>
				our jurisprudence has consistently confined the imposition of the death penalty to a narrow category of the most serious crimes.  For example, in 
				<em>
					Godfrey
				</em>
				 v.

            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/446/420" class="subref" title="subref">446 U. S. 420</a> (1980)
, we set aside a death sentence because the petitioners crimes did not reflect  a consciousness materially more depraved than that of any person guilty of murder.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 433.  If the culpability of the average murderer is insufficient to justify the most extreme sanction available to the State, the lesser culpability of the mentally retarded offender surely does not merit that form of retribution.  Thus, pursuant to our narrowing jurisprudence, which seeks to ensure that only the most deserving of execution are put to death, an exclusion for the mentally retarded is appropriate.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				With respect to deterrencethe interest in preventing capital crimes by prospective offendersit seems likely that capital punishment can serve as a deterrent only when murder is the result of premeditation and deliberation,  
				<em>
					Enmund, 
				</em>
				458 U. S., at 799.  Exempting the mentally retarded from that punishment will not affect the cold calculus that precedes the decision of other potential murderers.  
				<em>
					Gregg,
				</em>
				 428 U. S., at 186.  Indeed, that sort of calculus is at the opposite end of the spectrum from behavior of mentally retarded offenders.  The theory of deterrence in capital sentencing is predicated upon the notion that the increased severity of the punishment will inhibit criminal actors from carrying out murderous conduct.  Yet it is the same cognitive and behavioral impairments that make these defendants less morally culpablefor example, the diminished ability to understand and process information, to learn from experience, to engage in logical reasoning, or to control impulsesthat also make it less likely that they can process the information of the possibility of execution as a penalty and, as a result, control their conduct based upon that information.  Nor will exempting the mentally retarded from execution lessen the deterrent effect of the death penalty with respect to offenders who are not mentally retarded.  Such individuals are unprotected by the exemption and will continue to face the threat of execution.  Thus, executing the mentally retarded will not measurably further the goal of deterrence.

				 but also by the lesser ability of mentally retarded defendants to make a persuasive showing of mitigation in the face of prosecutorial evidence of one or more aggravating factors.  Mentally retarded defendants may be less able to give meaningful assistance to their counsel and are typically poor witnesses, and their demeanor may create an unwarranted impression of lack of remorse for their crimes.  As 
				<em>

				 demonstrated, moreover, reliance on mental retardation as a mitigating factor can be a two-edged sword that may enhance the likelihood that the aggravating factor of future dangerousness will be found by the jury.  492 U.

				Our independent evaluation of the issue reveals no reason to disagree with the judgment of the legislatures that have recently addressed the matter and concluded that death is not a suitable punishment for a mentally retarded criminal.  We are not persuaded that the execution of mentally retarded criminals will measurably advance the deterrent or the retributive purpose of the death penalty.  Construing and applying the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentviii" class="subref" title="subref">Eighth Amendment</a> in the light of our evolving standards of decency, we therefore conclude that such punishment is excessive and that the Constitution places a substantive restriction on the States power to take the life of a mentally retarded offender.

						 The American Association of Mental Retardation (AAMR) defines mental retardation as follows: Mental retardation refers to substantial limitations in present functioning.  It is characterized by significantly subaverage intellectual functioning, existing concurrently with related limitations in two or more of the following applicable adaptive skill areas: communication, self-care, home living, social skills, community use, self-direction, health and safety, functional academics, leisure, and work.  Mental retardation manifests before age 18.  Mental Retardation: Definition, Classification, and Systems of Supports 5 (9th ed. 1992).


The American Psychiatric Associations definition is similar: The essential feature of Mental Retardation is significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning (Criterion A) that is accompanied by significant limitations in adaptive functioning in at least two of the following skill areas: communication, self-care, home living, social/interpersonal skills, use of community resources, self-direction, functional academic skills, work, leisure, health, and safety (Criterion B).  The onset must occur before age 18 years (Criterion C).  Mental Retardation has many different etiologies and may be seen as a final common pathway of various pathological processes that affect the functioning of the central nervous system.  American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 41 (4th ed. 2000).  Mild mental retardation is typically used to describe people with an IQ level of 5055 to approximately 70.  Id., at 4243.

						 Dr. Nelson administered the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scales test (WAISIII), the standard instrument in the United States for assessing intellectual functioning.  AAMR, Mental Retardation, supra.  The WAISIII is scored by adding together the number of points earned on different subtests, and using a mathematical formula to convert this raw score into a scaled score.  The test measures an intelligence range from 45 to 155.  The mean score of the test is 100, which means that a person receiving a score of 100 is considered to have an average level of cognitive functioning.  A. Kaufman &amp; E. Lichtenberger, Essentials of WAISIII Assessment 60 (1999).  It is estimated that between 1 and 3 percent of the population has an IQ between 70 and 75 or lower, which is typically considered the cutoff IQ score for the intellectual function prong of the mental retardation definition.  2 B. Sadock &amp; V. Sadock, Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry 2952 (7th ed. 2000).


At the sentencing phase, Dr. Nelson testified: [Atkins] full scale IQ is 59.  Compared to the population at large, that means less than one percentile… . Mental retardation is a relatively rare thing.  Its about one percent of the population.  App. 274.  According to Dr. Nelson, Atkins IQ score would automatically qualify for Social Security disability income.  Id., at 280.  Dr. Nelson also indicated that of the over 40 capital defendants that he had evaluated, Atkins was only the second individual who met the criteria for mental retardation. Id., at 310.  He testified that, in his opinion, Atkins limited intellect had been a consistent feature throughout his life, and that his IQ score of 59 is not an aberration, malingered result, or invalid test score. Id., at 308.

						 Dr. Samenows testimony was based upon two interviews with Atkins, a review of his school records, and interviews with correctional staff.  He did not administer an intelligence test, but did ask Atkins questions taken from the 1972 version of the Wechsler Memory Scale. Id., at 524525, 529.  Dr. Samenow attributed Atkins academic performance [that was] by and large terrible to the fact that he is a person who chose to pay attention sometimes, not to pay attention others, and did poorly because he did not want to do what he was required to do.  Id., at 480481.

						 Jerome Bowden, who was identified as having mental retardation when he was 14-years-old, was scheduled for imminent execution in Georgia in June of 1986.  The Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles granted a stay following public protests over his execution.  A psychologist selected by the State evaluated Bowden and determined that he had an IQ of 65, which is consistent with mental retardation.  Nevertheless, the board lifted the stay and Bowden was executed the following day.  The board concluded that Bowden understood the nature of his crime and his punishment and therefore that execution, despite his mental deficiencies, was permissible.

In fact, he stated: We do not execute mentally retarded murderers today.  See Veto Proclamation for H. B. No. 236.  Instead, his motivation to veto the bill was based upon what he perceived as a procedural flaw: My opposition to this legislation focuses on a serious legal flaw in the bill.  House Bill No. 236 would create a system whereby the jury and judge are asked to make the same determination based on two different sets of facts… .

						 Additional evidence makes it clear that this legislative judgment  reflects a much broader social and professional consensus.  For example, several organizations with germane expertise have adopted official positions opposing the imposition of the death penalty upon a mentally retarded offender.  See Brief for American Psychological Association et al. as Amici Curiae; Brief for AAMR et al. as Amici Curiae.  In addition, representatives of widely diverse religious communities in the United States, reflecting Christian, Jewish, Muslim, and Buddhist traditions, have filed an amicus curiae brief explaining that even though their views about the death penalty differ, they all share a conviction that the execution of persons with mental retardation cannot be morally justified.  See Brief for United States Catholic Conference et al. as Amici Curiae in McCarver v. North Carolina, O. T. 2001, No. 008727, p. 2.  Moreover, within the world community, the imposition of the death penalty for crimes committed by mentally retarded offenders is overwhelmingly disapproved.  Brief for The European Union as Amicus Curiae in McCarver v. North Carolina, O. T. 2001, No. 008727, p. 4.  Finally, polling data shows a widespread consensus among Americans, even those who support the death penalty, that executing the mentally retarded is wrong.  R. Bonner &amp; S. Rimer, Executing the Mentally Retarded Even as Laws Begin to Shift, N. Y. Times, Aug. 7, 2000, p. A1; App. B to Brief for AAMR as Amicus Curiae in McCarver v. North Carolina, O. T. 2001, No. 008727 (appending approximately 20 state and national polls on the issue).   Although these factors are by no means dispositive, their consistency with the legislative evidence lends further support to our conclusion that there is a consensus among those who have addressed the issue.  See Thompson v. Oklahoma, 487U. S. 815, 830, 831, n. 31 (1988) (considering the views of respected professional organizations, by other nations that share our Anglo-American heritage, and by the leading members of the Western European community).

				Those mentally retarded persons who meet the laws requirements for criminal responsibility should be tried and punished when they commit crimes.  Because of their disabilities in areas of reasoning, judgment, and control of their impulses, however, they do not act with the level of moral culpability that characterizes the most serious adult criminal conduct.  Moreover, their impairments can jeopardize the reliability and fairness of capital proceedings against mentally retarded defendants.  Presumably for these reasons, in the 13 years since we decided

, the American public, legislators, scholars, and judges have deliberated over the question whether the death penalty should ever be imposed on a mentally retarded criminal.  The consensus reflected in those deliberations informs our answer to the question presented by this case: whether such executions are cruel and unusual punishments prohibited by the

				Petitioner, Daryl Renard Atkins, was convicted of abduction, armed robbery, and capital murder, and sentenced to death.  At approximately midnight on August 16, 1996, Atkins and William Jones, armed with a semiautomatic handgun, abducted Eric Nesbitt, robbed him of the money on his person, drove him to an automated teller machine in his pickup truck where cameras recorded their withdrawal of additional cash, then took him to an isolated location where he was shot eight times and killed.

				  Each confirmed most of the details in the others account of the incident, with the important exception that each stated that the other had actually shot and killed Nesbitt.  Jones testimony, which was both more coherent and credible than Atkins, was obviously credited by the jury and was sufficient to establish Atkins guilt.

				  At the penalty phase of the trial, the State introduced victim impact evidence and proved two aggravating circumstances: future dangerousness and vileness of the offense.  To prove future dangerousness, the State relied on Atkins prior felony convictions as well as the testimony of four victims of earlier robberies and assaults.  To prove the second aggravator, the prosecution relied upon the trial record, including pictures of the deceaseds body and the autopsy report.

				The jury sentenced Atkins to death, but the Virginia Supreme Court ordered a second sentencing hearing because the trial court had used a misleading verdict form.  257 Va. 160, 510 S. E. 2d 445 (1999).  At the resentencing, Dr. Nelson again testified.  The State presented an expert rebuttal witness, Dr. Stanton Samenow, who expressed the opinion that Atkins was not mentally retarded, but rather was of average intelligence, at least, and diagnosable as having antisocial personality disorder.

				The Supreme Court of Virginia affirmed the imposition of the death penalty.  260 Va. 375, 385, 534 S. E. 2d 312, 318 (2000).  Atkins did not argue before the Virginia Supreme Court that his sentence was disproportionate to penalties imposed for similar crimes in Virginia, but he did contend that he is mentally retarded and thus cannot be sentenced to death.

				Justice Hassell and Justice Koontz dissented.  They rejected Dr. Samenows opinion that Atkins possesses average intelligence as incredulous as a matter of law, and concluded that the imposition of the sentence of death upon a criminal defendant who has the mental age of a child between the ages of 9 and 12 is excessive.

					Id.,

				 at 394, 395396, 534 S. E. 2d, at 323324.  In their opinion, it is indefensible to conclude that individuals who are mentally retarded are not to some degree less culpable for their criminal acts.  By definition, such individuals have substantial limitations not shared by the general population.  A moral and civilized society diminishes itself if its system of justice does not afford recognition and consideration of those limitations in a meaningful way.

        <p class="bodytext">
				For purposes of imposing the death penalty, Enmunds criminal 
				<em>
					culpability
				</em>
				 must be limited to his participation in the robbery, and his punishment must be tailored to his personal responsibility and moral guilt.  Putting Enmund to death to avenge two killings that he did not commit and had no intention of committing or causing does not measurably contribute to the retributive end of ensuring that the criminal gets his just deserts.  This is the judgment of most of

				  Given the well-known fact that anticrime legislation is far more popular than legislation providing protections for persons guilty of violent crime, the large number of States prohibiting the execution of mentally retarded persons (and the complete absence of States passing legislation reinstating the power to conduct such executions) provides powerful evidence that today our society views mentally retarded offenders as categorically less culpable than the average criminal.  The evidence carries even greater force when it is noted that the legislatures that have addressed the issue have voted overwhelmingly in favor of the prohibition.

            </a>
				  Moreover, even in those States that allow the execution of mentally retarded offenders, the practice is uncommon.  Some States, for example New Hampshire and New Jersey, continue to authorize executions, but none have been carried out in decades.  Thus there is little need to pursue legislation barring the execution of the mentally retarded in those States.  And it appears that even among those States that regularly execute offenders and that have no prohibition with regard to the mentally retarded, only five have executed offenders possessing a known IQ less than 70 since we decided

				  The practice, therefore, has become truly unusual, and it is fair to say that a national consensus has developed against it.

				To the extent there is serious disagreement about the execution of mentally retarded offenders, it is in determining which offenders are in fact retarded.  In this case, for instance, the Commonwealth of Virginia disputes that Atkins suffers from mental retardation.  Not all people who claim to be mentally retarded will be so impaired as to fall within the range of mentally retarded offenders about whom there is a national consensus.  As was our approach in 
				<em>

				This consensus unquestionably reflects widespread judgment about the relative culpability of mentally retarded offenders, and the relationship between mental retardation and the penological purposes served by the death penalty.  Additionally, it suggests that some characteristics of mental retardation undermine the strength of the procedural protections that our capital jurisprudence steadfastly guards.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				As discussed above, clinical definitions of mental retardation require not only subaverage intellectual functioning, but also significant limitations in adaptive skills such as communication, self-care, and self-direction that became manifest before age 18.  Mentally retarded persons frequently know the difference between right and wrong and are competent to stand trial.  Because of their impairments, however, by definition they have diminished capacities to understand and process information, to communicate, to abstract from mistakes and learn from experience, to engage in logical reasoning, to control impulses, and to understand the reactions of others.

				  There is no evidence that they are more likely to engage in criminal conduct than others, but there is abundant evidence that they often act on impulse rather than pursuant to a premeditated plan, and that in group settings they are followers rather than leaders.

				  Their deficiencies do not warrant an exemption from criminal sanctions, but they do diminish their personal culpability.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In light of these deficiencies, our death penalty jurisprudence provides two reasons consistent with the legislative consensus that the mentally retarded should be categorically excluded from execution.  First, there is a serious question as to whether either justification that we have recognized as a basis for the death penalty applies to mentally retarded offenders.

, identified retribution and deterrence of capital crimes by prospective offenders as the social purposes served by the death penalty.  Unless the imposition of the death penalty on a mentally retarded person measurably contributes to one or both of these goals, it is nothing more than the purposeless and needless imposition of pain and suffering, and hence an unconstitutional punishment.

				With respect to retributionthe interest in seeing that the offender gets his just desertsthe severity of the appropriate punishment necessarily depends on the culpability of the offender.  Since 
				<em>
					Gregg, 
				</em>
				our jurisprudence has consistently confined the imposition of the death penalty to a narrow category of the most serious crimes.  For example, in 
				<em>
					Godfrey
				</em>
				 v.

            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/446/420" class="subref" title="subref">446 U. S. 420</a> (1980)
, we set aside a death sentence because the petitioners crimes did not reflect  a consciousness materially more depraved than that of any person guilty of murder.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 433.  If the culpability of the average murderer is insufficient to justify the most extreme sanction available to the State, the lesser culpability of the mentally retarded offender surely does not merit that form of retribution.  Thus, pursuant to our narrowing jurisprudence, which seeks to ensure that only the most deserving of execution are put to death, an exclusion for the mentally retarded is appropriate.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				With respect to deterrencethe interest in preventing capital crimes by prospective offendersit seems likely that capital punishment can serve as a deterrent only when murder is the result of premeditation and deliberation,  
				<em>
					Enmund, 
				</em>
				458 U. S., at 799.  Exempting the mentally retarded from that punishment will not affect the cold calculus that precedes the decision of other potential murderers.  
				<em>
					Gregg,
				</em>
				 428 U. S., at 186.  Indeed, that sort of calculus is at the opposite end of the spectrum from behavior of mentally retarded offenders.  The theory of deterrence in capital sentencing is predicated upon the notion that the increased severity of the punishment will inhibit criminal actors from carrying out murderous conduct.  Yet it is the same cognitive and behavioral impairments that make these defendants less morally culpablefor example, the diminished ability to understand and process information, to learn from experience, to engage in logical reasoning, or to control impulsesthat also make it less likely that they can process the information of the possibility of execution as a penalty and, as a result, control their conduct based upon that information.  Nor will exempting the mentally retarded from execution lessen the deterrent effect of the death penalty with respect to offenders who are not mentally retarded.  Such individuals are unprotected by the exemption and will continue to face the threat of execution.  Thus, executing the mentally retarded will not measurably further the goal of deterrence.

				 but also by the lesser ability of mentally retarded defendants to make a persuasive showing of mitigation in the face of prosecutorial evidence of one or more aggravating factors.  Mentally retarded defendants may be less able to give meaningful assistance to their counsel and are typically poor witnesses, and their demeanor may create an unwarranted impression of lack of remorse for their crimes.  As 
				<em>

				 demonstrated, moreover, reliance on mental retardation as a mitigating factor can be a two-edged sword that may enhance the likelihood that the aggravating factor of future dangerousness will be found by the jury.  492 U.

				Our independent evaluation of the issue reveals no reason to disagree with the judgment of the legislatures that have recently addressed the matter and concluded that death is not a suitable punishment for a mentally retarded criminal.  We are not persuaded that the execution of mentally retarded criminals will measurably advance the deterrent or the retributive purpose of the death penalty.  Construing and applying the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentviii" class="subref" title="subref">Eighth Amendment</a> in the light of our evolving standards of decency, we therefore conclude that such punishment is excessive and that the Constitution places a substantive restriction on the States power to take the life of a mentally retarded offender.

						 The American Association of Mental Retardation (AAMR) defines mental retardation as follows: Mental retardation refers to substantial limitations in present functioning.  It is characterized by significantly subaverage intellectual functioning, existing concurrently with related limitations in two or more of the following applicable adaptive skill areas: communication, self-care, home living, social skills, community use, self-direction, health and safety, functional academics, leisure, and work.  Mental retardation manifests before age 18.  Mental Retardation: Definition, Classification, and Systems of Supports 5 (9th ed. 1992).


The American Psychiatric Associations definition is similar: The essential feature of Mental Retardation is significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning (Criterion A) that is accompanied by significant limitations in adaptive functioning in at least two of the following skill areas: communication, self-care, home living, social/interpersonal skills, use of community resources, self-direction, functional academic skills, work, leisure, health, and safety (Criterion B).  The onset must occur before age 18 years (Criterion C).  Mental Retardation has many different etiologies and may be seen as a final common pathway of various pathological processes that affect the functioning of the central nervous system.  American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 41 (4th ed. 2000).  Mild mental retardation is typically used to describe people with an IQ level of 5055 to approximately 70.  Id., at 4243.

						 Dr. Nelson administered the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scales test (WAISIII), the standard instrument in the United States for assessing intellectual functioning.  AAMR, Mental Retardation, supra.  The WAISIII is scored by adding together the number of points earned on different subtests, and using a mathematical formula to convert this raw score into a scaled score.  The test measures an intelligence range from 45 to 155.  The mean score of the test is 100, which means that a person receiving a score of 100 is considered to have an average level of cognitive functioning.  A. Kaufman &amp; E. Lichtenberger, Essentials of WAISIII Assessment 60 (1999).  It is estimated that between 1 and 3 percent of the population has an IQ between 70 and 75 or lower, which is typically considered the cutoff IQ score for the intellectual function prong of the mental retardation definition.  2 B. Sadock &amp; V. Sadock, Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry 2952 (7th ed. 2000).


At the sentencing phase, Dr. Nelson testified: [Atkins] full scale IQ is 59.  Compared to the population at large, that means less than one percentile… . Mental retardation is a relatively rare thing.  Its about one percent of the population.  App. 274.  According to Dr. Nelson, Atkins IQ score would automatically qualify for Social Security disability income.  Id., at 280.  Dr. Nelson also indicated that of the over 40 capital defendants that he had evaluated, Atkins was only the second individual who met the criteria for mental retardation. Id., at 310.  He testified that, in his opinion, Atkins limited intellect had been a consistent feature throughout his life, and that his IQ score of 59 is not an aberration, malingered result, or invalid test score. Id., at 308.

						 Dr. Samenows testimony was based upon two interviews with Atkins, a review of his school records, and interviews with correctional staff.  He did not administer an intelligence test, but did ask Atkins questions taken from the 1972 version of the Wechsler Memory Scale. Id., at 524525, 529.  Dr. Samenow attributed Atkins academic performance [that was] by and large terrible to the fact that he is a person who chose to pay attention sometimes, not to pay attention others, and did poorly because he did not want to do what he was required to do.  Id., at 480481.

						 Jerome Bowden, who was identified as having mental retardation when he was 14-years-old, was scheduled for imminent execution in Georgia in June of 1986.  The Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles granted a stay following public protests over his execution.  A psychologist selected by the State evaluated Bowden and determined that he had an IQ of 65, which is consistent with mental retardation.  Nevertheless, the board lifted the stay and Bowden was executed the following day.  The board concluded that Bowden understood the nature of his crime and his punishment and therefore that execution, despite his mental deficiencies, was permissible.

In fact, he stated: We do not execute mentally retarded murderers today.  See Veto Proclamation for H. B. No. 236.  Instead, his motivation to veto the bill was based upon what he perceived as a procedural flaw: My opposition to this legislation focuses on a serious legal flaw in the bill.  House Bill No. 236 would create a system whereby the jury and judge are asked to make the same determination based on two different sets of facts… .

						 Additional evidence makes it clear that this legislative judgment  reflects a much broader social and professional consensus.  For example, several organizations with germane expertise have adopted official positions opposing the imposition of the death penalty upon a mentally retarded offender.  See Brief for American Psychological Association et al. as Amici Curiae; Brief for AAMR et al. as Amici Curiae.  In addition, representatives of widely diverse religious communities in the United States, reflecting Christian, Jewish, Muslim, and Buddhist traditions, have filed an amicus curiae brief explaining that even though their views about the death penalty differ, they all share a conviction that the execution of persons with mental retardation cannot be morally justified.  See Brief for United States Catholic Conference et al. as Amici Curiae in McCarver v. North Carolina, O. T. 2001, No. 008727, p. 2.  Moreover, within the world community, the imposition of the death penalty for crimes committed by mentally retarded offenders is overwhelmingly disapproved.  Brief for The European Union as Amicus Curiae in McCarver v. North Carolina, O. T. 2001, No. 008727, p. 4.  Finally, polling data shows a widespread consensus among Americans, even those who support the death penalty, that executing the mentally retarded is wrong.  R. Bonner &amp; S. Rimer, Executing the Mentally Retarded Even as Laws Begin to Shift, N. Y. Times, Aug. 7, 2000, p. A1; App. B to Brief for AAMR as Amicus Curiae in McCarver v. North Carolina, O. T. 2001, No. 008727 (appending approximately 20 state and national polls on the issue).   Although these factors are by no means dispositive, their consistency with the legislative evidence lends further support to our conclusion that there is a consensus among those who have addressed the issue.  See Thompson v. Oklahoma, 487U. S. 815, 830, 831, n. 31 (1988) (considering the views of respected professional organizations, by other nations that share our Anglo-American heritage, and by the leading members of the Western European community).

				Those mentally retarded persons who meet the laws requirements for criminal responsibility should be tried and punished when they commit crimes.  Because of their disabilities in areas of reasoning, judgment, and control of their impulses, however, they do not act with the level of moral culpability that characterizes the most serious adult criminal conduct.  Moreover, their impairments can jeopardize the reliability and fairness of capital proceedings against mentally retarded defendants.  Presumably for these reasons, in the 13 years since we decided

, the American public, legislators, scholars, and judges have deliberated over the question whether the death penalty should ever be imposed on a mentally retarded criminal.  The consensus reflected in those deliberations informs our answer to the question presented by this case: whether such executions are cruel and unusual punishments prohibited by the

				Petitioner, Daryl Renard Atkins, was convicted of abduction, armed robbery, and capital murder, and sentenced to death.  At approximately midnight on August 16, 1996, Atkins and William Jones, armed with a semiautomatic handgun, abducted Eric Nesbitt, robbed him of the money on his person, drove him to an automated teller machine in his pickup truck where cameras recorded their withdrawal of additional cash, then took him to an isolated location where he was shot eight times and killed.

				  Each confirmed most of the details in the others account of the incident, with the important exception that each stated that the other had actually shot and killed Nesbitt.  Jones testimony, which was both more coherent and credible than Atkins, was obviously credited by the jury and was sufficient to establish Atkins guilt.

				  At the penalty phase of the trial, the State introduced victim impact evidence and proved two aggravating circumstances: future dangerousness and vileness of the offense.  To prove future dangerousness, the State relied on Atkins prior felony convictions as well as the testimony of four victims of earlier robberies and assaults.  To prove the second aggravator, the prosecution relied upon the trial record, including pictures of the deceaseds body and the autopsy report.

				The jury sentenced Atkins to death, but the Virginia Supreme Court ordered a second sentencing hearing because the trial court had used a misleading verdict form.  257 Va. 160, 510 S. E. 2d 445 (1999).  At the resentencing, Dr. Nelson again testified.  The State presented an expert rebuttal witness, Dr. Stanton Samenow, who expressed the opinion that Atkins was not mentally retarded, but rather was of average intelligence, at least, and diagnosable as having antisocial personality disorder.

				The Supreme Court of Virginia affirmed the imposition of the death penalty.  260 Va. 375, 385, 534 S. E. 2d 312, 318 (2000).  Atkins did not argue before the Virginia Supreme Court that his sentence was disproportionate to penalties imposed for similar crimes in Virginia, but he did contend that he is mentally retarded and thus cannot be sentenced to death.

				Justice Hassell and Justice Koontz dissented.  They rejected Dr. Samenows opinion that Atkins possesses average intelligence as incredulous as a matter of law, and concluded that the imposition of the sentence of death upon a criminal defendant who has the mental age of a child between the ages of 9 and 12 is excessive.

					Id.,

				 at 394, 395396, 534 S. E. 2d, at 323324.  In their opinion, it is indefensible to conclude that individuals who are mentally retarded are not to some degree less culpable for their criminal acts.  By definition, such individuals have substantial limitations not shared by the general population.  A moral and civilized society diminishes itself if its system of justice does not afford recognition and consideration of those limitations in a meaningful way.

        <p class="bodytext">
				For purposes of imposing the death penalty, Enmunds criminal 
				<em>
					culpability
				</em>
				 must be limited to his participation in the robbery, and his punishment must be tailored to his personal responsibility and moral guilt.  Putting Enmund to death to avenge two killings that he did not commit and had no intention of committing or causing does not measurably contribute to the retributive end of ensuring that the criminal gets his just deserts.  This is the judgment of most of

				  Given the well-known fact that anticrime legislation is far more popular than legislation providing protections for persons guilty of violent crime, the large number of States prohibiting the execution of mentally retarded persons (and the complete absence of States passing legislation reinstating the power to conduct such executions) provides powerful evidence that today our society views mentally retarded offenders as categorically less culpable than the average criminal.  The evidence carries even greater force when it is noted that the legislatures that have addressed the issue have voted overwhelmingly in favor of the prohibition.

            </a>
				  Moreover, even in those States that allow the execution of mentally retarded offenders, the practice is uncommon.  Some States, for example New Hampshire and New Jersey, continue to authorize executions, but none have been carried out in decades.  Thus there is little need to pursue legislation barring the execution of the mentally retarded in those States.  And it appears that even among those States that regularly execute offenders and that have no prohibition with regard to the mentally retarded, only five have executed offenders possessing a known IQ less than 70 since we decided

				  The practice, therefore, has become truly unusual, and it is fair to say that a national consensus has developed against it.

				To the extent there is serious disagreement about the execution of mentally retarded offenders, it is in determining which offenders are in fact retarded.  In this case, for instance, the Commonwealth of Virginia disputes that Atkins suffers from mental retardation.  Not all people who claim to be mentally retarded will be so impaired as to fall within the range of mentally retarded offenders about whom there is a national consensus.  As was our approach in 
				<em>

				This consensus unquestionably reflects widespread judgment about the relative culpability of mentally retarded offenders, and the relationship between mental retardation and the penological purposes served by the death penalty.  Additionally, it suggests that some characteristics of mental retardation undermine the strength of the procedural protections that our capital jurisprudence steadfastly guards.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				As discussed above, clinical definitions of mental retardation require not only subaverage intellectual functioning, but also significant limitations in adaptive skills such as communication, self-care, and self-direction that became manifest before age 18.  Mentally retarded persons frequently know the difference between right and wrong and are competent to stand trial.  Because of their impairments, however, by definition they have diminished capacities to understand and process information, to communicate, to abstract from mistakes and learn from experience, to engage in logical reasoning, to control impulses, and to understand the reactions of others.

				  There is no evidence that they are more likely to engage in criminal conduct than others, but there is abundant evidence that they often act on impulse rather than pursuant to a premeditated plan, and that in group settings they are followers rather than leaders.

				  Their deficiencies do not warrant an exemption from criminal sanctions, but they do diminish their personal culpability.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In light of these deficiencies, our death penalty jurisprudence provides two reasons consistent with the legislative consensus that the mentally retarded should be categorically excluded from execution.  First, there is a serious question as to whether either justification that we have recognized as a basis for the death penalty applies to mentally retarded offenders.

, identified retribution and deterrence of capital crimes by prospective offenders as the social purposes served by the death penalty.  Unless the imposition of the death penalty on a mentally retarded person measurably contributes to one or both of these goals, it is nothing more than the purposeless and needless imposition of pain and suffering, and hence an unconstitutional punishment.

				With respect to retributionthe interest in seeing that the offender gets his just desertsthe severity of the appropriate punishment necessarily depends on the culpability of the offender.  Since 
				<em>
					Gregg, 
				</em>
				our jurisprudence has consistently confined the imposition of the death penalty to a narrow category of the most serious crimes.  For example, in 
				<em>
					Godfrey
				</em>
				 v.

            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/446/420" class="subref" title="subref">446 U. S. 420</a> (1980)
, we set aside a death sentence because the petitioners crimes did not reflect  a consciousness materially more depraved than that of any person guilty of murder.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 433.  If the culpability of the average murderer is insufficient to justify the most extreme sanction available to the State, the lesser culpability of the mentally retarded offender surely does not merit that form of retribution.  Thus, pursuant to our narrowing jurisprudence, which seeks to ensure that only the most deserving of execution are put to death, an exclusion for the mentally retarded is appropriate.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				With respect to deterrencethe interest in preventing capital crimes by prospective offendersit seems likely that capital punishment can serve as a deterrent only when murder is the result of premeditation and deliberation,  
				<em>
					Enmund, 
				</em>
				458 U. S., at 799.  Exempting the mentally retarded from that punishment will not affect the cold calculus that precedes the decision of other potential murderers.  
				<em>
					Gregg,
				</em>
				 428 U. S., at 186.  Indeed, that sort of calculus is at the opposite end of the spectrum from behavior of mentally retarded offenders.  The theory of deterrence in capital sentencing is predicated upon the notion that the increased severity of the punishment will inhibit criminal actors from carrying out murderous conduct.  Yet it is the same cognitive and behavioral impairments that make these defendants less morally culpablefor example, the diminished ability to understand and process information, to learn from experience, to engage in logical reasoning, or to control impulsesthat also make it less likely that they can process the information of the possibility of execution as a penalty and, as a result, control their conduct based upon that information.  Nor will exempting the mentally retarded from execution lessen the deterrent effect of the death penalty with respect to offenders who are not mentally retarded.  Such individuals are unprotected by the exemption and will continue to face the threat of execution.  Thus, executing the mentally retarded will not measurably further the goal of deterrence.

				 but also by the lesser ability of mentally retarded defendants to make a persuasive showing of mitigation in the face of prosecutorial evidence of one or more aggravating factors.  Mentally retarded defendants may be less able to give meaningful assistance to their counsel and are typically poor witnesses, and their demeanor may create an unwarranted impression of lack of remorse for their crimes.  As 
				<em>

				 demonstrated, moreover, reliance on mental retardation as a mitigating factor can be a two-edged sword that may enhance the likelihood that the aggravating factor of future dangerousness will be found by the jury.  492 U.

				Our independent evaluation of the issue reveals no reason to disagree with the judgment of the legislatures that have recently addressed the matter and concluded that death is not a suitable punishment for a mentally retarded criminal.  We are not persuaded that the execution of mentally retarded criminals will measurably advance the deterrent or the retributive purpose of the death penalty.  Construing and applying the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentviii" class="subref" title="subref">Eighth Amendment</a> in the light of our evolving standards of decency, we therefore conclude that such punishment is excessive and that the Constitution places a substantive restriction on the States power to take the life of a mentally retarded offender.

						 The American Association of Mental Retardation (AAMR) defines mental retardation as follows: Mental retardation refers to substantial limitations in present functioning.  It is characterized by significantly subaverage intellectual functioning, existing concurrently with related limitations in two or more of the following applicable adaptive skill areas: communication, self-care, home living, social skills, community use, self-direction, health and safety, functional academics, leisure, and work.  Mental retardation manifests before age 18.  Mental Retardation: Definition, Classification, and Systems of Supports 5 (9th ed. 1992).


The American Psychiatric Associations definition is similar: The essential feature of Mental Retardation is significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning (Criterion A) that is accompanied by significant limitations in adaptive functioning in at least two of the following skill areas: communication, self-care, home living, social/interpersonal skills, use of community resources, self-direction, functional academic skills, work, leisure, health, and safety (Criterion B).  The onset must occur before age 18 years (Criterion C).  Mental Retardation has many different etiologies and may be seen as a final common pathway of various pathological processes that affect the functioning of the central nervous system.  American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 41 (4th ed. 2000).  Mild mental retardation is typically used to describe people with an IQ level of 5055 to approximately 70.  Id., at 4243.

						 Dr. Nelson administered the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scales test (WAISIII), the standard instrument in the United States for assessing intellectual functioning.  AAMR, Mental Retardation, supra.  The WAISIII is scored by adding together the number of points earned on different subtests, and using a mathematical formula to convert this raw score into a scaled score.  The test measures an intelligence range from 45 to 155.  The mean score of the test is 100, which means that a person receiving a score of 100 is considered to have an average level of cognitive functioning.  A. Kaufman &amp; E. Lichtenberger, Essentials of WAISIII Assessment 60 (1999).  It is estimated that between 1 and 3 percent of the population has an IQ between 70 and 75 or lower, which is typically considered the cutoff IQ score for the intellectual function prong of the mental retardation definition.  2 B. Sadock &amp; V. Sadock, Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry 2952 (7th ed. 2000).


At the sentencing phase, Dr. Nelson testified: [Atkins] full scale IQ is 59.  Compared to the population at large, that means less than one percentile… . Mental retardation is a relatively rare thing.  Its about one percent of the population.  App. 274.  According to Dr. Nelson, Atkins IQ score would automatically qualify for Social Security disability income.  Id., at 280.  Dr. Nelson also indicated that of the over 40 capital defendants that he had evaluated, Atkins was only the second individual who met the criteria for mental retardation. Id., at 310.  He testified that, in his opinion, Atkins limited intellect had been a consistent feature throughout his life, and that his IQ score of 59 is not an aberration, malingered result, or invalid test score. Id., at 308.

						 Dr. Samenows testimony was based upon two interviews with Atkins, a review of his school records, and interviews with correctional staff.  He did not administer an intelligence test, but did ask Atkins questions taken from the 1972 version of the Wechsler Memory Scale. Id., at 524525, 529.  Dr. Samenow attributed Atkins academic performance [that was] by and large terrible to the fact that he is a person who chose to pay attention sometimes, not to pay attention others, and did poorly because he did not want to do what he was required to do.  Id., at 480481.

						 Jerome Bowden, who was identified as having mental retardation when he was 14-years-old, was scheduled for imminent execution in Georgia in June of 1986.  The Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles granted a stay following public protests over his execution.  A psychologist selected by the State evaluated Bowden and determined that he had an IQ of 65, which is consistent with mental retardation.  Nevertheless, the board lifted the stay and Bowden was executed the following day.  The board concluded that Bowden understood the nature of his crime and his punishment and therefore that execution, despite his mental deficiencies, was permissible.

In fact, he stated: We do not execute mentally retarded murderers today.  See Veto Proclamation for H. B. No. 236.  Instead, his motivation to veto the bill was based upon what he perceived as a procedural flaw: My opposition to this legislation focuses on a serious legal flaw in the bill.  House Bill No. 236 would create a system whereby the jury and judge are asked to make the same determination based on two different sets of facts… .

						 Additional evidence makes it clear that this legislative judgment  reflects a much broader social and professional consensus.  For example, several organizations with germane expertise have adopted official positions opposing the imposition of the death penalty upon a mentally retarded offender.  See Brief for American Psychological Association et al. as Amici Curiae; Brief for AAMR et al. as Amici Curiae.  In addition, representatives of widely diverse religious communities in the United States, reflecting Christian, Jewish, Muslim, and Buddhist traditions, have filed an amicus curiae brief explaining that even though their views about the death penalty differ, they all share a conviction that the execution of persons with mental retardation cannot be morally justified.  See Brief for United States Catholic Conference et al. as Amici Curiae in McCarver v. North Carolina, O. T. 2001, No. 008727, p. 2.  Moreover, within the world community, the imposition of the death penalty for crimes committed by mentally retarded offenders is overwhelmingly disapproved.  Brief for The European Union as Amicus Curiae in McCarver v. North Carolina, O. T. 2001, No. 008727, p. 4.  Finally, polling data shows a widespread consensus among Americans, even those who support the death penalty, that executing the mentally retarded is wrong.  R. Bonner &amp; S. Rimer, Executing the Mentally Retarded Even as Laws Begin to Shift, N. Y. Times, Aug. 7, 2000, p. A1; App. B to Brief for AAMR as Amicus Curiae in McCarver v. North Carolina, O. T. 2001, No. 008727 (appending approximately 20 state and national polls on the issue).   Although these factors are by no means dispositive, their consistency with the legislative evidence lends further support to our conclusion that there is a consensus among those who have addressed the issue.  See Thompson v. Oklahoma, 487U. S. 815, 830, 831, n. 31 (1988) (considering the views of respected professional organizations, by other nations that share our Anglo-American heritage, and by the leading members of the Western European community).

				Those mentally retarded persons who meet the laws requirements for criminal responsibility should be tried and punished when they commit crimes.  Because of their disabilities in areas of reasoning, judgment, and control of their impulses, however, they do not act with the level of moral culpability that characterizes the most serious adult criminal conduct.  Moreover, their impairments can jeopardize the reliability and fairness of capital proceedings against mentally retarded defendants.  Presumably for these reasons, in the 13 years since we decided

, the American public, legislators, scholars, and judges have deliberated over the question whether the death penalty should ever be imposed on a mentally retarded criminal.  The consensus reflected in those deliberations informs our answer to the question presented by this case: whether such executions are cruel and unusual punishments prohibited by the

				Petitioner, Daryl Renard Atkins, was convicted of abduction, armed robbery, and capital murder, and sentenced to death.  At approximately midnight on August 16, 1996, Atkins and William Jones, armed with a semiautomatic handgun, abducted Eric Nesbitt, robbed him of the money on his person, drove him to an automated teller machine in his pickup truck where cameras recorded their withdrawal of additional cash, then took him to an isolated location where he was shot eight times and killed.

				  Each confirmed most of the details in the others account of the incident, with the important exception that each stated that the other had actually shot and killed Nesbitt.  Jones testimony, which was both more coherent and credible than Atkins, was obviously credited by the jury and was sufficient to establish Atkins guilt.

				  At the penalty phase of the trial, the State introduced victim impact evidence and proved two aggravating circumstances: future dangerousness and vileness of the offense.  To prove future dangerousness, the State relied on Atkins prior felony convictions as well as the testimony of four victims of earlier robberies and assaults.  To prove the second aggravator, the prosecution relied upon the trial record, including pictures of the deceaseds body and the autopsy report.

				The jury sentenced Atkins to death, but the Virginia Supreme Court ordered a second sentencing hearing because the trial court had used a misleading verdict form.  257 Va. 160, 510 S. E. 2d 445 (1999).  At the resentencing, Dr. Nelson again testified.  The State presented an expert rebuttal witness, Dr. Stanton Samenow, who expressed the opinion that Atkins was not mentally retarded, but rather was of average intelligence, at least, and diagnosable as having antisocial personality disorder.

				The Supreme Court of Virginia affirmed the imposition of the death penalty.  260 Va. 375, 385, 534 S. E. 2d 312, 318 (2000).  Atkins did not argue before the Virginia Supreme Court that his sentence was disproportionate to penalties imposed for similar crimes in Virginia, but he did contend that he is mentally retarded and thus cannot be sentenced to death.

				Justice Hassell and Justice Koontz dissented.  They rejected Dr. Samenows opinion that Atkins possesses average intelligence as incredulous as a matter of law, and concluded that the imposition of the sentence of death upon a criminal defendant who has the mental age of a child between the ages of 9 and 12 is excessive.

					Id.,

				 at 394, 395396, 534 S. E. 2d, at 323324.  In their opinion, it is indefensible to conclude that individuals who are mentally retarded are not to some degree less culpable for their criminal acts.  By definition, such individuals have substantial limitations not shared by the general population.  A moral and civilized society diminishes itself if its system of justice does not afford recognition and consideration of those limitations in a meaningful way.

        <p class="bodytext">
				For purposes of imposing the death penalty, Enmunds criminal 
				<em>
					culpability
				</em>
				 must be limited to his participation in the robbery, and his punishment must be tailored to his personal responsibility and moral guilt.  Putting Enmund to death to avenge two killings that he did not commit and had no intention of committing or causing does not measurably contribute to the retributive end of ensuring that the criminal gets his just deserts.  This is the judgment of most of

				  Given the well-known fact that anticrime legislation is far more popular than legislation providing protections for persons guilty of violent crime, the large number of States prohibiting the execution of mentally retarded persons (and the complete absence of States passing legislation reinstating the power to conduct such executions) provides powerful evidence that today our society views mentally retarded offenders as categorically less culpable than the average criminal.  The evidence carries even greater force when it is noted that the legislatures that have addressed the issue have voted overwhelmingly in favor of the prohibition.

            </a>
				  Moreover, even in those States that allow the execution of mentally retarded offenders, the practice is uncommon.  Some States, for example New Hampshire and New Jersey, continue to authorize executions, but none have been carried out in decades.  Thus there is little need to pursue legislation barring the execution of the mentally retarded in those States.  And it appears that even among those States that regularly execute offenders and that have no prohibition with regard to the mentally retarded, only five have executed offenders possessing a known IQ less than 70 since we decided

				  The practice, therefore, has become truly unusual, and it is fair to say that a national consensus has developed against it.

				To the extent there is serious disagreement about the execution of mentally retarded offenders, it is in determining which offenders are in fact retarded.  In this case, for instance, the Commonwealth of Virginia disputes that Atkins suffers from mental retardation.  Not all people who claim to be mentally retarded will be so impaired as to fall within the range of mentally retarded offenders about whom there is a national consensus.  As was our approach in 
				<em>

				This consensus unquestionably reflects widespread judgment about the relative culpability of mentally retarded offenders, and the relationship between mental retardation and the penological purposes served by the death penalty.  Additionally, it suggests that some characteristics of mental retardation undermine the strength of the procedural protections that our capital jurisprudence steadfastly guards.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				As discussed above, clinical definitions of mental retardation require not only subaverage intellectual functioning, but also significant limitations in adaptive skills such as communication, self-care, and self-direction that became manifest before age 18.  Mentally retarded persons frequently know the difference between right and wrong and are competent to stand trial.  Because of their impairments, however, by definition they have diminished capacities to understand and process information, to communicate, to abstract from mistakes and learn from experience, to engage in logical reasoning, to control impulses, and to understand the reactions of others.

				  There is no evidence that they are more likely to engage in criminal conduct than others, but there is abundant evidence that they often act on impulse rather than pursuant to a premeditated plan, and that in group settings they are followers rather than leaders.

				  Their deficiencies do not warrant an exemption from criminal sanctions, but they do diminish their personal culpability.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In light of these deficiencies, our death penalty jurisprudence provides two reasons consistent with the legislative consensus that the mentally retarded should be categorically excluded from execution.  First, there is a serious question as to whether either justification that we have recognized as a basis for the death penalty applies to mentally retarded offenders.

, identified retribution and deterrence of capital crimes by prospective offenders as the social purposes served by the death penalty.  Unless the imposition of the death penalty on a mentally retarded person measurably contributes to one or both of these goals, it is nothing more than the purposeless and needless imposition of pain and suffering, and hence an unconstitutional punishment.

				With respect to retributionthe interest in seeing that the offender gets his just desertsthe severity of the appropriate punishment necessarily depends on the culpability of the offender.  Since 
				<em>
					Gregg, 
				</em>
				our jurisprudence has consistently confined the imposition of the death penalty to a narrow category of the most serious crimes.  For example, in 
				<em>
					Godfrey
				</em>
				 v.

            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/446/420" class="subref" title="subref">446 U. S. 420</a> (1980)
, we set aside a death sentence because the petitioners crimes did not reflect  a consciousness materially more depraved than that of any person guilty of murder.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 433.  If the culpability of the average murderer is insufficient to justify the most extreme sanction available to the State, the lesser culpability of the mentally retarded offender surely does not merit that form of retribution.  Thus, pursuant to our narrowing jurisprudence, which seeks to ensure that only the most deserving of execution are put to death, an exclusion for the mentally retarded is appropriate.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				With respect to deterrencethe interest in preventing capital crimes by prospective offendersit seems likely that capital punishment can serve as a deterrent only when murder is the result of premeditation and deliberation,  
				<em>
					Enmund, 
				</em>
				458 U. S., at 799.  Exempting the mentally retarded from that punishment will not affect the cold calculus that precedes the decision of other potential murderers.  
				<em>
					Gregg,
				</em>
				 428 U. S., at 186.  Indeed, that sort of calculus is at the opposite end of the spectrum from behavior of mentally retarded offenders.  The theory of deterrence in capital sentencing is predicated upon the notion that the increased severity of the punishment will inhibit criminal actors from carrying out murderous conduct.  Yet it is the same cognitive and behavioral impairments that make these defendants less morally culpablefor example, the diminished ability to understand and process information, to learn from experience, to engage in logical reasoning, or to control impulsesthat also make it less likely that they can process the information of the possibility of execution as a penalty and, as a result, control their conduct based upon that information.  Nor will exempting the mentally retarded from execution lessen the deterrent effect of the death penalty with respect to offenders who are not mentally retarded.  Such individuals are unprotected by the exemption and will continue to face the threat of execution.  Thus, executing the mentally retarded will not measurably further the goal of deterrence.

				 but also by the lesser ability of mentally retarded defendants to make a persuasive showing of mitigation in the face of prosecutorial evidence of one or more aggravating factors.  Mentally retarded defendants may be less able to give meaningful assistance to their counsel and are typically poor witnesses, and their demeanor may create an unwarranted impression of lack of remorse for their crimes.  As 
				<em>

				 demonstrated, moreover, reliance on mental retardation as a mitigating factor can be a two-edged sword that may enhance the likelihood that the aggravating factor of future dangerousness will be found by the jury.  492 U.

				Our independent evaluation of the issue reveals no reason to disagree with the judgment of the legislatures that have recently addressed the matter and concluded that death is not a suitable punishment for a mentally retarded criminal.  We are not persuaded that the execution of mentally retarded criminals will measurably advance the deterrent or the retributive purpose of the death penalty.  Construing and applying the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentviii" class="subref" title="subref">Eighth Amendment</a> in the light of our evolving standards of decency, we therefore conclude that such punishment is excessive and that the Constitution places a substantive restriction on the States power to take the life of a mentally retarded offender.

						 The American Association of Mental Retardation (AAMR) defines mental retardation as follows: Mental retardation refers to substantial limitations in present functioning.  It is characterized by significantly subaverage intellectual functioning, existing concurrently with related limitations in two or more of the following applicable adaptive skill areas: communication, self-care, home living, social skills, community use, self-direction, health and safety, functional academics, leisure, and work.  Mental retardation manifests before age 18.  Mental Retardation: Definition, Classification, and Systems of Supports 5 (9th ed. 1992).


The American Psychiatric Associations definition is similar: The essential feature of Mental Retardation is significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning (Criterion A) that is accompanied by significant limitations in adaptive functioning in at least two of the following skill areas: communication, self-care, home living, social/interpersonal skills, use of community resources, self-direction, functional academic skills, work, leisure, health, and safety (Criterion B).  The onset must occur before age 18 years (Criterion C).  Mental Retardation has many different etiologies and may be seen as a final common pathway of various pathological processes that affect the functioning of the central nervous system.  American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 41 (4th ed. 2000).  Mild mental retardation is typically used to describe people with an IQ level of 5055 to approximately 70.  Id., at 4243.

						 Dr. Nelson administered the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scales test (WAISIII), the standard instrument in the United States for assessing intellectual functioning.  AAMR, Mental Retardation, supra.  The WAISIII is scored by adding together the number of points earned on different subtests, and using a mathematical formula to convert this raw score into a scaled score.  The test measures an intelligence range from 45 to 155.  The mean score of the test is 100, which means that a person receiving a score of 100 is considered to have an average level of cognitive functioning.  A. Kaufman &amp; E. Lichtenberger, Essentials of WAISIII Assessment 60 (1999).  It is estimated that between 1 and 3 percent of the population has an IQ between 70 and 75 or lower, which is typically considered the cutoff IQ score for the intellectual function prong of the mental retardation definition.  2 B. Sadock &amp; V. Sadock, Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry 2952 (7th ed. 2000).


At the sentencing phase, Dr. Nelson testified: [Atkins] full scale IQ is 59.  Compared to the population at large, that means less than one percentile… . Mental retardation is a relatively rare thing.  Its about one percent of the population.  App. 274.  According to Dr. Nelson, Atkins IQ score would automatically qualify for Social Security disability income.  Id., at 280.  Dr. Nelson also indicated that of the over 40 capital defendants that he had evaluated, Atkins was only the second individual who met the criteria for mental retardation. Id., at 310.  He testified that, in his opinion, Atkins limited intellect had been a consistent feature throughout his life, and that his IQ score of 59 is not an aberration, malingered result, or invalid test score. Id., at 308.

						 Dr. Samenows testimony was based upon two interviews with Atkins, a review of his school records, and interviews with correctional staff.  He did not administer an intelligence test, but did ask Atkins questions taken from the 1972 version of the Wechsler Memory Scale. Id., at 524525, 529.  Dr. Samenow attributed Atkins academic performance [that was] by and large terrible to the fact that he is a person who chose to pay attention sometimes, not to pay attention others, and did poorly because he did not want to do what he was required to do.  Id., at 480481.

						 Jerome Bowden, who was identified as having mental retardation when he was 14-years-old, was scheduled for imminent execution in Georgia in June of 1986.  The Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles granted a stay following public protests over his execution.  A psychologist selected by the State evaluated Bowden and determined that he had an IQ of 65, which is consistent with mental retardation.  Nevertheless, the board lifted the stay and Bowden was executed the following day.  The board concluded that Bowden understood the nature of his crime and his punishment and therefore that execution, despite his mental deficiencies, was permissible.

In fact, he stated: We do not execute mentally retarded murderers today.  See Veto Proclamation for H. B. No. 236.  Instead, his motivation to veto the bill was based upon what he perceived as a procedural flaw: My opposition to this legislation focuses on a serious legal flaw in the bill.  House Bill No. 236 would create a system whereby the jury and judge are asked to make the same determination based on two different sets of facts… .

						 Additional evidence makes it clear that this legislative judgment  reflects a much broader social and professional consensus.  For example, several organizations with germane expertise have adopted official positions opposing the imposition of the death penalty upon a mentally retarded offender.  See Brief for American Psychological Association et al. as Amici Curiae; Brief for AAMR et al. as Amici Curiae.  In addition, representatives of widely diverse religious communities in the United States, reflecting Christian, Jewish, Muslim, and Buddhist traditions, have filed an amicus curiae brief explaining that even though their views about the death penalty differ, they all share a conviction that the execution of persons with mental retardation cannot be morally justified.  See Brief for United States Catholic Conference et al. as Amici Curiae in McCarver v. North Carolina, O. T. 2001, No. 008727, p. 2.  Moreover, within the world community, the imposition of the death penalty for crimes committed by mentally retarded offenders is overwhelmingly disapproved.  Brief for The European Union as Amicus Curiae in McCarver v. North Carolina, O. T. 2001, No. 008727, p. 4.  Finally, polling data shows a widespread consensus among Americans, even those who support the death penalty, that executing the mentally retarded is wrong.  R. Bonner &amp; S. Rimer, Executing the Mentally Retarded Even as Laws Begin to Shift, N. Y. Times, Aug. 7, 2000, p. A1; App. B to Brief for AAMR as Amicus Curiae in McCarver v. North Carolina, O. T. 2001, No. 008727 (appending approximately 20 state and national polls on the issue).   Although these factors are by no means dispositive, their consistency with the legislative evidence lends further support to our conclusion that there is a consensus among those who have addressed the issue.  See Thompson v. Oklahoma, 487U. S. 815, 830, 831, n. 31 (1988) (considering the views of respected professional organizations, by other nations that share our Anglo-American heritage, and by the leading members of the Western European community).

				Those mentally retarded persons who meet the laws requirements for criminal responsibility should be tried and punished when they commit crimes.  Because of their disabilities in areas of reasoning, judgment, and control of their impulses, however, they do not act with the level of moral culpability that characterizes the most serious adult criminal conduct.  Moreover, their impairments can jeopardize the reliability and fairness of capital proceedings against mentally retarded defendants.  Presumably for these reasons, in the 13 years since we decided

, the American public, legislators, scholars, and judges have deliberated over the question whether the death penalty should ever be imposed on a mentally retarded criminal.  The consensus reflected in those deliberations informs our answer to the question presented by this case: whether such executions are cruel and unusual punishments prohibited by the

				Petitioner, Daryl Renard Atkins, was convicted of abduction, armed robbery, and capital murder, and sentenced to death.  At approximately midnight on August 16, 1996, Atkins and William Jones, armed with a semiautomatic handgun, abducted Eric Nesbitt, robbed him of the money on his person, drove him to an automated teller machine in his pickup truck where cameras recorded their withdrawal of additional cash, then took him to an isolated location where he was shot eight times and killed.

				  Each confirmed most of the details in the others account of the incident, with the important exception that each stated that the other had actually shot and killed Nesbitt.  Jones testimony, which was both more coherent and credible than Atkins, was obviously credited by the jury and was sufficient to establish Atkins guilt.

				  At the penalty phase of the trial, the State introduced victim impact evidence and proved two aggravating circumstances: future dangerousness and vileness of the offense.  To prove future dangerousness, the State relied on Atkins prior felony convictions as well as the testimony of four victims of earlier robberies and assaults.  To prove the second aggravator, the prosecution relied upon the trial record, including pictures of the deceaseds body and the autopsy report.

				The jury sentenced Atkins to death, but the Virginia Supreme Court ordered a second sentencing hearing because the trial court had used a misleading verdict form.  257 Va. 160, 510 S. E. 2d 445 (1999).  At the resentencing, Dr. Nelson again testified.  The State presented an expert rebuttal witness, Dr. Stanton Samenow, who expressed the opinion that Atkins was not mentally retarded, but rather was of average intelligence, at least, and diagnosable as having antisocial personality disorder.

				The Supreme Court of Virginia affirmed the imposition of the death penalty.  260 Va. 375, 385, 534 S. E. 2d 312, 318 (2000).  Atkins did not argue before the Virginia Supreme Court that his sentence was disproportionate to penalties imposed for similar crimes in Virginia, but he did contend that he is mentally retarded and thus cannot be sentenced to death.

				Justice Hassell and Justice Koontz dissented.  They rejected Dr. Samenows opinion that Atkins possesses average intelligence as incredulous as a matter of law, and concluded that the imposition of the sentence of death upon a criminal defendant who has the mental age of a child between the ages of 9 and 12 is excessive.

					Id.,

				 at 394, 395396, 534 S. E. 2d, at 323324.  In their opinion, it is indefensible to conclude that individuals who are mentally retarded are not to some degree less culpable for their criminal acts.  By definition, such individuals have substantial limitations not shared by the general population.  A moral and civilized society diminishes itself if its system of justice does not afford recognition and consideration of those limitations in a meaningful way.

        <p class="bodytext">
				For purposes of imposing the death penalty, Enmunds criminal 
				<em>
					culpability
				</em>
				 must be limited to his participation in the robbery, and his punishment must be tailored to his personal responsibility and moral guilt.  Putting Enmund to death to avenge two killings that he did not commit and had no intention of committing or causing does not measurably contribute to the retributive end of ensuring that the criminal gets his just deserts.  This is the judgment of most of

				  Given the well-known fact that anticrime legislation is far more popular than legislation providing protections for persons guilty of violent crime, the large number of States prohibiting the execution of mentally retarded persons (and the complete absence of States passing legislation reinstating the power to conduct such executions) provides powerful evidence that today our society views mentally retarded offenders as categorically less culpable than the average criminal.  The evidence carries even greater force when it is noted that the legislatures that have addressed the issue have voted overwhelmingly in favor of the prohibition.

            </a>
				  Moreover, even in those States that allow the execution of mentally retarded offenders, the practice is uncommon.  Some States, for example New Hampshire and New Jersey, continue to authorize executions, but none have been carried out in decades.  Thus there is little need to pursue legislation barring the execution of the mentally retarded in those States.  And it appears that even among those States that regularly execute offenders and that have no prohibition with regard to the mentally retarded, only five have executed offenders possessing a known IQ less than 70 since we decided

				  The practice, therefore, has become truly unusual, and it is fair to say that a national consensus has developed against it.

				To the extent there is serious disagreement about the execution of mentally retarded offenders, it is in determining which offenders are in fact retarded.  In this case, for instance, the Commonwealth of Virginia disputes that Atkins suffers from mental retardation.  Not all people who claim to be mentally retarded will be so impaired as to fall within the range of mentally retarded offenders about whom there is a national consensus.  As was our approach in 
				<em>

				This consensus unquestionably reflects widespread judgment about the relative culpability of mentally retarded offenders, and the relationship between mental retardation and the penological purposes served by the death penalty.  Additionally, it suggests that some characteristics of mental retardation undermine the strength of the procedural protections that our capital jurisprudence steadfastly guards.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				As discussed above, clinical definitions of mental retardation require not only subaverage intellectual functioning, but also significant limitations in adaptive skills such as communication, self-care, and self-direction that became manifest before age 18.  Mentally retarded persons frequently know the difference between right and wrong and are competent to stand trial.  Because of their impairments, however, by definition they have diminished capacities to understand and process information, to communicate, to abstract from mistakes and learn from experience, to engage in logical reasoning, to control impulses, and to understand the reactions of others.

				  There is no evidence that they are more likely to engage in criminal conduct than others, but there is abundant evidence that they often act on impulse rather than pursuant to a premeditated plan, and that in group settings they are followers rather than leaders.

				  Their deficiencies do not warrant an exemption from criminal sanctions, but they do diminish their personal culpability.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In light of these deficiencies, our death penalty jurisprudence provides two reasons consistent with the legislative consensus that the mentally retarded should be categorically excluded from execution.  First, there is a serious question as to whether either justification that we have recognized as a basis for the death penalty applies to mentally retarded offenders.

, identified retribution and deterrence of capital crimes by prospective offenders as the social purposes served by the death penalty.  Unless the imposition of the death penalty on a mentally retarded person measurably contributes to one or both of these goals, it is nothing more than the purposeless and needless imposition of pain and suffering, and hence an unconstitutional punishment.

				With respect to retributionthe interest in seeing that the offender gets his just desertsthe severity of the appropriate punishment necessarily depends on the culpability of the offender.  Since 
				<em>
					Gregg, 
				</em>
				our jurisprudence has consistently confined the imposition of the death penalty to a narrow category of the most serious crimes.  For example, in 
				<em>
					Godfrey
				</em>
				 v.

            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/446/420" class="subref" title="subref">446 U. S. 420</a> (1980)
, we set aside a death sentence because the petitioners crimes did not reflect  a consciousness materially more depraved than that of any person guilty of murder.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 433.  If the culpability of the average murderer is insufficient to justify the most extreme sanction available to the State, the lesser culpability of the mentally retarded offender surely does not merit that form of retribution.  Thus, pursuant to our narrowing jurisprudence, which seeks to ensure that only the most deserving of execution are put to death, an exclusion for the mentally retarded is appropriate.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				With respect to deterrencethe interest in preventing capital crimes by prospective offendersit seems likely that capital punishment can serve as a deterrent only when murder is the result of premeditation and deliberation,  
				<em>
					Enmund, 
				</em>
				458 U. S., at 799.  Exempting the mentally retarded from that punishment will not affect the cold calculus that precedes the decision of other potential murderers.  
				<em>
					Gregg,
				</em>
				 428 U. S., at 186.  Indeed, that sort of calculus is at the opposite end of the spectrum from behavior of mentally retarded offenders.  The theory of deterrence in capital sentencing is predicated upon the notion that the increased severity of the punishment will inhibit criminal actors from carrying out murderous conduct.  Yet it is the same cognitive and behavioral impairments that make these defendants less morally culpablefor example, the diminished ability to understand and process information, to learn from experience, to engage in logical reasoning, or to control impulsesthat also make it less likely that they can process the information of the possibility of execution as a penalty and, as a result, control their conduct based upon that information.  Nor will exempting the mentally retarded from execution lessen the deterrent effect of the death penalty with respect to offenders who are not mentally retarded.  Such individuals are unprotected by the exemption and will continue to face the threat of execution.  Thus, executing the mentally retarded will not measurably further the goal of deterrence.

				 but also by the lesser ability of mentally retarded defendants to make a persuasive showing of mitigation in the face of prosecutorial evidence of one or more aggravating factors.  Mentally retarded defendants may be less able to give meaningful assistance to their counsel and are typically poor witnesses, and their demeanor may create an unwarranted impression of lack of remorse for their crimes.  As 
				<em>

				 demonstrated, moreover, reliance on mental retardation as a mitigating factor can be a two-edged sword that may enhance the likelihood that the aggravating factor of future dangerousness will be found by the jury.  492 U.

				Our independent evaluation of the issue reveals no reason to disagree with the judgment of the legislatures that have recently addressed the matter and concluded that death is not a suitable punishment for a mentally retarded criminal.  We are not persuaded that the execution of mentally retarded criminals will measurably advance the deterrent or the retributive purpose of the death penalty.  Construing and applying the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentviii" class="subref" title="subref">Eighth Amendment</a> in the light of our evolving standards of decency, we therefore conclude that such punishment is excessive and that the Constitution places a substantive restriction on the States power to take the life of a mentally retarded offender.

						 The American Association of Mental Retardation (AAMR) defines mental retardation as follows: Mental retardation refers to substantial limitations in present functioning.  It is characterized by significantly subaverage intellectual functioning, existing concurrently with related limitations in two or more of the following applicable adaptive skill areas: communication, self-care, home living, social skills, community use, self-direction, health and safety, functional academics, leisure, and work.  Mental retardation manifests before age 18.  Mental Retardation: Definition, Classification, and Systems of Supports 5 (9th ed. 1992).


The American Psychiatric Associations definition is similar: The essential feature of Mental Retardation is significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning (Criterion A) that is accompanied by significant limitations in adaptive functioning in at least two of the following skill areas: communication, self-care, home living, social/interpersonal skills, use of community resources, self-direction, functional academic skills, work, leisure, health, and safety (Criterion B).  The onset must occur before age 18 years (Criterion C).  Mental Retardation has many different etiologies and may be seen as a final common pathway of various pathological processes that affect the functioning of the central nervous system.  American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 41 (4th ed. 2000).  Mild mental retardation is typically used to describe people with an IQ level of 5055 to approximately 70.  Id., at 4243.

						 Dr. Nelson administered the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scales test (WAISIII), the standard instrument in the United States for assessing intellectual functioning.  AAMR, Mental Retardation, supra.  The WAISIII is scored by adding together the number of points earned on different subtests, and using a mathematical formula to convert this raw score into a scaled score.  The test measures an intelligence range from 45 to 155.  The mean score of the test is 100, which means that a person receiving a score of 100 is considered to have an average level of cognitive functioning.  A. Kaufman &amp; E. Lichtenberger, Essentials of WAISIII Assessment 60 (1999).  It is estimated that between 1 and 3 percent of the population has an IQ between 70 and 75 or lower, which is typically considered the cutoff IQ score for the intellectual function prong of the mental retardation definition.  2 B. Sadock &amp; V. Sadock, Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry 2952 (7th ed. 2000).


At the sentencing phase, Dr. Nelson testified: [Atkins] full scale IQ is 59.  Compared to the population at large, that means less than one percentile… . Mental retardation is a relatively rare thing.  Its about one percent of the population.  App. 274.  According to Dr. Nelson, Atkins IQ score would automatically qualify for Social Security disability income.  Id., at 280.  Dr. Nelson also indicated that of the over 40 capital defendants that he had evaluated, Atkins was only the second individual who met the criteria for mental retardation. Id., at 310.  He testified that, in his opinion, Atkins limited intellect had been a consistent feature throughout his life, and that his IQ score of 59 is not an aberration, malingered result, or invalid test score. Id., at 308.

						 Dr. Samenows testimony was based upon two interviews with Atkins, a review of his school records, and interviews with correctional staff.  He did not administer an intelligence test, but did ask Atkins questions taken from the 1972 version of the Wechsler Memory Scale. Id., at 524525, 529.  Dr. Samenow attributed Atkins academic performance [that was] by and large terrible to the fact that he is a person who chose to pay attention sometimes, not to pay attention others, and did poorly because he did not want to do what he was required to do.  Id., at 480481.

						 Jerome Bowden, who was identified as having mental retardation when he was 14-years-old, was scheduled for imminent execution in Georgia in June of 1986.  The Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles granted a stay following public protests over his execution.  A psychologist selected by the State evaluated Bowden and determined that he had an IQ of 65, which is consistent with mental retardation.  Nevertheless, the board lifted the stay and Bowden was executed the following day.  The board concluded that Bowden understood the nature of his crime and his punishment and therefore that execution, despite his mental deficiencies, was permissible.

In fact, he stated: We do not execute mentally retarded murderers today.  See Veto Proclamation for H. B. No. 236.  Instead, his motivation to veto the bill was based upon what he perceived as a procedural flaw: My opposition to this legislation focuses on a serious legal flaw in the bill.  House Bill No. 236 would create a system whereby the jury and judge are asked to make the same determination based on two different sets of facts… .

						 Additional evidence makes it clear that this legislative judgment  reflects a much broader social and professional consensus.  For example, several organizations with germane expertise have adopted official positions opposing the imposition of the death penalty upon a mentally retarded offender.  See Brief for American Psychological Association et al. as Amici Curiae; Brief for AAMR et al. as Amici Curiae.  In addition, representatives of widely diverse religious communities in the United States, reflecting Christian, Jewish, Muslim, and Buddhist traditions, have filed an amicus curiae brief explaining that even though their views about the death penalty differ, they all share a conviction that the execution of persons with mental retardation cannot be morally justified.  See Brief for United States Catholic Conference et al. as Amici Curiae in McCarver v. North Carolina, O. T. 2001, No. 008727, p. 2.  Moreover, within the world community, the imposition of the death penalty for crimes committed by mentally retarded offenders is overwhelmingly disapproved.  Brief for The European Union as Amicus Curiae in McCarver v. North Carolina, O. T. 2001, No. 008727, p. 4.  Finally, polling data shows a widespread consensus among Americans, even those who support the death penalty, that executing the mentally retarded is wrong.  R. Bonner &amp; S. Rimer, Executing the Mentally Retarded Even as Laws Begin to Shift, N. Y. Times, Aug. 7, 2000, p. A1; App. B to Brief for AAMR as Amicus Curiae in McCarver v. North Carolina, O. T. 2001, No. 008727 (appending approximately 20 state and national polls on the issue).   Although these factors are by no means dispositive, their consistency with the legislative evidence lends further support to our conclusion that there is a consensus among those who have addressed the issue.  See Thompson v. Oklahoma, 487U. S. 815, 830, 831, n. 31 (1988) (considering the views of respected professional organizations, by other nations that share our Anglo-American heritage, and by the leading members of the Western European community).

				The question presented by this case is whether a national consensus deprives Virginia of the constitutional power to impose the death penalty on capital murder defendants like petitioner, 
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, those defendants who indisputably are competent to stand trial, aware of the punishment they are about to suffer and why, and whose mental retardation has been found an insufficiently compelling reason to lessen their individual responsibility for the crime.  The Court pronounces the punishment cruel and unusual primarily because 18 States recently have passed laws limiting the death eligibility of certain defendants based on mental retardation alone, despite the fact that the laws of 19 other States besides Virginia continue to leave the question of proper punishment to the individuated consideration of sentencing judges or juries familiar with the particular offender and his or her crime.

				<em>

				, at 1 (dissenting opinion), that the Courts assessment of the current legislative judgment regarding the execution of defendants like petitioner more resembles a

				 rationalization for the majoritys subjectively preferred result rather than any objective effort to ascertain the content of an evolving standard of decency.  I write separately, however, to call attention to the defects in the Courts decision to place weight on foreign laws, the views of professional and religious organizations, and opinion polls in reaching its conclusion.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1112, n. 21.  The Courts suggestion that these sources are relevant to the constitutional question finds little support in our precedents and, in my view, is antithetical to considerations of federalism, which instruct that any permanent prohibition upon all units of democratic government must [be apparent] in the operative acts (laws and the application of laws) that the people have approved.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In my view, these two sourcesthe work product of legislatures and sentencing jury determinationsought to be the sole indicators by which courts ascertain the contemporary American conceptions of decency for purposes of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentviii" class="subref" title="subref">Eighth Amendment</a>.  They are the only objective indicia of contemporary values firmly supported by our precedents.  More importantly, however, they can be reconciled with the undeniable precepts that the democratic branches of government and individual sentencing juries are, by design, better suited than courts to evaluating and giving effect to the complex societal and moral considerations that inform the selection of publicly acceptable criminal punishments.

				In reaching its conclusion today, the Court does not take notice of the fact that neither petitioner nor his

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				To further buttress its appraisal of contemporary societal values, the Court marshals public opinion poll results and evidence that several professional organizations and religious groups have adopted official positions opposing the imposition of the death penalty upon mentally retarded offenders.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1112, n. 21 (citing Brief for American Psychological Association et al. as 
				<em>
					Amici Curiae
				</em>
				; Brief for American Association on Mental Retardation et al. as 
				<em>
					Amici Curiae
				</em>
				; noting that representatives of widely diverse religious communities . . . reflecting Christian, Jewish, Muslim, and Buddhist traditions … share a conviction that the execution of persons with mental retardation cannot be morally justified ; and stating that polling data shows a widespread consensus among Americans … that executing the mentally retarded is wrong).  In my view, none should be accorded any weight on the Eight Amendment scale when the elected representatives of a States populace have not deemed them persuasive enough to prompt legislative action.  In 
				<em>
					Penry
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				492 U. S., at 334335, we were cited similar data and declined to take them into consideration where the public sentiment expressed in [them] had yet to find expression in state law.  See also 
				<em>
					Stanford
				</em>
				, 492 U. S., at 377 (plurality opinion) (refusing the invitation to rest constitutional law upon such uncertain foundations as public opinion polls, the views of interest groups, and the positions adopted by various professional organizations).  For the Court to rely on such data today serves only to illustrate its willingness to proscribe by judicial fiatat the behest of private organizations speaking only for themselvesa punishment about which no across-the-board consensus has developed through the workings of normal democratic processes in the laboratories of the States.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Even if I were to accept the legitimacy of the Courts decision to reach beyond the product of legislatures and practices of sentencing juries to discern a national standard of decency, I would take issue with the blind-faith credence it accords the opinion polls brought to our attention.  An extensive body of social science literature describes how methodological and other errors can affect the reliability and validity of estimates about the opinions and attitudes of a population derived from various sampling techniques.  Everything from variations in the survey methodology, such as the choice of the target population, the sampling design used, the questions asked, and the statistical analyses used to interpret the data can skew the results.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 R. Groves, Survey Errors and Survey Costs (1989); 1 C. Turner &amp; E. Martin, Surveying Subjective Phenomena (1984).

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Federal Judicial Centers Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence 221271 (1994) and its Manual for Complex Litigation §21.493 pp. 101103 (3d ed. 1995), offer helpful suggestions to judges called upon to assess the weight and admissibility of survey evidence on a factual issue before a court.  Looking at the polling data (reproduced in the Appendix to this opinion) in light of these factors, one cannot help but observe how unlikely it is that the data could support a valid inference about the question presented by this case.  For example, the questions reported to have been asked in the various polls do not appear designed to gauge whether the respondents might find the death penalty an acceptable punishment for mentally retarded offenders in rare cases.  Most are categorical (
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 Do you think that persons convicted of murder who are mentally retarded should or should not receive the death penalty?), and, as such, would not elicit whether the respondent might agree or disagree that all mentally retarded people by definition can never act with the level of culpability associated with the death penalty, regardless of the severity of their impairment or the individual circumstances of their crime.  Second, none of the 27 polls cited disclose the targeted survey population or the sampling techniques used by those who conducted the research.  Thus, even if one accepts that the survey instruments were adequately designed to address a relevant question, it is impossible to know whether the sample was representative enough or the methodology sufficiently sound to tell us anything about the opinions of the citizens of a particular State or the American public at large.  Finally, the information provided to us does not indicate why a particular survey was conducted or, in a few cases, by whom, factors which also can bear on the objectivity of the results.  In order to be credited here, such surveys should be offered as evidence at trial, where their sponsors can be examined and cross-examined about these matters.

				The question presented by this case is whether a national consensus deprives Virginia of the constitutional power to impose the death penalty on capital murder defendants like petitioner, 
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, those defendants who indisputably are competent to stand trial, aware of the punishment they are about to suffer and why, and whose mental retardation has been found an insufficiently compelling reason to lessen their individual responsibility for the crime.  The Court pronounces the punishment cruel and unusual primarily because 18 States recently have passed laws limiting the death eligibility of certain defendants based on mental retardation alone, despite the fact that the laws of 19 other States besides Virginia continue to leave the question of proper punishment to the individuated consideration of sentencing judges or juries familiar with the particular offender and his or her crime.

I write separately, however, to call attention to the defects in the Courts decision to place weight on foreign laws, the views of professional and religious organizations, and opinion polls in reaching its conclusion.

				In my view, these two sourcesthe work product of legislatures and sentencing jury determinationsought to be the sole indicators by which courts ascertain the contemporary American conceptions of decency for purposes of the

More importantly, however, they can be reconciled with the undeniable precepts that the democratic branches of government and individual sentencing juries are, by design, better suited than courts to evaluating and giving effect to the complex societal and moral considerations that inform the selection of publicly acceptable criminal punishments.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				To further buttress its appraisal of contemporary societal values, the Court marshals public opinion poll results and evidence that several professional organizations and religious groups have adopted official positions opposing the imposition of the death penalty upon mentally retarded offenders.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1112, n. 21 (citing Brief for American Psychological Association et al. as 
				<em>
					Amici Curiae
				</em>
				; Brief for American Association on Mental Retardation et al. as 
				<em>
					Amici Curiae
				</em>
				; noting that representatives of widely diverse religious communities . . . reflecting Christian, Jewish, Muslim, and Buddhist traditions … share a conviction that the execution of persons with mental retardation cannot be morally justified ; and stating that polling data shows a widespread consensus among Americans … that executing the mentally retarded is wrong).  In my view, none should be accorded any weight on the Eight Amendment scale when the elected representatives of a States populace have not deemed them persuasive enough to prompt legislative action.  In 
				<em>
					Penry
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				492 U. S., at 334335, we were cited similar data and declined to take them into consideration where the public sentiment expressed in [them] had yet to find expression in state law.  See also 
				<em>
					Stanford
				</em>
				, 492 U. S., at 377 (plurality opinion) (refusing the invitation to rest constitutional law upon such uncertain foundations as public opinion polls, the views of interest groups, and the positions adopted by various professional organizations).  For the Court to rely on such data today serves only to illustrate its willingness to proscribe by judicial fiatat the behest of private organizations speaking only for themselvesa punishment about which no across-the-board consensus has developed through the workings of normal democratic processes in the laboratories of the States.

				Even if I were to accept the legitimacy of the Courts decision to reach beyond the product of legislatures and practices of sentencing juries to discern a national standard of decency, I would take issue with the blind-faith credence it accords the opinion polls brought to our attention.  An extensive body of social science literature describes how methodological and other errors can affect the reliability and validity of estimates about the opinions and attitudes of a population derived from various sampling techniques.  Everything from variations in the survey methodology, such as the choice of the target population, the sampling design used, the questions asked, and the statistical analyses used to interpret the data can skew the results.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 R. Groves, Survey Errors and Survey Costs (1989); 1 C. Turner &amp; E. Martin, Surveying Subjective Phenomena (1984).

				The Federal Judicial Centers Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence 221271 (1994) and its Manual for Complex Litigation §21.493 pp. 101103 (3d ed. 1995), offer helpful suggestions to judges called upon to assess the weight and admissibility of survey evidence on a factual issue before a court.  Looking at the polling data (reproduced in the Appendix to this opinion) in light of these factors, one cannot help but observe how unlikely it is that the data could support a valid inference about the question presented by this case.  For example, the questions reported to have been asked in the various polls do not appear designed to gauge whether the respondents might find the death penalty an acceptable punishment for mentally retarded offenders in rare cases.  Most are categorical (
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 Do you think that persons convicted of murder who are mentally retarded should or should not receive the death penalty?), and, as such, would not elicit whether the respondent might agree or disagree that all mentally retarded people by definition can never act with the level of culpability associated with the death penalty, regardless of the severity of their impairment or the individual circumstances of their crime.  Second, none of the 27 polls cited disclose the targeted survey population or the sampling techniques used by those who conducted the research.  Thus, even if one accepts that the survey instruments were adequately designed to address a relevant question, it is impossible to know whether the sample was representative enough or the methodology sufficiently sound to tell us anything about the opinions of the citizens of a particular State or the American public at large.  Finally, the information provided to us does not indicate why a particular survey was conducted or, in a few cases, by whom, factors which also can bear on the objectivity of the results.  In order to be credited here, such surveys should be offered as evidence at trial, where their sponsors can be examined and cross-examined about these matters.

				The question presented by this case is whether a national consensus deprives Virginia of the constitutional power to impose the death penalty on capital murder defendants like petitioner, 
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, those defendants who indisputably are competent to stand trial, aware of the punishment they are about to suffer and why, and whose mental retardation has been found an insufficiently compelling reason to lessen their individual responsibility for the crime.  The Court pronounces the punishment cruel and unusual primarily because 18 States recently have passed laws limiting the death eligibility of certain defendants based on mental retardation alone, despite the fact that the laws of 19 other States besides Virginia continue to leave the question of proper punishment to the individuated consideration of sentencing judges or juries familiar with the particular offender and his or her crime.

				I agree with 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Scalia
				</span>
				, 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, at 1 (dissenting opinion), that the Courts assessment of the current legislative judgment regarding the execution of defendants like petitioner more resembles a 
				<em>
					post hoc
				</em>
				 rationalization for the majoritys subjectively preferred result rather than any objective effort to ascertain the content of an evolving standard of decency.  I write separately, however, to call attention to the defects in the Courts decision to place weight on foreign laws, the views of professional and religious organizations, and opinion polls in reaching its conclusion.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1112, n. 21.  The Courts suggestion that these sources are relevant to the constitutional question finds little support in our precedents and, in my view, is antithetical to considerations of federalism, which instruct that any permanent prohibition upon all units of democratic government must [be apparent] in the operative acts (laws and the application of laws) that the people have approved.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">377</a> (1989)
 (plurality opinion).  The Courts uncritical acceptance of the opinion poll data brought to our attention, moreover, warrants additional comment, because we lack sufficient information to conclude that the surveys were conducted in accordance with generally accepted scientific principles or are capable of supporting valid empirical inferences about the issue before us.

				In my view, these two sourcesthe work product of legislatures and sentencing jury determinationsought to be the sole indicators by which courts ascertain the contemporary American conceptions of decency for purposes of the

More importantly, however, they can be reconciled with the undeniable precepts that the democratic branches of government and individual sentencing juries are, by design, better suited than courts to evaluating and giving effect to the complex societal and moral considerations that inform the selection of publicly acceptable criminal punishments.

				In reaching its conclusion today, the Court does not take notice of the fact that neither petitioner nor his

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				To further buttress its appraisal of contemporary societal values, the Court marshals public opinion poll results and evidence that several professional organizations and religious groups have adopted official positions opposing the imposition of the death penalty upon mentally retarded offenders.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1112, n. 21 (citing Brief for American Psychological Association et al. as 
				<em>
					Amici Curiae
				</em>
				; Brief for American Association on Mental Retardation et al. as 
				<em>
					Amici Curiae
				</em>
				; noting that representatives of widely diverse religious communities . . . reflecting Christian, Jewish, Muslim, and Buddhist traditions … share a conviction that the execution of persons with mental retardation cannot be morally justified ; and stating that polling data shows a widespread consensus among Americans … that executing the mentally retarded is wrong).  In my view, none should be accorded any weight on the Eight Amendment scale when the elected representatives of a States populace have not deemed them persuasive enough to prompt legislative action.  In 
				<em>
					Penry
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				492 U. S., at 334335, we were cited similar data and declined to take them into consideration where the public sentiment expressed in [them] had yet to find expression in state law.  See also 
				<em>
					Stanford
				</em>
				, 492 U. S., at 377 (plurality opinion) (refusing the invitation to rest constitutional law upon such uncertain foundations as public opinion polls, the views of interest groups, and the positions adopted by various professional organizations).  For the Court to rely on such data today serves only to illustrate its willingness to proscribe by judicial fiatat the behest of private organizations speaking only for themselvesa punishment about which no across-the-board consensus has developed through the workings of normal democratic processes in the laboratories of the States.

				Even if I were to accept the legitimacy of the Courts decision to reach beyond the product of legislatures and practices of sentencing juries to discern a national standard of decency, I would take issue with the blind-faith credence it accords the opinion polls brought to our attention.  An extensive body of social science literature describes how methodological and other errors can affect the reliability and validity of estimates about the opinions and attitudes of a population derived from various sampling techniques.  Everything from variations in the survey methodology, such as the choice of the target population, the sampling design used, the questions asked, and the statistical analyses used to interpret the data can skew the results.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 R. Groves, Survey Errors and Survey Costs (1989); 1 C. Turner &amp; E. Martin, Surveying Subjective Phenomena (1984).

				The Federal Judicial Centers Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence 221271 (1994) and its Manual for Complex Litigation §21.493 pp. 101103 (3d ed. 1995), offer helpful suggestions to judges called upon to assess the weight and admissibility of survey evidence on a factual issue before a court.  Looking at the polling data (reproduced in the Appendix to this opinion) in light of these factors, one cannot help but observe how unlikely it is that the data could support a valid inference about the question presented by this case.  For example, the questions reported to have been asked in the various polls do not appear designed to gauge whether the respondents might find the death penalty an acceptable punishment for mentally retarded offenders in rare cases.  Most are categorical (
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 Do you think that persons convicted of murder who are mentally retarded should or should not receive the death penalty?), and, as such, would not elicit whether the respondent might agree or disagree that all mentally retarded people by definition can never act with the level of culpability associated with the death penalty, regardless of the severity of their impairment or the individual circumstances of their crime.  Second, none of the 27 polls cited disclose the targeted survey population or the sampling techniques used by those who conducted the research.  Thus, even if one accepts that the survey instruments were adequately designed to address a relevant question, it is impossible to know whether the sample was representative enough or the methodology sufficiently sound to tell us anything about the opinions of the citizens of a particular State or the American public at large.  Finally, the information provided to us does not indicate why a particular survey was conducted or, in a few cases, by whom, factors which also can bear on the objectivity of the results.  In order to be credited here, such surveys should be offered as evidence at trial, where their sponsors can be examined and cross-examined about these matters.

				There are strong reasons for limiting our inquiry into what constitutes an evolving standard of decency under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentviii" class="subref" title="subref">Eighth Amendment</a> to the laws passed by legislatures and the practices of sentencing juries in America.  Here, the Court goes beyond these well-established objective indicators of contemporary values.

				The question presented by this case is whether a national consensus deprives Virginia of the constitutional power to impose the death penalty on capital murder defendants like petitioner, 
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, those defendants who indisputably are competent to stand trial, aware of the punishment they are about to suffer and why, and whose mental retardation has been found an insufficiently compelling reason to lessen their individual responsibility for the crime.  The Court pronounces the punishment cruel and unusual primarily because 18 States recently have passed laws limiting the death eligibility of certain defendants based on mental retardation alone, despite the fact that the laws of 19 other States besides Virginia continue to leave the question of proper punishment to the individuated consideration of sentencing judges or juries familiar with the particular offender and his or her crime.

				I agree with 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Scalia
				</span>
				, 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, at 1 (dissenting opinion), that the Courts assessment of the current legislative judgment regarding the execution of defendants like petitioner more resembles a 
				<em>
					post hoc
				</em>
				 rationalization for the majoritys subjectively preferred result rather than any objective effort to ascertain the content of an evolving standard of decency.  I write separately, however, to call attention to the defects in the Courts decision to place weight on foreign laws, the views of professional and religious organizations, and opinion polls in reaching its conclusion.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1112, n. 21.  The Courts suggestion that these sources are relevant to the constitutional question finds little support in our precedents and, in my view, is antithetical to considerations of federalism, which instruct that any permanent prohibition upon all units of democratic government must [be apparent] in the operative acts (laws and the application of laws) that the people have approved.

The Courts uncritical acceptance of the opinion poll data brought to our attention, moreover, warrants additional comment, because we lack sufficient information to conclude that the surveys were conducted in accordance with generally accepted scientific principles or are capable of supporting valid empirical inferences about the issue before us.

				In my view, these two sourcesthe work product of legislatures and sentencing jury determinationsought to be the sole indicators by which courts ascertain the contemporary American conceptions of decency for purposes of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentviii" class="subref" title="subref">Eighth Amendment</a>.  They are the only objective indicia of contemporary values firmly supported by our precedents.  More importantly, however, they can be reconciled with the undeniable precepts that the democratic branches of government and individual sentencing juries are, by design, better suited than courts to evaluating and giving effect to the complex societal and moral considerations that inform the selection of publicly acceptable criminal punishments.

				In reaching its conclusion today, the Court does not take notice of the fact that neither petitioner nor his

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				To further buttress its appraisal of contemporary societal values, the Court marshals public opinion poll results and evidence that several professional organizations and religious groups have adopted official positions opposing the imposition of the death penalty upon mentally retarded offenders.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1112, n. 21 (citing Brief for American Psychological Association et al. as 
				<em>
					Amici Curiae
				</em>
				; Brief for American Association on Mental Retardation et al. as 
				<em>
					Amici Curiae
				</em>
				; noting that representatives of widely diverse religious communities . . . reflecting Christian, Jewish, Muslim, and Buddhist traditions … share a conviction that the execution of persons with mental retardation cannot be morally justified ; and stating that polling data shows a widespread consensus among Americans … that executing the mentally retarded is wrong).  In my view, none should be accorded any weight on the Eight Amendment scale when the elected representatives of a States populace have not deemed them persuasive enough to prompt legislative action.  In 
				<em>
					Penry
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				492 U. S., at 334335, we were cited similar data and declined to take them into consideration where the public sentiment expressed in [them] had yet to find expression in state law.  See also 
				<em>
					Stanford
				</em>
				, 492 U. S., at 377 (plurality opinion) (refusing the invitation to rest constitutional law upon such uncertain foundations as public opinion polls, the views of interest groups, and the positions adopted by various professional organizations).  For the Court to rely on such data today serves only to illustrate its willingness to proscribe by judicial fiatat the behest of private organizations speaking only for themselvesa punishment about which no across-the-board consensus has developed through the workings of normal democratic processes in the laboratories of the States.

				Even if I were to accept the legitimacy of the Courts decision to reach beyond the product of legislatures and practices of sentencing juries to discern a national standard of decency, I would take issue with the blind-faith credence it accords the opinion polls brought to our attention.  An extensive body of social science literature describes how methodological and other errors can affect the reliability and validity of estimates about the opinions and attitudes of a population derived from various sampling techniques.  Everything from variations in the survey methodology, such as the choice of the target population, the sampling design used, the questions asked, and the statistical analyses used to interpret the data can skew the results.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 R. Groves, Survey Errors and Survey Costs (1989); 1 C. Turner &amp; E. Martin, Surveying Subjective Phenomena (1984).

				The Federal Judicial Centers Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence 221271 (1994) and its Manual for Complex Litigation §21.493 pp. 101103 (3d ed. 1995), offer helpful suggestions to judges called upon to assess the weight and admissibility of survey evidence on a factual issue before a court.  Looking at the polling data (reproduced in the Appendix to this opinion) in light of these factors, one cannot help but observe how unlikely it is that the data could support a valid inference about the question presented by this case.  For example, the questions reported to have been asked in the various polls do not appear designed to gauge whether the respondents might find the death penalty an acceptable punishment for mentally retarded offenders in rare cases.  Most are categorical (
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 Do you think that persons convicted of murder who are mentally retarded should or should not receive the death penalty?), and, as such, would not elicit whether the respondent might agree or disagree that all mentally retarded people by definition can never act with the level of culpability associated with the death penalty, regardless of the severity of their impairment or the individual circumstances of their crime.  Second, none of the 27 polls cited disclose the targeted survey population or the sampling techniques used by those who conducted the research.  Thus, even if one accepts that the survey instruments were adequately designed to address a relevant question, it is impossible to know whether the sample was representative enough or the methodology sufficiently sound to tell us anything about the opinions of the citizens of a particular State or the American public at large.  Finally, the information provided to us does not indicate why a particular survey was conducted or, in a few cases, by whom, factors which also can bear on the objectivity of the results.  In order to be credited here, such surveys should be offered as evidence at trial, where their sponsors can be examined and cross-examined about these matters.

				There are strong reasons for limiting our inquiry into what constitutes an evolving standard of decency under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentviii" class="subref" title="subref">Eighth Amendment</a> to the laws passed by legislatures and the practices of sentencing juries in America.  Here, the Court goes beyond these well-established objective indicators of contemporary values.

				The question presented by this case is whether a national consensus deprives Virginia of the constitutional power to impose the death penalty on capital murder defendants like petitioner, 
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, those defendants who indisputably are competent to stand trial, aware of the punishment they are about to suffer and why, and whose mental retardation has been found an insufficiently compelling reason to lessen their individual responsibility for the crime.  The Court pronounces the punishment cruel and unusual primarily because 18 States recently have passed laws limiting the death eligibility of certain defendants based on mental retardation alone, despite the fact that the laws of 19 other States besides Virginia continue to leave the question of proper punishment to the individuated consideration of sentencing judges or juries familiar with the particular offender and his or her crime.

				I agree with 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Scalia
				</span>
				, 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, at 1 (dissenting opinion), that the Courts assessment of the current legislative judgment regarding the execution of defendants like petitioner more resembles a 
				<em>
					post hoc
				</em>
				 rationalization for the majoritys subjectively preferred result rather than any objective effort to ascertain the content of an evolving standard of decency.  I write separately, however, to call attention to the defects in the Courts decision to place weight on foreign laws, the views of professional and religious organizations, and opinion polls in reaching its conclusion.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1112, n. 21.  The Courts suggestion that these sources are relevant to the constitutional question finds little support in our precedents and, in my view, is antithetical to considerations of federalism, which instruct that any permanent prohibition upon all units of democratic government must [be apparent] in the operative acts (laws and the application of laws) that the people have approved.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In my view, these two sourcesthe work product of legislatures and sentencing jury determinationsought to be the sole indicators by which courts ascertain the contemporary American conceptions of decency for purposes of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentviii" class="subref" title="subref">Eighth Amendment</a>.  They are the only objective indicia of contemporary values firmly supported by our precedents.  More importantly, however, they can be reconciled with the undeniable precepts that the democratic branches of government and individual sentencing juries are, by design, better suited than courts to evaluating and giving effect to the complex societal and moral considerations that inform the selection of publicly acceptable criminal punishments.

				To further buttress its appraisal of contemporary societal values, the Court marshals public opinion poll results and evidence that several professional organizations and religious groups have adopted official positions opposing the imposition of the death penalty upon mentally retarded offenders.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1112, n. 21 (citing Brief for American Psychological Association et al. as 
				<em>
					Amici Curiae
				</em>
				; Brief for American Association on Mental Retardation et al. as 
				<em>
					Amici Curiae
				</em>
				; noting that representatives of widely diverse religious communities . . . reflecting Christian, Jewish, Muslim, and Buddhist traditions … share a conviction that the execution of persons with mental retardation cannot be morally justified ; and stating that polling data shows a widespread consensus among Americans … that executing the mentally retarded is wrong).  In my view, none should be accorded any weight on the Eight Amendment scale when the elected representatives of a States populace have not deemed them persuasive enough to prompt legislative action.  In 
				<em>
					Penry
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				492 U. S., at 334335, we were cited similar data and declined to take them into consideration where the public sentiment expressed in [them] had yet to find expression in state law.  See also 
				<em>
					Stanford
				</em>
				, 492 U. S., at 377 (plurality opinion) (refusing the invitation to rest constitutional law upon such uncertain foundations as public opinion polls, the views of interest groups, and the positions adopted by various professional organizations).  For the Court to rely on such data today serves only to illustrate its willingness to proscribe by judicial fiatat the behest of private organizations speaking only for themselvesa punishment about which no across-the-board consensus has developed through the workings of normal democratic processes in the laboratories of the States.

				Even if I were to accept the legitimacy of the Courts decision to reach beyond the product of legislatures and practices of sentencing juries to discern a national standard of decency, I would take issue with the blind-faith credence it accords the opinion polls brought to our attention.  An extensive body of social science literature describes how methodological and other errors can affect the reliability and validity of estimates about the opinions and attitudes of a population derived from various sampling techniques.  Everything from variations in the survey methodology, such as the choice of the target population, the sampling design used, the questions asked, and the statistical analyses used to interpret the data can skew the results.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 R. Groves, Survey Errors and Survey Costs (1989); 1 C. Turner &amp; E. Martin, Surveying Subjective Phenomena (1984).

				The Federal Judicial Centers Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence 221271 (1994) and its Manual for Complex Litigation §21.493 pp. 101103 (3d ed. 1995), offer helpful suggestions to judges called upon to assess the weight and admissibility of survey evidence on a factual issue before a court.  Looking at the polling data (reproduced in the Appendix to this opinion) in light of these factors, one cannot help but observe how unlikely it is that the data could support a valid inference about the question presented by this case.  For example, the questions reported to have been asked in the various polls do not appear designed to gauge whether the respondents might find the death penalty an acceptable punishment for mentally retarded offenders in rare cases.  Most are categorical (
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 Do you think that persons convicted of murder who are mentally retarded should or should not receive the death penalty?), and, as such, would not elicit whether the respondent might agree or disagree that all mentally retarded people by definition can never act with the level of culpability associated with the death penalty, regardless of the severity of their impairment or the individual circumstances of their crime.  Second, none of the 27 polls cited disclose the targeted survey population or the sampling techniques used by those who conducted the research.  Thus, even if one accepts that the survey instruments were adequately designed to address a relevant question, it is impossible to know whether the sample was representative enough or the methodology sufficiently sound to tell us anything about the opinions of the citizens of a particular State or the American public at large.  Finally, the information provided to us does not indicate why a particular survey was conducted or, in a few cases, by whom, factors which also can bear on the objectivity of the results.  In order to be credited here, such surveys should be offered as evidence at trial, where their sponsors can be examined and cross-examined about these matters.

				There are strong reasons for limiting our inquiry into what constitutes an evolving standard of decency under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentviii" class="subref" title="subref">Eighth Amendment</a> to the laws passed by legislatures and the practices of sentencing juries in America.  Here, the Court goes beyond these well-established objective indicators of contemporary values.  It finds further support to [its] conclusion that a national consensus has developed against imposing the death penalty on all mentally retarded defendants in international opinion, the views of professional and religious organizations, and opinion polls not demonstrated to be reliable.

				The question presented by this case is whether a national consensus deprives Virginia of the constitutional power to impose the death penalty on capital murder defendants like petitioner, 
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, those defendants who indisputably are competent to stand trial, aware of the punishment they are about to suffer and why, and whose mental retardation has been found an insufficiently compelling reason to lessen their individual responsibility for the crime.  The Court pronounces the punishment cruel and unusual primarily because 18 States recently have passed laws limiting the death eligibility of certain defendants based on mental retardation alone, despite the fact that the laws of 19 other States besides Virginia continue to leave the question of proper punishment to the individuated consideration of sentencing judges or juries familiar with the particular offender and his or her crime.

				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Scalia
				</span>
				, 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, at 1 (dissenting opinion), that the Courts assessment of the current legislative judgment regarding the execution of defendants like petitioner more resembles a 
				<em>
					post hoc
				</em>
				 rationalization for the majoritys subjectively preferred result rather than any objective effort to ascertain the content of an evolving standard of decency.  I write separately, however, to call attention to the defects in the Courts decision to place weight on foreign laws, the views of professional and religious organizations, and opinion polls in reaching its conclusion.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1112, n. 21.  The Courts suggestion that these sources are relevant to the constitutional question finds little support in our precedents and, in my view, is antithetical to considerations of federalism, which instruct that any permanent prohibition upon all units of democratic government must [be apparent] in the operative acts (laws and the application of laws) that the people have approved.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In my view, these two sourcesthe work product of legislatures and sentencing jury determinationsought to be the sole indicators by which courts ascertain the contemporary American conceptions of decency for purposes of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentviii" class="subref" title="subref">Eighth Amendment</a>.  They are the only objective indicia of contemporary values firmly supported by our precedents.  More importantly, however, they can be reconciled with the undeniable precepts that the democratic branches of government and individual sentencing juries are, by design, better suited than courts to evaluating and giving effect to the complex societal and moral considerations that inform the selection of publicly acceptable criminal punishments.

				In reaching its conclusion today, the Court does not take notice of the fact that neither petitioner nor his

				To further buttress its appraisal of contemporary societal values, the Court marshals public opinion poll results and evidence that several professional organizations and religious groups have adopted official positions opposing the imposition of the death penalty upon mentally retarded offenders.  See 
				<em>

				, at 1112, n. 21 (citing Brief for American Psychological Association et al. as 
				<em>

				; Brief for American Association on Mental Retardation et al. as 
				<em>
					Amici Curiae
				</em>
				; noting that representatives of widely diverse religious communities . . . reflecting Christian, Jewish, Muslim, and Buddhist traditions … share a conviction that the execution of persons with mental retardation cannot be morally justified ; and stating that polling data shows a widespread consensus among Americans … that executing the mentally retarded is wrong).  In my view, none should be accorded any weight on the Eight Amendment scale when the elected representatives of a States populace have not deemed them persuasive enough to prompt legislative action.  In 
				<em>
					Penry
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				492 U. S., at 334335, we were cited similar data and declined to take them into consideration where the public sentiment expressed in [them] had yet to find expression in state law.  See also 
				<em>
					Stanford
				</em>
				, 492 U. S., at 377 (plurality opinion) (refusing the invitation to rest constitutional law upon such uncertain foundations as public opinion polls, the views of interest groups, and the positions adopted by various professional organizations).  For the Court to rely on such data today serves only to illustrate its willingness to proscribe by judicial fiatat the behest of private organizations speaking only for themselvesa punishment about which no across-the-board consensus has developed through the workings of normal democratic processes in the laboratories of the States.

				Even if I were to accept the legitimacy of the Courts decision to reach beyond the product of legislatures and practices of sentencing juries to discern a national standard of decency, I would take issue with the blind-faith credence it accords the opinion polls brought to our attention.  An extensive body of social science literature describes how methodological and other errors can affect the reliability and validity of estimates about the opinions and attitudes of a population derived from various sampling techniques.  Everything from variations in the survey methodology, such as the choice of the target population, the sampling design used, the questions asked, and the statistical analyses used to interpret the data can skew the results.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 R. Groves, Survey Errors and Survey Costs (1989); 1 C. Turner &amp; E. Martin, Surveying Subjective Phenomena (1984).

				The Federal Judicial Centers Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence 221271 (1994) and its Manual for Complex Litigation §21.493 pp. 101103 (3d ed. 1995), offer helpful suggestions to judges called upon to assess the weight and admissibility of survey evidence on a factual issue before a court.  Looking at the polling data (reproduced in the Appendix to this opinion) in light of these factors, one cannot help but observe how unlikely it is that the data could support a valid inference about the question presented by this case.  For example, the questions reported to have been asked in the various polls do not appear designed to gauge whether the respondents might find the death penalty an acceptable punishment for mentally retarded offenders in rare cases.  Most are categorical (
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 Do you think that persons convicted of murder who are mentally retarded should or should not receive the death penalty?), and, as such, would not elicit whether the respondent might agree or disagree that all mentally retarded people by definition can never act with the level of culpability associated with the death penalty, regardless of the severity of their impairment or the individual circumstances of their crime.  Second, none of the 27 polls cited disclose the targeted survey population or the sampling techniques used by those who conducted the research.  Thus, even if one accepts that the survey instruments were adequately designed to address a relevant question, it is impossible to know whether the sample was representative enough or the methodology sufficiently sound to tell us anything about the opinions of the citizens of a particular State or the American public at large.  Finally, the information provided to us does not indicate why a particular survey was conducted or, in a few cases, by whom, factors which also can bear on the objectivity of the results.  In order to be credited here, such surveys should be offered as evidence at trial, where their sponsors can be examined and cross-examined about these matters.

				There are strong reasons for limiting our inquiry into what constitutes an evolving standard of decency under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentviii" class="subref" title="subref">Eighth Amendment</a> to the laws passed by legislatures and the practices of sentencing juries in America.  Here, the Court goes beyond these well-established objective indicators of contemporary values.  It finds further support to [its] conclusion that a national consensus has developed against imposing the death penalty on all mentally retarded defendants in international opinion, the views of professional and religious organizations, and opinion polls not demonstrated to be reliable.

				The question presented by this case is whether a national consensus deprives Virginia of the constitutional power to impose the death penalty on capital murder defendants like petitioner, 
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, those defendants who indisputably are competent to stand trial, aware of the punishment they are about to suffer and why, and whose mental retardation has been found an insufficiently compelling reason to lessen their individual responsibility for the crime.  The Court pronounces the punishment cruel and unusual primarily because 18 States recently have passed laws limiting the death eligibility of certain defendants based on mental retardation alone, despite the fact that the laws of 19 other States besides Virginia continue to leave the question of proper punishment to the individuated consideration of sentencing judges or juries familiar with the particular offender and his or her crime.

				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Scalia
				</span>
				, 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, at 1 (dissenting opinion), that the Courts assessment of the current legislative judgment regarding the execution of defendants like petitioner more resembles a 
				<em>
					post hoc
				</em>
				 rationalization for the majoritys subjectively preferred result rather than any objective effort to ascertain the content of an evolving standard of decency.  I write separately, however, to call attention to the defects in the Courts decision to place weight on foreign laws, the views of professional and religious organizations, and opinion polls in reaching its conclusion.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1112, n. 21.  The Courts suggestion that these sources are relevant to the constitutional question finds little support in our precedents and, in my view, is antithetical to considerations of federalism, which instruct that any permanent prohibition upon all units of democratic government must [be apparent] in the operative acts (laws and the application of laws) that the people have approved.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In my view, these two sourcesthe work product of legislatures and sentencing jury determinationsought to be the sole indicators by which courts ascertain the contemporary American conceptions of decency for purposes of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentviii" class="subref" title="subref">Eighth Amendment</a>.  They are the only objective indicia of contemporary values firmly supported by our precedents.  More importantly, however, they can be reconciled with the undeniable precepts that the democratic branches of government and individual sentencing juries are, by design, better suited than courts to evaluating and giving effect to the complex societal and moral considerations that inform the selection of publicly acceptable criminal punishments.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In reaching its conclusion today, the Court does not take notice of the fact that neither petitioner nor his

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				To further buttress its appraisal of contemporary societal values, the Court marshals public opinion poll results and evidence that several professional organizations and religious groups have adopted official positions opposing the imposition of the death penalty upon mentally retarded offenders.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1112, n. 21 (citing Brief for American Psychological Association et al. as 
				<em>
					Amici Curiae
				</em>
				; Brief for American Association on Mental Retardation et al. as 
				<em>
					Amici Curiae
				</em>
				; noting that representatives of widely diverse religious communities . . . reflecting Christian, Jewish, Muslim, and Buddhist traditions … share a conviction that the execution of persons with mental retardation cannot be morally justified ; and stating that polling data shows a widespread consensus among Americans … that executing the mentally retarded is wrong).  In my view, none should be accorded any weight on the Eight Amendment scale when the elected representatives of a States populace have not deemed them persuasive enough to prompt legislative action.  In 
				<em>
					Penry
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				492 U. S., at 334335, we were cited similar data and declined to take them into consideration where the public sentiment expressed in [them] had yet to find expression in state law.  See also 
				<em>
					Stanford
				</em>
				, 492 U. S., at 377 (plurality opinion) (refusing the invitation to rest constitutional law upon such uncertain foundations as public opinion polls, the views of interest groups, and the positions adopted by various professional organizations).  For the Court to rely on such data today serves only to illustrate its willingness to proscribe by judicial fiatat the behest of private organizations speaking only for themselvesa punishment about which no across-the-board consensus has developed through the workings of normal democratic processes in the laboratories of the States.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Even if I were to accept the legitimacy of the Courts decision to reach beyond the product of legislatures and practices of sentencing juries to discern a national standard of decency, I would take issue with the blind-faith credence it accords the opinion polls brought to our attention.  An extensive body of social science literature describes how methodological and other errors can affect the reliability and validity of estimates about the opinions and attitudes of a population derived from various sampling techniques.  Everything from variations in the survey methodology, such as the choice of the target population, the sampling design used, the questions asked, and the statistical analyses used to interpret the data can skew the results.

				The Federal Judicial Centers Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence 221271 (1994) and its Manual for Complex Litigation §21.493 pp. 101103 (3d ed. 1995), offer helpful suggestions to judges called upon to assess the weight and admissibility of survey evidence on a factual issue before a court.  Looking at the polling data (reproduced in the Appendix to this opinion) in light of these factors, one cannot help but observe how unlikely it is that the data could support a valid inference about the question presented by this case.  For example, the questions reported to have been asked in the various polls do not appear designed to gauge whether the respondents might find the death penalty an acceptable punishment for mentally retarded offenders in rare cases.  Most are categorical (
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 Do you think that persons convicted of murder who are mentally retarded should or should not receive the death penalty?), and, as such, would not elicit whether the respondent might agree or disagree that all mentally retarded people by definition can never act with the level of culpability associated with the death penalty, regardless of the severity of their impairment or the individual circumstances of their crime.  Second, none of the 27 polls cited disclose the targeted survey population or the sampling techniques used by those who conducted the research.  Thus, even if one accepts that the survey instruments were adequately designed to address a relevant question, it is impossible to know whether the sample was representative enough or the methodology sufficiently sound to tell us anything about the opinions of the citizens of a particular State or the American public at large.  Finally, the information provided to us does not indicate why a particular survey was conducted or, in a few cases, by whom, factors which also can bear on the objectivity of the results.  In order to be credited here, such surveys should be offered as evidence at trial, where their sponsors can be examined and cross-examined about these matters.

				There are strong reasons for limiting our inquiry into what constitutes an evolving standard of decency under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentviii" class="subref" title="subref">Eighth Amendment</a> to the laws passed by legislatures and the practices of sentencing juries in America.  Here, the Court goes beyond these well-established objective indicators of contemporary values.  It finds further support to [its] conclusion that a national consensus has developed against imposing the death penalty on all mentally retarded defendants in international opinion, the views of professional and religious organizations, and opinion polls not demonstrated to be reliable.

				The question presented by this case is whether a national consensus deprives Virginia of the constitutional power to impose the death penalty on capital murder defendants like petitioner, 
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, those defendants who indisputably are competent to stand trial, aware of the punishment they are about to suffer and why, and whose mental retardation has been found an insufficiently compelling reason to lessen their individual responsibility for the crime.  The Court pronounces the punishment cruel and unusual primarily because 18 States recently have passed laws limiting the death eligibility of certain defendants based on mental retardation alone, despite the fact that the laws of 19 other States besides Virginia continue to leave the question of proper punishment to the individuated consideration of sentencing judges or juries familiar with the particular offender and his or her crime.

I write separately, however, to call attention to the defects in the Courts decision to place weight on foreign laws, the views of professional and religious organizations, and opinion polls in reaching its conclusion.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1112, n. 21.  The Courts suggestion that these sources are relevant to the constitutional question finds little support in our precedents and, in my view, is antithetical to considerations of federalism, which instruct that any permanent prohibition upon all units of democratic government must [be apparent] in the operative acts (laws and the application of laws) that the people have approved.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In my view, these two sourcesthe work product of legislatures and sentencing jury determinationsought to be the sole indicators by which courts ascertain the contemporary American conceptions of decency for purposes of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentviii" class="subref" title="subref">Eighth Amendment</a>.  They are the only objective indicia of contemporary values firmly supported by our precedents.  More importantly, however, they can be reconciled with the undeniable precepts that the democratic branches of government and individual sentencing juries are, by design, better suited than courts to evaluating and giving effect to the complex societal and moral considerations that inform the selection of publicly acceptable criminal punishments.

				In reaching its conclusion today, the Court does not take notice of the fact that neither petitioner nor his

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				To further buttress its appraisal of contemporary societal values, the Court marshals public opinion poll results and evidence that several professional organizations and religious groups have adopted official positions opposing the imposition of the death penalty upon mentally retarded offenders.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1112, n. 21 (citing Brief for American Psychological Association et al. as 
				<em>
					Amici Curiae
				</em>
				; Brief for American Association on Mental Retardation et al. as 
				<em>
					Amici Curiae
				</em>
				; noting that representatives of widely diverse religious communities . . . reflecting Christian, Jewish, Muslim, and Buddhist traditions … share a conviction that the execution of persons with mental retardation cannot be morally justified ; and stating that polling data shows a widespread consensus among Americans … that executing the mentally retarded is wrong).  In my view, none should be accorded any weight on the Eight Amendment scale when the elected representatives of a States populace have not deemed them persuasive enough to prompt legislative action.  In 
				<em>
					Penry
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				492 U. S., at 334335, we were cited similar data and declined to take them into consideration where the public sentiment expressed in [them] had yet to find expression in state law.  See also 
				<em>
					Stanford
				</em>
				, 492 U. S., at 377 (plurality opinion) (refusing the invitation to rest constitutional law upon such uncertain foundations as public opinion polls, the views of interest groups, and the positions adopted by various professional organizations).  For the Court to rely on such data today serves only to illustrate its willingness to proscribe by judicial fiatat the behest of private organizations speaking only for themselvesa punishment about which no across-the-board consensus has developed through the workings of normal democratic processes in the laboratories of the States.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Even if I were to accept the legitimacy of the Courts decision to reach beyond the product of legislatures and practices of sentencing juries to discern a national standard of decency, I would take issue with the blind-faith credence it accords the opinion polls brought to our attention.  An extensive body of social science literature describes how methodological and other errors can affect the reliability and validity of estimates about the opinions and attitudes of a population derived from various sampling techniques.  Everything from variations in the survey methodology, such as the choice of the target population, the sampling design used, the questions asked, and the statistical analyses used to interpret the data can skew the results.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 R. Groves, Survey Errors and Survey Costs (1989); 1 C. Turner &amp; E. Martin, Surveying Subjective Phenomena (1984).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Federal Judicial Centers Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence 221271 (1994) and its Manual for Complex Litigation §21.493 pp. 101103 (3d ed. 1995), offer helpful suggestions to judges called upon to assess the weight and admissibility of survey evidence on a factual issue before a court.  Looking at the polling data (reproduced in the Appendix to this opinion) in light of these factors, one cannot help but observe how unlikely it is that the data could support a valid inference about the question presented by this case.  For example, the questions reported to have been asked in the various polls do not appear designed to gauge whether the respondents might find the death penalty an acceptable punishment for mentally retarded offenders in rare cases.  Most are categorical (
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 Do you think that persons convicted of murder who are mentally retarded should or should not receive the death penalty?), and, as such, would not elicit whether the respondent might agree or disagree that all mentally retarded people by definition can never act with the level of culpability associated with the death penalty, regardless of the severity of their impairment or the individual circumstances of their crime.  Second, none of the 27 polls cited disclose the targeted survey population or the sampling techniques used by those who conducted the research.  Thus, even if one accepts that the survey instruments were adequately designed to address a relevant question, it is impossible to know whether the sample was representative enough or the methodology sufficiently sound to tell us anything about the opinions of the citizens of a particular State or the American public at large.  Finally, the information provided to us does not indicate why a particular survey was conducted or, in a few cases, by whom, factors which also can bear on the objectivity of the results.  In order to be credited here, such surveys should be offered as evidence at trial, where their sponsors can be examined and cross-examined about these matters.

				The question presented by this case is whether a national consensus deprives Virginia of the constitutional power to impose the death penalty on capital murder defendants like petitioner, 
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, those defendants who indisputably are competent to stand trial, aware of the punishment they are about to suffer and why, and whose mental retardation has been found an insufficiently compelling reason to lessen their individual responsibility for the crime.  The Court pronounces the punishment cruel and unusual primarily because 18 States recently have passed laws limiting the death eligibility of certain defendants based on mental retardation alone, despite the fact that the laws of 19 other States besides Virginia continue to leave the question of proper punishment to the individuated consideration of sentencing judges or juries familiar with the particular offender and his or her crime.

I write separately, however, to call attention to the defects in the Courts decision to place weight on foreign laws, the views of professional and religious organizations, and opinion polls in reaching its conclusion.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1112, n. 21.  The Courts suggestion that these sources are relevant to the constitutional question finds little support in our precedents and, in my view, is antithetical to considerations of federalism, which instruct that any permanent prohibition upon all units of democratic government must [be apparent] in the operative acts (laws and the application of laws) that the people have approved.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In my view, these two sourcesthe work product of legislatures and sentencing jury determinationsought to be the sole indicators by which courts ascertain the contemporary American conceptions of decency for purposes of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentviii" class="subref" title="subref">Eighth Amendment</a>.  They are the only objective indicia of contemporary values firmly supported by our precedents.  More importantly, however, they can be reconciled with the undeniable precepts that the democratic branches of government and individual sentencing juries are, by design, better suited than courts to evaluating and giving effect to the complex societal and moral considerations that inform the selection of publicly acceptable criminal punishments.

				In reaching its conclusion today, the Court does not take notice of the fact that neither petitioner nor his

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				To further buttress its appraisal of contemporary societal values, the Court marshals public opinion poll results and evidence that several professional organizations and religious groups have adopted official positions opposing the imposition of the death penalty upon mentally retarded offenders.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1112, n. 21 (citing Brief for American Psychological Association et al. as 
				<em>
					Amici Curiae
				</em>
				; Brief for American Association on Mental Retardation et al. as 
				<em>
					Amici Curiae
				</em>
				; noting that representatives of widely diverse religious communities . . . reflecting Christian, Jewish, Muslim, and Buddhist traditions … share a conviction that the execution of persons with mental retardation cannot be morally justified ; and stating that polling data shows a widespread consensus among Americans … that executing the mentally retarded is wrong).  In my view, none should be accorded any weight on the Eight Amendment scale when the elected representatives of a States populace have not deemed them persuasive enough to prompt legislative action.  In 
				<em>
					Penry
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				492 U. S., at 334335, we were cited similar data and declined to take them into consideration where the public sentiment expressed in [them] had yet to find expression in state law.  See also 
				<em>
					Stanford
				</em>
				, 492 U. S., at 377 (plurality opinion) (refusing the invitation to rest constitutional law upon such uncertain foundations as public opinion polls, the views of interest groups, and the positions adopted by various professional organizations).  For the Court to rely on such data today serves only to illustrate its willingness to proscribe by judicial fiatat the behest of private organizations speaking only for themselvesa punishment about which no across-the-board consensus has developed through the workings of normal democratic processes in the laboratories of the States.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Even if I were to accept the legitimacy of the Courts decision to reach beyond the product of legislatures and practices of sentencing juries to discern a national standard of decency, I would take issue with the blind-faith credence it accords the opinion polls brought to our attention.  An extensive body of social science literature describes how methodological and other errors can affect the reliability and validity of estimates about the opinions and attitudes of a population derived from various sampling techniques.  Everything from variations in the survey methodology, such as the choice of the target population, the sampling design used, the questions asked, and the statistical analyses used to interpret the data can skew the results.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 R. Groves, Survey Errors and Survey Costs (1989); 1 C. Turner &amp; E. Martin, Surveying Subjective Phenomena (1984).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Federal Judicial Centers Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence 221271 (1994) and its Manual for Complex Litigation §21.493 pp. 101103 (3d ed. 1995), offer helpful suggestions to judges called upon to assess the weight and admissibility of survey evidence on a factual issue before a court.  Looking at the polling data (reproduced in the Appendix to this opinion) in light of these factors, one cannot help but observe how unlikely it is that the data could support a valid inference about the question presented by this case.  For example, the questions reported to have been asked in the various polls do not appear designed to gauge whether the respondents might find the death penalty an acceptable punishment for mentally retarded offenders in rare cases.  Most are categorical (
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 Do you think that persons convicted of murder who are mentally retarded should or should not receive the death penalty?), and, as such, would not elicit whether the respondent might agree or disagree that all mentally retarded people by definition can never act with the level of culpability associated with the death penalty, regardless of the severity of their impairment or the individual circumstances of their crime.  Second, none of the 27 polls cited disclose the targeted survey population or the sampling techniques used by those who conducted the research.  Thus, even if one accepts that the survey instruments were adequately designed to address a relevant question, it is impossible to know whether the sample was representative enough or the methodology sufficiently sound to tell us anything about the opinions of the citizens of a particular State or the American public at large.  Finally, the information provided to us does not indicate why a particular survey was conducted or, in a few cases, by whom, factors which also can bear on the objectivity of the results.  In order to be credited here, such surveys should be offered as evidence at trial, where their sponsors can be examined and cross-examined about these matters.

Furthermore, it is worth noting that experts have estimated that as many as 10 percent of death row inmates are mentally retarded, see R. Bonner &amp; S. Rimer, Executing the Mentally Retarded Even as Laws Begin to Shift, N. Y. Times, Aug. 7, 2000, p. A1, a number which suggests that sentencing juries are not as reluctant to impose the death penalty on defendants like petitioner as was the case in Coker v. Georgia,

				The question presented by this case is whether a national consensus deprives Virginia of the constitutional power to impose the death penalty on capital murder defendants like petitioner, 
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, those defendants who indisputably are competent to stand trial, aware of the punishment they are about to suffer and why, and whose mental retardation has been found an insufficiently compelling reason to lessen their individual responsibility for the crime.  The Court pronounces the punishment cruel and unusual primarily because 18 States recently have passed laws limiting the death eligibility of certain defendants based on mental retardation alone, despite the fact that the laws of 19 other States besides Virginia continue to leave the question of proper punishment to the individuated consideration of sentencing judges or juries familiar with the particular offender and his or her crime.

See 
				<em>

				</em>
				, at 1112, n. 21.  The Courts suggestion that these sources are relevant to the constitutional question finds little support in our precedents and, in my view, is antithetical to considerations of federalism, which instruct that any permanent prohibition upon all units of democratic government must [be apparent] in the operative acts (laws and the application of laws) that the people have approved.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In my view, these two sourcesthe work product of legislatures and sentencing jury determinationsought to be the sole indicators by which courts ascertain the contemporary American conceptions of decency for purposes of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentviii" class="subref" title="subref">Eighth Amendment</a>.  They are the only objective indicia of contemporary values firmly supported by our precedents.  More importantly, however, they can be reconciled with the undeniable precepts that the democratic branches of government and individual sentencing juries are, by design, better suited than courts to evaluating and giving effect to the complex societal and moral considerations that inform the selection of publicly acceptable criminal punishments.

				In reaching its conclusion today, the Court does not take notice of the fact that neither petitioner nor his

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				To further buttress its appraisal of contemporary societal values, the Court marshals public opinion poll results and evidence that several professional organizations and religious groups have adopted official positions opposing the imposition of the death penalty upon mentally retarded offenders.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1112, n. 21 (citing Brief for American Psychological Association et al. as 
				<em>
					Amici Curiae
				</em>
				; Brief for American Association on Mental Retardation et al. as 
				<em>
					Amici Curiae
				</em>
				; noting that representatives of widely diverse religious communities . . . reflecting Christian, Jewish, Muslim, and Buddhist traditions … share a conviction that the execution of persons with mental retardation cannot be morally justified ; and stating that polling data shows a widespread consensus among Americans … that executing the mentally retarded is wrong).  In my view, none should be accorded any weight on the Eight Amendment scale when the elected representatives of a States populace have not deemed them persuasive enough to prompt legislative action.  In 
				<em>
					Penry
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				492 U. S., at 334335, we were cited similar data and declined to take them into consideration where the public sentiment expressed in [them] had yet to find expression in state law.  See also 
				<em>
					Stanford
				</em>
				, 492 U. S., at 377 (plurality opinion) (refusing the invitation to rest constitutional law upon such uncertain foundations as public opinion polls, the views of interest groups, and the positions adopted by various professional organizations).  For the Court to rely on such data today serves only to illustrate its willingness to proscribe by judicial fiatat the behest of private organizations speaking only for themselvesa punishment about which no across-the-board consensus has developed through the workings of normal democratic processes in the laboratories of the States.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Even if I were to accept the legitimacy of the Courts decision to reach beyond the product of legislatures and practices of sentencing juries to discern a national standard of decency, I would take issue with the blind-faith credence it accords the opinion polls brought to our attention.  An extensive body of social science literature describes how methodological and other errors can affect the reliability and validity of estimates about the opinions and attitudes of a population derived from various sampling techniques.  Everything from variations in the survey methodology, such as the choice of the target population, the sampling design used, the questions asked, and the statistical analyses used to interpret the data can skew the results.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 R. Groves, Survey Errors and Survey Costs (1989); 1 C. Turner &amp; E. Martin, Surveying Subjective Phenomena (1984).

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Federal Judicial Centers Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence 221271 (1994) and its Manual for Complex Litigation §21.493 pp. 101103 (3d ed. 1995), offer helpful suggestions to judges called upon to assess the weight and admissibility of survey evidence on a factual issue before a court.  Looking at the polling data (reproduced in the Appendix to this opinion) in light of these factors, one cannot help but observe how unlikely it is that the data could support a valid inference about the question presented by this case.  For example, the questions reported to have been asked in the various polls do not appear designed to gauge whether the respondents might find the death penalty an acceptable punishment for mentally retarded offenders in rare cases.  Most are categorical (
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 Do you think that persons convicted of murder who are mentally retarded should or should not receive the death penalty?), and, as such, would not elicit whether the respondent might agree or disagree that all mentally retarded people by definition can never act with the level of culpability associated with the death penalty, regardless of the severity of their impairment or the individual circumstances of their crime.  Second, none of the 27 polls cited disclose the targeted survey population or the sampling techniques used by those who conducted the research.  Thus, even if one accepts that the survey instruments were adequately designed to address a relevant question, it is impossible to know whether the sample was representative enough or the methodology sufficiently sound to tell us anything about the opinions of the citizens of a particular State or the American public at large.  Finally, the information provided to us does not indicate why a particular survey was conducted or, in a few cases, by whom, factors which also can bear on the objectivity of the results.  In order to be credited here, such surveys should be offered as evidence at trial, where their sponsors can be examined and cross-examined about these matters.

				The question presented by this case is whether a national consensus deprives Virginia of the constitutional power to impose the death penalty on capital murder defendants like petitioner, 
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, those defendants who indisputably are competent to stand trial, aware of the punishment they are about to suffer and why, and whose mental retardation has been found an insufficiently compelling reason to lessen their individual responsibility for the crime.  The Court pronounces the punishment cruel and unusual primarily because 18 States recently have passed laws limiting the death eligibility of certain defendants based on mental retardation alone, despite the fact that the laws of 19 other States besides Virginia continue to leave the question of proper punishment to the individuated consideration of sentencing judges or juries familiar with the particular offender and his or her crime.

				In my view, these two sourcesthe work product of legislatures and sentencing jury determinationsought to be the sole indicators by which courts ascertain the contemporary American conceptions of decency for purposes of the

More importantly, however, they can be reconciled with the undeniable precepts that the democratic branches of government and individual sentencing juries are, by design, better suited than courts to evaluating and giving effect to the complex societal and moral considerations that inform the selection of publicly acceptable criminal punishments.

				In reaching its conclusion today, the Court does not take notice of the fact that neither petitioner nor his

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				To further buttress its appraisal of contemporary societal values, the Court marshals public opinion poll results and evidence that several professional organizations and religious groups have adopted official positions opposing the imposition of the death penalty upon mentally retarded offenders.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1112, n. 21 (citing Brief for American Psychological Association et al. as 
				<em>
					Amici Curiae
				</em>
				; Brief for American Association on Mental Retardation et al. as 
				<em>
					Amici Curiae
				</em>
				; noting that representatives of widely diverse religious communities . . . reflecting Christian, Jewish, Muslim, and Buddhist traditions … share a conviction that the execution of persons with mental retardation cannot be morally justified ; and stating that polling data shows a widespread consensus among Americans … that executing the mentally retarded is wrong).  In my view, none should be accorded any weight on the Eight Amendment scale when the elected representatives of a States populace have not deemed them persuasive enough to prompt legislative action.  In 
				<em>
					Penry
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				492 U. S., at 334335, we were cited similar data and declined to take them into consideration where the public sentiment expressed in [them] had yet to find expression in state law.  See also 
				<em>
					Stanford
				</em>
				, 492 U. S., at 377 (plurality opinion) (refusing the invitation to rest constitutional law upon such uncertain foundations as public opinion polls, the views of interest groups, and the positions adopted by various professional organizations).  For the Court to rely on such data today serves only to illustrate its willingness to proscribe by judicial fiatat the behest of private organizations speaking only for themselvesa punishment about which no across-the-board consensus has developed through the workings of normal democratic processes in the laboratories of the States.

				Even if I were to accept the legitimacy of the Courts decision to reach beyond the product of legislatures and practices of sentencing juries to discern a national standard of decency, I would take issue with the blind-faith credence it accords the opinion polls brought to our attention.  An extensive body of social science literature describes how methodological and other errors can affect the reliability and validity of estimates about the opinions and attitudes of a population derived from various sampling techniques.  Everything from variations in the survey methodology, such as the choice of the target population, the sampling design used, the questions asked, and the statistical analyses used to interpret the data can skew the results.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 R. Groves, Survey Errors and Survey Costs (1989); 1 C. Turner &amp; E. Martin, Surveying Subjective Phenomena (1984).

				The Federal Judicial Centers Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence 221271 (1994) and its Manual for Complex Litigation §21.493 pp. 101103 (3d ed. 1995), offer helpful suggestions to judges called upon to assess the weight and admissibility of survey evidence on a factual issue before a court.  Looking at the polling data (reproduced in the Appendix to this opinion) in light of these factors, one cannot help but observe how unlikely it is that the data could support a valid inference about the question presented by this case.  For example, the questions reported to have been asked in the various polls do not appear designed to gauge whether the respondents might find the death penalty an acceptable punishment for mentally retarded offenders in rare cases.  Most are categorical (
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 Do you think that persons convicted of murder who are mentally retarded should or should not receive the death penalty?), and, as such, would not elicit whether the respondent might agree or disagree that all mentally retarded people by definition can never act with the level of culpability associated with the death penalty, regardless of the severity of their impairment or the individual circumstances of their crime.  Second, none of the 27 polls cited disclose the targeted survey population or the sampling techniques used by those who conducted the research.  Thus, even if one accepts that the survey instruments were adequately designed to address a relevant question, it is impossible to know whether the sample was representative enough or the methodology sufficiently sound to tell us anything about the opinions of the citizens of a particular State or the American public at large.  Finally, the information provided to us does not indicate why a particular survey was conducted or, in a few cases, by whom, factors which also can bear on the objectivity of the results.  In order to be credited here, such surveys should be offered as evidence at trial, where their sponsors can be examined and cross-examined about these matters.

				The question presented by this case is whether a national consensus deprives Virginia of the constitutional power to impose the death penalty on capital murder defendants like petitioner, 
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, those defendants who indisputably are competent to stand trial, aware of the punishment they are about to suffer and why, and whose mental retardation has been found an insufficiently compelling reason to lessen their individual responsibility for the crime.  The Court pronounces the punishment cruel and unusual primarily because 18 States recently have passed laws limiting the death eligibility of certain defendants based on mental retardation alone, despite the fact that the laws of 19 other States besides Virginia continue to leave the question of proper punishment to the individuated consideration of sentencing judges or juries familiar with the particular offender and his or her crime.  See

				I agree with 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Scalia
				</span>
				, 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, at 1 (dissenting opinion), that the Courts assessment of the current legislative judgment regarding the execution of defendants like petitioner more resembles a 
				<em>
					post hoc
				</em>
				 rationalization for the majoritys subjectively preferred result rather than any objective effort to ascertain the content of an evolving standard of decency.  I write separately, however, to call attention to the defects in the Courts decision to place weight on foreign laws, the views of professional and religious organizations, and opinion polls in reaching its conclusion.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1112, n. 21.  The Courts suggestion that these sources are relevant to the constitutional question finds little support in our precedents and, in my view, is antithetical to considerations of federalism, which instruct that any permanent prohibition upon all units of democratic government must [be apparent] in the operative acts (laws and the application of laws) that the people have approved.

 (plurality opinion).  The Courts uncritical acceptance of the opinion poll data brought to our attention, moreover, warrants additional comment, because we lack sufficient information to conclude that the surveys were conducted in accordance with generally accepted scientific principles or are capable of supporting valid empirical inferences about the issue before us.

				In my view, these two sourcesthe work product of legislatures and sentencing jury determinationsought to be the sole indicators by which courts ascertain the contemporary American conceptions of decency for purposes of the

More importantly, however, they can be reconciled with the undeniable precepts that the democratic branches of government and individual sentencing juries are, by design, better suited than courts to evaluating and giving effect to the complex societal and moral considerations that inform the selection of publicly acceptable criminal punishments.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				To further buttress its appraisal of contemporary societal values, the Court marshals public opinion poll results and evidence that several professional organizations and religious groups have adopted official positions opposing the imposition of the death penalty upon mentally retarded offenders.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1112, n. 21 (citing Brief for American Psychological Association et al. as 
				<em>
					Amici Curiae
				</em>
				; Brief for American Association on Mental Retardation et al. as 
				<em>
					Amici Curiae
				</em>
				; noting that representatives of widely diverse religious communities . . . reflecting Christian, Jewish, Muslim, and Buddhist traditions … share a conviction that the execution of persons with mental retardation cannot be morally justified ; and stating that polling data shows a widespread consensus among Americans … that executing the mentally retarded is wrong).  In my view, none should be accorded any weight on the Eight Amendment scale when the elected representatives of a States populace have not deemed them persuasive enough to prompt legislative action.  In 
				<em>
					Penry
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				492 U. S., at 334335, we were cited similar data and declined to take them into consideration where the public sentiment expressed in [them] had yet to find expression in state law.  See also 
				<em>
					Stanford
				</em>
				, 492 U. S., at 377 (plurality opinion) (refusing the invitation to rest constitutional law upon such uncertain foundations as public opinion polls, the views of interest groups, and the positions adopted by various professional organizations).  For the Court to rely on such data today serves only to illustrate its willingness to proscribe by judicial fiatat the behest of private organizations speaking only for themselvesa punishment about which no across-the-board consensus has developed through the workings of normal democratic processes in the laboratories of the States.

				Even if I were to accept the legitimacy of the Courts decision to reach beyond the product of legislatures and practices of sentencing juries to discern a national standard of decency, I would take issue with the blind-faith credence it accords the opinion polls brought to our attention.  An extensive body of social science literature describes how methodological and other errors can affect the reliability and validity of estimates about the opinions and attitudes of a population derived from various sampling techniques.  Everything from variations in the survey methodology, such as the choice of the target population, the sampling design used, the questions asked, and the statistical analyses used to interpret the data can skew the results.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 R. Groves, Survey Errors and Survey Costs (1989); 1 C. Turner &amp; E. Martin, Surveying Subjective Phenomena (1984).

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Federal Judicial Centers Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence 221271 (1994) and its Manual for Complex Litigation §21.493 pp. 101103 (3d ed. 1995), offer helpful suggestions to judges called upon to assess the weight and admissibility of survey evidence on a factual issue before a court.  Looking at the polling data (reproduced in the Appendix to this opinion) in light of these factors, one cannot help but observe how unlikely it is that the data could support a valid inference about the question presented by this case.  For example, the questions reported to have been asked in the various polls do not appear designed to gauge whether the respondents might find the death penalty an acceptable punishment for mentally retarded offenders in rare cases.  Most are categorical (
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 Do you think that persons convicted of murder who are mentally retarded should or should not receive the death penalty?), and, as such, would not elicit whether the respondent might agree or disagree that all mentally retarded people by definition can never act with the level of culpability associated with the death penalty, regardless of the severity of their impairment or the individual circumstances of their crime.  Second, none of the 27 polls cited disclose the targeted survey population or the sampling techniques used by those who conducted the research.  Thus, even if one accepts that the survey instruments were adequately designed to address a relevant question, it is impossible to know whether the sample was representative enough or the methodology sufficiently sound to tell us anything about the opinions of the citizens of a particular State or the American public at large.  Finally, the information provided to us does not indicate why a particular survey was conducted or, in a few cases, by whom, factors which also can bear on the objectivity of the results.  In order to be credited here, such surveys should be offered as evidence at trial, where their sponsors can be examined and cross-examined about these matters.

				There are strong reasons for limiting our inquiry into what constitutes an evolving standard of decency under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentviii" class="subref" title="subref">Eighth Amendment</a> to the laws passed by legislatures and the practices of sentencing juries in America.  Here, the Court goes beyond these well-established objective indicators of contemporary values.

Furthermore, it is worth noting that experts have estimated that as many as 10 percent of death row inmates are mentally retarded, see R. Bonner &amp; S. Rimer, Executing the Mentally Retarded Even as Laws Begin to Shift, N. Y. Times, Aug. 7, 2000, p.

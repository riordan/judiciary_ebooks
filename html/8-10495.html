				An Indiana jury convicted Joseph Corcoran of four counts of murder.  Corcoran was sentenced to death.  After Corcorans challenges to his sentence in the Indiana courts failed, he sought federal habeas relief.  Corcoran argued in his federal habeas petition that: (1) the Indiana trial court committed various errors at the sentencing phase; (2) his sentence violated the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a>; (3) Indianas capital sentencing statute was unconstitutional; (4) the prosecution committed misconduct at sentencing; and (5) he should not be executed because he suffers from a mental illness.  See

					Corcoran
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Buss
				</em>
				, 483 F. Supp. 2d 709, 719, 726 (ND Ind. 2007).  The District Court granted habeas relief on Corcorans claim of a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> violation, and ordered the state courts to resentence Corcoran to a penalty other than death.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 725726.  The District Court did not address Corcorans other arguments relating to his sentence, noting that they were rendered moot by the order that Corcoran be resentenced because of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> violation.

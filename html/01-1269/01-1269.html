				I join the Courts opinion, including Part III, which concludes that respondents assertions of arbitrary government conduct must be rejected.  I write separately to observe that, 
				<em>
					even if
				</em>
				 there had been arbitrary government conduct, that would not have established the substantive-due-process violation that respondents claim.

				It would be absurd to think that all arbitrary and capricious government action violates substantive due processeven, for example, the arbitrary and capricious cancellation of a public employees parking privileges.  The judicially created substantive component of the Due Process Clause protects, we have said, certain fundamental liberty interests from deprivation by the government, unless the infringement is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.

.  Freedom from delay in receiving a building permit is not among these fundamental liberty interests.  To the contrary, the Takings Clause allows government 
				<em>

				</em>
				 of private property so long as it is taken for a public use and just compensation is paid; mere 
				<em>
					regulation
				</em>
				 of land use need not be narrowly tailored to effectuate a compelling state interest.  Those who claim arbitrary deprivations of nonfundamental liberty interests must look to the Equal Protection Clause, and

, precludes the use of  substantive due process  analysis when a more specific constitutional provision governs.

				As for respondents assertion that referendums may not be used to decide whether low-income housing may be built on their land: that is not a substantive-due-process claim, but rather a challenge to the 
				<em>
					procedures
				</em>
				 by which respondents were deprived of their alleged liberty interest in building on their land.  There is nothing procedurally defective about conditioning the right to build low-income housing on the outcome of a popular referendum, cf.

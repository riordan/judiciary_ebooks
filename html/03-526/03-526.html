				In April 1981, Finance America employee Brenna Bailey disappeared while on a house call to discuss an outstanding debt with respondent Warren Summerlins wife.  That evening, an anonymous woman (later identified as respondents mother-in-law) called the police and accused respondent of murdering Bailey.  Baileys partially nude body, her skull crushed, was found the next morning in the trunk of her car, wrapped in a bedspread from respondents home.  Police arrested respondent and later overheard him make incriminating remarks to his wife.

				Respondent was convicted of first-degree murder and sexual assault.  Arizonas capital sentencing provisions in effect at the time authorized the death penalty if one of several enumerated aggravating factors was present.  See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§13703(E), (F) (West 1978), as amended by Act of May 1, 1979 Ariz. Sess. Laws ch. 144.  Whether those aggravating factors existed, however, was determined by the trial judge rather than by a jury.  §13703(B).  In this case the judge, after a hearing, found two aggravating factors: a prior felony conviction involving use or threatened use of violence, §13703(F)(2), and commission of the offense in an especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner, §13703(F)(6).  Finding no mitigating factors, the judge imposed the death sentence.  The Arizona Supreme Court affirmed on direct review.

S., at 490.  In 
				<em>
					Ring
				</em>
				, we applied this principle to a death sentence imposed under the Arizona sentencing scheme at issue here.  We concluded that, because Arizona law authorized the death penalty only if an aggravating factor was present, 
				<em>
					Apprendi

				 required the existence of such a factor to be proved to a jury rather than to a judge.  536 U. S., at 603609.

				Judged by this standard, 
				<em>
					Ring
				</em>
				s holding is properly classified as procedural.  
				<em>
					Ring 
				</em>
				held that a sentencing judge, sitting without a jury, [may not] find an aggravating circumstance necessary for imposition of the death penalty.  536 U. S., at 609.  Rather, the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> requires that [those circumstances] be found by a jury.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  This holding did not alter the range of conduct Arizona law subjected to the death penalty.  It could not have; it rested entirely on the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a>s jury-trial guarantee, a provision that has nothing to do with the range of conduct a State may criminalize.  Instead, 
				<em>
					Ring
				</em>
				 altered the range of permissible methods for determining whether a defendants conduct is punishable by death, requiring that a jury rather than a judge find the essential facts bearing on punishment.  Rules that allocate decisionmaking authority in this fashion are prototypical procedural rules, a conclusion we have reached in numerous other contexts.  See

				A decision that modifies the elements of an offense is normally substantive rather than procedural.  New elements alter the range of conduct the statute punishes, rendering some formerly unlawful conduct lawful or vice versa.  See

				 making a certain fact essential to the death penalty.  The former was a procedural holding; the latter would be substantive.  The Ninth Circuits conclusion that

				First, for every argument why juries are more accurate factfinders, there is another why they are less accurate.  The Ninth Circuit dissent noted several, including juries tendency to become confused over legal standards and to be influenced by emotion or philosophical predisposition.

				<em>
					DeStefano
				</em>
				 was decided under our pre-
				<em>

				 retroactivity framework, its reasoning is germane.  We noted that, although the right to jury trial generally tends to prevent arbitrariness and repression[,] … [w]e would not assert … that every criminal trialor any particular trialheld before a judge alone is unfair or that a defendant may never be as fairly treated by a judge as he would be by a jury.   392 U.

				The dissent contends that juries are more accurate because they better reflect community standards in deciding whether, for example, a murder was heinous, cruel, or depraved.  
				<em>
					Post
				</em>
				, at 4 (opinion of 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Breyer, J.
				</span>

				<em>
					as determined by community standards
				</em>
				.  See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §13703(F)(6) (West 1978).  It is easy to find enhanced accuracy in jury determination when one redefines the statutes substantive scope in such manner as to ensure that result.  The dissent also advances several variations on the theme that death is different (or rather, dramatically different, 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, at 6).  Much of this analysis is not an application of 
				<em>
					Teague
				</em>
				, but a rejection of it, in favor of a broader endeavor to balance competing considerations, 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, at 4.  Even were we inclined to revisit 
				<em>
					Teague
				</em>
				 in this fashion, we would not agree with the dissents conclusions.  Finally, the dissent notes that, in 
				<em>
					DeStefano
				</em>
				, we considered factors other than enhanced accuracy that are no longer relevant after 
				<em>
					Teague.
				</em>
				  See 
				<em>

						 The dissent distinguishes DeStefano on the ground that this case involves only a small subclass of defendants deprived of jury trial rights, the relevant harm within that subclass is more widespread, the administration of justice problem is far less serious, and the reliance interest less weighty.  Post, at 8.  But the first, third, and fourth of these points are irrelevant under Teague, and the second, insofar as it relates to accuracy, is an unsubstantiated assertion.  If jury trial significantly enhances accuracy, we would not have been able to hold as we did in DeStefano that the first factorprevent[ing] arbitrariness and repression, 392 U.

				In April 1981, Finance America employee Brenna Bailey disappeared while on a house call to discuss an outstanding debt with respondent Warren Summerlins wife.  That evening, an anonymous woman (later identified as respondents mother-in-law) called the police and accused respondent of murdering Bailey.  Baileys partially nude body, her skull crushed, was found the next morning in the trunk of her car, wrapped in a bedspread from respondents home.  Police arrested respondent and later overheard him make incriminating remarks to his wife.

				Respondent was convicted of first-degree murder and sexual assault.  Arizonas capital sentencing provisions in effect at the time authorized the death penalty if one of several enumerated aggravating factors was present.  See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§13703(E), (F) (West 1978), as amended by Act of May 1, 1979 Ariz. Sess. Laws ch. 144.  Whether those aggravating factors existed, however, was determined by the trial judge rather than by a jury.  §13703(B).  In this case the judge, after a hearing, found two aggravating factors: a prior felony conviction involving use or threatened use of violence, §13703(F)(2), and commission of the offense in an especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner, §13703(F)(6).  Finding no mitigating factors, the judge imposed the death sentence.  The Arizona Supreme Court affirmed on direct review.

				Judged by this standard,

					Ring

				s holding is properly classified as procedural.  
				<em>
					Ring

				held that a sentencing judge, sitting without a jury, [may not] find an aggravating circumstance necessary for imposition of the death penalty.  536 U. S., at 609.  Rather, the

				 altered the range of permissible methods for determining whether a defendants conduct is punishable by death, requiring that a jury rather than a judge find the essential facts bearing on punishment.

				A decision that modifies the elements of an offense is normally substantive rather than procedural.  New elements alter the range of conduct the statute punishes, rendering some formerly unlawful conduct lawful or vice versa.  See 
				<em>
					Bousley
				</em>
				, 523 U. S., at 620621.  But that is not what 
				<em>
					Ring 
				</em>
				did; the range of conduct punished by death in Arizona was the same before 
				<em>
					Ring 
				</em>
				as after.  
				<em>
					Ring
				</em>
				 held that, 
				<em>
					because 
				</em>
				Arizonas statutory aggravators restricted (as a matter of state law) the class of death-eligible defendants, those aggravators 
				<em>
					effectively were 
				</em>
				elements for federal constitutional purposes, and so were subject to the procedural requirements the Constitution attaches to trial of elements.  536 U. S., at 609.  This Courts holding that, 
				<em>
					because Arizona
				</em>
				 has made a certain fact essential to the death penalty, that fact must be found by a jury, is not the same as 
				<em>
					this Courts
				</em>
				 making a certain fact essential to the death penalty.  The former was a procedural holding; the latter would be substantive.  The Ninth Circuits conclusion that 
				<em>
					Ring

				<em>

				</em>
				 was decided under our pre-
				<em>
					Teague

				 retroactivity framework, its reasoning is germane.  We noted that, although the right to jury trial generally tends to prevent arbitrariness and repression[,] … [w]e would not assert … that every criminal trialor any particular trialheld before a judge alone is unfair or that a defendant may never be as fairly treated by a judge as he would be by a jury.   392 U.

				The dissent contends that juries are more accurate because they better reflect community standards in deciding whether, for example, a murder was heinous, cruel, or depraved.  
				<em>
					Post

				, at 4 (opinion of 
				<span class="smallcaps">

				<em>
					as determined by community standards
				</em>
				.  See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §13703(F)(6) (West 1978).  It is easy to find enhanced accuracy in jury determination when one redefines the statutes substantive scope in such manner as to ensure that result.  The dissent also advances several variations on the theme that death is different (or rather, dramatically different, 
				<em>
					post

				<em>
					Teague

				<em>
					post

				<em>
					Teague
				</em>
				 in this fashion, we would not agree with the dissents conclusions.  Finally, the dissent notes that, in

				, we considered factors other than enhanced accuracy that are no longer relevant after

						 The dissent distinguishes DeStefano on the ground that this case involves only a small subclass of defendants deprived of jury trial rights, the relevant harm within that subclass is more widespread, the administration of justice problem is far less serious, and the reliance interest less weighty.  Post, at 8.  But the first, third, and fourth of these points are irrelevant under Teague, and the second, insofar as it relates to accuracy, is an unsubstantiated assertion.  If jury trial significantly enhances accuracy, we would not have been able to hold as we did in DeStefano that the first factorprevent[ing] arbitrariness and repression, 392 U. S., at 633did not favor retroactivity.

				In April 1981, Finance America employee Brenna Bailey disappeared while on a house call to discuss an outstanding debt with respondent Warren Summerlins wife.  That evening, an anonymous woman (later identified as respondents mother-in-law) called the police and accused respondent of murdering Bailey.  Baileys partially nude body, her skull crushed, was found the next morning in the trunk of her car, wrapped in a bedspread from respondents home.  Police arrested respondent and later overheard him make incriminating remarks to his wife.

				Respondent was convicted of first-degree murder and sexual assault.  Arizonas capital sentencing provisions in effect at the time authorized the death penalty if one of several enumerated aggravating factors was present.  See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§13703(E), (F) (West 1978), as amended by Act of May 1, 1979 Ariz. Sess. Laws ch. 144.  Whether those aggravating factors existed, however, was determined by the trial judge rather than by a jury.  §13703(B).  In this case the judge, after a hearing, found two aggravating factors: a prior felony conviction involving use or threatened use of violence, §13703(F)(2), and commission of the offense in an especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner, §13703(F)(6).  Finding no mitigating factors, the judge imposed the death sentence.  The Arizona Supreme Court affirmed on direct review.

				New rules of procedure, on the other hand, generally do not apply retroactively.

				A rule is substantive rather than procedural if it alters the range of conduct or the class of persons that the law punishes.  See 
				<em>
					Bousley

				Judged by this standard, 
				<em>
					Ring
				</em>
				s holding is properly classified as procedural.  
				<em>
					Ring 
				</em>
				held that a sentencing judge, sitting without a jury, [may not] find an aggravating circumstance necessary for imposition of the death penalty.  536 U. S., at 609.  Rather, the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> requires that [those circumstances] be found by a jury.  
				<em>
					Ibid.

				  This holding did not alter the range of conduct Arizona law subjected to the death penalty.  It could not have; it rested entirely on the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a>s jury-trial guarantee, a provision that has nothing to do with the range of conduct a State may criminalize.  Instead, 
				<em>
					Ring
				</em>
				 altered the range of permissible methods for determining whether a defendants conduct is punishable by death, requiring that a jury rather than a judge find the essential facts bearing on punishment.  Rules that allocate decisionmaking authority in this fashion are prototypical procedural rules, a conclusion we have reached in numerous other contexts.  See

				Respondent nevertheless argues that

				that, [b]ecause Arizonas enumerated aggravating factors operate as the functional equivalent of an element of a greater offense, the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> requires that they be found by a jury.   536 U. S., at 609 (citation omitted); see also

				<em>

				</em>
				reposition[ed] Arizonas aggravating factors as elements of the separate offense of capital murder and reshap[ed] the structure of Arizona murder law.  341 F. 3d, at 1105.  
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				A decision that modifies the elements of an offense is normally substantive rather than procedural.  New elements alter the range of conduct the statute punishes, rendering some formerly unlawful conduct lawful or vice versa.  See 
				<em>
					Bousley
				</em>
				, 523 U. S., at 620621.  But that is not what 
				<em>
					Ring 
				</em>
				did; the range of conduct punished by death in Arizona was the same before 
				<em>
					Ring 
				</em>
				as after.  
				<em>
					Ring
				</em>
				 held that, 
				<em>
					because 
				</em>
				Arizonas statutory aggravators restricted (as a matter of state law) the class of death-eligible defendants, those aggravators 
				<em>
					effectively were 
				</em>
				elements for federal constitutional purposes, and so were subject to the procedural requirements the Constitution attaches to trial of elements.  536 U. S., at 609.  This Courts holding that, 
				<em>
					because Arizona
				</em>
				 has made a certain fact essential to the death penalty, that fact must be found by a jury, is not the same as 
				<em>
					this Courts
				</em>
				 making a certain fact essential to the death penalty.  The former was a procedural holding; the latter would be substantive.  The Ninth Circuits conclusion that 
				<em>
					Ring
				</em>
				 nonetheless reshap[ed] the structure of Arizona murder law, 341 F. 3d, at 1105, is particularly remarkable in the face of the Arizona Supreme Courts previous conclusion to the contrary.  See

He offers several reasons why juries are more accurate factfinders, including the tendency of group deliberation to suppress individual eccentricities; the jurys protection from exposure to inadmissible evidence; and its better representation of the common sense of the community.  The Ninth Circuit majority added others, including the claim that a judge might be too acclimated to capital sentencing and that he might be swayed by political pressure.  341 F. 3d, at 11091116.  Respondent further notes that common-law authorities praised the jurys factfinding ability.  See,

				<em>
					are 
				</em>
				more accurate factfinders than judges (again, perhaps so).  Rather, the question is whether judicial factfinding so 
				<em>
					seriously 
				</em>
				diminishe[s] accuracy that there is an  impermissibly large risk  of punishing conduct the law does not reach.

				First, for every argument why juries are more accurate factfinders, there is another why they are less accurate.  The Ninth Circuit dissent noted several, including juries tendency to become confused over legal standards and to be influenced by emotion or philosophical predisposition. 
				<em>

, which applied the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a>s jury-trial guarantee to the States.  While 
				<em>
					DeStefano
				</em>
				 was decided under our pre-
				<em>
					Teague
				</em>
				 retroactivity framework, its reasoning is germane.  We noted that, although the right to jury trial generally tends to prevent arbitrariness and repression[,] … [w]e would not assert … that every criminal trialor any particular trialheld before a judge alone is unfair or that a defendant may never be as fairly treated by a judge as he would be by a jury.   392 U. S., at 633634 (quoting 
				<em>
					Duncan
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 158).  We concluded that [t]he values implemented by the right to jury trial would not measurably be served by requiring retrial of all persons convicted in the past by procedures not consistent with the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> right to jury trial.  392 U. S., at 634.  If under 
				<em>
					DeStefano
				</em>
				 a trial held entirely without a jury was not impermissibly inaccurate, it is hard to see how a trial in which a judge finds only aggravating factors could be.

				The dissent contends that juries are more accurate because they better reflect community standards in deciding whether, for example, a murder was heinous, cruel, or depraved.  
				<em>
					Post
				</em>
				, at 4 (opinion of 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Breyer, J.
				</span>
				).  But the statute here does not condition death eligibility on whether the offense is heinous, cruel, or depraved 
				<em>
					as determined by community standards
				</em>
				.  See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §13703(F)(6) (West 1978).  It is easy to find enhanced accuracy in jury determination when one redefines the statutes substantive scope in such manner as to ensure that result.  The dissent also advances several variations on the theme that death is different (or rather, dramatically different, 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, at 6).  Much of this analysis is not an application of 
				<em>
					Teague
				</em>
				, but a rejection of it, in favor of a broader endeavor to balance competing considerations, 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, at 4.  Even were we inclined to revisit 
				<em>
					Teague
				</em>
				 in this fashion, we would not agree with the dissents conclusions.  Finally, the dissent notes that, in 
				<em>
					DeStefano
				</em>
				, we considered factors other than enhanced accuracy that are no longer relevant after 
				<em>
					Teague.
				</em>
				  See 
				<em>

				, at 8.  But we held in that case that 
				<em>
					[a]ll three
				</em>
				 factors favor only prospective application of the rule.  392 U. S., at 633 (emphasis added).  Thus, the result would have been the same even if enhanced accuracy were the sole criterion for retroactivity.

						 The dissent distinguishes DeStefano on the ground that this case involves only a small subclass of defendants deprived of jury trial rights, the relevant harm within that subclass is more widespread, the administration of justice problem is far less serious, and the reliance interest less weighty.  Post, at 8.  But the first, third, and fourth of these points are irrelevant under Teague, and the second, insofar as it relates to accuracy, is an unsubstantiated assertion.  If jury trial significantly enhances accuracy, we would not have been able to hold as we did in DeStefano that the first factorprevent[ing] arbitrariness and repression, 392 U. S., at 633did not favor retroactivity.

				In April 1981, Finance America employee Brenna Bailey disappeared while on a house call to discuss an outstanding debt with respondent Warren Summerlins wife.  That evening, an anonymous woman (later identified as respondents mother-in-law) called the police and accused respondent of murdering Bailey.  Baileys partially nude body, her skull crushed, was found the next morning in the trunk of her car, wrapped in a bedspread from respondents home.  Police arrested respondent and later overheard him make incriminating remarks to his wife.

				Respondent was convicted of first-degree murder and sexual assault.  Arizonas capital sentencing provisions in effect at the time authorized the death penalty if one of several enumerated aggravating factors was present.  See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§13703(E), (F) (West 1978), as amended by Act of May 1, 1979 Ariz. Sess. Laws ch. 144.  Whether those aggravating factors existed, however, was determined by the trial judge rather than by a jury.  §13703(B).  In this case the judge, after a hearing, found two aggravating factors: a prior felony conviction involving use or threatened use of violence, §13703(F)(2), and commission of the offense in an especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner, §13703(F)(6).  Finding no mitigating factors, the judge imposed the death sentence.  The Arizona Supreme Court affirmed on direct review.

				A decision that modifies the elements of an offense is normally substantive rather than procedural.  New elements alter the range of conduct the statute punishes, rendering some formerly unlawful conduct lawful or vice versa.  See 
				<em>
					Bousley
				</em>
				, 523 U. S., at 620621.  But that is not what 
				<em>
					Ring 
				</em>
				did; the range of conduct punished by death in Arizona was the same before 
				<em>

				as after.  
				<em>
					Ring

				 held that, 
				<em>
					because 
				</em>
				Arizonas statutory aggravators restricted (as a matter of state law) the class of death-eligible defendants, those aggravators 
				<em>
					effectively were 
				</em>
				elements for federal constitutional purposes, and so were subject to the procedural requirements the Constitution attaches to trial of elements.  536 U. S., at 609.  This Courts holding that, 
				<em>
					because Arizona
				</em>
				 has made a certain fact essential to the death penalty, that fact must be found by a jury, is not the same as 
				<em>

				 making a certain fact essential to the death penalty.  The former was a procedural holding; the latter would be substantive.  The Ninth Circuits conclusion that

				First, for every argument why juries are more accurate factfinders, there is another why they are less accurate.  The Ninth Circuit dissent noted several, including juries tendency to become confused over legal standards and to be influenced by emotion or philosophical predisposition.

				<em>

				</em>
				 was decided under our pre-
				<em>

				 retroactivity framework, its reasoning is germane.  We noted that, although the right to jury trial generally tends to prevent arbitrariness and repression[,] … [w]e would not assert … that every criminal trialor any particular trialheld before a judge alone is unfair or that a defendant may never be as fairly treated by a judge as he would be by a jury.   392 U.

				The dissent contends that juries are more accurate because they better reflect community standards in deciding whether, for example, a murder was heinous, cruel, or depraved.  
				<em>
					Post
				</em>
				, at 4 (opinion of 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Breyer, J.
				</span>

				<em>
					as determined by community standards
				</em>
				.  See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §13703(F)(6) (West 1978).  It is easy to find enhanced accuracy in jury determination when one redefines the statutes substantive scope in such manner as to ensure that result.  The dissent also advances several variations on the theme that death is different (or rather, dramatically different, 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, at 6).  Much of this analysis is not an application of 
				<em>
					Teague
				</em>
				, but a rejection of it, in favor of a broader endeavor to balance competing considerations, 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, at 4.  Even were we inclined to revisit 
				<em>
					Teague
				</em>
				 in this fashion, we would not agree with the dissents conclusions.  Finally, the dissent notes that, in 
				<em>
					DeStefano
				</em>
				, we considered factors other than enhanced accuracy that are no longer relevant after 
				<em>
					Teague.
				</em>
				  See 
				<em>

						 The dissent distinguishes DeStefano on the ground that this case involves only a small subclass of defendants deprived of jury trial rights, the relevant harm within that subclass is more widespread, the administration of justice problem is far less serious, and the reliance interest less weighty.  Post, at 8.  But the first, third, and fourth of these points are irrelevant under Teague, and the second, insofar as it relates to accuracy, is an unsubstantiated assertion.  If jury trial significantly enhances accuracy, we would not have been able to hold as we did in DeStefano that the first factorprevent[ing] arbitrariness and repression, 392 U.

				In April 1981, Finance America employee Brenna Bailey disappeared while on a house call to discuss an outstanding debt with respondent Warren Summerlins wife.  That evening, an anonymous woman (later identified as respondents mother-in-law) called the police and accused respondent of murdering Bailey.  Baileys partially nude body, her skull crushed, was found the next morning in the trunk of her car, wrapped in a bedspread from respondents home.  Police arrested respondent and later overheard him make incriminating remarks to his wife.

				Respondent was convicted of first-degree murder and sexual assault.  Arizonas capital sentencing provisions in effect at the time authorized the death penalty if one of several enumerated aggravating factors was present.  See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§13703(E), (F) (West 1978), as amended by Act of May 1, 1979 Ariz. Sess. Laws ch. 144.  Whether those aggravating factors existed, however, was determined by the trial judge rather than by a jury.  §13703(B).  In this case the judge, after a hearing, found two aggravating factors: a prior felony conviction involving use or threatened use of violence, §13703(F)(2), and commission of the offense in an especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner, §13703(F)(6).  Finding no mitigating factors, the judge imposed the death sentence.  The Arizona Supreme Court affirmed on direct review.

				Judged by this standard, 
				<em>
					Ring
				</em>
				s holding is properly classified as procedural.  
				<em>
					Ring 
				</em>
				held that a sentencing judge, sitting without a jury, [may not] find an aggravating circumstance necessary for imposition of the death penalty.  536 U. S., at 609.  Rather, the

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a>s jury-trial guarantee, a provision that has nothing to do with the range of conduct a State may criminalize.  Instead, 
				<em>
					Ring

				 altered the range of permissible methods for determining whether a defendants conduct is punishable by death, requiring that a jury rather than a judge find the essential facts bearing on punishment.

				reposition[ed] Arizonas aggravating factors as elements of the separate offense of capital murder and reshap[ed] the structure of Arizona murder law.  341 F. 3d, at 1105.  
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				A decision that modifies the elements of an offense is normally substantive rather than procedural.  New elements alter the range of conduct the statute punishes, rendering some formerly unlawful conduct lawful or vice versa.  See 
				<em>
					Bousley
				</em>
				, 523 U. S., at 620621.  But that is not what 
				<em>
					Ring 
				</em>
				did; the range of conduct punished by death in Arizona was the same before 
				<em>
					Ring 
				</em>
				as after.  
				<em>
					Ring
				</em>
				 held that, 
				<em>
					because 
				</em>
				Arizonas statutory aggravators restricted (as a matter of state law) the class of death-eligible defendants, those aggravators 
				<em>
					effectively were 
				</em>
				elements for federal constitutional purposes, and so were subject to the procedural requirements the Constitution attaches to trial of elements.  536 U. S., at 609.  This Courts holding that, 
				<em>
					because Arizona
				</em>
				 has made a certain fact essential to the death penalty, that fact must be found by a jury, is not the same as 
				<em>
					this Courts
				</em>
				 making a certain fact essential to the death penalty.  The former was a procedural holding; the latter would be substantive.  The Ninth Circuits conclusion that 
				<em>
					Ring
				</em>
				 nonetheless reshap[ed] the structure of Arizona murder law, 341 F. 3d, at 1105, is particularly remarkable in the face of the Arizona Supreme Courts previous conclusion to the contrary.  See

The Ninth Circuit majority added others, including the claim that a judge might be too acclimated to capital sentencing and that he might be swayed by political pressure.  341 F. 3d, at 11091116.

				First, for every argument why juries are more accurate factfinders, there is another why they are less accurate.  The Ninth Circuit dissent noted several, including juries tendency to become confused over legal standards and to be influenced by emotion or philosophical predisposition.

				<em>

				</em>
				 was decided under our pre-
				<em>
					Teague

				 retroactivity framework, its reasoning is germane.  We noted that, although the right to jury trial generally tends to prevent arbitrariness and repression[,] … [w]e would not assert … that every criminal trialor any particular trialheld before a judge alone is unfair or that a defendant may never be as fairly treated by a judge as he would be by a jury.   392 U.

				The dissent contends that juries are more accurate because they better reflect community standards in deciding whether, for example, a murder was heinous, cruel, or depraved.  
				<em>
					Post

				, at 4 (opinion of 
				<span class="smallcaps">

				<em>
					as determined by community standards
				</em>
				.  See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §13703(F)(6) (West 1978).  It is easy to find enhanced accuracy in jury determination when one redefines the statutes substantive scope in such manner as to ensure that result.  The dissent also advances several variations on the theme that death is different (or rather, dramatically different, 
				<em>
					post

				<em>
					Teague

				<em>
					post

				<em>
					Teague
				</em>
				 in this fashion, we would not agree with the dissents conclusions.  Finally, the dissent notes that, in

				, we considered factors other than enhanced accuracy that are no longer relevant after

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/536/266" class="subref" title="subref">536 U. S. 266</a>, and n. 5 (2002) (per curiam); they are more accurately characterized as substantive rules not subject to the bar.

						 Respondent also argues that Ring was substantive because our understanding of Arizona law changed.  Compare Ring v. Arizona, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/536/584" class="subref" title="subref">536 U. S. 584</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">602</a>603 (2002)
, with Apprendi v. New Jersey, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/530/466" class="subref" title="subref">530 U. S. 466</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">496</a>497 (2000)
.  Even if our understanding of state law changed, however, the actual content of state law did not.  See State v. Ring, 200 Ariz. 267, 279, 25 P. 3d 1139, 1151 (2001), revd on other grounds, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/536/584" class="subref" title="subref">536 U. S. 584</a> (2002)
; State v. Gretzler, 135 Ariz. 42, 54, 659 P. 2d 1, 13, cert. denied, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/461/971" class="subref" title="subref">461 U. S. 971</a> (1983)
; Johnson v. Fankell, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/520/911" class="subref" title="subref">520 U. S. 911</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">916</a> (1997)

						 The dissent distinguishes DeStefano on the ground that this case involves only a small subclass of defendants deprived of jury trial rights, the relevant harm within that subclass is more widespread, the administration of justice problem is far less serious, and the reliance interest less weighty.  Post, at 8.  But the first, third, and fourth of these points are irrelevant under Teague, and the second, insofar as it relates to accuracy, is an unsubstantiated assertion.  If jury trial significantly enhances accuracy, we would not have been able to hold as we did in DeStefano that the first factorprevent[ing] arbitrariness and repression, 392 U. S., at 633did not favor retroactivity.

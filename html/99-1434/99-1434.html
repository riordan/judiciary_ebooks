				 Customs offices may issue ruling letters, and so may the Customs Headquarters Office, in providing [a]dvice or guidance as to the interpretation or proper application of the Customs and related laws with respect to a specific Customs transaction [which] may be requested by Customs Service field offices … at any time, whether the transaction is prospective, current, or completed,

				Respondent, the Mead Corporation, imports day planners, three-ring binders with pages having room for notes of daily schedules and phone numbers and addresses, together with a calendar and suchlike.  The tariff schedule on point falls under the HTSUS heading for [r]egisters, account books, notebooks, order books, receipt books, letter pads, memorandum pads, diaries and similar articles, HTSUS subheading 4820.10, which comprises two subcategories.  Items in the first, [d]iaries, notebooks and address books, bound; memorandum pads, letter pads and similar articles, were subject to a tariff of 4.0% at the time in controversy.  185 F. 3d 1304, 1305 (CA Fed. 1999) (citing subheading 4820.10.20); see also App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a.  Objects in the second, covering [o]ther items, were free of duty.  HTSUS subheading 4820.10.40; see also App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Between 1989 and 1993, Customs repeatedly treated day planners under the other HTSUS subheading.  In January 1993, however, Customs changed its position, and issued a Headquarters ruling letter classifying Meads day planners as Diaries …, bound subject to tariff under subheading 4820.10.20.  That letter was short on explanation, App. to Brief in Opposition 4a6a, but after Meads protest, Customs Headquarters issued a new letter, carefully reasoned but never published, reaching the same conclusion, App. to Pet. for Cert. 28a47a.  This letter considered two definitions of diary from the Oxford English Dictionary, the first covering a daily journal of the past days events, the second a book including  printed dates for daily memoranda and jottings; also … calendars … .   
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 33a34a (quoting Oxford English Dictionary 321 (Compact ed. 1982)).  Customs concluded that diary was not confined to the first, in part because the broader definition reflects commercial usage and hence the commercial identity of these items in the marketplace.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 34a.  As for the definition of bound, Customs concluded that HTSUS was not referring to bookbinding, but to a less exact sort of fastening described in the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System Explanatory Notes to Heading 4820, which spoke of binding by  reinforcements or fittings of metal, plastics, etc.   
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 45a.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Customs rejected Meads further protest of the second Headquarters ruling letter, and Mead filed suit in the Court of International Trade (CIT).  The CIT granted the Governments motion for summary judgment, adopting Customss reasoning without saying anything about deference.  17 F. Supp. 2d 1004 (1998).

				Mead then went to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.  While the case was pending there this Court decided 
				<em>

				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Haggar Apparel Co., 
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/526/380" class="subref" title="subref">526 U. S. 380</a> (1999)

				 v. 
				<em>

.  The appeals court requested briefing on the im-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				pact of 
				<em>

				</em>
				, and the Government argued that classification rulings, like Customs regulations, deserve 
				<em>
					Chevron
				</em>
				 deference.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Federal Circuit, however, reversed the CIT and held that Customs classification rulings should not get 
				<em>
					Chevron
				</em>
				 deference, owing to differences from the regulations at issue in 
				<em>
					Haggar
				</em>
				.
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				 Rulings are not preceded by notice and comment as under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/5/553.html" class="subref" title="subref">5 U. S. C. §553</a>, they do not carry the force of law and are not, like regulations, intended to clarify the rights and obligations of importers beyond the specific case under review.  185 F. 3d, at 1307.  The appeals court thought classification rulings had a weaker 
				<em>
					Chevron
				</em>
				 claim even than Internal Revenue Service interpretive rulings, to which that court gives no deference; unlike rulings by the IRS, Customs rulings issue from many locations and need not be published.  185 F. 3d, at 13071308.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court of Appeals accordingly gave no deference at all to the ruling classifying the Mead day planners and rejected the agencys reasoning as to both diary and bound.  It thought that planners were not diaries because they had no space for relatively extensive notations about events, observations, feelings, or thoughts in the past.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 1310.  And it concluded that diaries bound in subheading 4810.10.20 presupposed unbound diaries, such that treating ring-fastened diaries as bound would leave the unbound diary an empty category.  
				<em>
					Id.,

				at 1311.

				<em>
					Chevron
				</em>
				 deference owed to administrative practice in applying a statute.  We hold that administrative implementation of a particular statutory provision qualifies for 
				<em>
					Chevron
				</em>
				 deference when it appears that Congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law, and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.  Delegation of such authority may be shown in a variety of ways, as by an agencys power to engage in adjudication or notice-and-comment rulemaking, or by some other indication of a comparable congressional intent.  The Customs ruling at issue here fails to qualify, although the possibility that it deserves some deference under

				Since 1984, we have identified a
				 
				category of interpretive choices distinguished by an additional reason for judicial deference.  This Court in 
				<em>
					Chevron
				</em>
				 recognized that Congress not only engages in express delegation of specific interpretive authority, but that [s]ometimes the legislative delegation to an agency on a particular question is implicit.  467 U. S., at 844.  Congress, that is, may not have expressly delegated authority or responsibility to implement a particular provision or fill a particular gap.  Yet it can still be apparent from the agencys generally conferred authority and other statutory circumstances that Congress would expect the agency to be able to speak with the force of law when it addresses ambiguity in the statute or fills a space in the enacted law, even one about which Congress did not actually have an intent as to a particular result.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 845.  When circumstances implying such an expectation exist, a reviewing court has no business rejecting an agencys exercise of its generally conferred authority to resolve a particular statutory ambiguity simply because the agencys chosen resolution seems unwise, see
				<em>
					 id.,
				</em>
				 at 845846, but is obliged to accept the agencys position if Congress has not previously spoken to the point at issue and the agencys interpretation is reasonable, see
				<em>
					 id.,
				</em>
				 at 842845; cf. 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/5/706.html#2" class="subref" title="subref">5 U. S. C. §706(2)</a> (a reviewing court shall set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law).

				  It is true as well that Congress had classification rulings in mind when it explicitly authorized, in a parenthetical, the issuance of regulations establishing procedures for the issuance of binding rulings prior to the entry of the merchandise concerned,

				  The reference to binding classifications does not, however, bespeak the legislative type of activity that would naturally bind more than the parties to the ruling, once the goods classified are admitted into this country.  And though the statutes direction to disseminate information necessary to secure uniformity, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/19/1502.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">19 U. S. C. §1502(a)</a>, seems to assume that a ruling may be precedent in later transactions, precedential value alone does not add up to 
				<em>
					Chevron
				</em>
				 entitlement; interpretive rules may sometimes function as precedents, see Strauss, The Rulemaking Continuum, 41 Duke L. J. 1463, 14721473 (1992), and they enjoy no 
				<em>
					Chevron
				</em>
				 status as a class.  In any event, any precedential claim of a classification ruling is counterbalanced by the provision for independent review of Customs classifications by the CIT, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2638-264.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §§2638264</a>0; the scheme for CIT review includes a provision that treats classification rulings on par with the Secretarys rulings on valuation, rate of duty, marking, restricted merchandise, entry requirements, drawbacks, vessel repairs, or similar matters, §1581(h); see §2639(b).  It is hard to imagine a congressional understanding more at odds with the

				It is difficult, in fact, to see in the agency practice itself any indication that Customs ever set out with a lawmaking pretense in mind when it undertook to make classifications like these.  Customs does not generally engage in notice-and-comment practice when issuing them, and their treatment by the agency makes it clear that a letters binding character as a ruling stops short of third parties; Customs has regarded a classification as conclusive only as between itself and the importer to whom it was issued, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/19/177" class="subref" title="subref">19 CFR §177.9</a>(c) (2000), and even then only until Customs has given advance notice of intended change, §§177.9(a), (c).  Other importers are in fact warned against assuming any right of detrimental reliance.  §177.9(c).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Indeed, to claim that classifications have legal force is to ignore the reality that 46 different Customs offices issue 10,000 to 15,000 of them each year, see Brief for Respondent 5; CITBA Brief 6 (citing Treasury Advisory Committee on the Commercial Operations of the United States Customs Service, Report of the COAC Subcommittee on OR&amp;R, Exhibits 1, 3 (Jan. 26, 2000) (reprinted in App. to CITBA Brief 20a21a)).  Any suggestion that rulings intended to have the force of law are being churned out at a rate of 10,000 a year at an agencys 46 scattered offices is simply self-refuting.  Although the circumstances are less startling here, with a Headquarters letter in issue, none of the relevant statutes recognizes this category of rulings as separate or different from others; there is thus no indication that a more potent delegation might have been understood as going to Headquarters even when Headquarters provides developed reasoning, as it did in this instance.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Nor do the amendments to the statute made effective after this case arose disturb our conclusion.  The new law requires Customs to provide notice-and-comment procedures only when modifying or revoking a prior classification ruling or modifying the treatment accorded to substantially identical transactions, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/19/1625.html#c" class="subref" title="subref">19 U. S. C. §1625(c)</a>; and under its regulations, Customs sees itself obliged to provide notice-and-comment procedures only when changing a practice so as to produce a tariff increase, or in the imposition of a restriction or prohibition, or when Customs Headquarters determines that the matter is of sufficient importance to involve the interests of domestic industry, 19 CFR §§177.10(c)(1)(2) (2000).  The statutory changes reveal no new congressional objective of treating classification decisions generally as rulemaking with force of law, nor do they suggest any intent to create a 
				<em>
					Chevron
				</em>
				 patchwork of classification rulings, some with force of law, some without.

				Underlying the position we take here, like the position expressed by

That feature is the great variety of ways in which the laws invest the Governments administrative arms with discretion, and with procedures for exercising it, in giving meaning to Acts of Congress.  Implementation of a statute may occur in formal adjudication or the choice to defend against judicial challenge; it may occur in a central board or office or in dozens of enforcement agencies dotted across the country; its institutional lawmaking may be confined to the resolution of minute detail or extend to legislative rulemaking on matters intentionally left by Congress to be worked out at the agency level.

				Although we all accept the position that the Judiciary should defer to at least some of this multifarious administrative action, we have to decide how to take account of the great range of its variety.  If the primary objective is 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				to simplify the judicial process of giving or withholding deference, then the diversity of statutes authorizing discretionary administrative action must be declared irrelevant or minimized.  If, on the other hand, it is simply implausible that Congress intended such a broad range of statutory authority to produce only two varieties of administrative action, demanding either 
				<em>

				</em>
				 deference or none at all, then the breadth of the spectrum of possible agency action must be taken into account.

				<em>

				 was simply a case recognizing that even without express authority to fill a specific statutory gap, circumstances pointing to implicit congressional delegation present a particularly insistent call for deference.  Indeed, in holding here that 
				<em>

				</em>
				 left 
				<em>

						 It is, of course, true that the limit of Chevron deference is not marked by a hard-edged rule.  But Chevron itself is a good example showing when Chevron deference is warranted, while this is a good case showing when it is not.  Judges in other, perhaps harder, cases will make reasoned choices between the two examples,  the way courts have always done.

						 Surely Justice Jacksons practical criteria, along with Chevrons concern with congressional understanding, provide more reliable guideposts than conclusory references to the authoritative or official.  Even if those terms provided a true criterion, there would have to be something wrong with a standard that accorded the status of substantive law to every one of 10,000 official customs classifications rulings turned out each year from over 46 offices placed around the country at the Nations entryways.  Justice Scalia tries to avoid that result by limiting what is authoritative or official to a pronouncement that expresses the judgment of central agency management, approved at the highest level, as distinct from the pronouncements of underlings, post, at 22, n. 5.  But that analysis would not entitle a Headquarters ruling to Chevron deference; the highest level at Customs is the source of the regulation at issue in Haggar, the Commissioner of Customs with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury.   526 U. S., at 386.  The Commissioner did not issue the Headquarters ruling.  What Justice Scalia has in mind here is that because the Secretary approved the Governments position in its brief to this Court, Chevron deference is due.  But if that is so, Chevron deference was not called for until sometime after the litigation began, when central management at the highest level decided to defend the ruling, and the deference is not to the classification ruling as such but to the brief.  This explains why the Court has not accepted Justice Scalias position.

				Respondent, the Mead Corporation, imports day planners, three-ring binders with pages having room for notes of daily schedules and phone numbers and addresses, together with a calendar and suchlike.  The tariff schedule on point falls under the HTSUS heading for [r]egisters, account books, notebooks, order books, receipt books, letter pads, memorandum pads, diaries and similar articles, HTSUS subheading 4820.10, which comprises two subcategories.  Items in the first, [d]iaries, notebooks and address books, bound; memorandum pads, letter pads and similar articles, were subject to a tariff of 4.0% at the time in controversy.  185 F. 3d 1304, 1305 (CA Fed. 1999) (citing subheading 4820.10.20); see also App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a.  Objects in the second, covering [o]ther items, were free of duty.  HTSUS subheading 4820.10.40; see also App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Between 1989 and 1993, Customs repeatedly treated day planners under the other HTSUS subheading.  In January 1993, however, Customs changed its position, and issued a Headquarters ruling letter classifying Meads day planners as Diaries …, bound subject to tariff under subheading 4820.10.20.  That letter was short on explanation, App. to Brief in Opposition 4a6a, but after Meads protest, Customs Headquarters issued a new letter, carefully reasoned but never published, reaching the same conclusion, App. to Pet. for Cert. 28a47a.  This letter considered two definitions of diary from the Oxford English Dictionary, the first covering a daily journal of the past days events, the second a book including  printed dates for daily memoranda and jottings; also … calendars … .   
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 33a34a (quoting Oxford English Dictionary 321 (Compact ed. 1982)).  Customs concluded that diary was not confined to the first, in part because the broader definition reflects commercial usage and hence the commercial identity of these items in the marketplace.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 34a.  As for the definition of bound, Customs concluded that HTSUS was not referring to bookbinding, but to a less exact sort of fastening described in the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System Explanatory Notes to Heading 4820, which spoke of binding by  reinforcements or fittings of metal, plastics, etc.   
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 45a.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Customs rejected Meads further protest of the second Headquarters ruling letter, and Mead filed suit in the Court of International Trade (CIT).  The CIT granted the Governments motion for summary judgment, adopting Customss reasoning without saying anything about deference.  17 F. Supp. 2d 1004 (1998).

				Since 1984, we have identified a
				 
				category of interpretive choices distinguished by an additional reason for judicial deference.  This Court in 
				<em>
					Chevron
				</em>
				 recognized that Congress not only engages in express delegation of specific interpretive authority, but that [s]ometimes the legislative delegation to an agency on a particular question is implicit.  467 U. S., at 844.  Congress, that is, may not have expressly delegated authority or responsibility to implement a particular provision or fill a particular gap.  Yet it can still be apparent from the agencys generally conferred authority and other statutory circumstances that Congress would expect the agency to be able to speak with the force of law when it addresses ambiguity in the statute or fills a space in the enacted law, even one about which Congress did not actually have an intent as to a particular result.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 845.  When circumstances implying such an expectation exist, a reviewing court has no business rejecting an agencys exercise of its generally conferred authority to resolve a particular statutory ambiguity simply because the agencys chosen resolution seems unwise, see
				<em>
					 id.,
				</em>
				 at 845846, but is obliged to accept the agencys position if Congress has not previously spoken to the point at issue and the agencys interpretation is reasonable, see

On the face of the statute, to begin with, the terms of the congressional delegation give no indication that Congress meant to delegate authority to Customs to issue classification rulings with the force of law.  We are not, of course, here making any global statement about Customss authority, for it is true that the general rulemaking power conferred on Customs, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/19/1624.html" class="subref" title="subref">19 U. S. C. §1624</a>, authorizes some regulation with the force of law, or legal norms, as we put it in

				  It is true as well that Congress had classification rulings in mind when it explicitly authorized, in a parenthetical, the issuance of regulations establishing procedures for the issuance of binding rulings prior to the entry of the merchandise concerned, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/19/1502.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">19 U. S. C. §1502(a)</a>.

            </a>
				  The reference to binding classifications does not, however, bespeak the legislative type of activity that would naturally bind more than the parties to the ruling, once the goods classified are admitted into this country.  And though the statutes direction to disseminate information necessary to secure uniformity, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/19/1502.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">19 U. S. C. §1502(a)</a>, seems to assume that a ruling may be precedent in later transactions, precedential value alone does not add up to 
				<em>
					Chevron
				</em>
				 entitlement; interpretive rules may sometimes function as precedents, see Strauss, The Rulemaking Continuum, 41 Duke L. J. 1463, 14721473 (1992), and they enjoy no 
				<em>
					Chevron
				</em>
				 status as a class.  In any event, any precedential claim of a classification ruling is counterbalanced by the provision for independent review of Customs classifications by the CIT, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2638-264.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §§2638264</a>0; the scheme for CIT review includes a provision that treats classification rulings on par with the Secretarys rulings on valuation, rate of duty, marking, restricted merchandise, entry requirements, drawbacks, vessel repairs, or similar matters, §1581(h); see §2639(b).  It is hard to imagine a congressional understanding more at odds with the 
				<em>

				 regime.

				It is difficult, in fact, to see in the agency practice itself any indication that Customs ever set out with a lawmaking pretense in mind when it undertook to make classifications like these.  Customs does not generally engage in notice-and-comment practice when issuing them, and their treatment by the agency makes it clear that a letters binding character as a ruling stops short of third parties; Customs has regarded a classification as conclusive only as between itself and the importer to whom it was issued, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/19/177" class="subref" title="subref">19 CFR §177.9</a>(c) (2000), and even then only until Customs has given advance notice of intended change, §§177.9(a), (c).  Other importers are in fact warned against assuming any right of detrimental reliance.  §177.9(c).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Indeed, to claim that classifications have legal force is to ignore the reality that 46 different Customs offices issue 10,000 to 15,000 of them each year, see Brief for Respondent 5; CITBA Brief 6 (citing Treasury Advisory Committee on the Commercial Operations of the United States Customs Service, Report of the COAC Subcommittee on OR&amp;R, Exhibits 1, 3 (Jan. 26, 2000) (reprinted in App. to CITBA Brief 20a21a)).  Any suggestion that rulings intended to have the force of law are being churned out at a rate of 10,000 a year at an agencys 46 scattered offices is simply self-refuting.  Although the circumstances are less startling here, with a Headquarters letter in issue, none of the relevant statutes recognizes this category of rulings as separate or different from others; there is thus no indication that a more potent delegation might have been understood as going to Headquarters even when Headquarters provides developed reasoning, as it did in this instance.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Nor do the amendments to the statute made effective after this case arose disturb our conclusion.  The new law requires Customs to provide notice-and-comment procedures only when modifying or revoking a prior classification ruling or modifying the treatment accorded to substantially identical transactions, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/19/1625.html#c" class="subref" title="subref">19 U. S. C. §1625(c)</a>; and under its regulations, Customs sees itself obliged to provide notice-and-comment procedures only when changing a practice so as to produce a tariff increase, or in the imposition of a restriction or prohibition, or when Customs Headquarters determines that the matter is of sufficient importance to involve the interests of domestic industry, 19 CFR §§177.10(c)(1)(2) (2000).  The statutory changes reveal no new congressional objective of treating classification decisions generally as rulemaking with force of law, nor do they suggest any intent to create a 
				<em>
					Chevron
				</em>
				 patchwork of classification rulings, some with force of law, some without.

				Underlying the position we take here, like the position expressed by 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Scalia
				</span>
				 in dissent, is a choice about the best way to deal with an inescapable feature of the body of congressional legislation authorizing administrative action.  That feature is the great variety of ways in which the laws invest the Governments administrative arms with discretion, and with procedures for exercising it, in giving meaning to Acts of Congress.  Implementation of a statute may occur in formal adjudication or the choice to defend against judicial challenge; it may occur in a central board or office or in dozens of enforcement agencies dotted across the country; its institutional lawmaking may be confined to the resolution of minute detail or extend to legislative rulemaking on matters intentionally left by Congress to be worked out at the agency level.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Although we all accept the position that the Judiciary should defer to at least some of this multifarious administrative action, we have to decide how to take account of the great range of its variety.  If the primary objective is 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				to simplify the judicial process of giving or withholding deference, then the diversity of statutes authorizing discretionary administrative action must be declared irrelevant or minimized.  If, on the other hand, it is simply implausible that Congress intended such a broad range of statutory authority to produce only two varieties of administrative action, demanding either 
				<em>
					Chevron
				</em>
				 deference or none at all, then the breadth of the spectrum of possible agency action must be taken into account.  
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Scalia
				</span>
				s first priority over the years has been to limit and simplify.  The Courts choice has been to tailor deference to variety.

				  This acceptance of the range of statutory variation has led the Court to recognize more than one variety of judicial deference, just as the Court has recognized a variety of indicators that Congress would expect

				 deference.

				Our respective choices are repeated today.  
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Scalia
				</span>
				 would pose the question of deference as an either-or choice.  On his view that 
				<em>

				</em>
				 rendered 
				<em>

				</em>
				 anachronistic, when courts owe any deference it is 
				<em>
					Chevron
				</em>
				 deference that they owe, 
				<em>
					post,
				</em>
				 at 910.  Whether courts do owe deference in a given case turns, for him, on whether the agency action (if reasonable) is authoritative, 
				<em>
					post,
				</em>
				 at 17.  The character of the authoritative derives, in turn, not from breadth of delegation or the agencys procedure in implementing it, but is defined as the official position of an agency, 
				<em>
					ibid.,
				</em>
				 and may ultimately be a function of administrative persistence alone, 
				<em>
					ibid
				</em>
				.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court, on the other hand, said nothing in 
				<em>
					Chevron
				</em>
				 to eliminate 
				<em>
					Skidmore
				</em>
				s recognition of various justifications for deference depending on statutory circumstances and agency action; 
				<em>
					Chevron
				</em>
				 was simply a case recognizing that even without express authority to fill a specific statutory gap, circumstances pointing to implicit congressional delegation present a particularly insistent call for deference.  Indeed, in holding here that 
				<em>
					Chevron
				</em>
				 left 
				<em>
					Skidmore
				</em>
				 intact and applicable where statutory circumstances indicate no intent to delegate general authority to make rules with force of law, or where such authority was not invoked, we hold nothing more than we said last Term in response to the particular statutory circumstances in 
				<em>
					Christensen
				</em>
				, to which 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Scalia

				 then took exception, see 529 U. S., at 589, just as he does again today.

				We think, in sum, that 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Scalia
				</span>
				s efforts to simplify ultimately run afoul of Congresss indications that different statutes present different reasons for considering respect for the exercise of administrative authority or deference to it.  Without being at odds with congressional intent much of the time, we believe that judicial responses to administrative action must continue to differentiate between 
				<em>
					Chevron
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Skidmore,
				</em>
				 and that continued recognition of 
				<em>
					Skidmore
				</em>
				 is necessary for just the reasons Justice Jackson gave when that case was decided.

						 It is, of course, true that the limit of Chevron deference is not marked by a hard-edged rule.  But Chevron itself is a good example showing when Chevron deference is warranted, while this is a good case showing when it is not.  Judges in other, perhaps harder, cases will make reasoned choices between the two examples,  the way courts have always done.

						 Surely Justice Jacksons practical criteria, along with Chevrons concern with congressional understanding, provide more reliable guideposts than conclusory references to the authoritative or official.  Even if those terms provided a true criterion, there would have to be something wrong with a standard that accorded the status of substantive law to every one of 10,000 official customs classifications rulings turned out each year from over 46 offices placed around the country at the Nations entryways.  Justice Scalia tries to avoid that result by limiting what is authoritative or official to a pronouncement that expresses the judgment of central agency management, approved at the highest level, as distinct from the pronouncements of underlings, post, at 22, n. 5.  But that analysis would not entitle a Headquarters ruling to Chevron deference; the highest level at Customs is the source of the regulation at issue in Haggar, the Commissioner of Customs with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury.   526 U. S., at 386.  The Commissioner did not issue the Headquarters ruling.  What Justice Scalia has in mind here is that because the Secretary approved the Governments position in its brief to this Court, Chevron deference is due.  But if that is so, Chevron deference was not called for until sometime after the litigation began, when central management at the highest level decided to defend the ruling, and the deference is not to the classification ruling as such but to the brief.  This explains why the Court has not accepted Justice Scalias position.

				Respondent, the Mead Corporation, imports day planners, three-ring binders with pages having room for notes of daily schedules and phone numbers and addresses, together with a calendar and suchlike.  The tariff schedule on point falls under the HTSUS heading for [r]egisters, account books, notebooks, order books, receipt books, letter pads, memorandum pads, diaries and similar articles, HTSUS subheading 4820.10, which comprises two subcategories.  Items in the first, [d]iaries, notebooks and address books, bound; memorandum pads, letter pads and similar articles, were subject to a tariff of 4.0% at the time in controversy.  185 F. 3d 1304, 1305 (CA Fed. 1999) (citing subheading 4820.10.20); see also App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a.  Objects in the second, covering [o]ther items, were free of duty.  HTSUS subheading 4820.10.40; see also App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Between 1989 and 1993, Customs repeatedly treated day planners under the other HTSUS subheading.  In January 1993, however, Customs changed its position, and issued a Headquarters ruling letter classifying Meads day planners as Diaries …, bound subject to tariff under subheading 4820.10.20.  That letter was short on explanation, App. to Brief in Opposition 4a6a, but after Meads protest, Customs Headquarters issued a new letter, carefully reasoned but never published, reaching the same conclusion, App. to Pet. for Cert. 28a47a.  This letter considered two definitions of diary from the Oxford English Dictionary, the first covering a daily journal of the past days events, the second a book including  printed dates for daily memoranda and jottings; also … calendars … .   
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 33a34a (quoting Oxford English Dictionary 321 (Compact ed. 1982)).  Customs concluded that diary was not confined to the first, in part because the broader definition reflects commercial usage and hence the commercial identity of these items in the marketplace.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 34a.  As for the definition of bound, Customs concluded that HTSUS was not referring to bookbinding, but to a less exact sort of fastening described in the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System Explanatory Notes to Heading 4820, which spoke of binding by  reinforcements or fittings of metal, plastics, etc.   
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 45a.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Customs rejected Meads further protest of the second Headquarters ruling letter, and Mead filed suit in the Court of International Trade (CIT).  The CIT granted the Governments motion for summary judgment, adopting Customss reasoning without saying anything about deference.  17 F. Supp. 2d 1004 (1998).

				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/526/380" class="subref" title="subref">526 U. S. 380</a> (1999)

				, and the Government argued that classification rulings, like Customs regulations, deserve 
				<em>
					Chevron
				</em>
				 deference.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Federal Circuit, however, reversed the CIT and held that Customs classification rulings should not get 
				<em>
					Chevron
				</em>
				 deference, owing to differences from the regulations at issue in 
				<em>
					Haggar
				</em>
				.
				<em>
					 
				</em>

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/5/553.html" class="subref" title="subref">5 U. S.

The appeals court thought classification rulings had a weaker 
				<em>
					Chevron
				</em>
				 claim even than Internal Revenue Service interpretive rulings, to which that court gives no deference; unlike rulings by the IRS, Customs rulings issue from many locations and need not be published.  185 F. 3d, at 13071308.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court of Appeals accordingly gave no deference at all to the ruling classifying the Mead day planners and rejected the agencys reasoning as to both diary and bound.  It thought that planners were not diaries because they had no space for relatively extensive notations about events, observations, feelings, or thoughts in the past.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 1310.  And it concluded that diaries bound in subheading 4810.10.20 presupposed unbound diaries, such that treating ring-fastened diaries as bound would leave the unbound diary an empty category.

				</em>
				 deference owed to administrative practice in applying a statute.  We hold that administrative implementation of a particular statutory provision qualifies for

Delegation of such authority may be shown in a variety of ways, as by an agencys power to engage in adjudication or notice-and-comment rulemaking, or by some other indication of a comparable congressional intent.  The Customs ruling at issue here fails to qualify, although the possibility that it deserves some deference under

				Since 1984, we have identified a
				 
				category of interpretive choices distinguished by an additional reason for judicial deference.  This Court in 
				<em>
					Chevron
				</em>
				 recognized that Congress not only engages in express delegation of specific interpretive authority, but that [s]ometimes the legislative delegation to an agency on a particular question is implicit.  467 U. S., at 844.  Congress, that is, may not have expressly delegated authority or responsibility to implement a particular provision or fill a particular gap.  Yet it can still be apparent from the agencys generally conferred authority and other statutory circumstances that Congress would expect the agency to be able to speak with the force of law when it addresses ambiguity in the statute or fills a space in the enacted law, even one about which Congress did not actually have an intent as to a particular result.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 845.  When circumstances implying such an expectation exist, a reviewing court has no business rejecting an agencys exercise of its generally conferred authority to resolve a particular statutory ambiguity simply because the agencys chosen resolution seems unwise, see
				<em>
					 id.,
				</em>
				 at 845846, but is obliged to accept the agencys position if Congress has not previously spoken to the point at issue and the agencys interpretation is reasonable, see
				<em>
					 id.,

				 at 842845; cf.

On the face of the statute, to begin with, the terms of the congressional delegation give no indication that Congress meant to delegate authority to Customs to issue classification rulings with the force of law.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/19/1624.html" class="subref" title="subref">19 U. S. C. §1624</a>, authorizes some regulation with the force of law, or legal norms, as we put it in

				  It is true as well that Congress had classification rulings in mind when it explicitly authorized, in a parenthetical, the issuance of regulations establishing procedures for the issuance of binding rulings prior to the entry of the merchandise concerned,

				  The reference to binding classifications does not, however, bespeak the legislative type of activity that would naturally bind more than the parties to the ruling, once the goods classified are admitted into this country.  And though the statutes direction to disseminate information necessary to secure uniformity, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/19/1502.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">19 U. S. C. §1502(a)</a>, seems to assume that a ruling may be precedent in later transactions, precedential value alone does not add up to 
				<em>
					Chevron
				</em>
				 entitlement; interpretive rules may sometimes function as precedents, see Strauss, The Rulemaking Continuum, 41 Duke L. J. 1463, 14721473 (1992), and they enjoy no 
				<em>
					Chevron
				</em>
				 status as a class.  In any event, any precedential claim of a classification ruling is counterbalanced by the provision for independent review of Customs classifications by the CIT, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2638-264.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §§2638264</a>0; the scheme for CIT review includes a provision that treats classification rulings on par with the Secretarys rulings on valuation, rate of duty, marking, restricted merchandise, entry requirements, drawbacks, vessel repairs, or similar matters, §1581(h); see §2639(b).  It is hard to imagine a congressional understanding more at odds with the 
				<em>

				It is difficult, in fact, to see in the agency practice itself any indication that Customs ever set out with a lawmaking pretense in mind when it undertook to make classifications like these.  Customs does not generally engage in notice-and-comment practice when issuing them, and their treatment by the agency makes it clear that a letters binding character as a ruling stops short of third parties; Customs has regarded a classification as conclusive only as between itself and the importer to whom it was issued, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/19/177" class="subref" title="subref">19 CFR §177.9</a>(c) (2000), and even then only until Customs has given advance notice of intended change, §§177.9(a), (c).  Other importers are in fact warned against assuming any right of detrimental reliance.  §177.9(c).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Indeed, to claim that classifications have legal force is to ignore the reality that 46 different Customs offices issue 10,000 to 15,000 of them each year, see Brief for Respondent 5; CITBA Brief 6 (citing Treasury Advisory Committee on the Commercial Operations of the United States Customs Service, Report of the COAC Subcommittee on OR&amp;R, Exhibits 1, 3 (Jan. 26, 2000) (reprinted in App. to CITBA Brief 20a21a)).  Any suggestion that rulings intended to have the force of law are being churned out at a rate of 10,000 a year at an agencys 46 scattered offices is simply self-refuting.  Although the circumstances are less startling here, with a Headquarters letter in issue, none of the relevant statutes recognizes this category of rulings as separate or different from others; there is thus no indication that a more potent delegation might have been understood as going to Headquarters even when Headquarters provides developed reasoning, as it did in this instance.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Nor do the amendments to the statute made effective after this case arose disturb our conclusion.  The new law requires Customs to provide notice-and-comment procedures only when modifying or revoking a prior classification ruling or modifying the treatment accorded to substantially identical transactions, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/19/1625.html#c" class="subref" title="subref">19 U. S. C. §1625(c)</a>; and under its regulations, Customs sees itself obliged to provide notice-and-comment procedures only when changing a practice so as to produce a tariff increase, or in the imposition of a restriction or prohibition, or when Customs Headquarters determines that the matter is of sufficient importance to involve the interests of domestic industry, 19 CFR §§177.10(c)(1)(2) (2000).  The statutory changes reveal no new congressional objective of treating classification decisions generally as rulemaking with force of law, nor do they suggest any intent to create a 
				<em>
					Chevron
				</em>
				 patchwork of classification rulings, some with force of law, some without.

				Underlying the position we take here, like the position expressed by

That feature is the great variety of ways in which the laws invest the Governments administrative arms with discretion, and with procedures for exercising it, in giving meaning to Acts of Congress.  Implementation of a statute may occur in formal adjudication or the choice to defend against judicial challenge; it may occur in a central board or office or in dozens of enforcement agencies dotted across the country; its institutional lawmaking may be confined to the resolution of minute detail or extend to legislative rulemaking on matters intentionally left by Congress to be worked out at the agency level.

				Although we all accept the position that the Judiciary should defer to at least some of this multifarious administrative action, we have to decide how to take account of the great range of its variety.  If the primary objective is 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				to simplify the judicial process of giving or withholding deference, then the diversity of statutes authorizing discretionary administrative action must be declared irrelevant or minimized.  If, on the other hand, it is simply implausible that Congress intended such a broad range of statutory authority to produce only two varieties of administrative action, demanding either 
				<em>

				</em>
				 deference or none at all, then the breadth of the spectrum of possible agency action must be taken into account.

				 at 17.  The character of the authoritative derives, in turn, not from breadth of delegation or the agencys procedure in implementing it, but is defined as the official position of an agency,

				The Court, on the other hand, said nothing in

				<em>
					Chevron

				 was simply a case recognizing that even without express authority to fill a specific statutory gap, circumstances pointing to implicit congressional delegation present a particularly insistent call for deference.  Indeed, in holding here that 
				<em>

				 left 
				<em>

						 It is, of course, true that the limit of Chevron deference is not marked by a hard-edged rule.  But Chevron itself is a good example showing when Chevron deference is warranted, while this is a good case showing when it is not.  Judges in other, perhaps harder, cases will make reasoned choices between the two examples,  the way courts have always done.

						 Surely Justice Jacksons practical criteria, along with Chevrons concern with congressional understanding, provide more reliable guideposts than conclusory references to the authoritative or official.  Even if those terms provided a true criterion, there would have to be something wrong with a standard that accorded the status of substantive law to every one of 10,000 official customs classifications rulings turned out each year from over 46 offices placed around the country at the Nations entryways.  Justice Scalia tries to avoid that result by limiting what is authoritative or official to a pronouncement that expresses the judgment of central agency management, approved at the highest level, as distinct from the pronouncements of underlings, post, at 22, n. 5.  But that analysis would not entitle a Headquarters ruling to Chevron deference; the highest level at Customs is the source of the regulation at issue in Haggar, the Commissioner of Customs with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury.   526 U. S., at 386.  The Commissioner did not issue the Headquarters ruling.  What Justice Scalia has in mind here is that because the Secretary approved the Governments position in its brief to this Court, Chevron deference is due.  But if that is so, Chevron deference was not called for until sometime after the litigation began, when central management at the highest level decided to defend the ruling, and the deference is not to the classification ruling as such but to the brief.  This explains why the Court has not accepted Justice Scalias position.

				Respondent, the Mead Corporation, imports day planners, three-ring binders with pages having room for notes of daily schedules and phone numbers and addresses, together with a calendar and suchlike.  The tariff schedule on point falls under the HTSUS heading for [r]egisters, account books, notebooks, order books, receipt books, letter pads, memorandum pads, diaries and similar articles, HTSUS subheading 4820.10, which comprises two subcategories.  Items in the first, [d]iaries, notebooks and address books, bound; memorandum pads, letter pads and similar articles, were subject to a tariff of 4.0% at the time in controversy.  185 F. 3d 1304, 1305 (CA Fed. 1999) (citing subheading 4820.10.20); see also App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a.

				Between 1989 and 1993, Customs repeatedly treated day planners under the other HTSUS subheading.  In January 1993, however, Customs changed its position, and issued a Headquarters ruling letter classifying Meads day planners as Diaries …, bound subject to tariff under subheading 4820.10.20.  That letter was short on explanation, App. to Brief in Opposition 4a6a, but after Meads protest, Customs Headquarters issued a new letter, carefully reasoned but never published, reaching the same conclusion, App. to Pet. for Cert. 28a47a.  This letter considered two definitions of diary from the Oxford English Dictionary, the first covering a daily journal of the past days events, the second a book including  printed dates for daily memoranda and jottings; also … calendars … .   
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>

As for the definition of bound, Customs concluded that HTSUS was not referring to bookbinding, but to a less exact sort of fastening described in the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System Explanatory Notes to Heading 4820, which spoke of binding by  reinforcements or fittings of metal, plastics, etc. 

				Since 1984, we have identified a
				 
				category of interpretive choices distinguished by an additional reason for judicial deference.  This Court in 
				<em>
					Chevron
				</em>
				 recognized that Congress not only engages in express delegation of specific interpretive authority, but that [s]ometimes the legislative delegation to an agency on a particular question is implicit.  467 U. S., at 844.  Congress, that is, may not have expressly delegated authority or responsibility to implement a particular provision or fill a particular gap.  Yet it can still be apparent from the agencys generally conferred authority and other statutory circumstances that Congress would expect the agency to be able to speak with the force of law when it addresses ambiguity in the statute or fills a space in the enacted law, even one about which Congress did not actually have an intent as to a particular result.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 845.  When circumstances implying such an expectation exist, a reviewing court has no business rejecting an agencys exercise of its generally conferred authority to resolve a particular statutory ambiguity simply because the agencys chosen resolution seems unwise, see
				<em>
					 id.,
				</em>
				 at 845846, but is obliged to accept the agencys position if Congress has not previously spoken to the point at issue and the agencys interpretation is reasonable, see

On the face of the statute, to begin with, the terms of the congressional delegation give no indication that Congress meant to delegate authority to Customs to issue classification rulings with the force of law.  We are not, of course, here making any global statement about Customss authority, for it is true that the general rulemaking power conferred on Customs, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/19/1624.html" class="subref" title="subref">19 U. S. C. §1624</a>, authorizes some regulation with the force of law, or legal norms, as we put it in

				  It is true as well that Congress had classification rulings in mind when it explicitly authorized, in a parenthetical, the issuance of regulations establishing procedures for the issuance of binding rulings prior to the entry of the merchandise concerned, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/19/1502.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">19 U. S. C. §1502(a)</a>.

				  The reference to binding classifications does not, however, bespeak the legislative type of activity that would naturally bind more than the parties to the ruling, once the goods classified are admitted into this country.  And though the statutes direction to disseminate information necessary to secure uniformity, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/19/1502.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">19 U. S. C. §1502(a)</a>, seems to assume that a ruling may be precedent in later transactions, precedential value alone does not add up to 
				<em>
					Chevron
				</em>
				 entitlement; interpretive rules may sometimes function as precedents, see Strauss, The Rulemaking Continuum, 41 Duke L. J. 1463, 14721473 (1992), and they enjoy no 
				<em>
					Chevron
				</em>
				 status as a class.  In any event, any precedential claim of a classification ruling is counterbalanced by the provision for independent review of Customs classifications by the CIT, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2638-264.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §§2638264</a>0; the scheme for CIT review includes a provision that treats classification rulings on par with the Secretarys rulings on valuation, rate of duty, marking, restricted merchandise, entry requirements, drawbacks, vessel repairs, or similar matters, §1581(h); see §2639(b).  It is hard to imagine a congressional understanding more at odds with the 
				<em>

				 regime.

				It is difficult, in fact, to see in the agency practice itself any indication that Customs ever set out with a lawmaking pretense in mind when it undertook to make classifications like these.  Customs does not generally engage in notice-and-comment practice when issuing them, and their treatment by the agency makes it clear that a letters binding character as a ruling stops short of third parties; Customs has regarded a classification as conclusive only as between itself and the importer to whom it was issued, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/19/177" class="subref" title="subref">19 CFR §177.9</a>(c) (2000), and even then only until Customs has given advance notice of intended change, §§177.9(a), (c).  Other importers are in fact warned against assuming any right of detrimental reliance.  §177.9(c).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Indeed, to claim that classifications have legal force is to ignore the reality that 46 different Customs offices issue 10,000 to 15,000 of them each year, see Brief for Respondent 5; CITBA Brief 6 (citing Treasury Advisory Committee on the Commercial Operations of the United States Customs Service, Report of the COAC Subcommittee on OR&amp;R, Exhibits 1, 3 (Jan. 26, 2000) (reprinted in App. to CITBA Brief 20a21a)).  Any suggestion that rulings intended to have the force of law are being churned out at a rate of 10,000 a year at an agencys 46 scattered offices is simply self-refuting.  Although the circumstances are less startling here, with a Headquarters letter in issue, none of the relevant statutes recognizes this category of rulings as separate or different from others; there is thus no indication that a more potent delegation might have been understood as going to Headquarters even when Headquarters provides developed reasoning, as it did in this instance.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Nor do the amendments to the statute made effective after this case arose disturb our conclusion.  The new law requires Customs to provide notice-and-comment procedures only when modifying or revoking a prior classification ruling or modifying the treatment accorded to substantially identical transactions, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/19/1625.html#c" class="subref" title="subref">19 U. S. C. §1625(c)</a>; and under its regulations, Customs sees itself obliged to provide notice-and-comment procedures only when changing a practice so as to produce a tariff increase, or in the imposition of a restriction or prohibition, or when Customs Headquarters determines that the matter is of sufficient importance to involve the interests of domestic industry, 19 CFR §§177.10(c)(1)(2) (2000).  The statutory changes reveal no new congressional objective of treating classification decisions generally as rulemaking with force of law, nor do they suggest any intent to create a 
				<em>
					Chevron
				</em>
				 patchwork of classification rulings, some with force of law, some without.

				Underlying the position we take here, like the position expressed by 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Scalia
				</span>
				 in dissent, is a choice about the best way to deal with an inescapable feature of the body of congressional legislation authorizing administrative action.  That feature is the great variety of ways in which the laws invest the Governments administrative arms with discretion, and with procedures for exercising it, in giving meaning to Acts of Congress.  Implementation of a statute may occur in formal adjudication or the choice to defend against judicial challenge; it may occur in a central board or office or in dozens of enforcement agencies dotted across the country; its institutional lawmaking may be confined to the resolution of minute detail or extend to legislative rulemaking on matters intentionally left by Congress to be worked out at the agency level.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Although we all accept the position that the Judiciary should defer to at least some of this multifarious administrative action, we have to decide how to take account of the great range of its variety.  If the primary objective is 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				to simplify the judicial process of giving or withholding deference, then the diversity of statutes authorizing discretionary administrative action must be declared irrelevant or minimized.  If, on the other hand, it is simply implausible that Congress intended such a broad range of statutory authority to produce only two varieties of administrative action, demanding either 
				<em>
					Chevron
				</em>
				 deference or none at all, then the breadth of the spectrum of possible agency action must be taken into account.  
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Scalia
				</span>
				s first priority over the years has been to limit and simplify.  The Courts choice has been to tailor deference to variety.

				  This acceptance of the range of statutory variation has led the Court to recognize more than one variety of judicial deference, just as the Court has recognized a variety of indicators that Congress would expect

				Our respective choices are repeated today.  
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Scalia
				</span>
				 would pose the question of deference as an either-or choice.  On his view that 
				<em>

				</em>
				 anachronistic, when courts owe any deference it is 
				<em>
					Chevron
				</em>
				 deference that they owe,

				</em>
				 at 910.  Whether courts do owe deference in a given case turns, for him, on whether the agency action (if reasonable) is authoritative, 
				<em>
					post,
				</em>
				 at 17.  The character of the authoritative derives, in turn, not from breadth of delegation or the agencys procedure in implementing it, but is defined as the official position of an agency, 
				<em>
					ibid.,
				</em>
				 and may ultimately be a function of administrative persistence alone, 
				<em>
					ibid
				</em>
				.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court, on the other hand, said nothing in 
				<em>
					Chevron
				</em>
				 to eliminate 
				<em>
					Skidmore
				</em>
				s recognition of various justifications for deference depending on statutory circumstances and agency action; 
				<em>
					Chevron
				</em>
				 was simply a case recognizing that even without express authority to fill a specific statutory gap, circumstances pointing to implicit congressional delegation present a particularly insistent call for deference.  Indeed, in holding here that 
				<em>
					Chevron
				</em>
				 left 
				<em>
					Skidmore
				</em>
				 intact and applicable where statutory circumstances indicate no intent to delegate general authority to make rules with force of law, or where such authority was not invoked, we hold nothing more than we said last Term in response to the particular statutory circumstances in 
				<em>
					Christensen
				</em>
				, to which 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Scalia

				 then took exception, see 529 U. S., at 589, just as he does again today.

				We think, in sum, that 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Scalia
				</span>
				s efforts to simplify ultimately run afoul of Congresss indications that different statutes present different reasons for considering respect for the exercise of administrative authority or deference to it.  Without being at odds with congressional intent much of the time, we believe that judicial responses to administrative action must continue to differentiate between 
				<em>
					Chevron
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Skidmore,
				</em>
				 and that continued recognition of 
				<em>
					Skidmore
				</em>
				 is necessary for just the reasons Justice Jackson gave when that case was decided.

						 It is, of course, true that the limit of Chevron deference is not marked by a hard-edged rule.  But Chevron itself is a good example showing when Chevron deference is warranted, while this is a good case showing when it is not.  Judges in other, perhaps harder, cases will make reasoned choices between the two examples,  the way courts have always done.

						 Surely Justice Jacksons practical criteria, along with Chevrons concern with congressional understanding, provide more reliable guideposts than conclusory references to the authoritative or official.  Even if those terms provided a true criterion, there would have to be something wrong with a standard that accorded the status of substantive law to every one of 10,000 official customs classifications rulings turned out each year from over 46 offices placed around the country at the Nations entryways.  Justice Scalia tries to avoid that result by limiting what is authoritative or official to a pronouncement that expresses the judgment of central agency management, approved at the highest level, as distinct from the pronouncements of underlings, post, at 22, n. 5.  But that analysis would not entitle a Headquarters ruling to Chevron deference; the highest level at Customs is the source of the regulation at issue in Haggar, the Commissioner of Customs with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury.   526 U. S., at 386.  The Commissioner did not issue the Headquarters ruling.  What Justice Scalia has in mind here is that because the Secretary approved the Governments position in its brief to this Court, Chevron deference is due.  But if that is so, Chevron deference was not called for until sometime after the litigation began, when central management at the highest level decided to defend the ruling, and the deference is not to the classification ruling as such but to the brief.  This explains why the Court has not accepted Justice Scalias position.

				Respondent, the Mead Corporation, imports day planners, three-ring binders with pages having room for notes of daily schedules and phone numbers and addresses, together with a calendar and suchlike.  The tariff schedule on point falls under the HTSUS heading for [r]egisters, account books, notebooks, order books, receipt books, letter pads, memorandum pads, diaries and similar articles, HTSUS subheading 4820.10, which comprises two subcategories.  Items in the first, [d]iaries, notebooks and address books, bound; memorandum pads, letter pads and similar articles, were subject to a tariff of 4.0% at the time in controversy.  185 F. 3d 1304, 1305 (CA Fed. 1999) (citing subheading 4820.10.20); see also App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a.  Objects in the second, covering [o]ther items, were free of duty.  HTSUS subheading 4820.10.40; see also App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Between 1989 and 1993, Customs repeatedly treated day planners under the other HTSUS subheading.  In January 1993, however, Customs changed its position, and issued a Headquarters ruling letter classifying Meads day planners as Diaries …, bound subject to tariff under subheading 4820.10.20.  That letter was short on explanation, App. to Brief in Opposition 4a6a, but after Meads protest, Customs Headquarters issued a new letter, carefully reasoned but never published, reaching the same conclusion, App. to Pet. for Cert. 28a47a.  This letter considered two definitions of diary from the Oxford English Dictionary, the first covering a daily journal of the past days events, the second a book including  printed dates for daily memoranda and jottings; also … calendars … .   
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 33a34a (quoting Oxford English Dictionary 321 (Compact ed. 1982)).  Customs concluded that diary was not confined to the first, in part because the broader definition reflects commercial usage and hence the commercial identity of these items in the marketplace.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 34a.  As for the definition of bound, Customs concluded that HTSUS was not referring to bookbinding, but to a less exact sort of fastening described in the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System Explanatory Notes to Heading 4820, which spoke of binding by  reinforcements or fittings of metal, plastics, etc.   
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 45a.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Customs rejected Meads further protest of the second Headquarters ruling letter, and Mead filed suit in the Court of International Trade (CIT).  The CIT granted the Governments motion for summary judgment, adopting Customss reasoning without saying anything about deference.  17 F. Supp. 2d 1004 (1998).

				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/526/380" class="subref" title="subref">526 U. S. 380</a> (1999)

				<em>

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Federal Circuit, however, reversed the CIT and held that Customs classification rulings should not get 
				<em>
					Chevron
				</em>
				 deference, owing to differences from the regulations at issue in 
				<em>
					Haggar
				</em>
				.
				<em>

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/5/553.html" class="subref" title="subref">5 U. S.

The appeals court thought classification rulings had a weaker 
				<em>
					Chevron
				</em>
				 claim even than Internal Revenue Service interpretive rulings, to which that court gives no deference; unlike rulings by the IRS, Customs rulings issue from many locations and need not be published.  185 F. 3d, at 13071308.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court of Appeals accordingly gave no deference at all to the ruling classifying the Mead day planners and rejected the agencys reasoning as to both diary and bound.  It thought that planners were not diaries because they had no space for relatively extensive notations about events, observations, feelings, or thoughts in the past.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 1310.  And it concluded that diaries bound in subheading 4810.10.20 presupposed unbound diaries, such that treating ring-fastened diaries as bound would leave the unbound diary an empty category.

				 deference owed to administrative practice in applying a statute.  We hold that administrative implementation of a particular statutory provision qualifies for

Delegation of such authority may be shown in a variety of ways, as by an agencys power to engage in adjudication or notice-and-comment rulemaking, or by some other indication of a comparable congressional intent.  The Customs ruling at issue here fails to qualify, although the possibility that it deserves some deference under

				Since 1984, we have identified a
				 
				category of interpretive choices distinguished by an additional reason for judicial deference.  This Court in 
				<em>
					Chevron
				</em>
				 recognized that Congress not only engages in express delegation of specific interpretive authority, but that [s]ometimes the legislative delegation to an agency on a particular question is implicit.  467 U. S., at 844.  Congress, that is, may not have expressly delegated authority or responsibility to implement a particular provision or fill a particular gap.  Yet it can still be apparent from the agencys generally conferred authority and other statutory circumstances that Congress would expect the agency to be able to speak with the force of law when it addresses ambiguity in the statute or fills a space in the enacted law, even one about which Congress did not actually have an intent as to a particular result.

				  It is true as well that Congress had classification rulings in mind when it explicitly authorized, in a parenthetical, the issuance of regulations establishing procedures for the issuance of binding rulings prior to the entry of the merchandise concerned,

				  The reference to binding classifications does not, however, bespeak the legislative type of activity that would naturally bind more than the parties to the ruling, once the goods classified are admitted into this country.  And though the statutes direction to disseminate information necessary to secure uniformity, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/19/1502.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">19 U. S. C. §1502(a)</a>, seems to assume that a ruling may be precedent in later transactions, precedential value alone does not add up to 
				<em>
					Chevron
				</em>
				 entitlement; interpretive rules may sometimes function as precedents, see Strauss, The Rulemaking Continuum, 41 Duke L. J. 1463, 14721473 (1992), and they enjoy no 
				<em>
					Chevron
				</em>
				 status as a class.  In any event, any precedential claim of a classification ruling is counterbalanced by the provision for independent review of Customs classifications by the CIT, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2638-264.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S.

It is hard to imagine a congressional understanding more at odds with the

				It is difficult, in fact, to see in the agency practice itself any indication that Customs ever set out with a lawmaking pretense in mind when it undertook to make classifications like these.  Customs does not generally engage in notice-and-comment practice when issuing them, and their treatment by the agency makes it clear that a letters binding character as a ruling stops short of third parties; Customs has regarded a classification as conclusive only as between itself and the importer to whom it was issued, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/19/177" class="subref" title="subref">19 CFR §177.9</a>(c) (2000), and even then only until Customs has given advance notice of intended change, §§177.9(a), (c).  Other importers are in fact warned against assuming any right of detrimental reliance.  §177.9(c).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Indeed, to claim that classifications have legal force is to ignore the reality that 46 different Customs offices issue 10,000 to 15,000 of them each year, see Brief for Respondent 5; CITBA Brief 6 (citing Treasury Advisory Committee on the Commercial Operations of the United States Customs Service, Report of the COAC Subcommittee on OR&amp;R, Exhibits 1, 3 (Jan. 26, 2000) (reprinted in App. to CITBA Brief 20a21a)).  Any suggestion that rulings intended to have the force of law are being churned out at a rate of 10,000 a year at an agencys 46 scattered offices is simply self-refuting.  Although the circumstances are less startling here, with a Headquarters letter in issue, none of the relevant statutes recognizes this category of rulings as separate or different from others; there is thus no indication that a more potent delegation might have been understood as going to Headquarters even when Headquarters provides developed reasoning, as it did in this instance.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Nor do the amendments to the statute made effective after this case arose disturb our conclusion.  The new law requires Customs to provide notice-and-comment procedures only when modifying or revoking a prior classification ruling or modifying the treatment accorded to substantially identical transactions, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/19/1625.html#c" class="subref" title="subref">19 U. S. C. §1625(c)</a>; and under its regulations, Customs sees itself obliged to provide notice-and-comment procedures only when changing a practice so as to produce a tariff increase, or in the imposition of a restriction or prohibition, or when Customs Headquarters determines that the matter is of sufficient importance to involve the interests of domestic industry, 19 CFR §§177.10(c)(1)(2) (2000).  The statutory changes reveal no new congressional objective of treating classification decisions generally as rulemaking with force of law, nor do they suggest any intent to create a 
				<em>
					Chevron
				</em>
				 patchwork of classification rulings, some with force of law, some without.

That feature is the great variety of ways in which the laws invest the Governments administrative arms with discretion, and with procedures for exercising it, in giving meaning to Acts of Congress.  Implementation of a statute may occur in formal adjudication or the choice to defend against judicial challenge; it may occur in a central board or office or in dozens of enforcement agencies dotted across the country; its institutional lawmaking may be confined to the resolution of minute detail or extend to legislative rulemaking on matters intentionally left by Congress to be worked out at the agency level.

				Although we all accept the position that the Judiciary should defer to at least some of this multifarious administrative action, we have to decide how to take account of the great range of its variety.  If the primary objective is 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				to simplify the judicial process of giving or withholding deference, then the diversity of statutes authorizing discretionary administrative action must be declared irrelevant or minimized.  If, on the other hand, it is simply implausible that Congress intended such a broad range of statutory authority to produce only two varieties of administrative action, demanding either

				 deference or none at all, then the breadth of the spectrum of possible agency action must be taken into account.

						 It is, of course, true that the limit of Chevron deference is not marked by a hard-edged rule.  But Chevron itself is a good example showing when Chevron deference is warranted, while this is a good case showing when it is not.  Judges in other, perhaps harder, cases will make reasoned choices between the two examples,  the way courts have always done.

						 Surely Justice Jacksons practical criteria, along with Chevrons concern with congressional understanding, provide more reliable guideposts than conclusory references to the authoritative or official.  Even if those terms provided a true criterion, there would have to be something wrong with a standard that accorded the status of substantive law to every one of 10,000 official customs classifications rulings turned out each year from over 46 offices placed around the country at the Nations entryways.  Justice Scalia tries to avoid that result by limiting what is authoritative or official to a pronouncement that expresses the judgment of central agency management, approved at the highest level, as distinct from the pronouncements of underlings, post, at 22, n. 5.  But that analysis would not entitle a Headquarters ruling to Chevron deference; the highest level at Customs is the source of the regulation at issue in Haggar, the Commissioner of Customs with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury.   526 U. S., at 386.  The Commissioner did not issue the Headquarters ruling.  What Justice Scalia has in mind here is that because the Secretary approved the Governments position in its brief to this Court, Chevron deference is due.  But if that is so, Chevron deference was not called for until sometime after the litigation began, when central management at the highest level decided to defend the ruling, and the deference is not to the classification ruling as such but to the brief.  This explains why the Court has not accepted Justice Scalias position.

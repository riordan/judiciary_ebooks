				After Officer Fox began to investigate respondents apparent violation of a temporary restraining order, a federal agent told Foxs colleague, Detective Benner, that respondent, a convicted felon, illegally possessed a pistol.  Officer Fox and Detective Benner proceeded to respondents home, where Fox arrested him for violating the restraining order.

The District Court granted his motion to suppress the pistol, reasoning that the officers lacked probable cause to arrest him, and declining to rule on his alternative argument that the gun should be suppressed as the fruit of an unwarned statement.  The Tenth Circuit reversed the probable-cause ruling, but affirmed the suppression order on respondents alternative theory.  Rejecting the Governments argument that

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				(a) The 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 rule is a prophylactic employed to protect against violations of the Self-Incrimination Clause, U. S Const., Amdt. 5.  That Clauses core protection is a prohibition on compelling a criminal defendant to testify against himself at trial.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Chavez
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Martinez,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/538/760" class="subref" title="subref">538 U. S. 760</a>.   It cannot be violated by the introduction of nontestimonial evidence obtained as a result of voluntary statements.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v.  
				<em>
					Hubbell, 
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/530/27" class="subref" title="subref">530 U. S. 27</a>.  The Court has recognized and applied several prophylactic rules designed to protect the core privilege against self-incrimination.  For example, the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 rule creates a presumption of coercion in custodial interrogations, in the absence of specific warnings, that is generally irrebuttable for purposes of the prosecutions case in chief.  
				<em>
					E.g.,
				</em>
				 384 U. S., at 467.  But because such prophylactic rules necessarily sweep beyond the Self-Incrimination Clauses actual protections, see, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Withrow
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Williams,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/507/680" class="subref" title="subref">507 U. S. 680</a>, any further extension of one of them must be justified by its necessity for the protection of the actual right against compelled self-incrimination, 
				<em>
					e.g., Chavez, supra, 
				</em>
				at 778.  Thus, uncompelled statements taken without 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings can be used to impeach a defendants testimony at trial, see 
				<em>
					Elstad
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 307308, though the fruits of actually compelled testimony cannot, see 
				<em>
					New Jersey
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Portash,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/440/450" class="subref" title="subref">440 U. S. 450</a>.  A blanket rule requiring suppression of statements noncompliant with the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 rule could not be justified by reference to the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> goal of assuring trustworthy evidence or by any deterrence rationale, 
				<em>
					e.g., Elstad
				</em>
				, 470 U. S., at 308, and would therefore fail the Courts requirement that the closest possible fit be maintained between the Self-Incrimination Clause and any rule designed to protect it.  Furthermore, the Clause contains its own exclusionary rule that automatically protects those subjected to coercive police interrogations from the use of their involuntary statements (or evidence derived from their statements) in any subsequent criminal trial.  
				<em>
					E.g., id., 
				</em>
				at 307308.  This explicit textual protection supports a strong presumption against expanding the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 rule any further.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Graham
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Connor,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/490/386" class="subref" title="subref">490 U. S. 386</a>.  Finally, nothing in 
				<em>
					Dickerson 
				</em>
				calls into question the Courts continued insistence on its close-fit requirement.  Pp. 58.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				(b) That a mere failure to give 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings does not, by itself, violate a suspects constitutional rights or even the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 rule was evident in many of the Courts pre-
				<em>
					Dickerson
				</em>
				 cases, see, 
				<em>
					e.g., Elstad
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 308, and the Court has adhered to that view since 
				<em>
					Dickerson, 
				</em>
				see
				<em>
					 Chavez, supra, at 
				</em>
				772773.    This follows from the nature of the fundamental 
				<em>
					trial
				</em>
				 right protected by the Self-Incrimination Clause, 
				<em>
					e.g., Withrow, supra
				</em>
				, at 691, which the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 rule, in turn, protects.  Thus, the police do not violate a suspects constitutional rights (or the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 rule) by negligent or even deliberate failures to provide full 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings.  Potential violations occur, if at all, only upon the admission of unwarned statements into evidence.  And, at that point, the exclusion of such statements is a complete and sufficient remedy for any perceived 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 violation.  
				<em>
					Chavez, supra
				</em>
				, at 790.  Unlike actual violations of the Self-Incrimination Clause, there is, with respect to mere failures to warn, nothing to deter and therefore no reason to apply 
				<em>
					Wong Sun
				</em>
				s fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine.  It is not for this Court to impose its preferred police practices on either federal or state officials.  Pp. 810.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				(c) The Tenth Circuit erred in ruling that the taking of unwarned statements violates a suspects constitutional rights.  
				<em>
					Dickerson
				</em>
				s characterization of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 as a constitutional rule does not lessen the need to maintain the close-fit requirement.  There is no such fit here.  Introduction of the nontestimonial fruit of a voluntary statement, such as respondents pistol, does not implicate the Clause.  It presents no risk that a defendants coerced statements (however defined) will be used against him at a criminal trial.  In any case, the exclusion of unwarned statements is a complete and sufficient remedy for any perceived 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 violation.  
				<em>
					E.g., Chavez, supra
				</em>
				, at 790.  Similarly, because police cannot violate the Clause by taking unwarned though voluntary statements, an exclusionary rule cannot be justified by reference to a deterrence effect on law enforcement, as the court below believed.  The word witness in the constitutional text limits the Self-Incrimination Clauses scope to testimonial evidence.  
				<em>
					Hubbell, supra, 
				</em>
				at 3435.  And although the Court requires the exclusion of the physical fruit of actually coerced statements, statements taken without sufficient 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings are presumed to have been coerced only for certain purposes and then only when necessary to protect the privilege against self-incrimination.  This Court declines to extend that presumption further.  Pp. 1012.

            <span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Kennedy
				</span>
				, joined by 
				<span class="smallcaps">

				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings should be characterized as a violation of the 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				rule itself, or whether there is anything to deter so long as the unwarned statements are not later introduced at trial.  In 
				<em>
					Oregon
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>

				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/470/298" class="subref" title="subref">470 U. S. 298</a>,

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/401/222" class="subref" title="subref">401 U. S. 222</a>, evidence obtained following unwarned interrogations was held admissible based in large part on the Courts recognition that the concerns underlying the 
				<em>

				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Arizona, 
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/384/436" class="subref" title="subref">384 U. S. 436</a>, rule must be accommodated to other objectives of the criminal justice system.  Here, it is sufficient to note that the Government presents an even stronger case for admitting the evidence obtained as the result of Patanes unwarned statement than was presented in 
				<em>
					Elstad
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Michigan 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>

				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/417/433" class="subref" title="subref">417 U. S. 433</a>.  Admission of nontestimonial physical fruits (the pistol here) does not run the risk of admitting into trial an accuseds coerced incriminating statements against himself.  In light of reliable physical evidences important probative value, it is doubtful that exclusion can be justified by a deterrence rationale sensitive to both law enforcement interests and a suspects rights during an in-custody interrogation.

				The majority repeatedly says that the

				 rested on insight into the inherently coercive character of custodial interrogation and the inherently difficult exercise of assessing the voluntariness of any confession resulting from it.  Unless the police give the prescribed warnings meant to counter the coercive atmosphere, a custodial confession is inadmissible, there being no need for the previous time-consuming and difficult enquiry into voluntariness.  That inducement to forestall involuntary statements and troublesome issues of fact can only atrophy if we turn around and recognize an evidentiary benefit when an unwarned statement leads investigators to tangible evidence.  There is, of course, a price for excluding evidence, but the

				The majority repeatedly says that the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> does not address the admissibility of nontestimonial evidence, an overstatement that is beside the point.  The issue actually presented today is whether courts should apply the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine lest we create an incentive for the police to omit 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings, see 
				<em>
					Miranda

				 rested on insight into the inherently coercive character of custodial interrogation and the inherently difficult exercise of assessing the voluntariness of any confession resulting from it.  Unless the police give the prescribed warnings meant to counter the coercive atmosphere, a custodial confession is inadmissible, there being no need for the previous time-consuming and difficult enquiry into voluntariness.  That inducement to forestall involuntary statements and troublesome issues of fact can only atrophy if we turn around and recognize an evidentiary benefit when an unwarned statement leads investigators to tangible evidence.  There is, of course, a price for excluding evidence, but the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> is worth a price, and in the absence of a very good reason, the logic of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 should be followed: a 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 violation raises a presumption of coercion,

 (recognizing the

				The fact that the books contain some exceptions to the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 exclusionary rule carries no weight here.  In 
				<em>
					Harris
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					New York
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/401/222" class="subref" title="subref">401 U. S. 222</a> (1971)
, it was respect for the integrity of the judicial process that justified the admission of unwarned statements as impeachment evidence.  But Patanes suppression motion can hardly be described as seeking to pervert 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 into a license to use perjury or otherwise handicap the traditional truth-testing devices of the adversary process.  401 U. S., at 225226.  Nor is there any suggestion that the officers failure to warn Patane was justified or mitigated by a public emergency or other exigent circumstance, as in 
				<em>
					New York
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Quarles
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/467/649" class="subref" title="subref">467 U. S. 649</a> (1984)
.  And of course the premise of 
				<em>
					Oregon
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Elstad
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, is not on point; although a failure to give 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings before one individual statement does not necessarily bar the admission of a subsequent statement given after adequate warnings, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/470/298" class="subref" title="subref">470 U. S. 298</a>; cf. 
				<em>
					Missouri 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					Seibert
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at ___ (slip op., at 1213) (plurality opinion), that rule obviously does not apply to physical evidence seized once and for all.

				There is no way to read this case except as an unjustifiable invitation to law enforcement officers to flout 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 when there may be physical evidence to be gained.  The incentive is an odd one, coming from the Court on the same day it decides 
				<em>

						 In so saying, we are taking the legal issue as it comes to us, even though the facts give off the scent of a made-up case.  If there was a Miranda failure, the most immediate reason was that Patane told the police to stop giving the warnings because he already knew his rights.  There could easily be an analogy in this case to the bumbling mistake the police committed in Oregon v. Elstad, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/470/298" class="subref" title="subref">470 U. S. 298</a> (1985)
.  See Missouri v. Seibert, ante, at ___ (plurality opinion) (slip op., at 1213).

						 To the extent that Michigan v. Tucker, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/417/433" class="subref" title="subref">417 U. S. 433</a> (1974)
 (admitting the testimony of a witness who was discovered because of an unwarned custodial interrogation), created another exception to Miranda, it is off the point here.  In Tucker, we explicitly declined to lay down a broad rule about the fruits of unwarned statements.  Instead, we place[d] our holding on a narrower ground, relying principally on the fact that the interrogation occurred before Miranda was decided and was conducted in good faith according to constitutional standards governing at that time.  417 U. S., at 447448 (citing Escobedo v. Illinois, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/378/478" class="subref" title="subref">378 U. S. 478</a> (1964)

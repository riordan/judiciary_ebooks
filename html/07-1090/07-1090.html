        <hr>
        <p class="bodytext">The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA) prohibits suits against other countries in American courts, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1604.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1604</a>, with certain exceptions.  One exception, §1605(a)(7) (now repealed), stripped a foreign state of immunity in any suit arising from certain acts of terrorism that occurred when the state was designated as a sponsor of terrorism under §6(j) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 or §620A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961.  </p>
        <p class="bodytext">        Iraq was designated as a sponsor of terrorism in 1990, but in 2003, following the American-led invasion of Iraq, Congress enacted the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act (EWSAA), §1503 of which included a proviso clause (the second in a series of eight) authorizing the President to make inapplicable with respect to Iraq [§]620A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 or any other provision of law that applies to countries that have supported terrorism.  Although President Bush exercised that authority, the D. C. Circuit held in its 2004 <em>Acree</em> decision that the EWSAA did not permit the President to waive §1605(a)(7), and thereby restore Iraqs sovereign immunity, for claims arising from actions Iraq took while designated as a sponsor of terrorism.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">        Thereafter, Congress repealed §1605(a)(7) in §1083(b)(1)(A)(iii) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (NDAA) and replaced it with a new, roughly similar exception, §1083(a).  The NDAA also declared that nothing in EWSAA ever authorized, directly or indirectly, the making inapplicable of any provision of [the FSIA] or the removal of the jurisdiction of any court (thus purporting to ratify <em>Acree</em>), §1083(c)(4); and authorized the President to waive any provision of this section with respect to Iraq under certain conditions, §1083(d).  On the same day the President signed the NDAA into law he also waived all of §1083s provisions as to Iraq.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">        Respondents filed these suits against Iraq in early 2003, alleging mistreatment by Iraqi officials during and after the 1991 Gulf War.  Under <em>Acree</em>, the courts below refused to dismiss either case on jurisdictional grounds.  The D. C. Circuit also rejected Iraqs alternative argument that even if §1605(a)(7)s application to it survived the Presidents EWSAA waiver, the provision was repealed by NDAA §1083(b)(1)(A)(iii); and that the President had waived NDAA §1083(a)s <em>new</em> exception with respect to Iraq under his §1083(d) authority.  The court held instead that it retained jurisdiction over cases pending against Iraq when the NDAA was enacted.  </p>
        <p class="SYLCTE">
            <em>Held:</em> Iraq is no longer subject to suit in federal court.  Pp. 617.</p>
        <p class="SYLCTF">    (a) The District Court lost jurisdiction over both suits in May 2003, when the President exercised his EWSAA authority to make §1605(a)(7) inapplicable with respect to Iraq.  Pp. 613.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">        (i) Iraqs (and the United States) reading of EWSAA §1503s second proviso as sweeping in §1605(a)(7)s terrorism exception to foreign sovereign immunity is straightforward.  In the provisos terms, the exception is a provision of law (indisputably) that applies to (strips immunity from) countries that have supported terrorism (as designated pursuant to certain statutory provisions).  Because he exercised his waiver authority with respect to all provisions of law encompassed by the second proviso, his actions made §1605(a)(7) inapplicable to Iraq.  Pp. 67. </p>
        <p class="bodytext">        (ii) <em>Acree</em>s resistance to the above construction was based on a sophisticated attempt to construe EWSAA §1503s second proviso as limiting that sections principal clause, which authorized suspension of any provision of the Iraq Sanctions Act of 1990.  While a provisos general office … is to except something from the enacting clause, or to qualify and restrain its generality, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Morrow</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/266/531" class="subref" title="subref">266 U. S. 531</a>, another recognized use is to introduce independent legislation, <em>id., </em>at 535, which was the function of the proviso here.  In any event, §1605(a)(7) falls within the scope of the proviso even accepting the narrower interpretation adopted by the <em>Acree</em> decision.  Pp. 711. </p>
        <p class="bodytext">        (iii) Respondents other objections to the straightforward interpretation of EWSAA §1503s proviso are rejected.  Pp. 1112. </p>
        <p class="bodytext">        (iv) Nothing in the NDAA changes the above analysis.  Although NDAA §1083(c)(4) appears to ratify <em>Acree</em>, this Court need not decide whether such a ratification is effective because §1083(d)(1) authorized the President to waive any provision of this section with respect to Iraq, and he waived all such provisions, including §1083(c)(4).  Pp. 1213. </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    (b) The Court rejects the argument that §1605(a)(7)s inapplicability does not bar claims arising from Iraqs conduct <em>prior</em> to the Presidents waiver.  In order to exercise jurisdiction over these cases, the District Court had to apply §1605(a)(7) with respect to Iraq, but the Presidents waiver made that provision inapplicable.  No retroactivity problem is posed by this construction, if only because the primary conduct by Iraq that forms the basis for these suits actually occurred before §1605(a)(7)s enactment.  Pp. 1316. </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    (c) Respondents also argue that EWSAA §1503s sunset clauseunder which the authorities contained in [that] section expired in 2005revived §1605(a)(7) and restored jurisdiction as of the sunset date.  But expiration of the §1503 <em>authorities</em> is not the same as cancellation of the <em>effect</em> of the prior valid exercise of those authorities.  Pp. 1617.</p>

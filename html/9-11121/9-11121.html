				Police stopped and questioned petitioner J. D. B., a 13-year-old, seventh-grade student, upon seeing him near the site of two home break-ins.  Five days later, after a digital camera matching one of the stolen items was found at J. D. B.s school and seen in his possession, Investigator DiCostanzo went to the school.  A uniformed police officer on detail to the school took J. D. B. from his classroom to a closed-door conference room, where police and school administrators questioned him for at least 30 minutes.  Before beginning, they did not give him 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings or the opportunity to call his grandmother, his legal guardian, nor tell him he was free to leave the room.  He first denied his involvement, but later confessed after officials urged him to tell the truth and told him about the prospect of juvenile detention.  DiCostanzo only then told him that he could refuse to answer questions and was free to leave.  Asked whether he understood, J. D. B. nodded and provided further detail, including the location of the stolen items.  He also wrote a statement, at DiCostanzos request.  When the school day ended, he was permitted to leave to catch the bus home.  Two juvenile petitions were filed against J. D. B., charging him with breaking and entering and with larceny.  His public defender moved to suppress his statements and the evidence derived therefrom, arguing that J. D. B. had been interrogated in a custodial setting without being afforded 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				warnings and that his statements were involuntary.  The trial court denied the motion.  J. D. B. entered a transcript of admission to the charges, but renewed his objection to the denial of his motion to suppress.  The court adjudicated him delinquent, and the North Carolina Court of Appeals and State Supreme Court affirmed.  The latter court declined to find J. D. B.s age relevant to the determination whether he was in police custody.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/332/596" class="subref" title="subref">332 U. S. 596</a>.  The law has historically reflected the same assumption that children characteristically lack the capacity to exercise mature judgment and possess only an incomplete ability to understand the world around them.  Legal disqualifications on children as a class
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, limitations on their ability to marry without parental consentexhibit the settled understanding that the differentiating characteristics of youth are universal.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Given a history replete with laws and judicial recognition that children cannot be viewed simply as miniature adults, 
				<em>
					Eddings
				</em>
				, 455 U. S., at 115116, there is no justification for taking a different course here.  So long as the childs age was known to the officer at the time of the interview, or would have been objectively apparent to a reasonable officer, including age as part of the custody analysis requires officers neither to consider circumstances unknowable to them, 
				<em>
					Berkemer
				</em>
				, 468 U. S., at 430, nor to  anticipat[e] the frailties or idiosyncrasies of the particular suspect being questioned.    
				<em>
					Alvarado
				</em>
				, 541 U. S., at 662.  Precisely because childhood yields objective conclusions, considering age in the custody analysis does not involve a determination of how youth affects a particular childs subjective state of mind.  In fact, were the court precluded from taking J. D. B.s youth into account, it would be forced to evaluate the circumstances here through the eyes of a reasonable adult, when some objective circumstances surrounding an interrogation at school are specific to children.  These conclusions are not undermined by the Courts observation in 
				<em>
					Alvarado 
				</em>
				that accounting for a juveniles age in the 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				custody analysis could be viewed as creating a subjective inquiry, 541 U. S., at 668.  The Court said nothing about whether such a view would be correct under the law or whether it simply merited deference under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">110</a>Stat.
1214.  So long as the childs age was known to the officer, or would have been objectively apparent to a reasonable officer, including age in the custody analysis is consistent with the 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				tests objective nature.  This does not mean that a childs age will be a determinative, or even a significant, factor in every case, but it is a reality that courts cannot ignore.  Pp. 814.

Seeing no reason for police officers or courts to blind themselves to that commonsense reality, we hold that a childs age properly informs the

				Petitioner J. D. B. was a 13-year-old, seventh-grade student attending class at Smith Middle School in Chapel Hill, North Carolina when he was removed from his classroom by a uniformed police officer, escorted to a closed-door conference room, and questioned by police for at least half an hour.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				This was the second time that police questioned J. D. B. in the span of a week.  Five days earlier, two home break-ins occurred, and various items were stolen.  Police stopped and questioned J. D. B. after he was seen behind a residence in the neighborhood where the crimes occurred.  That same day, police also spoke to J. D. B.s grandmotherhis legal guardianas well as his aunt.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Police later learned that a digital camera matching the description of one of the stolen items had been found at J. D. B.s middle school and seen in J. D. B.s possession. Investigator DiCostanzo, the juvenile investigator with the local police force who had been assigned to the case, went to the school to question J. D. B.  Upon arrival, DiCostanzo informed the uniformed police officer on detail to the school (a so-called school resource officer), the assistant principal, and an administrative intern that he was there to question J. D. B. about the break-ins.  Although DiCostanzo asked the school administrators to verify J. D. B.s date of birth, address, and parent contact in-formation from school records, neither the police offi-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				cers nor the school administrators contacted J. D. B.s grandmother.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The uniformed officer interrupted J. D. B.s afternoon social studies class, removed J. D. B. from the classroom, and escorted him to a school conference room.

				  There, J. D. B. was met by DiCostanzo, the assistant principal, and the administrative intern.  The door to the conference room was closed.  With the two police officers and the two administrators present, J. D. B. was questioned for the next 30 to 45 minutes.  Prior to the commencement of questioning, J. D. B. was given neither 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings nor the opportunity to speak to his grandmother.  Nor was he informed that he was free to leave the room.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Questioning began with small talkdiscussion of sports and J. D. B.s family life.  DiCostanzo asked, and J. D. B. agreed, to discuss the events of the prior weekend.  Denying any wrongdoing, J. D. B. explained that he had been in the neighborhood where the crimes occurred because he was seeking work mowing lawns.  DiCostanzo pressed J. D. B. for additional detail about his efforts to obtain work; asked J. D. B. to explain a prior incident, when one of the victims returned home to find J. D. B. behind her house; and confronted J. D. B. with the stolen camera.  The assistant principal urged J. D. B. to do the right thing, warning J. D. B. that the truth always comes out in the end.  App. 99a, 112a.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Eventually, J. D. B. asked whether he would still be in trouble if he returned the stuff.  
				<em>

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				After learning of the prospect of juvenile detention, J. D. B. confessed that he and a friend were responsible for the break-ins.  DiCostanzo only then informed J. D. B. that he could refuse to answer the investigators questions and that he was free to leave.

				Two juvenile petitions were filed against J. D. B., each alleging one count of breaking and entering and one count of larceny.  J. D. B.s public defender moved to suppress his statements and the evidence derived therefrom, arguing that suppression was necessary because J. D. B. had been interrogated by police in a custodial setting without being afforded

 (due process precludes admission of a confession where a defendants will was overborne by the circumstances of the interrogation).  After a suppression hearing at which DiCostanzo and J. D. B. testified, the trial court denied the motion, deciding that J. D. B. was not in custody at the time of the schoolhouse interrogation and that his statements were voluntary.  As a result, J. D. B. entered a transcript of admission to all four counts, renewing his objection to the denial of his motion to suppress, and the court adjudicated J. D. B. delinquent.

				Our various statements to this effect are far from unique.  The law has historically reflected the same assumption that children characteristically lack the capacity to exercise mature judgment and possess only an incomplete ability to understand the world around them.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England *464*465 (hereinafter Blackstone) (explaining that limits on childrens legal capacity under the common law secure them from hurting themselves by their own improvident acts).  Like this Courts own generalizations, the legal disqualifications placed on children as a class
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, limitations on their ability to alienate property, enter a binding contract enforceable against them, and marry without parental consentexhibit the settled understanding that the differentiating characteristics of youth are universal.

				Indeed, even where a reasonable person standard otherwise applies, the common law has reflected the reality that children are not adults.  In negligence suits, for instance, where liability turns on what an objectively reasonable person would do in the circumstances, [a]ll American jurisdictions accept the idea that a persons childhood is a relevant circumstance to be considered.

				As this discussion establishes, [o]ur history is replete with laws and judicial recognition that children cannot be viewed simply as miniature adults.  
				<em>
					Eddings
				</em>
				, 455 U. S., at 115116.  We see no justification for taking a different course here.  So long as the childs age was known to the officer at the time of the interview, or would have been objectively apparent to any reasonable officer, including age as part of the custody analysis requires officers neither to consider circumstances unknowable to them, 
				<em>
					Berkemer
				</em>
				, 468 U. S., at 430, nor to anticipat[e] the frailties or idiosyncrasies of the particular suspect whom they question, 
				<em>
					Alvarado
				</em>
				, 541 U. S., at 662 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The same wide basis of community experience that makes it possible, as an objective matter, to determine what is to be expected of children in other contexts, Restatement (Second) of Torts §283A, at 15; see 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 10, and n. 6, likewise makes it possible to know what to expect of children subjected to police questioning.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In other words, a childs age differs from other personal characteristics that, even when known to police, have no objectively discernible relationship to a reasonable persons understanding of his freedom of action.  
				<em>
					Alvarado
				</em>
				, holds, for instance, that a suspects prior interrogation history with law enforcement has no role to play in the custody analysis because such experience could just as easily lead a reasonable person to feel free to walk away as to feel compelled to stay in place.  541 U. S., at 668.  Because the effect in any given case would be contingent [on the] psycholog[y] of the individual suspect, the Court explained, such experience cannot be considered without compromising the objective nature of the custody analysis.  
				<em>
					Ibid.  
				</em>
				A childs age, however, is different.  Precisely because childhood yields objective conclusions like those we have drawn ourselvesamong others, that children are most susceptible to influence,

					Eddings
				</em>
				, 455 U. S., at 115, and outside pressures, 
				<em>

				In fact, in many cases involving juvenile suspects, the custody analysis would be nonsensical absent some consideration of the suspects age.  This case is a prime example.  Were the court precluded from taking J. D. B.s youth into account, it would be forced to evaluate the circumstances present here through the eyes of a reasonable person of average years.  In other words, how would a reasonable adult understand his situation, after being removed from a seventh-grade social studies class by a uniformed school resource officer; being encouraged by his assistant principal to do the right thing; and being warned by a police investigator of the prospect of juvenile detention and separation from his guardian and primary caretaker?  To describe such an inquiry is to demonstrate its absurdity.  Neither officers nor courts can reasonably evaluate the effect of objective circumstances that, by their nature, are specific to children without accounting for the age of the child subjected to those circumstances.

				Indeed, although the dissent suggests that concerns regarding the application of the 
				<em>
					Miranda

				custody rule to minors can be accommodated by considering the unique circumstances present when minors are questioned in school, 
				<em>
					post

A studentwhose presence at school is compulsory and whose disobedience at school is cause for disciplinary actionis in a far different position than, say, a parent volunteer on school grounds to chaperone an event, or an adult from the community on school grounds to attend a basketball game.  Without asking whether the person questioned in school is a minor,

				Our prior decision in

				In the same vein, the State and its

				Relying on our statements that the objective custody test is designed to give clear guidance to the police, 
				<em>
					Alvarado
				</em>
				, 541 U. S., at 668, the State next argues that a childs age must be excluded from the analysis in order to preserve clarity.  Similarly, the dissent insists that the clarity of the custody analysis will be destroyed unless a one-size-fits-all reasonable-person test applies.

				, at 13.  In reality, however, ignoring a juvenile defendants age will often make the inquiry more artificial, see 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				at 1213, and thus only add confusion.  And in any event, a childs age, when known or apparent, is hardly an obscure factor to assess.  Though the State and the dissent worry about gradations among children of different ages, that concern cannot justify ignoring a childs age altogether.  Just as police officers are competent to account for other objective circumstances that are a matter of degree such as the length of questioning or the number of officers present, so too are they competent to evaluate the effect of relative age.  Indeed, they are competent to do so even though an interrogation room lacks the reflective atmosphere of a [jury] deliberation room, 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, at 15.  The same is true of judges, including those whose childhoods have long since passed, see 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, at 14.  In short, officers and judges need no imaginative powers, knowledge of developmental psychology, training in cognitive science, or expertise in social and cultural anthropology to account for a childs age.  They simply need the common sense to know that a 7-year-old is not a 13-year-old and neither is an adult.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				There is, however, an even more fundamental flaw with the States plea for clarity and the dissents singular focus on simplifying the analysis: Not once have we excluded from the custody analysis a circumstance that we determined was relevant and objective, simply to make the fault line between custodial and noncustodial brighter.  Indeed, were the guiding concern clarity and nothing else, the custody test would presumably ask only whether the suspect had been placed under formal arrest.

				, 468 U. S., at 441; see

				<span class="softbreak"></span>

				Finally, the State and the dissent suggest that excluding age from the custody analysis comes at no cost to juveniles constitutional rights because the due process voluntariness test independently accounts for a childs youth.  To be sure, that test permits consideration of a childs age, and it erects its own barrier to admission of a defendants inculpatory statements at trial.  See 
				<em>

				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, at 1718 ([C]ourts should be instructed to take particular care to ensure that [young childrens] incriminating statements were not obtained involuntarily).  But 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s procedural safeguards exist precisely because the voluntariness test is an inadequate barrier when custodial interrogation is at stake.  See 384 U. S., at 458 (Unless adequate protective devices are employed to dispel the compulsion inherent in custodial surroundings, no statement obtained from the defendant can truly be the product of his free choice); 
				<em>

				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 56.  To hold, as the State requests, that a childs age is never relevant to whether a suspect has been taken into custodyand thus to ignore the very real differences between children and adultswould be to deny children the full scope of the procedural safeguards that 
				<em>
					Miranda

				 guarantees to adults.

						 The North Carolina Supreme Court noted that the trial courts factual findings were uncontested and therefore . . . binding on it.  In re J. D. B., 363 N. C. 664, 668, 686 S. E. 2d 135, 137 (2009).  The court described the sequence of events set forth in the text.  See id., at 670671, 686 S. E. 2d, at 139. (Immediately following J. D. B.s initial confession, Investigator DiCostanzo informed J. D. B. that he did not have to speak with him and that he was free to leave (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted)).  Though less than perfectly explicit, the trial courts order indicates a finding that J. D. B. initially confessed prior to DiCostanzos warnings.  See App. 99a.


Nonetheless, both parties submissions to this Court suggest thatthe warnings came after DiCostanzo raised the possibility of a secure custody order but before J. D. B. confessed for the first time.  See Brief for Petitioner 5; Brief for Respondent 5.  Because we remand for a determination whether J. D. B. was in custody under the proper analysis, the state courts remain free to revisit whether the trial court made a conclusive finding of fact in this respect.

Rather than overtur[n] that settled principle, post, at 13, the limitation that a childs age may inform the custody analysis only when known or knowable simply reflects our  unwillingness to require officers to make guesses as to circumstances unknowable to them in deciding when to give Miranda warnings, Berkemer, 468 U.

						 Contrary to the dissents intimation, see post, at 8, Miranda does not answer the question whether a childs age is an objective circumstance relevant to the custody analysis.  Miranda simply holds that warnings must be given once a suspect is in custody, without paus[ing] to inquire in individual cases whether the defendant was aware of his rights without a warning being given.  384 U. S., at 468; see also id., at 468469 (Assessments of the knowledge the defendant possessed, based on information as to age, education, intelligence, or prior contact with authorities, can never be more than speculation; a warning is a clearcut fact (footnote omitted)).  That conclusion says nothing about whether age properly informs whether a child is in custody in the first place.

				Petitioner J. D. B. was a 13-year-old, seventh-grade student attending class at Smith Middle School in Chapel Hill, North Carolina when he was removed from his classroom by a uniformed police officer, escorted to a closed-door conference room, and questioned by police for at least half an hour.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				This was the second time that police questioned J. D. B. in the span of a week.  Five days earlier, two home break-ins occurred, and various items were stolen.  Police stopped and questioned J. D. B. after he was seen behind a residence in the neighborhood where the crimes occurred.  That same day, police also spoke to J. D. B.s grandmotherhis legal guardianas well as his aunt.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Police later learned that a digital camera matching the description of one of the stolen items had been found at J. D. B.s middle school and seen in J. D. B.s possession. Investigator DiCostanzo, the juvenile investigator with the local police force who had been assigned to the case, went to the school to question J. D. B.  Upon arrival, DiCostanzo informed the uniformed police officer on detail to the school (a so-called school resource officer), the assistant principal, and an administrative intern that he was there to question J. D. B. about the break-ins.  Although DiCostanzo asked the school administrators to verify J. D. B.s date of birth, address, and parent contact in-formation from school records, neither the police offi-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>

				  There, J. D. B. was met by DiCostanzo, the assistant principal, and the administrative intern.  The door to the conference room was closed.  With the two police officers and the two administrators present, J. D. B. was questioned for the next 30 to 45 minutes.  Prior to the commencement of questioning, J. D. B. was given neither

				Questioning began with small talkdiscussion of sports and J. D. B.s family life.  DiCostanzo asked, and J. D. B. agreed, to discuss the events of the prior weekend.  Denying any wrongdoing, J. D. B. explained that he had been in the neighborhood where the crimes occurred because he was seeking work mowing lawns.  DiCostanzo pressed J. D. B. for additional detail about his efforts to obtain work; asked J. D. B. to explain a prior incident, when one of the victims returned home to find J. D. B. behind her house; and confronted J. D. B. with the stolen camera.  The assistant principal urged J. D. B. to do the right thing, warning J. D. B. that the truth always comes out in the end.  App. 99a, 112a.

 (due process precludes admission of a confession where a defendants will was overborne by the circumstances of the interrogation).  After a suppression hearing at which DiCostanzo and J. D. B. testified, the trial court denied the motion, deciding that J. D. B. was not in custody at the time of the schoolhouse interrogation and that his statements were voluntary.  As a result, J. D. B. entered a transcript of admission to all four counts, renewing his objection to the denial of his motion to suppress, and the court adjudicated J. D. B. delinquent.

				Our various statements to this effect are far from unique.  The law has historically reflected the same assumption that children characteristically lack the capacity to exercise mature judgment and possess only an incomplete ability to understand the world around them.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England *464*465 (hereinafter Blackstone) (explaining that limits on childrens legal capacity under the common law secure them from hurting themselves by their own improvident acts).  Like this Courts own generalizations, the legal disqualifications placed on children as a class
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, limitations on their ability to alienate property, enter a binding contract enforceable against them, and marry without parental consentexhibit the settled understanding that the differentiating characteristics of youth are universal.

				Indeed, even where a reasonable person standard otherwise applies, the common law has reflected the reality that children are not adults.  In negligence suits, for instance, where liability turns on what an objectively reasonable person would do in the circumstances, [a]ll American jurisdictions accept the idea that a persons childhood is a relevant circumstance to be considered.

				As this discussion establishes, [o]ur history is replete with laws and judicial recognition that children cannot be viewed simply as miniature adults.  
				<em>
					Eddings
				</em>
				, 455 U. S., at 115116.  We see no justification for taking a different course here.  So long as the childs age was known to the officer at the time of the interview, or would have been objectively apparent to any reasonable officer, including age as part of the custody analysis requires officers neither to consider circumstances unknowable to them, 
				<em>
					Berkemer
				</em>
				, 468 U. S., at 430, nor to anticipat[e] the frailties or idiosyncrasies of the particular suspect whom they question, 
				<em>
					Alvarado
				</em>
				, 541 U. S., at 662 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The same wide basis of community experience that makes it possible, as an objective matter, to determine what is to be expected of children in other contexts, Restatement (Second) of Torts §283A, at 15; see 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 10, and n. 6, likewise makes it possible to know what to expect of children subjected to police questioning.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In other words, a childs age differs from other personal characteristics that, even when known to police, have no objectively discernible relationship to a reasonable persons understanding of his freedom of action.  
				<em>
					Alvarado
				</em>
				, holds, for instance, that a suspects prior interrogation history with law enforcement has no role to play in the custody analysis because such experience could just as easily lead a reasonable person to feel free to walk away as to feel compelled to stay in place.  541 U. S., at 668.  Because the effect in any given case would be contingent [on the] psycholog[y] of the individual suspect, the Court explained, such experience cannot be considered without compromising the objective nature of the custody analysis.  
				<em>
					Ibid.  
				</em>
				A childs age, however, is different.  Precisely because childhood yields objective conclusions like those we have drawn ourselvesamong others, that children are most susceptible to influence,

				</em>
				, 455 U. S., at 115, and outside pressures,

				In fact, in many cases involving juvenile suspects, the custody analysis would be nonsensical absent some consideration of the suspects age.  This case is a prime example.  Were the court precluded from taking J. D. B.s youth into account, it would be forced to evaluate the circumstances present here through the eyes of a reasonable person of average years.  In other words, how would a reasonable adult understand his situation, after being removed from a seventh-grade social studies class by a uniformed school resource officer; being encouraged by his assistant principal to do the right thing; and being warned by a police investigator of the prospect of juvenile detention and separation from his guardian and primary caretaker?  To describe such an inquiry is to demonstrate its absurdity.  Neither officers nor courts can reasonably evaluate the effect of objective circumstances that, by their nature, are specific to children without accounting for the age of the child subjected to those circumstances.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Indeed, although the dissent suggests that concerns regarding the application of the 
				<em>
					Miranda

				custody rule to minors can be accommodated by considering the unique circumstances present when minors are questioned in school, 
				<em>
					post

A studentwhose presence at school is compulsory and whose disobedience at school is cause for disciplinary actionis in a far different position than, say, a parent volunteer on school grounds to chaperone an event, or an adult from the community on school grounds to attend a basketball game.  Without asking whether the person questioned in school is a minor,

				Our prior decision in

				In the same vein, the State and its

				Relying on our statements that the objective custody test is designed to give clear guidance to the police, 
				<em>
					Alvarado
				</em>
				, 541 U. S., at 668, the State next argues that a childs age must be excluded from the analysis in order to preserve clarity.  Similarly, the dissent insists that the clarity of the custody analysis will be destroyed unless a one-size-fits-all reasonable-person test applies.

				, at 13.  In reality, however, ignoring a juvenile defendants age will often make the inquiry more artificial, see 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				at 1213, and thus only add confusion.  And in any event, a childs age, when known or apparent, is hardly an obscure factor to assess.  Though the State and the dissent worry about gradations among children of different ages, that concern cannot justify ignoring a childs age altogether.  Just as police officers are competent to account for other objective circumstances that are a matter of degree such as the length of questioning or the number of officers present, so too are they competent to evaluate the effect of relative age.  Indeed, they are competent to do so even though an interrogation room lacks the reflective atmosphere of a [jury] deliberation room, 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, at 15.  The same is true of judges, including those whose childhoods have long since passed, see 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, at 14.  In short, officers and judges need no imaginative powers, knowledge of developmental psychology, training in cognitive science, or expertise in social and cultural anthropology to account for a childs age.  They simply need the common sense to know that a 7-year-old is not a 13-year-old and neither is an adult.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				There is, however, an even more fundamental flaw with the States plea for clarity and the dissents singular focus on simplifying the analysis: Not once have we excluded from the custody analysis a circumstance that we determined was relevant and objective, simply to make the fault line between custodial and noncustodial brighter.  Indeed, were the guiding concern clarity and nothing else, the custody test would presumably ask only whether the suspect had been placed under formal arrest.

				, 468 U. S., at 441; see

				<span class="softbreak"></span>

				Finally, the State and the dissent suggest that excluding age from the custody analysis comes at no cost to juveniles constitutional rights because the due process voluntariness test independently accounts for a childs youth.  To be sure, that test permits consideration of a childs age, and it erects its own barrier to admission of a defendants inculpatory statements at trial.  See 
				<em>

				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, at 1718 ([C]ourts should be instructed to take particular care to ensure that [young childrens] incriminating statements were not obtained involuntarily).  But 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s procedural safeguards exist precisely because the voluntariness test is an inadequate barrier when custodial interrogation is at stake.  See 384 U. S., at 458 (Unless adequate protective devices are employed to dispel the compulsion inherent in custodial surroundings, no statement obtained from the defendant can truly be the product of his free choice); 
				<em>

				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 56.  To hold, as the State requests, that a childs age is never relevant to whether a suspect has been taken into custodyand thus to ignore the very real differences between children and adultswould be to deny children the full scope of the procedural safeguards that 
				<em>
					Miranda

				 guarantees to adults.

						 The North Carolina Supreme Court noted that the trial courts factual findings were uncontested and therefore . . . binding on it.  In re J. D. B., 363 N. C. 664, 668, 686 S. E. 2d 135, 137 (2009).  The court described the sequence of events set forth in the text.  See id., at 670671, 686 S. E. 2d, at 139. (Immediately following J. D. B.s initial confession, Investigator DiCostanzo informed J. D. B. that he did not have to speak with him and that he was free to leave (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted)).  Though less than perfectly explicit, the trial courts order indicates a finding that J. D. B. initially confessed prior to DiCostanzos warnings.  See App. 99a.


Nonetheless, both parties submissions to this Court suggest thatthe warnings came after DiCostanzo raised the possibility of a secure custody order but before J. D. B. confessed for the first time.  See Brief for Petitioner 5; Brief for Respondent 5.  Because we remand for a determination whether J. D. B. was in custody under the proper analysis, the state courts remain free to revisit whether the trial court made a conclusive finding of fact in this respect.

Rather than overtur[n] that settled principle, post, at 13, the limitation that a childs age may inform the custody analysis only when known or knowable simply reflects our  unwillingness to require officers to make guesses as to circumstances unknowable to them in deciding when to give Miranda warnings, Berkemer, 468 U.

						 Contrary to the dissents intimation, see post, at 8, Miranda does not answer the question whether a childs age is an objective circumstance relevant to the custody analysis.  Miranda simply holds that warnings must be given once a suspect is in custody, without paus[ing] to inquire in individual cases whether the defendant was aware of his rights without a warning being given.  384 U. S., at 468; see also id., at 468469 (Assessments of the knowledge the defendant possessed, based on information as to age, education, intelligence, or prior contact with authorities, can never be more than speculation; a warning is a clearcut fact (footnote omitted)).  That conclusion says nothing about whether age properly informs whether a child is in custody in the first place.

				Petitioner J. D. B. was a 13-year-old, seventh-grade student attending class at Smith Middle School in Chapel Hill, North Carolina when he was removed from his classroom by a uniformed police officer, escorted to a closed-door conference room, and questioned by police for at least half an hour.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				This was the second time that police questioned J. D. B. in the span of a week.  Five days earlier, two home break-ins occurred, and various items were stolen.  Police stopped and questioned J. D. B. after he was seen behind a residence in the neighborhood where the crimes occurred.  That same day, police also spoke to J. D. B.s grandmotherhis legal guardianas well as his aunt.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Police later learned that a digital camera matching the description of one of the stolen items had been found at J. D. B.s middle school and seen in J. D. B.s possession. Investigator DiCostanzo, the juvenile investigator with the local police force who had been assigned to the case, went to the school to question J. D. B.  Upon arrival, DiCostanzo informed the uniformed police officer on detail to the school (a so-called school resource officer), the assistant principal, and an administrative intern that he was there to question J. D. B. about the break-ins.  Although DiCostanzo asked the school administrators to verify J. D. B.s date of birth, address, and parent contact in-formation from school records, neither the police offi-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>

				  There, J. D. B. was met by DiCostanzo, the assistant principal, and the administrative intern.  The door to the conference room was closed.  With the two police officers and the two administrators present, J. D. B. was questioned for the next 30 to 45 minutes.  Prior to the commencement of questioning, J. D. B. was given neither

				Questioning began with small talkdiscussion of sports and J. D. B.s family life.  DiCostanzo asked, and J. D. B. agreed, to discuss the events of the prior weekend.  Denying any wrongdoing, J. D. B. explained that he had been in the neighborhood where the crimes occurred because he was seeking work mowing lawns.  DiCostanzo pressed J. D. B. for additional detail about his efforts to obtain work; asked J. D. B. to explain a prior incident, when one of the victims returned home to find J. D. B. behind her house; and confronted J. D. B. with the stolen camera.  The assistant principal urged J. D. B. to do the right thing, warning J. D. B. that the truth always comes out in the end.  App. 99a, 112a.

 (due process precludes admission of a confession where a defendants will was overborne by the circumstances of the interrogation).  After a suppression hearing at which DiCostanzo and J. D. B. testified, the trial court denied the motion, deciding that J. D. B. was not in custody at the time of the schoolhouse interrogation and that his statements were voluntary.  As a result, J. D. B. entered a transcript of admission to all four counts, renewing his objection to the denial of his motion to suppress, and the court adjudicated J. D. B. delinquent.

				Our various statements to this effect are far from unique.  The law has historically reflected the same assumption that children characteristically lack the capacity to exercise mature judgment and possess only an incomplete ability to understand the world around them.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England *464*465 (hereinafter Blackstone) (explaining that limits on childrens legal capacity under the common law secure them from hurting themselves by their own improvident acts).  Like this Courts own generalizations, the legal disqualifications placed on children as a class
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, limitations on their ability to alienate property, enter a binding contract enforceable against them, and marry without parental consentexhibit the settled understanding that the differentiating characteristics of youth are universal.

				Indeed, even where a reasonable person standard otherwise applies, the common law has reflected the reality that children are not adults.  In negligence suits, for instance, where liability turns on what an objectively reasonable person would do in the circumstances, [a]ll American jurisdictions accept the idea that a persons childhood is a relevant circumstance to be considered.

				As this discussion establishes, [o]ur history is replete with laws and judicial recognition that children cannot be viewed simply as miniature adults.  
				<em>
					Eddings
				</em>
				, 455 U. S., at 115116.  We see no justification for taking a different course here.  So long as the childs age was known to the officer at the time of the interview, or would have been objectively apparent to any reasonable officer, including age as part of the custody analysis requires officers neither to consider circumstances unknowable to them, 
				<em>
					Berkemer
				</em>
				, 468 U. S., at 430, nor to anticipat[e] the frailties or idiosyncrasies of the particular suspect whom they question, 
				<em>
					Alvarado
				</em>
				, 541 U. S., at 662 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The same wide basis of community experience that makes it possible, as an objective matter, to determine what is to be expected of children in other contexts, Restatement (Second) of Torts §283A, at 15; see 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 10, and n. 6, likewise makes it possible to know what to expect of children subjected to police questioning.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In other words, a childs age differs from other personal characteristics that, even when known to police, have no objectively discernible relationship to a reasonable persons understanding of his freedom of action.  
				<em>
					Alvarado
				</em>
				, holds, for instance, that a suspects prior interrogation history with law enforcement has no role to play in the custody analysis because such experience could just as easily lead a reasonable person to feel free to walk away as to feel compelled to stay in place.  541 U. S., at 668.  Because the effect in any given case would be contingent [on the] psycholog[y] of the individual suspect, the Court explained, such experience cannot be considered without compromising the objective nature of the custody analysis.  
				<em>
					Ibid.  
				</em>
				A childs age, however, is different.  Precisely because childhood yields objective conclusions like those we have drawn ourselvesamong others, that children are most susceptible to influence,

				</em>
				, 455 U. S., at 115, and outside pressures,

				In fact, in many cases involving juvenile suspects, the custody analysis would be nonsensical absent some consideration of the suspects age.  This case is a prime example.  Were the court precluded from taking J. D. B.s youth into account, it would be forced to evaluate the circumstances present here through the eyes of a reasonable person of average years.  In other words, how would a reasonable adult understand his situation, after being removed from a seventh-grade social studies class by a uniformed school resource officer; being encouraged by his assistant principal to do the right thing; and being warned by a police investigator of the prospect of juvenile detention and separation from his guardian and primary caretaker?  To describe such an inquiry is to demonstrate its absurdity.  Neither officers nor courts can reasonably evaluate the effect of objective circumstances that, by their nature, are specific to children without accounting for the age of the child subjected to those circumstances.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Indeed, although the dissent suggests that concerns regarding the application of the 
				<em>
					Miranda

				custody rule to minors can be accommodated by considering the unique circumstances present when minors are questioned in school, 
				<em>
					post

A studentwhose presence at school is compulsory and whose disobedience at school is cause for disciplinary actionis in a far different position than, say, a parent volunteer on school grounds to chaperone an event, or an adult from the community on school grounds to attend a basketball game.  Without asking whether the person questioned in school is a minor,

				Our prior decision in

				In the same vein, the State and its

				Relying on our statements that the objective custody test is designed to give clear guidance to the police, 
				<em>
					Alvarado
				</em>
				, 541 U. S., at 668, the State next argues that a childs age must be excluded from the analysis in order to preserve clarity.  Similarly, the dissent insists that the clarity of the custody analysis will be destroyed unless a one-size-fits-all reasonable-person test applies.

				, at 13.  In reality, however, ignoring a juvenile defendants age will often make the inquiry more artificial, see 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				at 1213, and thus only add confusion.  And in any event, a childs age, when known or apparent, is hardly an obscure factor to assess.  Though the State and the dissent worry about gradations among children of different ages, that concern cannot justify ignoring a childs age altogether.  Just as police officers are competent to account for other objective circumstances that are a matter of degree such as the length of questioning or the number of officers present, so too are they competent to evaluate the effect of relative age.  Indeed, they are competent to do so even though an interrogation room lacks the reflective atmosphere of a [jury] deliberation room, 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, at 15.  The same is true of judges, including those whose childhoods have long since passed, see 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, at 14.  In short, officers and judges need no imaginative powers, knowledge of developmental psychology, training in cognitive science, or expertise in social and cultural anthropology to account for a childs age.  They simply need the common sense to know that a 7-year-old is not a 13-year-old and neither is an adult.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				There is, however, an even more fundamental flaw with the States plea for clarity and the dissents singular focus on simplifying the analysis: Not once have we excluded from the custody analysis a circumstance that we determined was relevant and objective, simply to make the fault line between custodial and noncustodial brighter.  Indeed, were the guiding concern clarity and nothing else, the custody test would presumably ask only whether the suspect had been placed under formal arrest.

				, 468 U. S., at 441; see

				<span class="softbreak"></span>

				Finally, the State and the dissent suggest that excluding age from the custody analysis comes at no cost to juveniles constitutional rights because the due process voluntariness test independently accounts for a childs youth.  To be sure, that test permits consideration of a childs age, and it erects its own barrier to admission of a defendants inculpatory statements at trial.  See 
				<em>

				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, at 1718 ([C]ourts should be instructed to take particular care to ensure that [young childrens] incriminating statements were not obtained involuntarily).  But 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s procedural safeguards exist precisely because the voluntariness test is an inadequate barrier when custodial interrogation is at stake.  See 384 U. S., at 458 (Unless adequate protective devices are employed to dispel the compulsion inherent in custodial surroundings, no statement obtained from the defendant can truly be the product of his free choice); 
				<em>

				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 56.  To hold, as the State requests, that a childs age is never relevant to whether a suspect has been taken into custodyand thus to ignore the very real differences between children and adultswould be to deny children the full scope of the procedural safeguards that 
				<em>
					Miranda

				 guarantees to adults.

						 The North Carolina Supreme Court noted that the trial courts factual findings were uncontested and therefore . . . binding on it.  In re J. D. B., 363 N. C. 664, 668, 686 S. E. 2d 135, 137 (2009).  The court described the sequence of events set forth in the text.  See id., at 670671, 686 S. E. 2d, at 139. (Immediately following J. D. B.s initial confession, Investigator DiCostanzo informed J. D. B. that he did not have to speak with him and that he was free to leave (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted)).  Though less than perfectly explicit, the trial courts order indicates a finding that J. D. B. initially confessed prior to DiCostanzos warnings.  See App. 99a.


Nonetheless, both parties submissions to this Court suggest thatthe warnings came after DiCostanzo raised the possibility of a secure custody order but before J. D. B. confessed for the first time.  See Brief for Petitioner 5; Brief for Respondent 5.  Because we remand for a determination whether J. D. B. was in custody under the proper analysis, the state courts remain free to revisit whether the trial court made a conclusive finding of fact in this respect.

Rather than overtur[n] that settled principle, post, at 13, the limitation that a childs age may inform the custody analysis only when known or knowable simply reflects our  unwillingness to require officers to make guesses as to circumstances unknowable to them in deciding when to give Miranda warnings, Berkemer, 468 U.

						 Contrary to the dissents intimation, see post, at 8, Miranda does not answer the question whether a childs age is an objective circumstance relevant to the custody analysis.  Miranda simply holds that warnings must be given once a suspect is in custody, without paus[ing] to inquire in individual cases whether the defendant was aware of his rights without a warning being given.  384 U. S., at 468; see also id., at 468469 (Assessments of the knowledge the defendant possessed, based on information as to age, education, intelligence, or prior contact with authorities, can never be more than speculation; a warning is a clearcut fact (footnote omitted)).  That conclusion says nothing about whether age properly informs whether a child is in custody in the first place.

				Petitioner J. D. B. was a 13-year-old, seventh-grade student attending class at Smith Middle School in Chapel Hill, North Carolina when he was removed from his classroom by a uniformed police officer, escorted to a closed-door conference room, and questioned by police for at least half an hour.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				This was the second time that police questioned J. D. B. in the span of a week.  Five days earlier, two home break-ins occurred, and various items were stolen.  Police stopped and questioned J. D. B. after he was seen behind a residence in the neighborhood where the crimes occurred.  That same day, police also spoke to J. D. B.s grandmotherhis legal guardianas well as his aunt.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Police later learned that a digital camera matching the description of one of the stolen items had been found at J. D. B.s middle school and seen in J. D. B.s possession. Investigator DiCostanzo, the juvenile investigator with the local police force who had been assigned to the case, went to the school to question J. D. B.  Upon arrival, DiCostanzo informed the uniformed police officer on detail to the school (a so-called school resource officer), the assistant principal, and an administrative intern that he was there to question J. D. B. about the break-ins.  Although DiCostanzo asked the school administrators to verify J. D. B.s date of birth, address, and parent contact in-formation from school records, neither the police offi-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>

				  There, J. D. B. was met by DiCostanzo, the assistant principal, and the administrative intern.  The door to the conference room was closed.  With the two police officers and the two administrators present, J. D. B. was questioned for the next 30 to 45 minutes.  Prior to the commencement of questioning, J. D. B. was given neither

				Questioning began with small talkdiscussion of sports and J. D. B.s family life.  DiCostanzo asked, and J. D. B. agreed, to discuss the events of the prior weekend.  Denying any wrongdoing, J. D. B. explained that he had been in the neighborhood where the crimes occurred because he was seeking work mowing lawns.  DiCostanzo pressed J. D. B. for additional detail about his efforts to obtain work; asked J. D. B. to explain a prior incident, when one of the victims returned home to find J. D. B. behind her house; and confronted J. D. B. with the stolen camera.  The assistant principal urged J. D. B. to do the right thing, warning J. D. B. that the truth always comes out in the end.  App. 99a, 112a.

 (due process precludes admission of a confession where a defendants will was overborne by the circumstances of the interrogation).  After a suppression hearing at which DiCostanzo and J. D. B. testified, the trial court denied the motion, deciding that J. D. B. was not in custody at the time of the schoolhouse interrogation and that his statements were voluntary.  As a result, J. D. B. entered a transcript of admission to all four counts, renewing his objection to the denial of his motion to suppress, and the court adjudicated J. D. B. delinquent.

				Our various statements to this effect are far from unique.  The law has historically reflected the same assumption that children characteristically lack the capacity to exercise mature judgment and possess only an incomplete ability to understand the world around them.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England *464*465 (hereinafter Blackstone) (explaining that limits on childrens legal capacity under the common law secure them from hurting themselves by their own improvident acts).  Like this Courts own generalizations, the legal disqualifications placed on children as a class
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, limitations on their ability to alienate property, enter a binding contract enforceable against them, and marry without parental consentexhibit the settled understanding that the differentiating characteristics of youth are universal.

				Indeed, even where a reasonable person standard otherwise applies, the common law has reflected the reality that children are not adults.  In negligence suits, for instance, where liability turns on what an objectively reasonable person would do in the circumstances, [a]ll American jurisdictions accept the idea that a persons childhood is a relevant circumstance to be considered.

				As this discussion establishes, [o]ur history is replete with laws and judicial recognition that children cannot be viewed simply as miniature adults.  
				<em>
					Eddings
				</em>
				, 455 U. S., at 115116.  We see no justification for taking a different course here.  So long as the childs age was known to the officer at the time of the interview, or would have been objectively apparent to any reasonable officer, including age as part of the custody analysis requires officers neither to consider circumstances unknowable to them, 
				<em>
					Berkemer
				</em>
				, 468 U. S., at 430, nor to anticipat[e] the frailties or idiosyncrasies of the particular suspect whom they question, 
				<em>
					Alvarado
				</em>
				, 541 U. S., at 662 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The same wide basis of community experience that makes it possible, as an objective matter, to determine what is to be expected of children in other contexts, Restatement (Second) of Torts §283A, at 15; see 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 10, and n. 6, likewise makes it possible to know what to expect of children subjected to police questioning.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In other words, a childs age differs from other personal characteristics that, even when known to police, have no objectively discernible relationship to a reasonable persons understanding of his freedom of action.  
				<em>
					Alvarado
				</em>
				, holds, for instance, that a suspects prior interrogation history with law enforcement has no role to play in the custody analysis because such experience could just as easily lead a reasonable person to feel free to walk away as to feel compelled to stay in place.  541 U. S., at 668.  Because the effect in any given case would be contingent [on the] psycholog[y] of the individual suspect, the Court explained, such experience cannot be considered without compromising the objective nature of the custody analysis.  
				<em>
					Ibid.  
				</em>
				A childs age, however, is different.  Precisely because childhood yields objective conclusions like those we have drawn ourselvesamong others, that children are most susceptible to influence,

				</em>
				, 455 U. S., at 115, and outside pressures,

				In fact, in many cases involving juvenile suspects, the custody analysis would be nonsensical absent some consideration of the suspects age.  This case is a prime example.  Were the court precluded from taking J. D. B.s youth into account, it would be forced to evaluate the circumstances present here through the eyes of a reasonable person of average years.  In other words, how would a reasonable adult understand his situation, after being removed from a seventh-grade social studies class by a uniformed school resource officer; being encouraged by his assistant principal to do the right thing; and being warned by a police investigator of the prospect of juvenile detention and separation from his guardian and primary caretaker?  To describe such an inquiry is to demonstrate its absurdity.  Neither officers nor courts can reasonably evaluate the effect of objective circumstances that, by their nature, are specific to children without accounting for the age of the child subjected to those circumstances.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Indeed, although the dissent suggests that concerns regarding the application of the 
				<em>
					Miranda

				custody rule to minors can be accommodated by considering the unique circumstances present when minors are questioned in school, 
				<em>
					post

A studentwhose presence at school is compulsory and whose disobedience at school is cause for disciplinary actionis in a far different position than, say, a parent volunteer on school grounds to chaperone an event, or an adult from the community on school grounds to attend a basketball game.  Without asking whether the person questioned in school is a minor,

				Our prior decision in

				In the same vein, the State and its

				Relying on our statements that the objective custody test is designed to give clear guidance to the police, 
				<em>
					Alvarado
				</em>
				, 541 U. S., at 668, the State next argues that a childs age must be excluded from the analysis in order to preserve clarity.  Similarly, the dissent insists that the clarity of the custody analysis will be destroyed unless a one-size-fits-all reasonable-person test applies.

				, at 13.  In reality, however, ignoring a juvenile defendants age will often make the inquiry more artificial, see 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				at 1213, and thus only add confusion.  And in any event, a childs age, when known or apparent, is hardly an obscure factor to assess.  Though the State and the dissent worry about gradations among children of different ages, that concern cannot justify ignoring a childs age altogether.  Just as police officers are competent to account for other objective circumstances that are a matter of degree such as the length of questioning or the number of officers present, so too are they competent to evaluate the effect of relative age.  Indeed, they are competent to do so even though an interrogation room lacks the reflective atmosphere of a [jury] deliberation room, 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, at 15.  The same is true of judges, including those whose childhoods have long since passed, see 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, at 14.  In short, officers and judges need no imaginative powers, knowledge of developmental psychology, training in cognitive science, or expertise in social and cultural anthropology to account for a childs age.  They simply need the common sense to know that a 7-year-old is not a 13-year-old and neither is an adult.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				There is, however, an even more fundamental flaw with the States plea for clarity and the dissents singular focus on simplifying the analysis: Not once have we excluded from the custody analysis a circumstance that we determined was relevant and objective, simply to make the fault line between custodial and noncustodial brighter.  Indeed, were the guiding concern clarity and nothing else, the custody test would presumably ask only whether the suspect had been placed under formal arrest.

				, 468 U. S., at 441; see

				<span class="softbreak"></span>

				Finally, the State and the dissent suggest that excluding age from the custody analysis comes at no cost to juveniles constitutional rights because the due process voluntariness test independently accounts for a childs youth.  To be sure, that test permits consideration of a childs age, and it erects its own barrier to admission of a defendants inculpatory statements at trial.  See 
				<em>

				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, at 1718 ([C]ourts should be instructed to take particular care to ensure that [young childrens] incriminating statements were not obtained involuntarily).  But 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s procedural safeguards exist precisely because the voluntariness test is an inadequate barrier when custodial interrogation is at stake.  See 384 U. S., at 458 (Unless adequate protective devices are employed to dispel the compulsion inherent in custodial surroundings, no statement obtained from the defendant can truly be the product of his free choice); 
				<em>

				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 56.  To hold, as the State requests, that a childs age is never relevant to whether a suspect has been taken into custodyand thus to ignore the very real differences between children and adultswould be to deny children the full scope of the procedural safeguards that 
				<em>
					Miranda

				 guarantees to adults.

						 The North Carolina Supreme Court noted that the trial courts factual findings were uncontested and therefore . . . binding on it.  In re J. D. B., 363 N. C. 664, 668, 686 S. E. 2d 135, 137 (2009).  The court described the sequence of events set forth in the text.  See id., at 670671, 686 S. E. 2d, at 139. (Immediately following J. D. B.s initial confession, Investigator DiCostanzo informed J. D. B. that he did not have to speak with him and that he was free to leave (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted)).  Though less than perfectly explicit, the trial courts order indicates a finding that J. D. B. initially confessed prior to DiCostanzos warnings.  See App. 99a.


Nonetheless, both parties submissions to this Court suggest thatthe warnings came after DiCostanzo raised the possibility of a secure custody order but before J. D. B. confessed for the first time.  See Brief for Petitioner 5; Brief for Respondent 5.  Because we remand for a determination whether J. D. B. was in custody under the proper analysis, the state courts remain free to revisit whether the trial court made a conclusive finding of fact in this respect.

Rather than overtur[n] that settled principle, post, at 13, the limitation that a childs age may inform the custody analysis only when known or knowable simply reflects our  unwillingness to require officers to make guesses as to circumstances unknowable to them in deciding when to give Miranda warnings, Berkemer, 468 U.

						 Contrary to the dissents intimation, see post, at 8, Miranda does not answer the question whether a childs age is an objective circumstance relevant to the custody analysis.  Miranda simply holds that warnings must be given once a suspect is in custody, without paus[ing] to inquire in individual cases whether the defendant was aware of his rights without a warning being given.  384 U. S., at 468; see also id., at 468469 (Assessments of the knowledge the defendant possessed, based on information as to age, education, intelligence, or prior contact with authorities, can never be more than speculation; a warning is a clearcut fact (footnote omitted)).  That conclusion says nothing about whether age properly informs whether a child is in custody in the first place.

				Petitioner J. D. B. was a 13-year-old, seventh-grade student attending class at Smith Middle School in Chapel Hill, North Carolina when he was removed from his classroom by a uniformed police officer, escorted to a closed-door conference room, and questioned by police for at least half an hour.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				This was the second time that police questioned J. D. B. in the span of a week.  Five days earlier, two home break-ins occurred, and various items were stolen.  Police stopped and questioned J. D. B. after he was seen behind a residence in the neighborhood where the crimes occurred.  That same day, police also spoke to J. D. B.s grandmotherhis legal guardianas well as his aunt.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Police later learned that a digital camera matching the description of one of the stolen items had been found at J. D. B.s middle school and seen in J. D. B.s possession. Investigator DiCostanzo, the juvenile investigator with the local police force who had been assigned to the case, went to the school to question J. D. B.  Upon arrival, DiCostanzo informed the uniformed police officer on detail to the school (a so-called school resource officer), the assistant principal, and an administrative intern that he was there to question J. D. B. about the break-ins.  Although DiCostanzo asked the school administrators to verify J. D. B.s date of birth, address, and parent contact in-formation from school records, neither the police offi-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>

				  There, J. D. B. was met by DiCostanzo, the assistant principal, and the administrative intern.  The door to the conference room was closed.  With the two police officers and the two administrators present, J. D. B. was questioned for the next 30 to 45 minutes.  Prior to the commencement of questioning, J. D. B. was given neither

				Questioning began with small talkdiscussion of sports and J. D. B.s family life.  DiCostanzo asked, and J. D. B. agreed, to discuss the events of the prior weekend.  Denying any wrongdoing, J. D. B. explained that he had been in the neighborhood where the crimes occurred because he was seeking work mowing lawns.  DiCostanzo pressed J. D. B. for additional detail about his efforts to obtain work; asked J. D. B. to explain a prior incident, when one of the victims returned home to find J. D. B. behind her house; and confronted J. D. B. with the stolen camera.  The assistant principal urged J. D. B. to do the right thing, warning J. D. B. that the truth always comes out in the end.  App. 99a, 112a.

 (due process precludes admission of a confession where a defendants will was overborne by the circumstances of the interrogation).  After a suppression hearing at which DiCostanzo and J. D. B. testified, the trial court denied the motion, deciding that J. D. B. was not in custody at the time of the schoolhouse interrogation and that his statements were voluntary.  As a result, J. D. B. entered a transcript of admission to all four counts, renewing his objection to the denial of his motion to suppress, and the court adjudicated J. D. B. delinquent.

				Our various statements to this effect are far from unique.  The law has historically reflected the same assumption that children characteristically lack the capacity to exercise mature judgment and possess only an incomplete ability to understand the world around them.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England *464*465 (hereinafter Blackstone) (explaining that limits on childrens legal capacity under the common law secure them from hurting themselves by their own improvident acts).  Like this Courts own generalizations, the legal disqualifications placed on children as a class
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, limitations on their ability to alienate property, enter a binding contract enforceable against them, and marry without parental consentexhibit the settled understanding that the differentiating characteristics of youth are universal.

				Indeed, even where a reasonable person standard otherwise applies, the common law has reflected the reality that children are not adults.  In negligence suits, for instance, where liability turns on what an objectively reasonable person would do in the circumstances, [a]ll American jurisdictions accept the idea that a persons childhood is a relevant circumstance to be considered.

				As this discussion establishes, [o]ur history is replete with laws and judicial recognition that children cannot be viewed simply as miniature adults.  
				<em>
					Eddings
				</em>
				, 455 U. S., at 115116.  We see no justification for taking a different course here.  So long as the childs age was known to the officer at the time of the interview, or would have been objectively apparent to any reasonable officer, including age as part of the custody analysis requires officers neither to consider circumstances unknowable to them, 
				<em>
					Berkemer
				</em>
				, 468 U. S., at 430, nor to anticipat[e] the frailties or idiosyncrasies of the particular suspect whom they question, 
				<em>
					Alvarado
				</em>
				, 541 U. S., at 662 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The same wide basis of community experience that makes it possible, as an objective matter, to determine what is to be expected of children in other contexts, Restatement (Second) of Torts §283A, at 15; see 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 10, and n. 6, likewise makes it possible to know what to expect of children subjected to police questioning.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In other words, a childs age differs from other personal characteristics that, even when known to police, have no objectively discernible relationship to a reasonable persons understanding of his freedom of action.  
				<em>
					Alvarado
				</em>
				, holds, for instance, that a suspects prior interrogation history with law enforcement has no role to play in the custody analysis because such experience could just as easily lead a reasonable person to feel free to walk away as to feel compelled to stay in place.  541 U. S., at 668.  Because the effect in any given case would be contingent [on the] psycholog[y] of the individual suspect, the Court explained, such experience cannot be considered without compromising the objective nature of the custody analysis.  
				<em>
					Ibid.  
				</em>
				A childs age, however, is different.  Precisely because childhood yields objective conclusions like those we have drawn ourselvesamong others, that children are most susceptible to influence,

				</em>
				, 455 U. S., at 115, and outside pressures,

				In fact, in many cases involving juvenile suspects, the custody analysis would be nonsensical absent some consideration of the suspects age.  This case is a prime example.  Were the court precluded from taking J. D. B.s youth into account, it would be forced to evaluate the circumstances present here through the eyes of a reasonable person of average years.  In other words, how would a reasonable adult understand his situation, after being removed from a seventh-grade social studies class by a uniformed school resource officer; being encouraged by his assistant principal to do the right thing; and being warned by a police investigator of the prospect of juvenile detention and separation from his guardian and primary caretaker?  To describe such an inquiry is to demonstrate its absurdity.  Neither officers nor courts can reasonably evaluate the effect of objective circumstances that, by their nature, are specific to children without accounting for the age of the child subjected to those circumstances.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Indeed, although the dissent suggests that concerns regarding the application of the 
				<em>
					Miranda

				custody rule to minors can be accommodated by considering the unique circumstances present when minors are questioned in school, 
				<em>
					post

A studentwhose presence at school is compulsory and whose disobedience at school is cause for disciplinary actionis in a far different position than, say, a parent volunteer on school grounds to chaperone an event, or an adult from the community on school grounds to attend a basketball game.  Without asking whether the person questioned in school is a minor,

				Our prior decision in

				In the same vein, the State and its

				, 516 U. S., at 112.  Because the

				custody inquiry turns on the mindset of a reasonable person in the suspects position, it cannot be the case that a circumstance is subjective simply because it has an internal or psychological impact on perception.

				Relying on our statements that the objective custody test is designed to give clear guidance to the police, 
				<em>
					Alvarado
				</em>
				, 541 U. S., at 668, the State next argues that a childs age must be excluded from the analysis in order to preserve clarity.  Similarly, the dissent insists that the clarity of the custody analysis will be destroyed unless a one-size-fits-all reasonable-person test applies.  
				<em>
					Post

				, at 13.  In reality, however, ignoring a juvenile defendants age will often make the inquiry more artificial, see 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				at 1213, and thus only add confusion.  And in any event, a childs age, when known or apparent, is hardly an obscure factor to assess.  Though the State and the dissent worry about gradations among children of different ages, that concern cannot justify ignoring a childs age altogether.  Just as police officers are competent to account for other objective circumstances that are a matter of degree such as the length of questioning or the number of officers present, so too are they competent to evaluate the effect of relative age.  Indeed, they are competent to do so even though an interrogation room lacks the reflective atmosphere of a [jury] deliberation room, 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, at 15.  The same is true of judges, including those whose childhoods have long since passed, see 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, at 14.  In short, officers and judges need no imaginative powers, knowledge of developmental psychology, training in cognitive science, or expertise in social and cultural anthropology to account for a childs age.  They simply need the common sense to know that a 7-year-old is not a 13-year-old and neither is an adult.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				There is, however, an even more fundamental flaw with the States plea for clarity and the dissents singular focus on simplifying the analysis: Not once have we excluded from the custody analysis a circumstance that we determined was relevant and objective, simply to make the fault line between custodial and noncustodial brighter.  Indeed, were the guiding concern clarity and nothing else, the custody test would presumably ask only whether the suspect had been placed under formal arrest.

				<span class="softbreak"></span>

				Finally, the State and the dissent suggest that excluding age from the custody analysis comes at no cost to juveniles constitutional rights because the due process voluntariness test independently accounts for a childs youth.  To be sure, that test permits consideration of a childs age, and it erects its own barrier to admission of a defendants inculpatory statements at trial.  See 
				<em>

				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, at 1718 ([C]ourts should be instructed to take particular care to ensure that [young childrens] incriminating statements were not obtained involuntarily).  But 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s procedural safeguards exist precisely because the voluntariness test is an inadequate barrier when custodial interrogation is at stake.  See 384 U. S., at 458 (Unless adequate protective devices are employed to dispel the compulsion inherent in custodial surroundings, no statement obtained from the defendant can truly be the product of his free choice); 
				<em>
					Dickerson
				</em>

				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 56.  To hold, as the State requests, that a childs age is never relevant to whether a suspect has been taken into custodyand thus to ignore the very real differences between children and adultswould be to deny children the full scope of the procedural safeguards that 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 guarantees to adults.

E. 2d 135, 137 (2009).  The court described the sequence of events set forth in the text.  See id., at 670671, 686 S. E. 2d, at 139. (Immediately following J. D. B.s initial confession, Investigator DiCostanzo informed J. D. B. that he did not have to speak with him and that he was free to leave (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted)).  Though less than perfectly explicit, the trial courts order indicates a finding that J. D. B. initially confessed prior to DiCostanzos warnings.  See App. 99a.


Nonetheless, both parties submissions to this Court suggest thatthe warnings came after DiCostanzo raised the possibility of a secure custody order but before J. D. B. confessed for the first time.  See Brief for Petitioner 5; Brief for Respondent 5.  Because we remand for a determination whether J. D. B. was in custody under the proper analysis, the state courts remain free to revisit whether the trial court made a conclusive finding of fact in this respect.

Rather than overtur[n] that settled principle, post, at 13, the limitation that a childs age may inform the custody analysis only when known or knowable simply reflects our  unwillingness to require officers to make guesses as to circumstances unknowable to them in deciding when to give Miranda warnings, Berkemer, 468 U.

						 Contrary to the dissents intimation, see post, at 8, Miranda does not answer the question whether a childs age is an objective circumstance relevant to the custody analysis.  Miranda simply holds that warnings must be given once a suspect is in custody, without paus[ing] to inquire in individual cases whether the defendant was aware of his rights without a warning being given.  384 U. S., at 468; see also id., at 468469 (Assessments of the knowledge the defendant possessed, based on information as to age, education, intelligence, or prior contact with authorities, can never be more than speculation; a warning is a clearcut fact (footnote omitted)).  That conclusion says nothing about whether age properly informs whether a child is in custody in the first place.

				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				voluntary confessions, the 
				<em>
					Miranda

				 Court set down rigid standards that often require courts to ignore personal characteristics that may be highly relevant to a particular suspects actual susceptibility to police pressure.  This rigidity, however, has brought with it one of

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">425</a>426 (1986)

				<em>

				</em>
				s objective reasonable-person test for determining custody.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s custody requirement is based on the proposition that the risk of unconstitutional coercion is heightened when a suspect is placed under formal arrest or is subjected to some functionally equivalent limitation on freedom of movement.  When this custodial threshold is reached, 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings must precede police questioning.  But in the interest of simplicity, the custody analysis considers only whether, under the circumstances, a hypothetical reasonable person would consider himself to be confined.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Many suspects, of course, will differ from this hypothetical reasonable person.  Some, including those who have been hardened by past interrogations, may have no need for 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings at all.  And for other suspectsthose who are unusually sensitive to the pressures of police questioning
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings may come too late to be of any use.  That is a necessary consequence of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s rigid standards, but it does not mean that the constitutional rights of these especially sensitive suspects are left unprotected.  A vulnerable defendant can still turn to the constitutional rule against 
				<em>
					actual 
				</em>
				coercion and contend that that his confession was extracted against his will.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Todays decision shifts the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 custody determination from a one-size-fits-all reasonable-person test into an inquiry that must account for at least one individualized characteristicagethat is thought to correlate with sus-ceptibility to coercive pressures.  Age, however, is in no way the only personal characteristic that may correlate with pliability, and in future cases the Court will be forced to choose between two unpalatable alternatives.  It may choose to limit todays decision by arbitrarily distinguishing a suspects age from other personal characteristicssuch as intelligence, education, occupation, or prior experience with law enforcementthat may also correlate with susceptibility to coercive pressures.  Or, if the Court is unwilling to draw these arbitrary lines, it will be forced to effect a fundamental transformation of the 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				custody testfrom a clear, easily applied prophylactic
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				rule into a highly fact-intensive standard resembling the voluntariness test that the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 Court found to be unsatisfactory.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				For at least three reasons, there is no need to go down this road.  First, many minors subjected to police interrogation are near the age of majority, and for these suspects the one-size-fits-all 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 custody rule may not be a bad fit.  Second, many of the difficulties in applying the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 custody rule to minors arise because of the unique circumstances present when the police conduct interrogations at school.  The 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 custody rule has always taken into account the setting in which questioning occurs, and accounting for the school setting in such cases will address many of these problems.  Third, in cases like the one now before us, where the suspect is especially young, courts applying the constitutional voluntariness standard can take special care to ensure that incriminating statements were not obtained through coercion.

        <p class="bodytext">

				The Courts rationale for importing age into the custody standard is that minors tend to lack adults capacity to exercise mature judgment and that failing to account for that reality will leave some minors unprotected under 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				in situations where they perceive themselves to be confined.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 10, 8.  I do not dispute that many suspects who are under 18 will be more susceptible to police pressure than the average adult.  As the Court notes, our pre-
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				cases were particularly attuned to this reality in applying the constitutional requirement of voluntariness in fact.  
				<em>
					Ante,

					Haley, 
				</em>
				332 U. S., at 599 (plurality opinion), and

				, 370 U. S., at 54).  It is no less a reality, however, that many persons 
				<em>
					over
				</em>
				 the age of 18 are also more susceptible to police pressure than the hypothetical reasonable person.  See 
				<em>
					Payne,
				</em>
				 356 U. S., at 567 (fact that defendant was a mentally dull 19-year-old youth relevant in voluntariness inquiry).  Yet the 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				custody standard has never accounted for the personal characteristics of these or any other individual defendants.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Indeed, it has always been the case under 
				<em>
					Miranda

				 that the unusually meek or compliant are subject to the same fixed rules, including the same custody requirement, as those who are unusually resistant to police pressure.  
				<em>
					Berkemer

				s rigid standards are both overinclusive and underinclusive.  They are overinclusive to the extent that they provide a windfall to the most hardened and savvy of suspects, who often have no need for 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s protections.  Compare 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, 
				<em>

 (White, J., dissenting) (Where the defendant himself [w]as a lawyer, policeman, professional criminal, or otherwise has become aware of what his right to silence is, it is sheer fancy to assert that his answer to every question asked him is compelled unless he is advised of those rights with which he is already intimately familiar).  And 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s requirements are underinclusive to the extent that they fail to account for frailties, idiosyncrasies, and other individualized considerations that might cause a person to bend more easily during a confrontation with the police.  See 
				<em>
					Alvarado
				</em>
				, 541 U. S., at 662 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Members of this Court have seen this rigidity as a major weakness in

				That is undoubtedly why this Courts

				,

				at 666.  And unless the
				<em>

				</em>
				 custody rule is now to be radically transformed into one that takes into account the wide range of individual characteristics that are relevant in determining whether a confession is voluntary, the Court must shoulder the burden of explaining why age is different from these other personal characteristics.

				Why, for example, is age different from intelligence?  Suppose that an officer, upon going to a school to question a student, is told by the principal that the student has an I. Q. of 75 and is in a special-education class.  Cf.

				The Court holds that age must be taken into account when it was known to the officer at the time of the interview, or when it would have been objectively apparent to a reasonable officer.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 11.  The first half of this test overturns the rule that the initial determination of custody does not depend on the subjective views harbored by . . . interrogating officers.  
				<em>
					Stansbury,
				</em>
				 511 U. S., at 323.  The second half will generate time-consuming satellite litigation over a reasonable officers perceptions.  When, as here, the interrogation takes place in school, the inquiry may be relatively simple.  But not all police questioning of minors takes place in schools.  In many cases, courts will presumably have to make findings as to whether a particular suspect had a sufficiently youthful look to alert a reasonable officer to the possibility that the suspect was under 18, or whether a reasonable officer would have recognized that a suspects I. D. was a fake.  The inquiry will be both time-consuming and disruptive for the police and the courts.  See 
				<em>
					Berkemer
				</em>
				, 468 U. S., at 432 (refusing to modify the custody test based on similar considerations).  It will also be made all the more complicated by the fact that a suspects dress and manner will often be different when the issue is litigated in court than it was at the time of the interrogation.

				Even after courts clear this initial hurdle, further problems will likely emerge as judges attempt to put themselves in the shoes of the average 16-year-old, or 15-year-old, or 13-year-old, as the case may be.  Consider, for example, a 60-year-old judge attempting to make a custody determination through the eyes of a hypothetical, average 15-year-old.  Forty-five years of personal experience and societal change separate this judge from the days when he or she was 15 years old.  And this judge may or may not have been an average 15-year-old.  The Courts answer to these difficulties is to state that no imaginative powers, knowledge of developmental psychology, [or] training in cognitive science will be necessary.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 17.  Judges simply need the common sense, the Court assures, to know that a 7-year-old is not a 13-year-old and neither is an adult.  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 17.  It is obvious, however, that application of the Courts new rule demands much more than this.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Take a fairly typical case in which todays holding may make a difference.  A 16-year-old moves to suppress incriminating statements made prior to the administration of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings.  The circumstances are such that, if the defendant were at least 18, the court would not find that he or she was in custody, but the defendant argues that a reasonable 16-year-old would view the situation differently.  The judge will not have the luxury of merely saying: It is common sense that a 16-year-old is not an 18-year-old.  Motion granted.  Rather, the judge will be required to determine whether the differences between a typical 16-year-old and a typical 18-year-old with respect to susceptibility to the pressures of interrogation are sufficient to change the outcome of the custody determination.  Todays opinion contains not a word of actual guidance as to how judges are supposed to go about making that determination.

				Petitioner and the Court attempt to show that this task is not unmanageable by pointing out that age is taken into account in other legal contexts.

				In addition, many of the concerns that petitioner raises regarding the application of the

				 custody rule to minors can be accommodated by considering the unique circumstances present when minors are questioned in school.  See Brief for Petitioner 1011 (reciting at length the factors petitioner believes to be relevant to the custody determination here, including the fact that petitioner was removed from class by a police officer, that the interview took place in a school conference room, and that a uniformed officer and a vice principal were present).  The
				<em>

				 custody rule has always taken into account the setting in which questioning occurs, restrictions on a suspects freedom of movement, and the presence of police officers or other authority figures.  See

				Finally, in cases like the one now before us, where the suspect is much younger than the typical juvenile defendant, courts should be instructed to take particular care to ensure that incriminating statements were not obtained involuntarily.  The voluntariness inquiry is flexible and accommodating by nature, see 
				<em>
					Schneckloth,
				</em>
				 412 U. S., at 224, and the Courts precedents already make clear that special care must be exercised in applying the voluntariness test where the confession of a mere child is at issue.

						 The Court claims that [n]ot once have any of our cases excluded from the custody analysis a circumstance that we determined was relevant and objective, simply to make the fault line between custodial and noncustodial brighter.   Ante, at 17.  Surely this is incorrect.  The very act of adopting a reasonable-person test necessarily excludes all sorts of relevant and objective circumstancesfor example, all the objective circumstances of a suspects life historythat might otherwise bear on a custody determination.

						 The Court also relies on North Carolinas concession at oral argument that a court could take into account a suspects blindness as a factor relevant to the Miranda custody determination.  Ante, at 15, and n. 9.  This is a far-fetched hypothetical, and neither the parties nor their amici cite any case in which such a problem has actually arisen.  Presumably such a case would involve a situation in which a blind defendant was given a typed document advising him that he [was] free to leave.  See Brief for Juvenile Law Center as Amicus Curiae 23.  In such a case, furnishing this advice in a form calculated to be unintelligible to the suspect would be tantamount to failing to provide the advice at all.  And advice by the police that a suspect is or is not free to leave at will has always been regarded as a circumstance regarding the conditions of the interrogation that must be taken into account in making the Miranda custody determination.

						 The Court thinks it would be absur[d] to consider the school setting without accounting for age, ante, at 12, but the real absurdity is for the Court to require police officers to get inside the head of a reasonable minor while making the quick, on-the-spot determinations that Miranda demands.

				The Courts decision in this case may seem on first consideration to be modest and sensible, but in truth it
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				is neither.  It is fundamentally inconsistent with one of the main justifications for the 
				<em>
					Miranda&lt;footcall num="1"&gt;
				</em>
				 rule: the perceived need for a clear rule that can be easily applied in all cases.  And todays holding is not needed to protect the constitutional rights of minors who are questioned by the police.

        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s prophylactic regime places a high value on clarity and certainty.  Dissatisfied with the highly fact-specific constitutional rule against the admission of in-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				voluntary confessions, the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 Court set down rigid standards that often require courts to ignore personal characteristics that may be highly relevant to a particular suspects actual susceptibility to police pressure.  This rigidity, however, has brought with it one of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s principal strengthsthe ease and clarity of its application by law enforcement officials and courts.  See 
				<em>
					Moran
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Burbine
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/475/412" class="subref" title="subref">475 U. S. 412</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">425</a>426 (1986)
.  A key contributor to this clarity, at least up until now, has been 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s objective reasonable-person test for determining custody.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s custody requirement is based on the proposition that the risk of unconstitutional coercion is heightened when a suspect is placed under formal arrest or is subjected to some functionally equivalent limitation on freedom of movement.  When this custodial threshold is reached, 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings must precede police questioning.  But in the interest of simplicity, the custody analysis considers only whether, under the circumstances, a hypothetical reasonable person would consider himself to be confined.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Many suspects, of course, will differ from this hypothetical reasonable person.  Some, including those who have been hardened by past interrogations, may have no need for 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings at all.  And for other suspectsthose who are unusually sensitive to the pressures of police questioning
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings may come too late to be of any use.  That is a necessary consequence of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s rigid standards, but it does not mean that the constitutional rights of these especially sensitive suspects are left unprotected.  A vulnerable defendant can still turn to the constitutional rule against 
				<em>
					actual 
				</em>
				coercion and contend that that his confession was extracted against his will.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Todays decision shifts the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 custody determination from a one-size-fits-all reasonable-person test into an inquiry that must account for at least one individualized characteristicagethat is thought to correlate with sus-ceptibility to coercive pressures.  Age, however, is in no way the only personal characteristic that may correlate with pliability, and in future cases the Court will be forced to choose between two unpalatable alternatives.  It may choose to limit todays decision by arbitrarily distinguishing a suspects age from other personal characteristicssuch as intelligence, education, occupation, or prior experience with law enforcementthat may also correlate with susceptibility to coercive pressures.  Or, if the Court is unwilling to draw these arbitrary lines, it will be forced to effect a fundamental transformation of the 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				custody testfrom a clear, easily applied prophylactic
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				rule into a highly fact-intensive standard resembling the voluntariness test that the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 Court found to be unsatisfactory.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				For at least three reasons, there is no need to go down this road.  First, many minors subjected to police interrogation are near the age of majority, and for these suspects the one-size-fits-all 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 custody rule may not be a bad fit.  Second, many of the difficulties in applying the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 custody rule to minors arise because of the unique circumstances present when the police conduct interrogations at school.  The 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 custody rule has always taken into account the setting in which questioning occurs, and accounting for the school setting in such cases will address many of these problems.  Third, in cases like the one now before us, where the suspect is especially young, courts applying the constitutional voluntariness standard can take special care to ensure that incriminating statements were not obtained through coercion.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Safeguarding the constitutional rights of minors does not require the extreme makeover of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 that todays decision may portend.

				The Courts rationale for importing age into the custody standard is that minors tend to lack adults capacity to exercise mature judgment and that failing to account for that reality will leave some minors unprotected under 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				in situations where they perceive themselves to be confined.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 10, 8.  I do not dispute that many suspects who are under 18 will be more susceptible to police pressure than the average adult.  As the Court notes, our pre-
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				cases were particularly attuned to this reality in applying the constitutional requirement of voluntariness in fact.

				332 U. S., at 599 (plurality opinion), and

				<em>
					over
				</em>
				 the age of 18 are also more susceptible to police pressure than the hypothetical reasonable person.  See 
				<em>
					Payne,

				 356 U. S., at 567 (fact that defendant was a mentally dull 19-year-old youth relevant in voluntariness inquiry).  Yet the

And 
				<em>
					Miranda

				The Court holds that age must be taken into account when it was known to the officer at the time of the interview, or when it would have been objectively apparent to a reasonable officer.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 11.  The first half of this test overturns the rule that the initial determination of custody does not depend on the subjective views harbored by . . . interrogating officers.  
				<em>
					Stansbury,
				</em>
				 511 U. S., at 323.  The second half will generate time-consuming satellite litigation over a reasonable officers perceptions.  When, as here, the interrogation takes place in school, the inquiry may be relatively simple.  But not all police questioning of minors takes place in schools.  In many cases, courts will presumably have to make findings as to whether a particular suspect had a sufficiently youthful look to alert a reasonable officer to the possibility that the suspect was under 18, or whether a reasonable officer would have recognized that a suspects I. D. was a fake.  The inquiry will be both time-consuming and disruptive for the police and the courts.  See 
				<em>
					Berkemer
				</em>
				, 468 U. S., at 432 (refusing to modify the custody test based on similar considerations).  It will also be made all the more complicated by the fact that a suspects dress and manner will often be different when the issue is litigated in court than it was at the time of the interrogation.

				Even after courts clear this initial hurdle, further problems will likely emerge as judges attempt to put themselves in the shoes of the average 16-year-old, or 15-year-old, or 13-year-old, as the case may be.  Consider, for example, a 60-year-old judge attempting to make a custody determination through the eyes of a hypothetical, average 15-year-old.  Forty-five years of personal experience and societal change separate this judge from the days when he or she was 15 years old.  And this judge may or may not have been an average 15-year-old.  The Courts answer to these difficulties is to state that no imaginative powers, knowledge of developmental psychology, [or] training in cognitive science will be necessary.  
				<em>
					Ante

				</em>
				 at 17.  It is obvious, however, that application of the Courts new rule demands much more than this.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Take a fairly typical case in which todays holding may make a difference.  A 16-year-old moves to suppress incriminating statements made prior to the administration of

				</em>
				 warnings.  The circumstances are such that, if the defendant were at least 18, the court would not find that he or she was in custody, but the defendant argues that a reasonable 16-year-old would view the situation differently.  The judge will not have the luxury of merely saying: It is common sense that a 16-year-old is not an 18-year-old.  Motion granted.  Rather, the judge will be required to determine whether the differences between a typical 16-year-old and a typical 18-year-old with respect to susceptibility to the pressures of interrogation are sufficient to change the outcome of the custody determination.  Todays opinion contains not a word of actual guidance as to how judges are supposed to go about making that determination.

Todays decision, by contrast, injects a new, complicating factor into what had been a clear, easily applied prophylactic rule.  See

				The Courts decision greatly diminishes the clarity and administrability that have long been recognized as principal advantages of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s prophylactic requirements.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 
				<em>

				As an initial matter, the difficulties that the Courts standard introduces will likely yield little added protection for most juvenile defendants.  Most juveniles who are subjected to police interrogation are teenagers nearing the age of majority.

				  These defendants reactions to police pressure are unlikely to be much different from the reaction of a typical 18-year-old in similar circumstances.  A one-size-fits-all 
				<em>

				</em>
				 custody rule thus provides a roughly reasonable fit for these defendants.

				In addition, many of the concerns that petitioner raises regarding the application of the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 custody rule to minors can be accommodated by considering the unique circumstances present when minors are questioned in school.  See Brief for Petitioner 1011 (reciting at length the factors petitioner believes to be relevant to the custody determination here, including the fact that petitioner was removed from class by a police officer, that the interview took place in a school conference room, and that a uniformed officer and a vice principal were present).  The
				<em>
					 Miranda
				</em>
				 custody rule has always taken into account the setting in which questioning occurs, restrictions on a suspects freedom of movement, and the presence of police officers or other authority figures.  See

				Finally, in cases like the one now before us, where the suspect is much younger than the typical juvenile defendant, courts should be instructed to take particular care to ensure that incriminating statements were not obtained involuntarily.  The voluntariness inquiry is flexible and accommodating by nature, see 
				<em>
					Schneckloth,
				</em>
				 412 U. S., at 224, and the Courts precedents already make clear that special care must be exercised in applying the voluntariness test where the confession of a mere child is at issue.

						 The Court claims that [n]ot once have any of our cases excluded from the custody analysis a circumstance that we determined was relevant and objective, simply to make the fault line between custodial and noncustodial brighter.   Ante, at 17.  Surely this is incorrect.  The very act of adopting a reasonable-person test necessarily excludes all sorts of relevant and objective circumstancesfor example, all the objective circumstances of a suspects life historythat might otherwise bear on a custody determination.

						 The Court also relies on North Carolinas concession at oral argument that a court could take into account a suspects blindness as a factor relevant to the Miranda custody determination.  Ante, at 15, and n. 9.  This is a far-fetched hypothetical, and neither the parties nor their amici cite any case in which such a problem has actually arisen.  Presumably such a case would involve a situation in which a blind defendant was given a typed document advising him that he [was] free to leave.  See Brief for Juvenile Law Center as Amicus Curiae 23.  In such a case, furnishing this advice in a form calculated to be unintelligible to the suspect would be tantamount to failing to provide the advice at all.  And advice by the police that a suspect is or is not free to leave at will has always been regarded as a circumstance regarding the conditions of the interrogation that must be taken into account in making the Miranda custody determination.

						 The Court thinks it would be absur[d] to consider the school setting without accounting for age, ante, at 12, but the real absurdity is for the Court to require police officers to get inside the head of a reasonable minor while making the quick, on-the-spot determinations that Miranda demands.

				s prophylactic regime places a high value on clarity and certainty.  Dissatisfied with the highly fact-specific constitutional rule against the admission of in-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				voluntary confessions, the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 Court set down rigid standards that often require courts to ignore personal characteristics that may be highly relevant to a particular suspects actual susceptibility to police pressure.  This rigidity, however, has brought with it one of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s principal strengthsthe ease and clarity of its application by law enforcement officials and courts.  See 
				<em>
					Moran

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">425</a>426 (1986)
.  A key contributor to this clarity, at least up until now, has been 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s objective reasonable-person test for determining custody.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s custody requirement is based on the proposition that the risk of unconstitutional coercion is heightened when a suspect is placed under formal arrest or is subjected to some functionally equivalent limitation on freedom of movement.  When this custodial threshold is reached, 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings must precede police questioning.  But in the interest of simplicity, the custody analysis considers only whether, under the circumstances, a hypothetical reasonable person would consider himself to be confined.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Many suspects, of course, will differ from this hypothetical reasonable person.  Some, including those who have been hardened by past interrogations, may have no need for 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings at all.  And for other suspectsthose who are unusually sensitive to the pressures of police questioning
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings may come too late to be of any use.  That is a necessary consequence of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s rigid standards, but it does not mean that the constitutional rights of these especially sensitive suspects are left unprotected.  A vulnerable defendant can still turn to the constitutional rule against 
				<em>
					actual 
				</em>
				coercion and contend that that his confession was extracted against his will.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Todays decision shifts the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 custody determination from a one-size-fits-all reasonable-person test into an inquiry that must account for at least one individualized characteristicagethat is thought to correlate with sus-ceptibility to coercive pressures.  Age, however, is in no way the only personal characteristic that may correlate with pliability, and in future cases the Court will be forced to choose between two unpalatable alternatives.  It may choose to limit todays decision by arbitrarily distinguishing a suspects age from other personal characteristicssuch as intelligence, education, occupation, or prior experience with law enforcementthat may also correlate with susceptibility to coercive pressures.  Or, if the Court is unwilling to draw these arbitrary lines, it will be forced to effect a fundamental transformation of the 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				custody testfrom a clear, easily applied prophylactic
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				rule into a highly fact-intensive standard resembling the voluntariness test that the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 Court found to be unsatisfactory.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				For at least three reasons, there is no need to go down this road.  First, many minors subjected to police interrogation are near the age of majority, and for these suspects the one-size-fits-all 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 custody rule may not be a bad fit.  Second, many of the difficulties in applying the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 custody rule to minors arise because of the unique circumstances present when the police conduct interrogations at school.  The 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 custody rule has always taken into account the setting in which questioning occurs, and accounting for the school setting in such cases will address many of these problems.  Third, in cases like the one now before us, where the suspect is especially young, courts applying the constitutional voluntariness standard can take special care to ensure that incriminating statements were not obtained through coercion.

        <p class="bodytext">

				The Courts rationale for importing age into the custody standard is that minors tend to lack adults capacity to exercise mature judgment and that failing to account for that reality will leave some minors unprotected under 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				in situations where they perceive themselves to be confined.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 10, 8.  I do not dispute that many suspects who are under 18 will be more susceptible to police pressure than the average adult.  As the Court notes, our pre-
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				cases were particularly attuned to this reality in applying the constitutional requirement of voluntariness in fact.  
				<em>

					Haley, 
				</em>
				332 U. S., at 599 (plurality opinion), and

				, 370 U. S., at 54).  It is no less a reality, however, that many persons 
				<em>
					over
				</em>
				 the age of 18 are also more susceptible to police pressure than the hypothetical reasonable person.  See 
				<em>
					Payne,
				</em>
				 356 U. S., at 567 (fact that defendant was a mentally dull 19-year-old youth relevant in voluntariness inquiry).  Yet the

				</em>
				custody standard has never accounted for the personal characteristics of these or any other individual defendants.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Indeed, it has always been the case under

				 that the unusually meek or compliant are subject to the same fixed rules, including the same custody requirement, as those who are unusually resistant to police pressure.  
				<em>

				s rigid standards are both overinclusive and underinclusive.  They are overinclusive to the extent that they provide a windfall to the most hardened and savvy of suspects, who often have no need for 
				<em>

				</em>
				s protections.  Compare 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, 
				<em>

And 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s requirements are underinclusive to the extent that they fail to account for frailties, idiosyncrasies, and other individualized considerations that might cause a person to bend more easily during a confrontation with the police.  See 
				<em>
					Alvarado

				, 541 U. S., at 662 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Members of this Court have seen this rigidity as a major weakness in

				The Court holds that age must be taken into account when it was known to the officer at the time of the interview, or when it would have been objectively apparent to a reasonable officer.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 11.  The first half of this test overturns the rule that the initial determination of custody does not depend on the subjective views harbored by . . . interrogating officers.  
				<em>
					Stansbury,
				</em>
				 511 U. S., at 323.  The second half will generate time-consuming satellite litigation over a reasonable officers perceptions.  When, as here, the interrogation takes place in school, the inquiry may be relatively simple.  But not all police questioning of minors takes place in schools.  In many cases, courts will presumably have to make findings as to whether a particular suspect had a sufficiently youthful look to alert a reasonable officer to the possibility that the suspect was under 18, or whether a reasonable officer would have recognized that a suspects I. D. was a fake.  The inquiry will be both time-consuming and disruptive for the police and the courts.  See 
				<em>
					Berkemer
				</em>
				, 468 U. S., at 432 (refusing to modify the custody test based on similar considerations).  It will also be made all the more complicated by the fact that a suspects dress and manner will often be different when the issue is litigated in court than it was at the time of the interrogation.

				Even after courts clear this initial hurdle, further problems will likely emerge as judges attempt to put themselves in the shoes of the average 16-year-old, or 15-year-old, or 13-year-old, as the case may be.  Consider, for example, a 60-year-old judge attempting to make a custody determination through the eyes of a hypothetical, average 15-year-old.  Forty-five years of personal experience and societal change separate this judge from the days when he or she was 15 years old.  And this judge may or may not have been an average 15-year-old.  The Courts answer to these difficulties is to state that no imaginative powers, knowledge of developmental psychology, [or] training in cognitive science will be necessary.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 17.  Judges simply need the common sense, the Court assures, to know that a 7-year-old is not a 13-year-old and neither is an adult.  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 17.  It is obvious, however, that application of the Courts new rule demands much more than this.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Take a fairly typical case in which todays holding may make a difference.  A 16-year-old moves to suppress incriminating statements made prior to the administration of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings.  The circumstances are such that, if the defendant were at least 18, the court would not find that he or she was in custody, but the defendant argues that a reasonable 16-year-old would view the situation differently.  The judge will not have the luxury of merely saying: It is common sense that a 16-year-old is not an 18-year-old.  Motion granted.  Rather, the judge will be required to determine whether the differences between a typical 16-year-old and a typical 18-year-old with respect to susceptibility to the pressures of interrogation are sufficient to change the outcome of the custody determination.  Todays opinion contains not a word of actual guidance as to how judges are supposed to go about making that determination.

				Petitioner and the Court attempt to show that this task is not unmanageable by pointing out that age is taken into account in other legal contexts.

				In addition, many of the concerns that petitioner raises regarding the application of the

				 custody rule to minors can be accommodated by considering the unique circumstances present when minors are questioned in school.  See Brief for Petitioner 1011 (reciting at length the factors petitioner believes to be relevant to the custody determination here, including the fact that petitioner was removed from class by a police officer, that the interview took place in a school conference room, and that a uniformed officer and a vice principal were present).  The

				Finally, in cases like the one now before us, where the suspect is much younger than the typical juvenile defendant, courts should be instructed to take particular care to ensure that incriminating statements were not obtained involuntarily.  The voluntariness inquiry is flexible and accommodating by nature, see 
				<em>
					Schneckloth,
				</em>
				 412 U. S., at 224, and the Courts precedents already make clear that special care must be exercised in applying the voluntariness test where the confession of a mere child is at issue.

						 The Court claims that [n]ot once have any of our cases excluded from the custody analysis a circumstance that we determined was relevant and objective, simply to make the fault line between custodial and noncustodial brighter.   Ante, at 17.  Surely this is incorrect.  The very act of adopting a reasonable-person test necessarily excludes all sorts of relevant and objective circumstancesfor example, all the objective circumstances of a suspects life historythat might otherwise bear on a custody determination.

						 The Court also relies on North Carolinas concession at oral argument that a court could take into account a suspects blindness as a factor relevant to the Miranda custody determination.  Ante, at 15, and n. 9.  This is a far-fetched hypothetical, and neither the parties nor their amici cite any case in which such a problem has actually arisen.  Presumably such a case would involve a situation in which a blind defendant was given a typed document advising him that he [was] free to leave.  See Brief for Juvenile Law Center as Amicus Curiae 23.  In such a case, furnishing this advice in a form calculated to be unintelligible to the suspect would be tantamount to failing to provide the advice at all.  And advice by the police that a suspect is or is not free to leave at will has always been regarded as a circumstance regarding the conditions of the interrogation that must be taken into account in making the Miranda custody determination.

				The Courts decision in this case may seem on first consideration to be modest and sensible, but in truth it
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				is neither.  It is fundamentally inconsistent with one of the main justifications for the 
				<em>
					Miranda&lt;footcall num="1"&gt;
				</em>
				 rule: the perceived need for a clear rule that can be easily applied in all cases.  And todays holding is not needed to protect the constitutional rights of minors who are questioned by the police.

        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s prophylactic regime places a high value on clarity and certainty.  Dissatisfied with the highly fact-specific constitutional rule against the admission of in-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				voluntary confessions, the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 Court set down rigid standards that often require courts to ignore personal characteristics that may be highly relevant to a particular suspects actual susceptibility to police pressure.  This rigidity, however, has brought with it one of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s principal strengthsthe ease and clarity of its application by law enforcement officials and courts.  See 
				<em>
					Moran
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Burbine
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/475/412" class="subref" title="subref">475 U. S. 412</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">425</a>426 (1986)
.  A key contributor to this clarity, at least up until now, has been 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s objective reasonable-person test for determining custody.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s custody requirement is based on the proposition that the risk of unconstitutional coercion is heightened when a suspect is placed under formal arrest or is subjected to some functionally equivalent limitation on freedom of movement.  When this custodial threshold is reached, 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings must precede police questioning.  But in the interest of simplicity, the custody analysis considers only whether, under the circumstances, a hypothetical reasonable person would consider himself to be confined.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Many suspects, of course, will differ from this hypothetical reasonable person.  Some, including those who have been hardened by past interrogations, may have no need for 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings at all.  And for other suspectsthose who are unusually sensitive to the pressures of police questioning
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings may come too late to be of any use.  That is a necessary consequence of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s rigid standards, but it does not mean that the constitutional rights of these especially sensitive suspects are left unprotected.  A vulnerable defendant can still turn to the constitutional rule against 
				<em>
					actual 
				</em>
				coercion and contend that that his confession was extracted against his will.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Todays decision shifts the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 custody determination from a one-size-fits-all reasonable-person test into an inquiry that must account for at least one individualized characteristicagethat is thought to correlate with sus-ceptibility to coercive pressures.  Age, however, is in no way the only personal characteristic that may correlate with pliability, and in future cases the Court will be forced to choose between two unpalatable alternatives.  It may choose to limit todays decision by arbitrarily distinguishing a suspects age from other personal characteristicssuch as intelligence, education, occupation, or prior experience with law enforcementthat may also correlate with susceptibility to coercive pressures.  Or, if the Court is unwilling to draw these arbitrary lines, it will be forced to effect a fundamental transformation of the 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				custody testfrom a clear, easily applied prophylactic
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				rule into a highly fact-intensive standard resembling the voluntariness test that the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 Court found to be unsatisfactory.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				For at least three reasons, there is no need to go down this road.  First, many minors subjected to police interrogation are near the age of majority, and for these suspects the one-size-fits-all 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 custody rule may not be a bad fit.  Second, many of the difficulties in applying the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 custody rule to minors arise because of the unique circumstances present when the police conduct interrogations at school.  The 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 custody rule has always taken into account the setting in which questioning occurs, and accounting for the school setting in such cases will address many of these problems.  Third, in cases like the one now before us, where the suspect is especially young, courts applying the constitutional voluntariness standard can take special care to ensure that incriminating statements were not obtained through coercion.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Safeguarding the constitutional rights of minors does not require the extreme makeover of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 that todays decision may portend.

				The glaring absence of reliance on personal characteristics in these and other custody cases should come as no surprise.  To account for such individualized considerations would be to contradict 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s central premise.  The 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 Courts decision to adopt its inflexible prophylactic requirements was expressly based on the notion that [a]ssessments of the knowledge the defendant possessed, based on information as to his age, education, intelligence, or prior contact with authorities, can never be more than speculation.  384 U.

				The Courts rationale for importing age into the custody standard is that minors tend to lack adults capacity to exercise mature judgment and that failing to account for that reality will leave some minors unprotected under 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				in situations where they perceive themselves to be confined.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 10, 8.  I do not dispute that many suspects who are under 18 will be more susceptible to police pressure than the average adult.  As the Court notes, our pre-
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				cases were particularly attuned to this reality in applying the constitutional requirement of voluntariness in fact.  
				<em>
					Ante,

					Haley, 
				</em>
				332 U. S., at 599 (plurality opinion), and 
				<em>
					Gallegos
				</em>
				, 370 U. S., at 54).  It is no less a reality, however, that many persons 
				<em>
					over
				</em>
				 the age of 18 are also more susceptible to police pressure than the hypothetical reasonable person.  See 
				<em>
					Payne,
				</em>
				 356 U. S., at 567 (fact that defendant was a mentally dull 19-year-old youth relevant in voluntariness inquiry).  Yet the 
				<em>

				</em>
				custody standard has never accounted for the personal characteristics of these or any other individual defendants.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Indeed, it has always been the case under

				<em>

				</em>
				s protections.  Compare 
				<em>

And 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s requirements are underinclusive to the extent that they fail to account for frailties, idiosyncrasies, and other individualized considerations that might cause a person to bend more easily during a confrontation with the police.  See 
				<em>
					Alvarado
				</em>
				, 541 U. S., at 662 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Members of this Court have seen this rigidity as a major weakness in

				That is undoubtedly why this Courts

				The Court holds that age must be taken into account when it was known to the officer at the time of the interview, or when it would have been objectively apparent to a reasonable officer.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 11.  The first half of this test overturns the rule that the initial determination of custody does not depend on the subjective views harbored by . . . interrogating officers.  
				<em>
					Stansbury,
				</em>
				 511 U. S., at 323.  The second half will generate time-consuming satellite litigation over a reasonable officers perceptions.  When, as here, the interrogation takes place in school, the inquiry may be relatively simple.  But not all police questioning of minors takes place in schools.  In many cases, courts will presumably have to make findings as to whether a particular suspect had a sufficiently youthful look to alert a reasonable officer to the possibility that the suspect was under 18, or whether a reasonable officer would have recognized that a suspects I. D. was a fake.  The inquiry will be both time-consuming and disruptive for the police and the courts.  See 
				<em>
					Berkemer
				</em>
				, 468 U. S., at 432 (refusing to modify the custody test based on similar considerations).  It will also be made all the more complicated by the fact that a suspects dress and manner will often be different when the issue is litigated in court than it was at the time of the interrogation.

				Even after courts clear this initial hurdle, further problems will likely emerge as judges attempt to put themselves in the shoes of the average 16-year-old, or 15-year-old, or 13-year-old, as the case may be.  Consider, for example, a 60-year-old judge attempting to make a custody determination through the eyes of a hypothetical, average 15-year-old.  Forty-five years of personal experience and societal change separate this judge from the days when he or she was 15 years old.  And this judge may or may not have been an average 15-year-old.  The Courts answer to these difficulties is to state that no imaginative powers, knowledge of developmental psychology, [or] training in cognitive science will be necessary.  
				<em>
					Ante

					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 17.  It is obvious, however, that application of the Courts new rule demands much more than this.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Take a fairly typical case in which todays holding may make a difference.  A 16-year-old moves to suppress incriminating statements made prior to the administration of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings.  The circumstances are such that, if the defendant were at least 18, the court would not find that he or she was in custody, but the defendant argues that a reasonable 16-year-old would view the situation differently.  The judge will not have the luxury of merely saying: It is common sense that a 16-year-old is not an 18-year-old.  Motion granted.  Rather, the judge will be required to determine whether the differences between a typical 16-year-old and a typical 18-year-old with respect to susceptibility to the pressures of interrogation are sufficient to change the outcome of the custody determination.  Todays opinion contains not a word of actual guidance as to how judges are supposed to go about making that determination.

				Petitioner and the Court attempt to show that this task is not unmanageable by pointing out that age is taken into account in other legal contexts.

				In addition, many of the concerns that petitioner raises regarding the application of the

				 custody rule to minors can be accommodated by considering the unique circumstances present when minors are questioned in school.  See Brief for Petitioner 1011 (reciting at length the factors petitioner believes to be relevant to the custody determination here, including the fact that petitioner was removed from class by a police officer, that the interview took place in a school conference room, and that a uniformed officer and a vice principal were present).  The

				Finally, in cases like the one now before us, where the suspect is much younger than the typical juvenile defendant, courts should be instructed to take particular care to ensure that incriminating statements were not obtained involuntarily.  The voluntariness inquiry is flexible and accommodating by nature, see 
				<em>
					Schneckloth,
				</em>
				 412 U. S., at 224, and the Courts precedents already make clear that special care must be exercised in applying the voluntariness test where the confession of a mere child is at issue.

						 The Court claims that [n]ot once have any of our cases excluded from the custody analysis a circumstance that we determined was relevant and objective, simply to make the fault line between custodial and noncustodial brighter.   Ante, at 17.  Surely this is incorrect.  The very act of adopting a reasonable-person test necessarily excludes all sorts of relevant and objective circumstancesfor example, all the objective circumstances of a suspects life historythat might otherwise bear on a custody determination.

						 The Court also relies on North Carolinas concession at oral argument that a court could take into account a suspects blindness as a factor relevant to the Miranda custody determination.  Ante, at 15, and n. 9.  This is a far-fetched hypothetical, and neither the parties nor their amici cite any case in which such a problem has actually arisen.  Presumably such a case would involve a situation in which a blind defendant was given a typed document advising him that he [was] free to leave.  See Brief for Juvenile Law Center as Amicus Curiae 23.  In such a case, furnishing this advice in a form calculated to be unintelligible to the suspect would be tantamount to failing to provide the advice at all.  And advice by the police that a suspect is or is not free to leave at will has always been regarded as a circumstance regarding the conditions of the interrogation that must be taken into account in making the Miranda custody determination.

						 The Court thinks it would be absur[d] to consider the school setting without accounting for age, ante, at 12, but the real absurdity is for the Court to require police officers to get inside the head of a reasonable minor while making the quick, on-the-spot determinations that Miranda demands.

				The Courts decision in this case may seem on first consideration to be modest and sensible, but in truth it

            <em>

				s prophylactic regime places a high value on clarity and certainty.  Dissatisfied with the highly fact-specific constitutional rule against the admission of in-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				voluntary confessions, the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 Court set down rigid standards that often require courts to ignore personal characteristics that may be highly relevant to a particular suspects actual susceptibility to police pressure.  This rigidity, however, has brought with it one of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s principal strengthsthe ease and clarity of its application by law enforcement officials and courts.  See 
				<em>
					Moran
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/475/412" class="subref" title="subref">475 U. S. 412</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">425</a>426 (1986)
.  A key contributor to this clarity, at least up until now, has been 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s objective reasonable-person test for determining custody.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s custody requirement is based on the proposition that the risk of unconstitutional coercion is heightened when a suspect is placed under formal arrest or is subjected to some functionally equivalent limitation on freedom of movement.  When this custodial threshold is reached, 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings must precede police questioning.  But in the interest of simplicity, the custody analysis considers only whether, under the circumstances, a hypothetical reasonable person would consider himself to be confined.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Many suspects, of course, will differ from this hypothetical reasonable person.  Some, including those who have been hardened by past interrogations, may have no need for 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings at all.  And for other suspectsthose who are unusually sensitive to the pressures of police questioning
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings may come too late to be of any use.  That is a necessary consequence of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s rigid standards, but it does not mean that the constitutional rights of these especially sensitive suspects are left unprotected.  A vulnerable defendant can still turn to the constitutional rule against 
				<em>
					actual 
				</em>
				coercion and contend that that his confession was extracted against his will.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Todays decision shifts the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 custody determination from a one-size-fits-all reasonable-person test into an inquiry that must account for at least one individualized characteristicagethat is thought to correlate with sus-ceptibility to coercive pressures.  Age, however, is in no way the only personal characteristic that may correlate with pliability, and in future cases the Court will be forced to choose between two unpalatable alternatives.  It may choose to limit todays decision by arbitrarily distinguishing a suspects age from other personal characteristicssuch as intelligence, education, occupation, or prior experience with law enforcementthat may also correlate with susceptibility to coercive pressures.  Or, if the Court is unwilling to draw these arbitrary lines, it will be forced to effect a fundamental transformation of the 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				custody testfrom a clear, easily applied prophylactic
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				rule into a highly fact-intensive standard resembling the voluntariness test that the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 Court found to be unsatisfactory.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				For at least three reasons, there is no need to go down this road.  First, many minors subjected to police interrogation are near the age of majority, and for these suspects the one-size-fits-all 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 custody rule may not be a bad fit.  Second, many of the difficulties in applying the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 custody rule to minors arise because of the unique circumstances present when the police conduct interrogations at school.  The 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 custody rule has always taken into account the setting in which questioning occurs, and accounting for the school setting in such cases will address many of these problems.  Third, in cases like the one now before us, where the suspect is especially young, courts applying the constitutional voluntariness standard can take special care to ensure that incriminating statements were not obtained through coercion.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Safeguarding the constitutional rights of minors does not require the extreme makeover of

				The glaring absence of reliance on personal characteristics in these and other custody cases should come as no surprise.  To account for such individualized considerations would be to contradict

				The Courts rationale for importing age into the custody standard is that minors tend to lack adults capacity to exercise mature judgment and that failing to account for that reality will leave some minors unprotected under 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				in situations where they perceive themselves to be confined.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 10, 8.  I do not dispute that many suspects who are under 18 will be more susceptible to police pressure than the average adult.  As the Court notes, our pre-
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				cases were particularly attuned to this reality in applying the constitutional requirement of voluntariness in fact.  
				<em>
					Ante,

				 at 9 (relying on 
				<em>
					Haley, 
				</em>
				332 U. S., at 599 (plurality opinion), and 
				<em>
					Gallegos
				</em>
				, 370 U. S., at 54).  It is no less a reality, however, that many persons 
				<em>
					over
				</em>
				 the age of 18 are also more susceptible to police pressure than the hypothetical reasonable person.  See 
				<em>
					Payne,
				</em>
				 356 U. S., at 567 (fact that defendant was a mentally dull 19-year-old youth relevant in voluntariness inquiry).  Yet the 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				custody standard has never accounted for the personal characteristics of these or any other individual defendants.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Indeed, it has always been the case under 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 that the unusually meek or compliant are subject to the same fixed rules, including the same custody requirement, as those who are unusually resistant to police pressure.  
				<em>
					Berkemer

				, 468 U. S., at 442, and n. 35 ([O]nly relevant inquiry is how a reasonable man in the suspects position would have understood his situation).  
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s rigid standards are both overinclusive and underinclusive.  They are overinclusive to the extent that they provide a windfall to the most hardened and savvy of suspects, who often have no need for 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s protections.  Compare 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra

And 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s requirements are underinclusive to the extent that they fail to account for frailties, idiosyncrasies, and other individualized considerations that might cause a person to bend more easily during a confrontation with the police.  See 
				<em>
					Alvarado
				</em>
				, 541 U. S., at 662 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Members of this Court have seen this rigidity as a major weakness in

				That is undoubtedly why this Courts

				at 666.  And unless the

				The Court holds that age must be taken into account when it was known to the officer at the time of the interview, or when it would have been objectively apparent to a reasonable officer.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 11.  The first half of this test overturns the rule that the initial determination of custody does not depend on the subjective views harbored by . . . interrogating officers.  
				<em>
					Stansbury,
				</em>
				 511 U. S., at 323.  The second half will generate time-consuming satellite litigation over a reasonable officers perceptions.  When, as here, the interrogation takes place in school, the inquiry may be relatively simple.  But not all police questioning of minors takes place in schools.  In many cases, courts will presumably have to make findings as to whether a particular suspect had a sufficiently youthful look to alert a reasonable officer to the possibility that the suspect was under 18, or whether a reasonable officer would have recognized that a suspects I. D. was a fake.  The inquiry will be both time-consuming and disruptive for the police and the courts.  See 
				<em>
					Berkemer
				</em>
				, 468 U. S., at 432 (refusing to modify the custody test based on similar considerations).  It will also be made all the more complicated by the fact that a suspects dress and manner will often be different when the issue is litigated in court than it was at the time of the interrogation.

				Even after courts clear this initial hurdle, further problems will likely emerge as judges attempt to put themselves in the shoes of the average 16-year-old, or 15-year-old, or 13-year-old, as the case may be.  Consider, for example, a 60-year-old judge attempting to make a custody determination through the eyes of a hypothetical, average 15-year-old.  Forty-five years of personal experience and societal change separate this judge from the days when he or she was 15 years old.  And this judge may or may not have been an average 15-year-old.  The Courts answer to these difficulties is to state that no imaginative powers, knowledge of developmental psychology, [or] training in cognitive science will be necessary.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 17.  Judges simply need the common sense, the Court assures, to know that a 7-year-old is not a 13-year-old and neither is an adult.  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 17.  It is obvious, however, that application of the Courts new rule demands much more than this.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Take a fairly typical case in which todays holding may make a difference.  A 16-year-old moves to suppress incriminating statements made prior to the administration of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings.  The circumstances are such that, if the defendant were at least 18, the court would not find that he or she was in custody, but the defendant argues that a reasonable 16-year-old would view the situation differently.  The judge will not have the luxury of merely saying: It is common sense that a 16-year-old is not an 18-year-old.  Motion granted.  Rather, the judge will be required to determine whether the differences between a typical 16-year-old and a typical 18-year-old with respect to susceptibility to the pressures of interrogation are sufficient to change the outcome of the custody determination.  Todays opinion contains not a word of actual guidance as to how judges are supposed to go about making that determination.

				Petitioner and the Court attempt to show that this task is not unmanageable by pointing out that age is taken into account in other legal contexts.  In particular, the Court relies on the fact that the age of a defendant is a relevant factor under the reasonable-person standard applicable in negligence suits.

				As an initial matter, the difficulties that the Courts standard introduces will likely yield little added protection for most juvenile defendants.  Most juveniles who are subjected to police interrogation are teenagers nearing the age of majority.

				In addition, many of the concerns that petitioner raises regarding the application of the

				 custody rule to minors can be accommodated by considering the unique circumstances present when minors are questioned in school.  See Brief for Petitioner 1011 (reciting at length the factors petitioner believes to be relevant to the custody determination here, including the fact that petitioner was removed from class by a police officer, that the interview took place in a school conference room, and that a uniformed officer and a vice principal were present).  The
				<em>

				 custody rule has always taken into account the setting in which questioning occurs, restrictions on a suspects freedom of movement, and the presence of police officers or other authority figures.  See

				Finally, in cases like the one now before us, where the suspect is much younger than the typical juvenile defendant, courts should be instructed to take particular care to ensure that incriminating statements were not obtained involuntarily.  The voluntariness inquiry is flexible and accommodating by nature, see 
				<em>
					Schneckloth,
				</em>
				 412 U. S., at 224, and the Courts precedents already make clear that special care must be exercised in applying the voluntariness test where the confession of a mere child is at issue.

						 The Court claims that [n]ot once have any of our cases excluded from the custody analysis a circumstance that we determined was relevant and objective, simply to make the fault line between custodial and noncustodial brighter.   Ante, at 17.  Surely this is incorrect.  The very act of adopting a reasonable-person test necessarily excludes all sorts of relevant and objective circumstancesfor example, all the objective circumstances of a suspects life historythat might otherwise bear on a custody determination.

						 The Court also relies on North Carolinas concession at oral argument that a court could take into account a suspects blindness as a factor relevant to the Miranda custody determination.  Ante, at 15, and n. 9.  This is a far-fetched hypothetical, and neither the parties nor their amici cite any case in which such a problem has actually arisen.  Presumably such a case would involve a situation in which a blind defendant was given a typed document advising him that he [was] free to leave.  See Brief for Juvenile Law Center as Amicus Curiae 23.  In such a case, furnishing this advice in a form calculated to be unintelligible to the suspect would be tantamount to failing to provide the advice at all.  And advice by the police that a suspect is or is not free to leave at will has always been regarded as a circumstance regarding the conditions of the interrogation that must be taken into account in making the Miranda custody determination.

				</em>
				s prophylactic regime places a high value on clarity and certainty.  Dissatisfied with the highly fact-specific constitutional rule against the admission of in-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				voluntary confessions, the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 Court set down rigid standards that often require courts to ignore personal characteristics that may be highly relevant to a particular suspects actual susceptibility to police pressure.  This rigidity, however, has brought with it one of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s principal strengthsthe ease and clarity of its application by law enforcement officials and courts.  See 
				<em>
					Moran
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Burbine
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/475/412" class="subref" title="subref">475 U. S. 412</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">425</a>426 (1986)
.  A key contributor to this clarity, at least up until now, has been 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s objective reasonable-person test for determining custody.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s custody requirement is based on the proposition that the risk of unconstitutional coercion is heightened when a suspect is placed under formal arrest or is subjected to some functionally equivalent limitation on freedom of movement.  When this custodial threshold is reached, 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings must precede police questioning.  But in the interest of simplicity, the custody analysis considers only whether, under the circumstances, a hypothetical reasonable person would consider himself to be confined.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Many suspects, of course, will differ from this hypothetical reasonable person.  Some, including those who have been hardened by past interrogations, may have no need for 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings at all.  And for other suspectsthose who are unusually sensitive to the pressures of police questioning
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings may come too late to be of any use.  That is a necessary consequence of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s rigid standards, but it does not mean that the constitutional rights of these especially sensitive suspects are left unprotected.  A vulnerable defendant can still turn to the constitutional rule against 
				<em>
					actual 
				</em>
				coercion and contend that that his confession was extracted against his will.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Todays decision shifts the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 custody determination from a one-size-fits-all reasonable-person test into an inquiry that must account for at least one individualized characteristicagethat is thought to correlate with sus-ceptibility to coercive pressures.  Age, however, is in no way the only personal characteristic that may correlate with pliability, and in future cases the Court will be forced to choose between two unpalatable alternatives.  It may choose to limit todays decision by arbitrarily distinguishing a suspects age from other personal characteristicssuch as intelligence, education, occupation, or prior experience with law enforcementthat may also correlate with susceptibility to coercive pressures.  Or, if the Court is unwilling to draw these arbitrary lines, it will be forced to effect a fundamental transformation of the 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				custody testfrom a clear, easily applied prophylactic
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				rule into a highly fact-intensive standard resembling the voluntariness test that the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 Court found to be unsatisfactory.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				For at least three reasons, there is no need to go down this road.  First, many minors subjected to police interrogation are near the age of majority, and for these suspects the one-size-fits-all 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 custody rule may not be a bad fit.  Second, many of the difficulties in applying the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 custody rule to minors arise because of the unique circumstances present when the police conduct interrogations at school.  The 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 custody rule has always taken into account the setting in which questioning occurs, and accounting for the school setting in such cases will address many of these problems.  Third, in cases like the one now before us, where the suspect is especially young, courts applying the constitutional voluntariness standard can take special care to ensure that incriminating statements were not obtained through coercion.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Safeguarding the constitutional rights of minors does not require the extreme makeover of 
				<em>

				 that todays decision may portend.

				The Courts rationale for importing age into the custody standard is that minors tend to lack adults capacity to exercise mature judgment and that failing to account for that reality will leave some minors unprotected under 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				in situations where they perceive themselves to be confined.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 10, 8.  I do not dispute that many suspects who are under 18 will be more susceptible to police pressure than the average adult.  As the Court notes, our pre-
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				cases were particularly attuned to this reality in applying the constitutional requirement of voluntariness in fact.

				<em>
					over

				 the age of 18 are also more susceptible to police pressure than the hypothetical reasonable person.  See 
				<em>
					Payne,

				<em>

				The Court holds that age must be taken into account when it was known to the officer at the time of the interview, or when it would have been objectively apparent to a reasonable officer.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 11.  The first half of this test overturns the rule that the initial determination of custody does not depend on the subjective views harbored by . . . interrogating officers.  
				<em>
					Stansbury,
				</em>
				 511 U. S., at 323.  The second half will generate time-consuming satellite litigation over a reasonable officers perceptions.  When, as here, the interrogation takes place in school, the inquiry may be relatively simple.  But not all police questioning of minors takes place in schools.  In many cases, courts will presumably have to make findings as to whether a particular suspect had a sufficiently youthful look to alert a reasonable officer to the possibility that the suspect was under 18, or whether a reasonable officer would have recognized that a suspects I. D. was a fake.  The inquiry will be both time-consuming and disruptive for the police and the courts.  See 
				<em>
					Berkemer
				</em>
				, 468 U. S., at 432 (refusing to modify the custody test based on similar considerations).  It will also be made all the more complicated by the fact that a suspects dress and manner will often be different when the issue is litigated in court than it was at the time of the interrogation.

				Even after courts clear this initial hurdle, further problems will likely emerge as judges attempt to put themselves in the shoes of the average 16-year-old, or 15-year-old, or 13-year-old, as the case may be.  Consider, for example, a 60-year-old judge attempting to make a custody determination through the eyes of a hypothetical, average 15-year-old.  Forty-five years of personal experience and societal change separate this judge from the days when he or she was 15 years old.  And this judge may or may not have been an average 15-year-old.  The Courts answer to these difficulties is to state that no imaginative powers, knowledge of developmental psychology, [or] training in cognitive science will be necessary.  
				<em>
					Ante

				Take a fairly typical case in which todays holding may make a difference.  A 16-year-old moves to suppress incriminating statements made prior to the administration of

				</em>
				 warnings.  The circumstances are such that, if the defendant were at least 18, the court would not find that he or she was in custody, but the defendant argues that a reasonable 16-year-old would view the situation differently.  The judge will not have the luxury of merely saying: It is common sense that a 16-year-old is not an 18-year-old.  Motion granted.  Rather, the judge will be required to determine whether the differences between a typical 16-year-old and a typical 18-year-old with respect to susceptibility to the pressures of interrogation are sufficient to change the outcome of the custody determination.

				Finally, in cases like the one now before us, where the suspect is much younger than the typical juvenile defendant, courts should be instructed to take particular care to ensure that incriminating statements were not obtained involuntarily.  The voluntariness inquiry is flexible and accommodating by nature, see 
				<em>
					Schneckloth,
				</em>
				 412 U. S., at 224, and the Courts precedents already make clear that special care must be exercised in applying the voluntariness test where the confession of a mere child is at issue.

						 The Court claims that [n]ot once have any of our cases excluded from the custody analysis a circumstance that we determined was relevant and objective, simply to make the fault line between custodial and noncustodial brighter.   Ante, at 17.  Surely this is incorrect.  The very act of adopting a reasonable-person test necessarily excludes all sorts of relevant and objective circumstancesfor example, all the objective circumstances of a suspects life historythat might otherwise bear on a custody determination.

						 The Court also relies on North Carolinas concession at oral argument that a court could take into account a suspects blindness as a factor relevant to the Miranda custody determination.  Ante, at 15, and n. 9.  This is a far-fetched hypothetical, and neither the parties nor their amici cite any case in which such a problem has actually arisen.  Presumably such a case would involve a situation in which a blind defendant was given a typed document advising him that he [was] free to leave.  See Brief for Juvenile Law Center as Amicus Curiae 23.  In such a case, furnishing this advice in a form calculated to be unintelligible to the suspect would be tantamount to failing to provide the advice at all.  And advice by the police that a suspect is or is not free to leave at will has always been regarded as a circumstance regarding the conditions of the interrogation that must be taken into account in making the Miranda custody determination.

						 The Court thinks it would be absur[d] to consider the school setting without accounting for age, ante, at 12, but the real absurdity is for the Court to require police officers to get inside the head of a reasonable minor while making the quick, on-the-spot determinations that Miranda demands.

				The Courts decision in this case may seem on first consideration to be modest and sensible, but in truth it

				is neither.  It is fundamentally inconsistent with one of the main justifications for the 
				<em>

            <em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s prophylactic regime places a high value on clarity and certainty.  Dissatisfied with the highly fact-specific constitutional rule against the admission of in-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				voluntary confessions, the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 Court set down rigid standards that often require courts to ignore personal characteristics that may be highly relevant to a particular suspects actual susceptibility to police pressure.  This rigidity, however, has brought with it one of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s principal strengthsthe ease and clarity of its application by law enforcement officials and courts.  See 
				<em>
					Moran
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Burbine

				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/475/412" class="subref" title="subref">475 U. S. 412</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">425</a>426 (1986)
.  A key contributor to this clarity, at least up until now, has been 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s objective reasonable-person test for determining custody.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s custody requirement is based on the proposition that the risk of unconstitutional coercion is heightened when a suspect is placed under formal arrest or is subjected to some functionally equivalent limitation on freedom of movement.  When this custodial threshold is reached, 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings must precede police questioning.  But in the interest of simplicity, the custody analysis considers only whether, under the circumstances, a hypothetical reasonable person would consider himself to be confined.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Many suspects, of course, will differ from this hypothetical reasonable person.  Some, including those who have been hardened by past interrogations, may have no need for 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings at all.  And for other suspectsthose who are unusually sensitive to the pressures of police questioning
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings may come too late to be of any use.  That is a necessary consequence of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s rigid standards, but it does not mean that the constitutional rights of these especially sensitive suspects are left unprotected.  A vulnerable defendant can still turn to the constitutional rule against 
				<em>
					actual 
				</em>
				coercion and contend that that his confession was extracted against his will.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Todays decision shifts the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 custody determination from a one-size-fits-all reasonable-person test into an inquiry that must account for at least one individualized characteristicagethat is thought to correlate with sus-ceptibility to coercive pressures.  Age, however, is in no way the only personal characteristic that may correlate with pliability, and in future cases the Court will be forced to choose between two unpalatable alternatives.  It may choose to limit todays decision by arbitrarily distinguishing a suspects age from other personal characteristicssuch as intelligence, education, occupation, or prior experience with law enforcementthat may also correlate with susceptibility to coercive pressures.  Or, if the Court is unwilling to draw these arbitrary lines, it will be forced to effect a fundamental transformation of the 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				custody testfrom a clear, easily applied prophylactic
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				rule into a highly fact-intensive standard resembling the voluntariness test that the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 Court found to be unsatisfactory.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				For at least three reasons, there is no need to go down this road.  First, many minors subjected to police interrogation are near the age of majority, and for these suspects the one-size-fits-all 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 custody rule may not be a bad fit.  Second, many of the difficulties in applying the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 custody rule to minors arise because of the unique circumstances present when the police conduct interrogations at school.  The 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 custody rule has always taken into account the setting in which questioning occurs, and accounting for the school setting in such cases will address many of these problems.  Third, in cases like the one now before us, where the suspect is especially young, courts applying the constitutional voluntariness standard can take special care to ensure that incriminating statements were not obtained through coercion.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Safeguarding the constitutional rights of minors does not require the extreme makeover of 
				<em>

				The glaring absence of reliance on personal characteristics in these and other custody cases should come as no surprise.  To account for such individualized considerations would be to contradict

				The Courts rationale for importing age into the custody standard is that minors tend to lack adults capacity to exercise mature judgment and that failing to account for that reality will leave some minors unprotected under 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				in situations where they perceive themselves to be confined.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 10, 8.  I do not dispute that many suspects who are under 18 will be more susceptible to police pressure than the average adult.  As the Court notes, our pre-
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				cases were particularly attuned to this reality in applying the constitutional requirement of voluntariness in fact.  
				<em>
					Ante,

				 at 9 (relying on 
				<em>
					Haley, 
				</em>
				332 U. S., at 599 (plurality opinion), and 
				<em>
					Gallegos
				</em>
				, 370 U. S., at 54).  It is no less a reality, however, that many persons 
				<em>
					over
				</em>
				 the age of 18 are also more susceptible to police pressure than the hypothetical reasonable person.  See 
				<em>
					Payne,
				</em>
				 356 U. S., at 567 (fact that defendant was a mentally dull 19-year-old youth relevant in voluntariness inquiry).  Yet the 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				custody standard has never accounted for the personal characteristics of these or any other individual defendants.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Indeed, it has always been the case under 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 that the unusually meek or compliant are subject to the same fixed rules, including the same custody requirement, as those who are unusually resistant to police pressure.  
				<em>
					Berkemer
				</em>
				, 468 U. S., at 442, and n. 35 ([O]nly relevant inquiry is how a reasonable man in the suspects position would have understood his situation).  
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s rigid standards are both overinclusive and underinclusive.  They are overinclusive to the extent that they provide a windfall to the most hardened and savvy of suspects, who often have no need for 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s protections.  Compare 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra

 (White, J., dissenting) (Where the defendant himself [w]as a lawyer, policeman, professional criminal, or otherwise has become aware of what his right to silence is, it is sheer fancy to assert that his answer to every question asked him is compelled unless he is advised of those rights with which he is already intimately familiar).  And 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s requirements are underinclusive to the extent that they fail to account for frailties, idiosyncrasies, and other individualized considerations that might cause a person to bend more easily during a confrontation with the police.  See 
				<em>
					Alvarado
				</em>
				, 541 U. S., at 662 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Members of this Court have seen this rigidity as a major weakness in

				</em>
				s code of rules for confessions.  See 384 U. S., at 504 (Harlan, J., dissenting); 
				<em>

				That is undoubtedly why this Courts

					Alvarado
				</em>
				,

				</em>
				at 666.  And unless the
				<em>
					 Miranda
				</em>
				 custody rule is now to be radically transformed into one that takes into account the wide range of individual characteristics that are relevant in determining whether a confession is voluntary, the Court must shoulder the burden of explaining why age is different from these other personal characteristics.

				The Court holds that age must be taken into account when it was known to the officer at the time of the interview, or when it would have been objectively apparent to a reasonable officer.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 11.  The first half of this test overturns the rule that the initial determination of custody does not depend on the subjective views harbored by . . . interrogating officers.  
				<em>
					Stansbury,
				</em>
				 511 U. S., at 323.  The second half will generate time-consuming satellite litigation over a reasonable officers perceptions.  When, as here, the interrogation takes place in school, the inquiry may be relatively simple.  But not all police questioning of minors takes place in schools.  In many cases, courts will presumably have to make findings as to whether a particular suspect had a sufficiently youthful look to alert a reasonable officer to the possibility that the suspect was under 18, or whether a reasonable officer would have recognized that a suspects I. D. was a fake.  The inquiry will be both time-consuming and disruptive for the police and the courts.  See 
				<em>
					Berkemer
				</em>
				, 468 U. S., at 432 (refusing to modify the custody test based on similar considerations).  It will also be made all the more complicated by the fact that a suspects dress and manner will often be different when the issue is litigated in court than it was at the time of the interrogation.

				Even after courts clear this initial hurdle, further problems will likely emerge as judges attempt to put themselves in the shoes of the average 16-year-old, or 15-year-old, or 13-year-old, as the case may be.  Consider, for example, a 60-year-old judge attempting to make a custody determination through the eyes of a hypothetical, average 15-year-old.  Forty-five years of personal experience and societal change separate this judge from the days when he or she was 15 years old.  And this judge may or may not have been an average 15-year-old.  The Courts answer to these difficulties is to state that no imaginative powers, knowledge of developmental psychology, [or] training in cognitive science will be necessary.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 17.  Judges simply need the common sense, the Court assures, to know that a 7-year-old is not a 13-year-old and neither is an adult.  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 17.  It is obvious, however, that application of the Courts new rule demands much more than this.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Take a fairly typical case in which todays holding may make a difference.  A 16-year-old moves to suppress incriminating statements made prior to the administration of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings.  The circumstances are such that, if the defendant were at least 18, the court would not find that he or she was in custody, but the defendant argues that a reasonable 16-year-old would view the situation differently.  The judge will not have the luxury of merely saying: It is common sense that a 16-year-old is not an 18-year-old.  Motion granted.  Rather, the judge will be required to determine whether the differences between a typical 16-year-old and a typical 18-year-old with respect to susceptibility to the pressures of interrogation are sufficient to change the outcome of the custody determination.  Todays opinion contains not a word of actual guidance as to how judges are supposed to go about making that determination.

				Petitioner and the Court attempt to show that this task is not unmanageable by pointing out that age is taken into account in other legal contexts.

				In addition, many of the concerns that petitioner raises regarding the application of the

				 custody rule to minors can be accommodated by considering the unique circumstances present when minors are questioned in school.  See Brief for Petitioner 1011 (reciting at length the factors petitioner believes to be relevant to the custody determination here, including the fact that petitioner was removed from class by a police officer, that the interview took place in a school conference room, and that a uniformed officer and a vice principal were present).  The

				Finally, in cases like the one now before us, where the suspect is much younger than the typical juvenile defendant, courts should be instructed to take particular care to ensure that incriminating statements were not obtained involuntarily.  The voluntariness inquiry is flexible and accommodating by nature, see 
				<em>
					Schneckloth,
				</em>
				 412 U. S., at 224, and the Courts precedents already make clear that special care must be exercised in applying the voluntariness test where the confession of a mere child is at issue.

						 The Court claims that [n]ot once have any of our cases excluded from the custody analysis a circumstance that we determined was relevant and objective, simply to make the fault line between custodial and noncustodial brighter.   Ante, at 17.  Surely this is incorrect.  The very act of adopting a reasonable-person test necessarily excludes all sorts of relevant and objective circumstancesfor example, all the objective circumstances of a suspects life historythat might otherwise bear on a custody determination.

						 The Court also relies on North Carolinas concession at oral argument that a court could take into account a suspects blindness as a factor relevant to the Miranda custody determination.  Ante, at 15, and n. 9.  This is a far-fetched hypothetical, and neither the parties nor their amici cite any case in which such a problem has actually arisen.  Presumably such a case would involve a situation in which a blind defendant was given a typed document advising him that he [was] free to leave.  See Brief for Juvenile Law Center as Amicus Curiae 23.  In such a case, furnishing this advice in a form calculated to be unintelligible to the suspect would be tantamount to failing to provide the advice at all.  And advice by the police that a suspect is or is not free to leave at will has always been regarded as a circumstance regarding the conditions of the interrogation that must be taken into account in making the Miranda custody determination.

				</em>
				s rigid standards, but it does not mean that the constitutional rights of these especially sensitive suspects are left unprotected.  A vulnerable defendant can still turn to the constitutional rule against

				Todays decision shifts the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 custody determination from a one-size-fits-all reasonable-person test into an inquiry that must account for at least one individualized characteristicagethat is thought to correlate with sus-ceptibility to coercive pressures.  Age, however, is in no way the only personal characteristic that may correlate with pliability, and in future cases the Court will be forced to choose between two unpalatable alternatives.  It may choose to limit todays decision by arbitrarily distinguishing a suspects age from other personal characteristicssuch as intelligence, education, occupation, or prior experience with law enforcementthat may also correlate with susceptibility to coercive pressures.  Or, if the Court is unwilling to draw these arbitrary lines, it will be forced to effect a fundamental transformation of the 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				custody testfrom a clear, easily applied prophylactic
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				rule into a highly fact-intensive standard resembling the voluntariness test that the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 Court found to be unsatisfactory.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				For at least three reasons, there is no need to go down this road.  First, many minors subjected to police interrogation are near the age of majority, and for these suspects the one-size-fits-all 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 custody rule may not be a bad fit.  Second, many of the difficulties in applying the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 custody rule to minors arise because of the unique circumstances present when the police conduct interrogations at school.  The 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 custody rule has always taken into account the setting in which questioning occurs, and accounting for the school setting in such cases will address many of these problems.  Third, in cases like the one now before us, where the suspect is especially young, courts applying the constitutional voluntariness standard can take special care to ensure that incriminating statements were not obtained through coercion.

				The Courts rationale for importing age into the custody standard is that minors tend to lack adults capacity to exercise mature judgment and that failing to account for that reality will leave some minors unprotected under 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				in situations where they perceive themselves to be confined.  See 
				<em>

				, at 10, 8.  I do not dispute that many suspects who are under 18 will be more susceptible to police pressure than the average adult.  As the Court notes, our pre-
				<em>
					Miranda

				cases were particularly attuned to this reality in applying the constitutional requirement of voluntariness in fact.

				<em>
					over

				 the age of 18 are also more susceptible to police pressure than the hypothetical reasonable person.  See 
				<em>

				The Court holds that age must be taken into account when it was known to the officer at the time of the interview, or when it would have been objectively apparent to a reasonable officer.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 11.  The first half of this test overturns the rule that the initial determination of custody does not depend on the subjective views harbored by . . . interrogating officers.  
				<em>
					Stansbury,
				</em>
				 511 U. S., at 323.  The second half will generate time-consuming satellite litigation over a reasonable officers perceptions.  When, as here, the interrogation takes place in school, the inquiry may be relatively simple.  But not all police questioning of minors takes place in schools.  In many cases, courts will presumably have to make findings as to whether a particular suspect had a sufficiently youthful look to alert a reasonable officer to the possibility that the suspect was under 18, or whether a reasonable officer would have recognized that a suspects I. D. was a fake.  The inquiry will be both time-consuming and disruptive for the police and the courts.  See 
				<em>
					Berkemer
				</em>
				, 468 U. S., at 432 (refusing to modify the custody test based on similar considerations).  It will also be made all the more complicated by the fact that a suspects dress and manner will often be different when the issue is litigated in court than it was at the time of the interrogation.

				Even after courts clear this initial hurdle, further problems will likely emerge as judges attempt to put themselves in the shoes of the average 16-year-old, or 15-year-old, or 13-year-old, as the case may be.  Consider, for example, a 60-year-old judge attempting to make a custody determination through the eyes of a hypothetical, average 15-year-old.  Forty-five years of personal experience and societal change separate this judge from the days when he or she was 15 years old.  And this judge may or may not have been an average 15-year-old.  The Courts answer to these difficulties is to state that no imaginative powers, knowledge of developmental psychology, [or] training in cognitive science will be necessary.  
				<em>
					Ante

				 at 17.  It is obvious, however, that application of the Courts new rule demands much more than this.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Take a fairly typical case in which todays holding may make a difference.  A 16-year-old moves to suppress incriminating statements made prior to the administration of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings.  The circumstances are such that, if the defendant were at least 18, the court would not find that he or she was in custody, but the defendant argues that a reasonable 16-year-old would view the situation differently.  The judge will not have the luxury of merely saying: It is common sense that a 16-year-old is not an 18-year-old.  Motion granted.  Rather, the judge will be required to determine whether the differences between a typical 16-year-old and a typical 18-year-old with respect to susceptibility to the pressures of interrogation are sufficient to change the outcome of the custody determination.  Todays opinion contains not a word of actual guidance as to how judges are supposed to go about making that determination.

				Petitioner and the Court attempt to show that this task is not unmanageable by pointing out that age is taken into account in other legal contexts.

				Finally, in cases like the one now before us, where the suspect is much younger than the typical juvenile defendant, courts should be instructed to take particular care to ensure that incriminating statements were not obtained involuntarily.

				<em>
					Schneckloth,

						 The Court claims that [n]ot once have any of our cases excluded from the custody analysis a circumstance that we determined was relevant and objective, simply to make the fault line between custodial and noncustodial brighter.   Ante, at 17.  Surely this is incorrect.  The very act of adopting a reasonable-person test necessarily excludes all sorts of relevant and objective circumstancesfor example, all the objective circumstances of a suspects life historythat might otherwise bear on a custody determination.

						 The Court also relies on North Carolinas concession at oral argument that a court could take into account a suspects blindness as a factor relevant to the Miranda custody determination.  Ante, at 15, and n. 9.  This is a far-fetched hypothetical, and neither the parties nor their amici cite any case in which such a problem has actually arisen.  Presumably such a case would involve a situation in which a blind defendant was given a typed document advising him that he [was] free to leave.  See Brief for Juvenile Law Center as Amicus Curiae 23.  In such a case, furnishing this advice in a form calculated to be unintelligible to the suspect would be tantamount to failing to provide the advice at all.  And advice by the police that a suspect is or is not free to leave at will has always been regarded as a circumstance regarding the conditions of the interrogation that must be taken into account in making the Miranda custody determination.

						 The Court thinks it would be absur[d] to consider the school setting without accounting for age, ante, at 12, but the real absurdity is for the Court to require police officers to get inside the head of a reasonable minor while making the quick, on-the-spot determinations that Miranda demands.

				The Courts decision in this case may seem on first consideration to be modest and sensible, but in truth it
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				is neither.  It is fundamentally inconsistent with one of the main justifications for the 
				<em>
					Miranda&lt;footcall num="1"&gt;

        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s prophylactic regime places a high value on clarity and certainty.  Dissatisfied with the highly fact-specific constitutional rule against the admission of in-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				voluntary confessions, the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 Court set down rigid standards that often require courts to ignore personal characteristics that may be highly relevant to a particular suspects actual susceptibility to police pressure.  This rigidity, however, has brought with it one of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s principal strengthsthe ease and clarity of its application by law enforcement officials and courts.  See 
				<em>
					Moran
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Burbine
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/475/412" class="subref" title="subref">475 U. S. 412</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">425</a>426 (1986)
.  A key contributor to this clarity, at least up until now, has been 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s objective reasonable-person test for determining custody.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s custody requirement is based on the proposition that the risk of unconstitutional coercion is heightened when a suspect is placed under formal arrest or is subjected to some functionally equivalent limitation on freedom of movement.  When this custodial threshold is reached, 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings must precede police questioning.  But in the interest of simplicity, the custody analysis considers only whether, under the circumstances, a hypothetical reasonable person would consider himself to be confined.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Many suspects, of course, will differ from this hypothetical reasonable person.  Some, including those who have been hardened by past interrogations, may have no need for 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings at all.  And for other suspectsthose who are unusually sensitive to the pressures of police questioning
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings may come too late to be of any use.  That is a necessary consequence of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s rigid standards, but it does not mean that the constitutional rights of these especially sensitive suspects are left unprotected.  A vulnerable defendant can still turn to the constitutional rule against 
				<em>
					actual 
				</em>
				coercion and contend that that his confession was extracted against his will.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Todays decision shifts the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 custody determination from a one-size-fits-all reasonable-person test into an inquiry that must account for at least one individualized characteristicagethat is thought to correlate with sus-ceptibility to coercive pressures.  Age, however, is in no way the only personal characteristic that may correlate with pliability, and in future cases the Court will be forced to choose between two unpalatable alternatives.  It may choose to limit todays decision by arbitrarily distinguishing a suspects age from other personal characteristicssuch as intelligence, education, occupation, or prior experience with law enforcementthat may also correlate with susceptibility to coercive pressures.  Or, if the Court is unwilling to draw these arbitrary lines, it will be forced to effect a fundamental transformation of the 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				custody testfrom a clear, easily applied prophylactic
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				rule into a highly fact-intensive standard resembling the voluntariness test that the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 Court found to be unsatisfactory.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				For at least three reasons, there is no need to go down this road.  First, many minors subjected to police interrogation are near the age of majority, and for these suspects the one-size-fits-all 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 custody rule may not be a bad fit.  Second, many of the difficulties in applying the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 custody rule to minors arise because of the unique circumstances present when the police conduct interrogations at school.  The 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 custody rule has always taken into account the setting in which questioning occurs, and accounting for the school setting in such cases will address many of these problems.  Third, in cases like the one now before us, where the suspect is especially young, courts applying the constitutional voluntariness standard can take special care to ensure that incriminating statements were not obtained through coercion.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Safeguarding the constitutional rights of minors does not require the extreme makeover of 
				<em>

				The glaring absence of reliance on personal characteristics in these and other custody cases should come as no surprise.  To account for such individualized considerations would be to contradict

				The Courts rationale for importing age into the custody standard is that minors tend to lack adults capacity to exercise mature judgment and that failing to account for that reality will leave some minors unprotected under 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				in situations where they perceive themselves to be confined.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 10, 8.  I do not dispute that many suspects who are under 18 will be more susceptible to police pressure than the average adult.  As the Court notes, our pre-
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				cases were particularly attuned to this reality in applying the constitutional requirement of voluntariness in fact.  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 9 (relying on 
				<em>
					Haley, 
				</em>
				332 U. S., at 599 (plurality opinion), and 
				<em>
					Gallegos
				</em>
				, 370 U. S., at 54).  It is no less a reality, however, that many persons 
				<em>
					over
				</em>
				 the age of 18 are also more susceptible to police pressure than the hypothetical reasonable person.  See 
				<em>
					Payne,
				</em>
				 356 U. S., at 567 (fact that defendant was a mentally dull 19-year-old youth relevant in voluntariness inquiry).  Yet the 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				custody standard has never accounted for the personal characteristics of these or any other individual defendants.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Indeed, it has always been the case under 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 that the unusually meek or compliant are subject to the same fixed rules, including the same custody requirement, as those who are unusually resistant to police pressure.  
				<em>
					Berkemer
				</em>
				, 468 U. S., at 442, and n. 35 ([O]nly relevant inquiry is how a reasonable man in the suspects position would have understood his situation).  
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s rigid standards are both overinclusive and underinclusive.  They are overinclusive to the extent that they provide a windfall to the most hardened and savvy of suspects, who often have no need for 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s protections.  Compare 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra

 (White, J., dissenting) (Where the defendant himself [w]as a lawyer, policeman, professional criminal, or otherwise has become aware of what his right to silence is, it is sheer fancy to assert that his answer to every question asked him is compelled unless he is advised of those rights with which he is already intimately familiar).  And 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s requirements are underinclusive to the extent that they fail to account for frailties, idiosyncrasies, and other individualized considerations that might cause a person to bend more easily during a confrontation with the police.  See 
				<em>
					Alvarado
				</em>
				, 541 U. S., at 662 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Members of this Court have seen this rigidity as a major weakness in 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s code of rules for confessions.  See 384 U. S., at 504 (Harlan, J., dissenting); 
				<em>

				 Courts decision to supplement the more holistic voluntariness requirement with a one-size-fits-all prophylactic rule.

				That is undoubtedly why this Courts

				</em>
				,

				</em>
				at 666.  And unless the
				<em>
					 Miranda
				</em>
				 custody rule is now to be radically transformed into one that takes into account the wide range of individual characteristics that are relevant in determining whether a confession is voluntary, the Court must shoulder the burden of explaining why age is different from these other personal characteristics.

				<em>
					Stansbury,
				</em>
				 511 U. S., at 323.  The second half will generate time-consuming satellite litigation over a reasonable officers perceptions.  When, as here, the interrogation takes place in school, the inquiry may be relatively simple.  But not all police questioning of minors takes place in schools.  In many cases, courts will presumably have to make findings as to whether a particular suspect had a sufficiently youthful look to alert a reasonable officer to the possibility that the suspect was under 18, or whether a reasonable officer would have recognized that a suspects I. D. was a fake.  The inquiry will be both time-consuming and disruptive for the police and the courts.  See 
				<em>
					Berkemer
				</em>
				, 468 U. S., at 432 (refusing to modify the custody test based on similar considerations).  It will also be made all the more complicated by the fact that a suspects dress and manner will often be different when the issue is litigated in court than it was at the time of the interrogation.

				Even after courts clear this initial hurdle, further problems will likely emerge as judges attempt to put themselves in the shoes of the average 16-year-old, or 15-year-old, or 13-year-old, as the case may be.  Consider, for example, a 60-year-old judge attempting to make a custody determination through the eyes of a hypothetical, average 15-year-old.  Forty-five years of personal experience and societal change separate this judge from the days when he or she was 15 years old.  And this judge may or may not have been an average 15-year-old.  The Courts answer to these difficulties is to state that no imaginative powers, knowledge of developmental psychology, [or] training in cognitive science will be necessary.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 17.  Judges simply need the common sense, the Court assures, to know that a 7-year-old is not a 13-year-old and neither is an adult.  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 17.  It is obvious, however, that application of the Courts new rule demands much more than this.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Take a fairly typical case in which todays holding may make a difference.  A 16-year-old moves to suppress incriminating statements made prior to the administration of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings.  The circumstances are such that, if the defendant were at least 18, the court would not find that he or she was in custody, but the defendant argues that a reasonable 16-year-old would view the situation differently.  The judge will not have the luxury of merely saying: It is common sense that a 16-year-old is not an 18-year-old.  Motion granted.  Rather, the judge will be required to determine whether the differences between a typical 16-year-old and a typical 18-year-old with respect to susceptibility to the pressures of interrogation are sufficient to change the outcome of the custody determination.  Todays opinion contains not a word of actual guidance as to how judges are supposed to go about making that determination.

				Petitioner and the Court attempt to show that this task is not unmanageable by pointing out that age is taken into account in other legal contexts.

See Brief for Petitioner 1011 (reciting at length the factors petitioner believes to be relevant to the custody determination here, including the fact that petitioner was removed from class by a police officer, that the interview took place in a school conference room, and that a uniformed officer and a vice principal were present).

				Finally, in cases like the one now before us, where the suspect is much younger than the typical juvenile defendant, courts should be instructed to take particular care to ensure that incriminating statements were not obtained involuntarily.  The voluntariness inquiry is flexible and accommodating by nature, see 
				<em>
					Schneckloth,
				</em>
				 412 U. S., at 224, and the Courts precedents already make clear that special care must be exercised in applying the voluntariness test where the confession of a mere child is at issue.

						 The Court claims that [n]ot once have any of our cases excluded from the custody analysis a circumstance that we determined was relevant and objective, simply to make the fault line between custodial and noncustodial brighter.   Ante, at 17.  Surely this is incorrect.  The very act of adopting a reasonable-person test necessarily excludes all sorts of relevant and objective circumstancesfor example, all the objective circumstances of a suspects life historythat might otherwise bear on a custody determination.

						 The Court also relies on North Carolinas concession at oral argument that a court could take into account a suspects blindness as a factor relevant to the Miranda custody determination.  Ante, at 15, and n. 9.  This is a far-fetched hypothetical, and neither the parties nor their amici cite any case in which such a problem has actually arisen.  Presumably such a case would involve a situation in which a blind defendant was given a typed document advising him that he [was] free to leave.  See Brief for Juvenile Law Center as Amicus Curiae 23.  In such a case, furnishing this advice in a form calculated to be unintelligible to the suspect would be tantamount to failing to provide the advice at all.  And advice by the police that a suspect is or is not free to leave at will has always been regarded as a circumstance regarding the conditions of the interrogation that must be taken into account in making the Miranda custody determination.

				s objective reasonable-person test for determining custody.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s custody requirement is based on the proposition that the risk of unconstitutional coercion is heightened when a suspect is placed under formal arrest or is subjected to some functionally equivalent limitation on freedom of movement.  When this custodial threshold is reached, 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings must precede police questioning.  But in the interest of simplicity, the custody analysis considers only whether, under the circumstances, a hypothetical reasonable person would consider himself to be confined.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Many suspects, of course, will differ from this hypothetical reasonable person.  Some, including those who have been hardened by past interrogations, may have no need for 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings at all.  And for other suspectsthose who are unusually sensitive to the pressures of police questioning
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings may come too late to be of any use.  That is a necessary consequence of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s rigid standards, but it does not mean that the constitutional rights of these especially sensitive suspects are left unprotected.  A vulnerable defendant can still turn to the constitutional rule against 
				<em>
					actual 
				</em>
				coercion and contend that that his confession was extracted against his will.

				Todays decision shifts the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 custody determination from a one-size-fits-all reasonable-person test into an inquiry that must account for at least one individualized characteristicagethat is thought to correlate with sus-ceptibility to coercive pressures.  Age, however, is in no way the only personal characteristic that may correlate with pliability, and in future cases the Court will be forced to choose between two unpalatable alternatives.  It may choose to limit todays decision by arbitrarily distinguishing a suspects age from other personal characteristicssuch as intelligence, education, occupation, or prior experience with law enforcementthat may also correlate with susceptibility to coercive pressures.  Or, if the Court is unwilling to draw these arbitrary lines, it will be forced to effect a fundamental transformation of the 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				custody testfrom a clear, easily applied prophylactic
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				rule into a highly fact-intensive standard resembling the voluntariness test that the

					Miranda
				</em>
				 Court found to be unsatisfactory.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				For at least three reasons, there is no need to go down this road.  First, many minors subjected to police interrogation are near the age of majority, and for these suspects the one-size-fits-all 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 custody rule may not be a bad fit.  Second, many of the difficulties in applying the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 custody rule to minors arise because of the unique circumstances present when the police conduct interrogations at school.  The 
				<em>

				 custody rule has always taken into account the setting in which questioning occurs, and accounting for the school setting in such cases will address many of these problems.  Third, in cases like the one now before us, where the suspect is especially young, courts applying the constitutional voluntariness standard can take special care to ensure that incriminating statements were not obtained through coercion.

				The Court holds that age must be taken into account when it was known to the officer at the time of the interview, or when it would have been objectively apparent to a reasonable officer.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 11.  The first half of this test overturns the rule that the initial determination of custody does not depend on the subjective views harbored by . . . interrogating officers.  
				<em>
					Stansbury,
				</em>
				 511 U. S., at 323.  The second half will generate time-consuming satellite litigation over a reasonable officers perceptions.  When, as here, the interrogation takes place in school, the inquiry may be relatively simple.  But not all police questioning of minors takes place in schools.  In many cases, courts will presumably have to make findings as to whether a particular suspect had a sufficiently youthful look to alert a reasonable officer to the possibility that the suspect was under 18, or whether a reasonable officer would have recognized that a suspects I. D. was a fake.  The inquiry will be both time-consuming and disruptive for the police and the courts.  See 
				<em>
					Berkemer
				</em>
				, 468 U. S., at 432 (refusing to modify the custody test based on similar considerations).  It will also be made all the more complicated by the fact that a suspects dress and manner will often be different when the issue is litigated in court than it was at the time of the interrogation.

				Even after courts clear this initial hurdle, further problems will likely emerge as judges attempt to put themselves in the shoes of the average 16-year-old, or 15-year-old, or 13-year-old, as the case may be.  Consider, for example, a 60-year-old judge attempting to make a custody determination through the eyes of a hypothetical, average 15-year-old.  Forty-five years of personal experience and societal change separate this judge from the days when he or she was 15 years old.  And this judge may or may not have been an average 15-year-old.  The Courts answer to these difficulties is to state that no imaginative powers, knowledge of developmental psychology, [or] training in cognitive science will be necessary.  
				<em>
					Ante

					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 17.  It is obvious, however, that application of the Courts new rule demands much more than this.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Take a fairly typical case in which todays holding may make a difference.  A 16-year-old moves to suppress incriminating statements made prior to the administration of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings.  The circumstances are such that, if the defendant were at least 18, the court would not find that he or she was in custody, but the defendant argues that a reasonable 16-year-old would view the situation differently.  The judge will not have the luxury of merely saying: It is common sense that a 16-year-old is not an 18-year-old.  Motion granted.  Rather, the judge will be required to determine whether the differences between a typical 16-year-old and a typical 18-year-old with respect to susceptibility to the pressures of interrogation are sufficient to change the outcome of the custody determination.  Todays opinion contains not a word of actual guidance as to how judges are supposed to go about making that determination.

				Petitioner and the Court attempt to show that this task is not unmanageable by pointing out that age is taken into account in other legal contexts.

				Finally, in cases like the one now before us, where the suspect is much younger than the typical juvenile defendant, courts should be instructed to take particular care to ensure that incriminating statements were not obtained involuntarily.  The voluntariness inquiry is flexible and accommodating by nature, see 
				<em>
					Schneckloth,

						 The Court claims that [n]ot once have any of our cases excluded from the custody analysis a circumstance that we determined was relevant and objective, simply to make the fault line between custodial and noncustodial brighter.   Ante, at 17.  Surely this is incorrect.  The very act of adopting a reasonable-person test necessarily excludes all sorts of relevant and objective circumstancesfor example, all the objective circumstances of a suspects life historythat might otherwise bear on a custody determination.

						 The Court also relies on North Carolinas concession at oral argument that a court could take into account a suspects blindness as a factor relevant to the Miranda custody determination.  Ante, at 15, and n. 9.  This is a far-fetched hypothetical, and neither the parties nor their amici cite any case in which such a problem has actually arisen.  Presumably such a case would involve a situation in which a blind defendant was given a typed document advising him that he [was] free to leave.  See Brief for Juvenile Law Center as Amicus Curiae 23.  In such a case, furnishing this advice in a form calculated to be unintelligible to the suspect would be tantamount to failing to provide the advice at all.  And advice by the police that a suspect is or is not free to leave at will has always been regarded as a circumstance regarding the conditions of the interrogation that must be taken into account in making the Miranda custody determination.

						 The Court thinks it would be absur[d] to consider the school setting without accounting for age, ante, at 12, but the real absurdity is for the Court to require police officers to get inside the head of a reasonable minor while making the quick, on-the-spot determinations that Miranda demands.

				The Courts decision in this case may seem on first consideration to be modest and sensible, but in truth it
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				is neither.  It is fundamentally inconsistent with one of the main justifications for the 
				<em>
					Miranda&lt;footcall num="1"&gt;
				</em>
				 rule: the perceived need for a clear rule that can be easily applied in all cases.  And todays holding is not needed to protect the constitutional rights of minors who are questioned by the police.

        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s prophylactic regime places a high value on clarity and certainty.  Dissatisfied with the highly fact-specific constitutional rule against the admission of in-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				voluntary confessions, the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 Court set down rigid standards that often require courts to ignore personal characteristics that may be highly relevant to a particular suspects actual susceptibility to police pressure.  This rigidity, however, has brought with it one of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s principal strengthsthe ease and clarity of its application by law enforcement officials and courts.  See 
				<em>
					Moran
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Burbine
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/475/412" class="subref" title="subref">475 U. S. 412</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">425</a>426 (1986)
.  A key contributor to this clarity, at least up until now, has been 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s objective reasonable-person test for determining custody.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s custody requirement is based on the proposition that the risk of unconstitutional coercion is heightened when a suspect is placed under formal arrest or is subjected to some functionally equivalent limitation on freedom of movement.  When this custodial threshold is reached, 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings must precede police questioning.  But in the interest of simplicity, the custody analysis considers only whether, under the circumstances, a hypothetical reasonable person would consider himself to be confined.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Many suspects, of course, will differ from this hypothetical reasonable person.  Some, including those who have been hardened by past interrogations, may have no need for 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings at all.  And for other suspectsthose who are unusually sensitive to the pressures of police questioning
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings may come too late to be of any use.  That is a necessary consequence of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s rigid standards, but it does not mean that the constitutional rights of these especially sensitive suspects are left unprotected.  A vulnerable defendant can still turn to the constitutional rule against 
				<em>
					actual 
				</em>
				coercion and contend that that his confession was extracted against his will.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Todays decision shifts the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 custody determination from a one-size-fits-all reasonable-person test into an inquiry that must account for at least one individualized characteristicagethat is thought to correlate with sus-ceptibility to coercive pressures.  Age, however, is in no way the only personal characteristic that may correlate with pliability, and in future cases the Court will be forced to choose between two unpalatable alternatives.  It may choose to limit todays decision by arbitrarily distinguishing a suspects age from other personal characteristicssuch as intelligence, education, occupation, or prior experience with law enforcementthat may also correlate with susceptibility to coercive pressures.  Or, if the Court is unwilling to draw these arbitrary lines, it will be forced to effect a fundamental transformation of the 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				custody testfrom a clear, easily applied prophylactic
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				rule into a highly fact-intensive standard resembling the voluntariness test that the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 Court found to be unsatisfactory.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				For at least three reasons, there is no need to go down this road.  First, many minors subjected to police interrogation are near the age of majority, and for these suspects the one-size-fits-all 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 custody rule may not be a bad fit.  Second, many of the difficulties in applying the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 custody rule to minors arise because of the unique circumstances present when the police conduct interrogations at school.  The 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 custody rule has always taken into account the setting in which questioning occurs, and accounting for the school setting in such cases will address many of these problems.  Third, in cases like the one now before us, where the suspect is especially young, courts applying the constitutional voluntariness standard can take special care to ensure that incriminating statements were not obtained through coercion.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Safeguarding the constitutional rights of minors does not require the extreme makeover of 
				<em>
					Miranda

				 that todays decision may portend.

				The glaring absence of reliance on personal characteristics in these and other custody cases should come as no surprise.  To account for such individualized considerations would be to contradict

				In light of this established practice, there is no denying that, by incorporating age into its analysis, the Court is embarking on a new expansion of the established custody standard.  And since

				The Courts rationale for importing age into the custody standard is that minors tend to lack adults capacity to exercise mature judgment and that failing to account for that reality will leave some minors unprotected under 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				in situations where they perceive themselves to be confined.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 10, 8.  I do not dispute that many suspects who are under 18 will be more susceptible to police pressure than the average adult.  As the Court notes, our pre-
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				cases were particularly attuned to this reality in applying the constitutional requirement of voluntariness in fact.  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 9 (relying on 
				<em>
					Haley, 
				</em>
				332 U. S., at 599 (plurality opinion), and 
				<em>
					Gallegos
				</em>
				, 370 U. S., at 54).  It is no less a reality, however, that many persons 
				<em>
					over
				</em>
				 the age of 18 are also more susceptible to police pressure than the hypothetical reasonable person.  See 
				<em>
					Payne,
				</em>
				 356 U. S., at 567 (fact that defendant was a mentally dull 19-year-old youth relevant in voluntariness inquiry).  Yet the 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				custody standard has never accounted for the personal characteristics of these or any other individual defendants.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Indeed, it has always been the case under 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 that the unusually meek or compliant are subject to the same fixed rules, including the same custody requirement, as those who are unusually resistant to police pressure.  
				<em>
					Berkemer
				</em>
				, 468 U. S., at 442, and n. 35 ([O]nly relevant inquiry is how a reasonable man in the suspects position would have understood his situation).  
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s rigid standards are both overinclusive and underinclusive.  They are overinclusive to the extent that they provide a windfall to the most hardened and savvy of suspects, who often have no need for 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s protections.  Compare 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				, 
				<em>

 (White, J., dissenting) (Where the defendant himself [w]as a lawyer, policeman, professional criminal, or otherwise has become aware of what his right to silence is, it is sheer fancy to assert that his answer to every question asked him is compelled unless he is advised of those rights with which he is already intimately familiar).  And 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s requirements are underinclusive to the extent that they fail to account for frailties, idiosyncrasies, and other individualized considerations that might cause a person to bend more easily during a confrontation with the police.  See 
				<em>
					Alvarado
				</em>
				, 541 U. S., at 662 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Members of this Court have seen this rigidity as a major weakness in 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s code of rules for confessions.  See 384 U. S., at 504 (Harlan, J., dissenting); 
				<em>

				 439 U. S., at 1314 (Rehnquist, J., in chambers) ([T]he rigidity of [
				<em>

				<em>

				 Courts decision to supplement the more holistic voluntariness requirement with a one-size-fits-all prophylactic rule.

				That is undoubtedly why this Courts

				<em>
					Alvarado
				</em>
				, 
				<em>

				</em>
				at 666.  And unless the
				<em>
					 Miranda
				</em>
				 custody rule is now to be radically transformed into one that takes into account the wide range of individual characteristics that are relevant in determining whether a confession is voluntary, the Court must shoulder the burden of explaining why age is different from these other personal characteristics.

				Even after courts clear this initial hurdle, further problems will likely emerge as judges attempt to put themselves in the shoes of the average 16-year-old, or 15-year-old, or 13-year-old, as the case may be.  Consider, for example, a 60-year-old judge attempting to make a custody determination through the eyes of a hypothetical, average 15-year-old.  Forty-five years of personal experience and societal change separate this judge from the days when he or she was 15 years old.  And this judge may or may not have been an average 15-year-old.  The Courts answer to these difficulties is to state that no imaginative powers, knowledge of developmental psychology, [or] training in cognitive science will be necessary.  
				<em>
					Ante

				, at 17.  Judges simply need the common sense, the Court assures, to know that a 7-year-old is not a 13-year-old and neither is an adult.  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 17.  It is obvious, however, that application of the Courts new rule demands much more than this.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Take a fairly typical case in which todays holding may make a difference.  A 16-year-old moves to suppress incriminating statements made prior to the administration of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings.  The circumstances are such that, if the defendant were at least 18, the court would not find that he or she was in custody, but the defendant argues that a reasonable 16-year-old would view the situation differently.  The judge will not have the luxury of merely saying: It is common sense that a 16-year-old is not an 18-year-old.  Motion granted.  Rather, the judge will be required to determine whether the differences between a typical 16-year-old and a typical 18-year-old with respect to susceptibility to the pressures of interrogation are sufficient to change the outcome of the custody determination.  Todays opinion contains not a word of actual guidance as to how judges are supposed to go about making that determination.

				Petitioner and the Court attempt to show that this task is not unmanageable by pointing out that age is taken into account in other legal contexts.

See Brief for Petitioner 1011 (reciting at length the factors petitioner believes to be relevant to the custody determination here, including the fact that petitioner was removed from class by a police officer, that the interview took place in a school conference room, and that a uniformed officer and a vice principal were present).

				Finally, in cases like the one now before us, where the suspect is much younger than the typical juvenile defendant, courts should be instructed to take particular care to ensure that incriminating statements were not obtained involuntarily.  The voluntariness inquiry is flexible and accommodating by nature, see 
				<em>
					Schneckloth,
				</em>

						 The Court claims that [n]ot once have any of our cases excluded from the custody analysis a circumstance that we determined was relevant and objective, simply to make the fault line between custodial and noncustodial brighter.   Ante, at 17.  Surely this is incorrect.  The very act of adopting a reasonable-person test necessarily excludes all sorts of relevant and objective circumstancesfor example, all the objective circumstances of a suspects life historythat might otherwise bear on a custody determination.

						 The Court also relies on North Carolinas concession at oral argument that a court could take into account a suspects blindness as a factor relevant to the Miranda custody determination.  Ante, at 15, and n. 9.  This is a far-fetched hypothetical, and neither the parties nor their amici cite any case in which such a problem has actually arisen.  Presumably such a case would involve a situation in which a blind defendant was given a typed document advising him that he [was] free to leave.  See Brief for Juvenile Law Center as Amicus Curiae 23.  In such a case, furnishing this advice in a form calculated to be unintelligible to the suspect would be tantamount to failing to provide the advice at all.  And advice by the police that a suspect is or is not free to leave at will has always been regarded as a circumstance regarding the conditions of the interrogation that must be taken into account in making the Miranda custody determination.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s custody requirement is based on the proposition that the risk of unconstitutional coercion is heightened when a suspect is placed under formal arrest or is subjected to some functionally equivalent limitation on freedom of movement.  When this custodial threshold is reached, 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings must precede police questioning.  But in the interest of simplicity, the custody analysis considers only whether, under the circumstances, a hypothetical reasonable person would consider himself to be confined.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Many suspects, of course, will differ from this hypothetical reasonable person.  Some, including those who have been hardened by past interrogations, may have no need for 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings at all.  And for other suspectsthose who are unusually sensitive to the pressures of police questioning
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings may come too late to be of any use.  That is a necessary consequence of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				s rigid standards, but it does not mean that the constitutional rights of these especially sensitive suspects are left unprotected.  A vulnerable defendant can still turn to the constitutional rule against 
				<em>
					actual 
				</em>
				coercion and contend that that his confession was extracted against his will.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Todays decision shifts the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 custody determination from a one-size-fits-all reasonable-person test into an inquiry that must account for at least one individualized characteristicagethat is thought to correlate with sus-ceptibility to coercive pressures.  Age, however, is in no way the only personal characteristic that may correlate with pliability, and in future cases the Court will be forced to choose between two unpalatable alternatives.  It may choose to limit todays decision by arbitrarily distinguishing a suspects age from other personal characteristicssuch as intelligence, education, occupation, or prior experience with law enforcementthat may also correlate with susceptibility to coercive pressures.  Or, if the Court is unwilling to draw these arbitrary lines, it will be forced to effect a fundamental transformation of the 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				custody testfrom a clear, easily applied prophylactic
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				rule into a highly fact-intensive standard resembling the voluntariness test that the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 Court found to be unsatisfactory.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				For at least three reasons, there is no need to go down this road.  First, many minors subjected to police interrogation are near the age of majority, and for these suspects the one-size-fits-all 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 custody rule may not be a bad fit.  Second, many of the difficulties in applying the 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 custody rule to minors arise because of the unique circumstances present when the police conduct interrogations at school.  The 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 custody rule has always taken into account the setting in which questioning occurs, and accounting for the school setting in such cases will address many of these problems.  Third, in cases like the one now before us, where the suspect is especially young, courts applying the constitutional voluntariness standard can take special care to ensure that incriminating statements were not obtained through coercion.

				The Courts rationale for importing age into the custody standard is that minors tend to lack adults capacity to exercise mature judgment and that failing to account for that reality will leave some minors unprotected under 
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				in situations where they perceive themselves to be confined.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 10, 8.  I do not dispute that many suspects who are under 18 will be more susceptible to police pressure than the average adult.  As the Court notes, our pre-
				<em>
					Miranda 
				</em>
				cases were particularly attuned to this reality in applying the constitutional requirement of voluntariness in fact.

					Ante,

					Haley, 
				</em>
				332 U. S., at 599 (plurality opinion), and

				<em>
					over
				</em>
				 the age of 18 are also more susceptible to police pressure than the hypothetical reasonable person.  See 
				<em>
					Payne,
				</em>
				 356 U. S., at 567 (fact that defendant was a mentally dull 19-year-old youth relevant in voluntariness inquiry).  Yet the

				</em>
				custody standard has never accounted for the personal characteristics of these or any other individual defendants.

				The Court holds that age must be taken into account when it was known to the officer at the time of the interview, or when it would have been objectively apparent to a reasonable officer.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 11.  The first half of this test overturns the rule that the initial determination of custody does not depend on the subjective views harbored by . . . interrogating officers.  
				<em>
					Stansbury,
				</em>
				 511 U. S., at 323.  The second half will generate time-consuming satellite litigation over a reasonable officers perceptions.  When, as here, the interrogation takes place in school, the inquiry may be relatively simple.  But not all police questioning of minors takes place in schools.  In many cases, courts will presumably have to make findings as to whether a particular suspect had a sufficiently youthful look to alert a reasonable officer to the possibility that the suspect was under 18, or whether a reasonable officer would have recognized that a suspects I. D. was a fake.  The inquiry will be both time-consuming and disruptive for the police and the courts.  See 
				<em>
					Berkemer
				</em>
				, 468 U. S., at 432 (refusing to modify the custody test based on similar considerations).  It will also be made all the more complicated by the fact that a suspects dress and manner will often be different when the issue is litigated in court than it was at the time of the interrogation.

				Even after courts clear this initial hurdle, further problems will likely emerge as judges attempt to put themselves in the shoes of the average 16-year-old, or 15-year-old, or 13-year-old, as the case may be.  Consider, for example, a 60-year-old judge attempting to make a custody determination through the eyes of a hypothetical, average 15-year-old.  Forty-five years of personal experience and societal change separate this judge from the days when he or she was 15 years old.  And this judge may or may not have been an average 15-year-old.  The Courts answer to these difficulties is to state that no imaginative powers, knowledge of developmental psychology, [or] training in cognitive science will be necessary.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 17.  Judges simply need the common sense, the Court assures, to know that a 7-year-old is not a 13-year-old and neither is an adult.  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 17.  It is obvious, however, that application of the Courts new rule demands much more than this.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Take a fairly typical case in which todays holding may make a difference.  A 16-year-old moves to suppress incriminating statements made prior to the administration of 
				<em>
					Miranda
				</em>
				 warnings.  The circumstances are such that, if the defendant were at least 18, the court would not find that he or she was in custody, but the defendant argues that a reasonable 16-year-old would view the situation differently.  The judge will not have the luxury of merely saying: It is common sense that a 16-year-old is not an 18-year-old.  Motion granted.  Rather, the judge will be required to determine whether the differences between a typical 16-year-old and a typical 18-year-old with respect to susceptibility to the pressures of interrogation are sufficient to change the outcome of the custody determination.  Todays opinion contains not a word of actual guidance as to how judges are supposed to go about making that determination.

				Petitioner and the Court attempt to show that this task is not unmanageable by pointing out that age is taken into account in other legal contexts.

See Brief for Petitioner 1011 (reciting at length the factors petitioner believes to be relevant to the custody determination here, including the fact that petitioner was removed from class by a police officer, that the interview took place in a school conference room, and that a uniformed officer and a vice principal were present).

				Finally, in cases like the one now before us, where the suspect is much younger than the typical juvenile defendant, courts should be instructed to take particular care to ensure that incriminating statements were not obtained involuntarily.  The voluntariness inquiry is flexible and accommodating by nature, see 
				<em>
					Schneckloth,
				</em>
				 412 U. S., at 224, and the Courts precedents already make clear that special care must be exercised in applying the voluntariness test where the confession of a mere child is at issue.

						 The Court claims that [n]ot once have any of our cases excluded from the custody analysis a circumstance that we determined was relevant and objective, simply to make the fault line between custodial and noncustodial brighter.   Ante, at 17.  Surely this is incorrect.  The very act of adopting a reasonable-person test necessarily excludes all sorts of relevant and objective circumstancesfor example, all the objective circumstances of a suspects life historythat might otherwise bear on a custody determination.

						 Cf. United States v. Chalan, 812 F. 2d 1302, 1307 (CA10 1987) (rejecting claim that Native American suspect was in custody for Miranda purposes because, by custom, obedience to tribal authorities was expected of all tribal members).

						 The Court also relies on North Carolinas concession at oral argument that a court could take into account a suspects blindness as a factor relevant to the Miranda custody determination.  Ante, at 15, and n. 9.  This is a far-fetched hypothetical, and neither the parties nor their amici cite any case in which such a problem has actually arisen.  Presumably such a case would involve a situation in which a blind defendant was given a typed document advising him that he [was] free to leave.  See Brief for Juvenile Law Center as Amicus Curiae 23.  In such a case, furnishing this advice in a form calculated to be unintelligible to the suspect would be tantamount to failing to provide the advice at all.  And advice by the police that a suspect is or is not free to leave at will has always been regarded as a circumstance regarding the conditions of the interrogation that must be taken into account in making the Miranda custody determination.

						 The Court thinks it would be absur[d] to consider the school setting without accounting for age, ante, at 12, but the real absurdity is for the Court to require police officers to get inside the head of a reasonable minor while making the quick, on-the-spot determinations that Miranda demands.

						 Surveys have shown that [l]arge majorities of the public are aware that individuals arrested for a crime have a right to remai[n] silent (81%), a right to a lawyer (95%), and a right to have a lawyer appointed if the arrestee cannot afford one (88%).  See Belden, Russonello &amp; Stewart, Developing a National Message for Indigent Defense:  Analysis of National Survey 4 (Oct. 2001), online at http://www.nlada.org/DMS/Documents/1211996548.53/Polling results report.pdf.

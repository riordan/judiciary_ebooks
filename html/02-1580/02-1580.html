				The facts, as alleged by the plaintiffs, are as follows.  The population figures derived from the 2000 census showed that Pennsylvania was entitled to only 19 Representatives in Congress, a decrease in 2 from the Commonwealths previous delegation.  Pennsylvanias General Assembly took up the task of drawing a new districting map.  At the time, the Republican party controlled a majority of both state Houses and held the Governors office.  Prominent national figures in the Republican Party pressured the General Assembly to adopt a partisan redistricting plan as a punitive measure against Democrats for having enacted pro-Democrat redistricting plans elsewhere.  The Republican members of Pennsylvanias House and Senate worked together on such a plan.  On January 3, 2002, the General Assembly passed its plan, which was signed into law by Governor Schweiker as Act 1.

				Political gerrymanders are not new to the American scene.  One scholar traces them back to the Colony of Pennsylvania at the beginning of the 18th century, where several counties conspired to minimize the political power of the city of Philadelphia by refusing to allow it to merge or expand into surrounding jurisdictions, and denying it additional representatives.  See E. Griffith, The Rise and Development of the Gerrymander 2628 (1974) (hereinafter Griffith).  In 1732, two members of His Majestys Council and the attorney general and deputy inspector and comptroller general of affairs of the Province of North Carolina reported that the Governor had proceeded to divide old Precincts established by Law, &amp; to enact new Ones in Places, whereby his Arts he has endeavored to prepossess People in a future election according to his desire, his Designs herein being … either to endeavor by his means to get a Majority of his creatures in the Lower House or to disrupt the assemblys proceedings.  3 Colonial Records of North Carolina 380381 (W. Saunders ed. 1886); see also Griffith 29.  The political gerrymander remained alive and well (though not yet known by that name) at the time of the framing.  There were allegations that Patrick Henry attempted (unsuccessfully) to gerrymander James Madison out of the First Congress.  See 2 W. Rives, Life and Times of James Madison 655, n. 1 (reprint 1970); Letter from Thomas Jefferson to William Short, Feb. 9, 1789, reprinted in 5 Works of Thomas Jefferson 451 (P. Ford ed. 1904).  And in 1812, of course, there occurred the notoriously outrageous political districting in Massachusetts that gave the gerrymander its namean amalgam of the names of Massachusetts Governor Elbridge Gerry and the creature (salamander) which the outline of an election district he was credited with forming was thought to resemble.  See Websters New International Dictionary 1052 (2d ed. 1945).  By 1840 the gerrymander was a recognized force in party politics and was generally attempted in all legislation enacted for the formation of election districts.  It was generally conceded that each party would attempt to gain power which was not proportionate to its numerical strength.  Griffith 123.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				It is significant that the Framers provided a remedy for such practices in the Constitution.  Article 1, §4, while leaving in state legislatures the initial power to draw districts for federal elections, permitted Congress to make or alter those districts if it wished.

				  Many objected to the congressional oversight established by this provision.  In the course of the debates in the Constitutional Convention, Charles Pinkney and John Rutledge moved to strike the relevant language.  James Madison responded in defense of the provision that Congress must be given the power to check partisan manipulation of the election process by the States:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				Whenever the State Legislatures had a favorite measure to carry, they would take care so to mould their regulations as to favor the candidates they wished to succeed.  Besides, the inequality of the Representation in the Legislatures of particular States, would produce a like inequality in their representation in the Natl. Legislature, as it was presumable that the Counties having the power in the former case would secure it to themselves in the latter.  What danger could there be in giving a controuling power to the Natl. Legislature?  2 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, pp. 240241 (M. Farrand ed. 1911).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
Although the motion of Pinkney and Rutledge failed, opposition to the make or alter provision of Article I, §4and the defense that it was needed to prevent political gerrymanderingcontinued to be voiced in the state ratifying debates.  A delegate to the Massachusetts convention warned that state legislatures
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				might make an unequal and partial division of the states into districts for the election of representatives, or they might even disqualify one third of the electors.  Without these powers in Congress, the people can have no remedy; But the 4th section provides a remedy, a controlling power in a legislature, composed of senators and representatives of twelve states, without the influence of our commotions and factions, who will hear impartially, and preserve and restore to the people their equal and sacred rights of election.  2 Debates on the Federal Constitution 27 (J. Elliot 2d ed. 1876).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				The power bestowed on Congress to regulate elections, and in particular to restrain the practice of political gerrymandering, has not lain dormant.  In the Apportionment Act of 1842, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">5</a>Stat.
491, Congress provided that Representatives must be elected from single-member districts composed of contiguous territory.  See Griffith 12 (noting that the law was an attempt to forbid the practice of the gerrymander).  Congress again imposed these requirements in the Apportionment Act of 1862, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">12</a>Stat.
572, and in 1872 further required that districts contai[n] as nearly as practicable an equal number of inhabitants, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">17</a>Stat.
28, §2.  In the Apportionment Act of 1901, Congress imposed a compactness requirement.  
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">31</a>Stat.
733.  The requirements of contiguity, compactness, and equality of population were repeated in the 1911 apportionment legislation, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">37</a>Stat.
13, but were not thereafter continued.  Today, only the single-member-district-requirement remains.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/2/2c.html" class="subref" title="subref">2 U. S. C. §2c</a>.  Recent history, however, attests to Congresss awareness of the sort of districting practices appellants protest, and of its power under Article I, §4 to control them.  Since 1980, no fewer than five bills have been introduced to regulate gerrymandering in congressional districting.  See H. R. 5037, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. (1990); H. R. 1711, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. (1989); H. R. 3468, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. (1983); H. R. 5529, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. (1982); H. R. 2349, 97th Cong., 1st Sess. (1981).

        <p class="bodytext">
				[1] a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department; or [2] a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it; or [3] the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion; or [4] the impossibility of a courts undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of the government; or [5] an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made; or [6] the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question.

				Over the dissent of three Justices, the Court held in 
				<em>
					Davis
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Bandemer
				</em>
				 that, since it was not persuaded that there are no judicially discernible and manageable standards by which political gerrymander cases are to be decided, 478 U. S., at 123, such cases 
				<em>
					were 
				</em>
				justiciable.  The clumsy shifting of the burden of proof for the premise (the Court was not persuaded that standards do not exist, rather than persuaded that they do) was necessitated by the uncomfortable fact that the six-Justice majority could not discern what the judicially discernable standards might be.  There was no majority on that point.  Four of the Justices finding justiciability believed that the standard was one thing, see 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 127 (plurality opinion of White

				, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  The lower courts have lived with that assurance of a standard (or more precisely, lack of assurance that there is no standard), coupled with that inability to specify a standard, for the past 18 years.  In that time, they have considered numerous political gerrymandering claims; this Court has never revisited the unanswered question of what standard governs.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Nor can it be said that the lower courts have, over 18 years, succeeded in shaping the standard that this Court was initially unable to enunciate.  They have simply applied the standard set forth in
				<em>
					 Bandemer
				</em>
				s four-Justice plurality opinion.  This might be thought to prove that the four-Justice plurality standard has met the test of timebut for the fact that its application has almost invariably produced the same result (except for the incurring of attorneys fees) as would have obtained if the question were nonjusticiable: judicial intervention has been refused.  As one commentary has put it, [t]hroughout its subsequent history, 
				<em>
					Bandemer
				</em>
				 has served almost exclusively as an invitation to litigation without much prospect of redress.  S. Issacharoff, P. Karlan, &amp; R. Pildes, The Law of Democracy 886 (rev. 2d ed. 2002).  The one case in which relief was provided (and merely preliminary relief, at that) did

				Eighteen years of judicial effort with virtually nothing to show for it justify us in revisiting the question whether the standard promised by

As to the intent element, the plurality acknowledged that [a]s long as redistricting is done by a legislature, it should not be very difficult to prove that the likely political consequences of the reapportionment were intended.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 129.  However, the effects prong was significantly harder to satisfy.  Relief could not be based merely upon the fact that a group of persons banded together for political purposes had failed to achieve representation commensurate with its numbers, or that the apportionment scheme made its winning of elections more difficult.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 132.  Rather, it would have to be shown that, taking into account a variety of historic factors and projected election results, the group had been denied its chance to effectively influence the political process as a whole, which could be achieved even without electing a candidate.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 132133.  It would not be enough to establish, for example, that Democrats had been placed in a district with a supermajority of other Democratic voters or that the district departs from pre-existing political boundaries.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 140141.  Rather, in a challenge to an individual district the inquiry would focus on the opportunity of members of the group to participate in party deliberations in the slating and nomination of candidates, their opportunity to register and vote, and hence their chance to directly influence the election returns and to secure the attention of the winning candidate.  
				<em>
					Id.

				<em>
					or indirect 
				</em>
				influence on the elections of the state legislature as a whole.  
				<em>

				</em>

				Appellants take a run at enunciating their own workable standard based on Article I, §2, and the Equal Protection Clause.  We consider it at length not only because it reflects the litigants view as to the best that can be derived from 18 years of experience, but also because it shares many features with other proposed standards, so that what is said of it may be said of them as well.  Appellants proposed standard retains the two-pronged framework of the

				 pluralityintent plus effectbut modifies the type of showing sufficient to satisfy each.

				<em>
					Bandemer
				</em>
				 pluralitys test of mere intent to disadvantage the plaintiffs group, this proposal seemingly makes the standard more difficult to meetbut only at the expense of making the standard more indeterminate.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Predominant intent to disadvantage the plaintiff political group refers to the relative importance of that goal as compared with all the other goals that the map seeks to pursuecontiguity of districts, compactness of districts, observance of the lines of political subdivision, protection of incumbents of all parties, cohesion of natural racial and ethnic neighborhoods, compliance with requirements of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 regarding racial distribution, etc.  Appellants contend that their intent test 
				<em>
					must 
				</em>
				be discernible and manageable because it has been borrowed from our racial gerrymandering cases.  See 
				<em>
					Miller

				 v.

.  To begin with, in a very important respect that is not so.  In the racial gerrymandering context, the predominant intent test has been applied to the challenged district in which the plaintiffs voted.  See 
				<em>
					Miller

				<em>

.  Here, however, appellants do not assert that an apportionment fails their intent test if any single district does so.  Since it would be quixotic to attempt to bar state legislatures from considering politics as they redraw district lines, Brief for Appellants 3, appellants propose a test that is satisfied only when partisan advantage was the predominant motivation 
				<em>
					behind the entire statewide plan
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 32 (emphasis added).  Vague as the predominant motivation test might be when used to evaluate single districts, it all but evaporates when applied statewide.  Does it mean, for instance, that partisan intent must outweigh all other goalscontiguity, compactness, preservation of neighborhoods, etc.
				<em>
					statewide
				</em>
				?  And how is the statewide outweighing to be determined?  If three-fifths of the maps districts forgo the pursuit of partisan ends in favor of strictly observing political-subdivision lines, and only two-fifths ignore those lines to disadvantage the plaintiffs, is the observance of political subdivisions the predominant goal between those two?  We are sure appellants do not think so.  
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Even within the narrower compass of challenges to a single district, applying a predominant intent test to 
				<em>
					racial 
				</em>
				gerrymandering is easier and less disruptive.  The Constitution clearly contemplates districting by political entities, see Article I, §4, and unsurprisingly that turns out to be root-and-branch a matter of politics.  See 
				<em>
					Miller,
				</em>
            <em>

				</em>
				at 914 ([R]edistricting in most cases will implicate a political calculus in which various interests compete for recognition …);

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">753</a> (1973)
 (The reality is that districting inevitably has and is intended to have substantial political consequences).  By contrast, the purpose of segregating voters on the basis of race is not a lawful one, and is much more rarely encountered.  Determining whether the shape of a particular district is so substantially affected by the presence of a rare and constitutionally suspect motive as to invalidate it is quite different from determining whether it is so substantially affected by the excess of an ordinary and lawful motive as to invalidate it.  Moreover, the fact that partisan districting is a lawful and common practice means that there is almost 
				<em>
					always
				</em>
				 room for an election-impeding lawsuit contending that partisan advantage was the predominant motivation; not so for claims of racial gerrymandering.  Finally, courts might be justified in accepting a modest degree of unmanageability to enforce a constitutional command which (like the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a> obligation to refrain from racial discrimination) is clear; whereas they are not justified in inferring a judicially enforceable constitutional obligation (the obligation not to apply 
				<em>
					too much
				</em>
				 partisanship in districting) which is both dubious and severely unmanageable.  For these reasons, to the extent that our racial gerrymandering cases represent a model of discernible and manageable standards, they provide no comfort here.

				The effects prong of appellants proposal replaces the 
				<em>
					Bandemer

				 pluralitys vague test of denied its chance to effectively influence the political process, 478 U. S., at 132133, with criteria that are seemingly more specific.

					and 
				</em>
				(2) the courts examination of the totality of circumstances confirms that the map can thwart the plaintiffs ability to translate a majority of votes into a majority of seats.  Brief for Appellants 20 (emphasis and footnote added).  This test is loosely based on our cases applying §2 of the Voting Rights Act, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/1973.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §1973</a>, to discrimination by race, see,

.  But a persons politics is rarely as readily discernibleand 
				<em>
					never
				</em>
				 as permanently discernibleas a persons race.  Political affiliation is not an immutable characteristic, but may shift from one election to the next; and even within a given election, not all voters follow the party line.  We dare say (and hope) that the political party which puts forward an utterly incompetent candidate will lose even in its registration stronghold.  These facts make it impossible to assess the effects of partisan gerrymandering, to fashion a standard for evaluating a violation, and finally to craft a remedy.  See

				Assuming, however, that the effects of partisan gerrymandering can be determined, appellants test would invalidate the districting only when it prevents a majority of the electorate from electing a majority of representatives.  Before considering whether this particular standard is judicially manageable we question whether it is judicially discernible in the sense of being relevant to some constitutional violation.  Deny it as appellants may (and do), this standard rests upon the principle that groups (or at least political-action groups) have a right to proportional representation.  But the Constitution contains no such principle.  It guarantees equal protection of the law to persons, not equal representation in government to equivalently sized groups.  It nowhere says that farmers or urban dwellers, Christian fundamentalists or Jews, Republicans or Democrats, must be accorded political strength proportionate to their numbers.

				Even if the standard were relevant, however, it is not judicially manageable.  To begin with, how is a partys majority status to be established?  Appellants propose using the results of statewide races as the benchmark of party support.  But as their own complaint describes, in the 2000 Pennsylvania statewide elections some Republicans won and some Democrats won.  See Juris. Statement 137a138a (describing how Democrat candidates received more votes for President and auditor general, and Republicans received more votes for United States Senator, attorney general, and treasurer).  Moreover, to think that majority status in statewide races establishes majority status for district contests, one would have to believe that the only factor determining voting behavior at all levels is political affiliation.  That is assuredly not true.  As one law review comment has put it:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				There is no statewide vote in this country for the House of Representatives or the state legislature.  Rather, there are separate elections between separate candidates in separate districts, and that is all there is.  If the districts change, the candidates change, their strengths and weaknesses change, their campaigns change, their ability to raise money changes, the issues changeeverything changes.  Political parties do not compete for the highest statewide vote totals or the highest mean district vote percentages: They compete for specific seats.  Lowenstein &amp; Steinberg, The Quest for Legislative Districting in the Public Interest: Elusive or Illusory, 33 UCLA L. Rev. 1, 5960 (1985).

				But if we could identify a majority party, we would find it impossible to assure that that party wins a majority of seatsunless we radically revise the States traditional structure for elections.  In any winner-take-all district system, there can be no guarantee, no matter how the district lines are drawn, that a majority of party votes statewide will produce a majority of seats for that party.  The point is proved by the 2000 congressional elections in Pennsylvania, which, according to appellants own pleadings, were conducted under a judicially drawn district map free from partisan gerrymandering.  Juris. Statement 137a.  On this neutral playing fiel[d], the Democrats statewide majority of the major-party vote (50.6%) translated into a minority of seats (10, versus 11 for the Republicans).  
				<em>
					Id.

				, at 133a, 137a.  Whether by reason of partisan districting or not, party constituents may always wind up packed in some districts and cracked throughout others.  See R. Dixon, Democratic Representation 462 (1968) (All Districting is Gerrymandering ); Schuck, 87 Colum. L. Rev., at 1359.  Consider, for example, a legislature that draws district lines with no objectives in mind except compactness and respect for the lines of political subdivisions.  Under that system, political groups that tend to cluster (as is the case with Democratic voters in cities) would be systematically affected by what might be called a natural packing effect.  See

, have no bearing upon this question, neither in principle nor in practicality.  Not in principle, because to say that each individual must have an equal say in the selection of representatives, and hence that a majority of individuals must have a majority say, is not at all to say that each discernable group, whether farmers or urban dwellers or political parties, must have representation equivalent to its numbers.  And not in practicality, because the easily administrable standard of population equality adopted by 
				<em>

				</em>
				and 
				<em>
					Reynolds
				</em>
				 enables judges to decide whether a violation has occurred (and to remedy it) essentially on the basis of three readily determined factorswhere the plaintiff lives, how many voters are in his district, and how many voters are in other districts; whereas requiring judges to decide whether a districting system will produce a statewide majority for a majority party casts them forth upon a sea of imponderables, and asks them to make determinations that not even election experts can agree upon.

				For many of the same reasons, we also reject the standard suggested by Justice Powell in

He agreed with the plurality that a plaintiff should show intent and effect, but believed that the ultimate inquiry ought to focus on whether district boundaries had been drawn solely for partisan ends to the exclusion of all other neutral factors relevant to the fairness of redistricting.  478 U. S., at 161 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part); see also 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 164165.  Under that inquiry, the courts should consider numerous factors, though [n]o one factor should be dispositive.  
				<em>

				</em>
				, at 173.  The most important would be the shapes of voting districts and adherence to established political subdivision boundaries.

				  Other relevant considerations include the nature of the legislative procedures by which the apportionment law was adopted and legislative history reflecting contemporaneous legislative goals.  
				<em>

				While Justice Powell rightly criticized the

				 plurality for failing to suggest a constitutionally based, judicially manageable standard, the standard proposed in his opinion also falls short of the mark.  It is essentially a totality-of-the-circumstances analysis, where all conceivable factors, none of which is dispositive, are weighed with an eye to ascertaining whether the particular gerrymander has gone too faror, in Justice Powells terminology, whether it is not fair.  Fairness does not seem to us a judicially manageable standard.  Fairness is compatible with noncontiguous districts, it is compatible with districts that straddle political subdivisions, and it is compatible with a partys not winning the number of seats that mirrors the proportion of its vote.  Some criterion more solid and more demonstrably met than that seems to us necessary to enable the state legislatures to discern the limits of their districting discretion, to meaningfully constrain the discretion of the courts, and to win public acceptance for the courts intrusion into a process that is the very foundation of democratic decisionmaking.

				<em>
					for
				</em>
				.  In the present context, the test ought to identify deprivation of that minimal degree of representation or influence to which a political group is constitutionally entitled.  As we have seen, the

				</em>
				 test sought (unhelpfully, but at least gamely) to specify what that minimal degree was: [a] chance to effectively influence the political process.  478 U. S., at 133.

				<span class="smallcaps">

            <span class="smallcaps">
					Souter

				 avoids the difficulties of those formulations by never telling us what his test is looking for, other than the utterly unhelpful extremity of unfairness.  He vaguely describes the harm he is concerned with as vote dilution, 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, at 10, a term which usually implies some actual effect on the weight of a vote.  But no element of his test looks to the effect of the gerrymander on the electoral success, the electoral opportunity, or even the political influence, of the plaintiff group.  We do not know the precise constitutional deprivation his test is designed to identify and prevent.

        <p class="bodytext">
				

Even if (though it is implausible) 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				 believes that the constitutional deprivation consists of merely vote dilution, his test would not even identify 
				<em>
					that
				</em>
				 effect.  Despite his claimed reliance on the 
				<em>
					McDonnell Douglas
				</em>
				 framework, 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter

            </a>
				  His reason for this is never stated, but it certainly cannot be that adherence to traditional districting factors negates any possibility of intentional vote dilution.  As we have explained above, packing and cracking, whether intentional or no, are quite consistent with adherence to compactness and respect for political subdivision lines.  See 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 20.  An even better example is the traditional criterion of incumbency protection.  
				<span class="smallcaps">

				 has previously acknowledged it to be a traditional and constitutionally acceptable districting principle.  See 
				<em>
					Vera
				</em>
				, 517 U. S., at 10471048 (dissenting opinion).  Since that is so, his test would not protect those who are packed, and often tightly so, to ensure the reelection of representatives of either party.  Indeed, efforts to maximize partisan representation statewide might well begin with packing voters of the opposing party into the districts of existing incumbents of that party.  By this means an incumbent is protected, a potential adversary to the districting mollified, and votes of the opposing party are diluted.

Is the regular insertion of the judiciary into districting, with the delay and uncertainty that brings to the political process and the partisan enmity it brings upon the courts, worth the benefit to be achievedan accelerated (by some unknown degree) effectuation of the majority will?

				 provides no cover.  There, all of the Justices who concluded that political gerrymandering claims are justiciable proceeded to describe what they regarded as the discernible and manageable standard that rendered it so.  The lower courts were set wandering in the wilderness for 18 years not because the 
				<em>

				 majority thought it a good idea, but because five Justices could not agree upon a single standard, and because the standard the plurality proposed turned out not to work.

				As for 
				<em>
					Baker
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Carr:
				</em>
				 It is true enough that, having had no experience 
				<em>
					whatever
				</em>
				 in apportionment matters of any sort, the Court there refrained from spelling out the equal-protection standard.  (It did so a mere two years later in 
				<em>
					Reynolds
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Sims
				</em>
				.)  But the judgment under review in 
				<em>
					Baker
				</em>
				, unlike the one under review here, did not 
				<em>
					demand
				</em>
				 the determination of a standard.  The lower court in 
				<em>
					Baker 
				</em>
				had held the apportionment claim of the plaintiffs 
				<em>
					nonjusticiable
				</em>
				, and so it was logically possible to dispose of the appeal by simply disagreeing with the nonjusticiability determination.  As we observed earlier, that is not possible here, where the lower court has held the claim 
				<em>
					justiciable
				</em>
				 but unsupported by the facts.  We must either enunciate the standard that causes us to agree or disagree with that merits judgment, or else affirm that the claim is beyond our competence to adjudicate.

What we think would erode confidence is the Courts refusal to do its jobannouncing that there may well be a valid claim here, but we are not yet prepared to figure it out.  Moreover, that course does more than erode confidence; by placing the district courts back in the business of pretending to afford help when they in fact can give none, it deters the political process from affording genuine relief.

				s holding that the judiciary is to address excessive partisan line-drawing, while leaving the issue virtually unenforceable.  Inevitably, as the political party in power uses district lines to lock in its present advantage, the party out of power attempts to stretch the protective cover of the Voting Rights Act, urging dilution of critical standards that may, if accepted, aid their party in the short-run but work to the detriment of persons now protected by the Act in the long-run.

We suggest that they must treat it as a reluctant fifth vote against justiciability at district and statewide levelsa vote that may change in some future case but that holds, for the time being, that this matter is nonjusticiable.

				Considerations of

				 because the majoritys inability to enunciate the judicially discernible and manageable standard that it thought existed (or did not think did not exist) presaged the need for reconsideration in light of subsequent experience.

						 The term political gerrymander has been defined as [t]he practice of dividing a geographical area into electoral districts, often of highly irregular shape, to give one political party an unfair advantage by diluting the oppositions voting strength.  Blacks Law Dictionary 696 (7th ed. 1999).

						 The plaintiffs apparently never amended their complaint to allege that Act 34 was a political gerrymander, yet the District Courts decision in Vieth III resolved that claim on the merits.  Because subject-matter jurisdiction is not implicated and neither party has raised the point, we assume that the District Court deemed the plaintiffs original complaint to have been constructively amended.

In the elections for superior court judges conducted just five days after this pronouncement, every Republican candidate standing for the office of superior court judge was victorious at the state level, ibid., a result which the Fourth Circuit thought (with good reason) directly at odds with the recent prediction by the district court, id., at *2, causing it to remand the case for reconsideration.

						 The Constitution also does not share appellants alarm at the asserted tendency of partisan gerrymandering to create more partisan representatives.  Assuming that assertion to be true, the Constitution does not answer the question whether it is better for Democratic voters to have their States congressional delegation include 10 wishy-washy Democrats (because Democratic voters are effectively distributed so as to constitute bare majorities in many districts), or 5 hardcore Democrats (because Democratic voters are tightly packed in a few districts).  Choosing the former dilutes the vote of the radical Democrat; choosing the latter does the same to the moderate.  Neither Article I, §2, nor the Equal Protection Clause takes sides in this dispute.

						 Justice Souter would allow a State, in proving its affirmative defense, to demonstrate that the reasons given for the districts shape were more than a mere pretext for an old-fashioned gerrymander.  Post, at 11.  But the need to establish that affirmative defense does not arise until the plaintiff has established his prima facie case.  And that prima facie case fails when, under step two, the district on its face complies with traditional districting criteria.

				The facts, as alleged by the plaintiffs, are as follows.  The population figures derived from the 2000 census showed that Pennsylvania was entitled to only 19 Representatives in Congress, a decrease in 2 from the Commonwealths previous delegation.  Pennsylvanias General Assembly took up the task of drawing a new districting map.  At the time, the Republican party controlled a majority of both state Houses and held the Governors office.  Prominent national figures in the Republican Party pressured the General Assembly to adopt a partisan redistricting plan as a punitive measure against Democrats for having enacted pro-Democrat redistricting plans elsewhere.  The Republican members of Pennsylvanias House and Senate worked together on such a plan.  On January 3, 2002, the General Assembly passed its plan, which was signed into law by Governor Schweiker as Act 1.

				Political gerrymanders are not new to the American scene.  One scholar traces them back to the Colony of Pennsylvania at the beginning of the 18th century, where several counties conspired to minimize the political power of the city of Philadelphia by refusing to allow it to merge or expand into surrounding jurisdictions, and denying it additional representatives.  See E. Griffith, The Rise and Development of the Gerrymander 2628 (1974) (hereinafter Griffith).  In 1732, two members of His Majestys Council and the attorney general and deputy inspector and comptroller general of affairs of the Province of North Carolina reported that the Governor had proceeded to divide old Precincts established by Law, &amp; to enact new Ones in Places, whereby his Arts he has endeavored to prepossess People in a future election according to his desire, his Designs herein being … either to endeavor by his means to get a Majority of his creatures in the Lower House or to disrupt the assemblys proceedings.  3 Colonial Records of North Carolina 380381 (W. Saunders ed. 1886); see also Griffith 29.  The political gerrymander remained alive and well (though not yet known by that name) at the time of the framing.  There were allegations that Patrick Henry attempted (unsuccessfully) to gerrymander James Madison out of the First Congress.  See 2 W. Rives, Life and Times of James Madison 655, n. 1 (reprint 1970); Letter from Thomas Jefferson to William Short, Feb. 9, 1789, reprinted in 5 Works of Thomas Jefferson 451 (P. Ford ed. 1904).  And in 1812, of course, there occurred the notoriously outrageous political districting in Massachusetts that gave the gerrymander its namean amalgam of the names of Massachusetts Governor Elbridge Gerry and the creature (salamander) which the outline of an election district he was credited with forming was thought to resemble.  See Websters New International Dictionary 1052 (2d ed. 1945).  By 1840 the gerrymander was a recognized force in party politics and was generally attempted in all legislation enacted for the formation of election districts.  It was generally conceded that each party would attempt to gain power which was not proportionate to its numerical strength.  Griffith 123.

				It is significant that the Framers provided a remedy for such practices in the Constitution.  Article 1, §4, while leaving in state legislatures the initial power to draw districts for federal elections, permitted Congress to make or alter those districts if it wished.

				  Many objected to the congressional oversight established by this provision.  In the course of the debates in the Constitutional Convention, Charles Pinkney and John Rutledge moved to strike the relevant language.  James Madison responded in defense of the provision that Congress must be given the power to check partisan manipulation of the election process by the States:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				Whenever the State Legislatures had a favorite measure to carry, they would take care so to mould their regulations as to favor the candidates they wished to succeed.  Besides, the inequality of the Representation in the Legislatures of particular States, would produce a like inequality in their representation in the Natl. Legislature, as it was presumable that the Counties having the power in the former case would secure it to themselves in the latter.  What danger could there be in giving a controuling power to the Natl. Legislature?  2 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, pp. 240241 (M. Farrand ed. 1911).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
Although the motion of Pinkney and Rutledge failed, opposition to the make or alter provision of Article I, §4and the defense that it was needed to prevent political gerrymanderingcontinued to be voiced in the state ratifying debates.  A delegate to the Massachusetts convention warned that state legislatures
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				might make an unequal and partial division of the states into districts for the election of representatives, or they might even disqualify one third of the electors.  Without these powers in Congress, the people can have no remedy; But the 4th section provides a remedy, a controlling power in a legislature, composed of senators and representatives of twelve states, without the influence of our commotions and factions, who will hear impartially, and preserve and restore to the people their equal and sacred rights of election.  2 Debates on the Federal Constitution 27 (J. Elliot 2d ed. 1876).

				The power bestowed on Congress to regulate elections, and in particular to restrain the practice of political gerrymandering, has not lain dormant.  In the Apportionment Act of 1842, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">5</a>Stat.
491, Congress provided that Representatives must be elected from single-member districts composed of contiguous territory.  See Griffith 12 (noting that the law was an attempt to forbid the practice of the gerrymander).  Congress again imposed these requirements in the Apportionment Act of 1862, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">12</a>Stat.
572, and in 1872 further required that districts contai[n] as nearly as practicable an equal number of inhabitants, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">17</a>Stat.
28, §2.  In the Apportionment Act of 1901, Congress imposed a compactness requirement.  
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">31</a>Stat.
733.  The requirements of contiguity, compactness, and equality of population were repeated in the 1911 apportionment legislation, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">37</a>Stat.
13, but were not thereafter continued.  Today, only the single-member-district-requirement remains.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/2/2c.html" class="subref" title="subref">2 U. S. C. §2c</a>.  Recent history, however, attests to Congresss awareness of the sort of districting practices appellants protest, and of its power under Article I, §4 to control them.  Since 1980, no fewer than five bills have been introduced to regulate gerrymandering in congressional districting.  See H. R. 5037, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. (1990); H. R. 1711, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. (1989); H. R. 3468, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. (1983); H. R. 5529, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. (1982); H. R. 2349, 97th Cong., 1st Sess. (1981).

				Over the dissent of three Justices, the Court held in 
				<em>
					Davis
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Bandemer
				</em>
				 that, since it was not persuaded that there are no judicially discernible and manageable standards by which political gerrymander cases are to be decided, 478 U. S., at 123, such cases 
				<em>
					were 
				</em>
				justiciable.  The clumsy shifting of the burden of proof for the premise (the Court was not persuaded that standards do not exist, rather than persuaded that they do) was necessitated by the uncomfortable fact that the six-Justice majority could not discern what the judicially discernable standards might be.  There was no majority on that point.  Four of the Justices finding justiciability believed that the standard was one thing, see

The lower courts have lived with that assurance of a standard (or more precisely, lack of assurance that there is no standard), coupled with that inability to specify a standard, for the past 18 years.  In that time, they have considered numerous political gerrymandering claims; this Court has never revisited the unanswered question of what standard governs.

				Nor can it be said that the lower courts have, over 18 years, succeeded in shaping the standard that this Court was initially unable to enunciate.  They have simply applied the standard set forth in
				<em>
					 Bandemer
				</em>
				s four-Justice plurality opinion.  This might be thought to prove that the four-Justice plurality standard has met the test of timebut for the fact that its application has almost invariably produced the same result (except for the incurring of attorneys fees) as would have obtained if the question were nonjusticiable: judicial intervention has been refused.  As one commentary has put it, [t]hroughout its subsequent history, 
				<em>

				 has served almost exclusively as an invitation to litigation without much prospect of redress.  S. Issacharoff, P. Karlan, &amp; R. Pildes, The Law of Democracy 886 (rev. 2d ed. 2002).  The one case in which relief was provided (and merely preliminary relief, at that) did

				Eighteen years of judicial effort with virtually nothing to show for it justify us in revisiting the question whether the standard promised by 
				<em>
					Bandemer
				</em>
				 exists.  As the following discussion reveals, no judicially discernible and manageable standards for adjudicating political gerrymandering claims have emerged.  Lacking them, we must conclude that political gerrymandering claims are nonjusticiable and that

				 was wrongly decided.

				We begin our review of possible standards with that proposed by Justice Whites plurality opinion in 
				<em>
					Bandemer
				</em>
				 because, as the narrowest ground for our decision in that case, it has been the standard employed by the lower courts.  The plurality concluded that a political gerrymandering claim could succeed only where plaintiffs showed both intentional discrimination against an identifiable political group and an actual discriminatory effect on that group.  478 U. S., at 127.  As to the intent element, the plurality acknowledged that [a]s long as redistricting is done by a legislature, it should not be very difficult to prove that the likely political consequences of the reapportionment were intended.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 129.  However, the effects prong was significantly harder to satisfy.  Relief could not be based merely upon the fact that a group of persons banded together for political purposes had failed to achieve representation commensurate with its numbers, or that the apportionment scheme made its winning of elections more difficult.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 132.  Rather, it would have to be shown that, taking into account a variety of historic factors and projected election results, the group had been denied its chance to effectively influence the political process as a whole, which could be achieved even without electing a candidate.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 132133.  It would not be enough to establish, for example, that Democrats had been placed in a district with a supermajority of other Democratic voters or that the district departs from pre-existing political boundaries.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 140141.  Rather, in a challenge to an individual district the inquiry would focus on the opportunity of members of the group to participate in party deliberations in the slating and nomination of candidates, their opportunity to register and vote, and hence their chance to directly influence the election returns and to secure the attention of the winning candidate.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 133.  A statewide challenge, by contrast, would involve an analysis of the voters direct 
				<em>
					or indirect 
				</em>
				influence on the elections of the state legislature as a whole.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				 (emphasis added).  With what has proved to be a gross understatement, the plurality acknowledged this was of necessity a difficult inquiry.

Tribe, American Constitutional Law §139, p. 1083 (2d ed. 1988) (Neither Justice Whites nor Justice Powells approach to the question of partisan apportionment gives any real guidance to lower courts forced to adjudicate this issue …); Still, Hunting of the Gerrymander, 38 UCLA L.

L. Rev. 1325, 1365 (1987) (noting that the

				Appellants take a run at enunciating their own workable standard based on Article I, §2, and the Equal Protection Clause.  We consider it at length not only because it reflects the litigants view as to the best that can be derived from 18 years of experience, but also because it shares many features with other proposed standards, so that what is said of it may be said of them as well.  Appellants proposed standard retains the two-pronged framework of the

				Predominant intent to disadvantage the plaintiff political group refers to the relative importance of that goal as compared with all the other goals that the map seeks to pursuecontiguity of districts, compactness of districts, observance of the lines of political subdivision, protection of incumbents of all parties, cohesion of natural racial and ethnic neighborhoods, compliance with requirements of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 regarding racial distribution, etc.  Appellants contend that their intent test

				?  And how is the statewide outweighing to be determined?  If three-fifths of the maps districts forgo the pursuit of partisan ends in favor of strictly observing political-subdivision lines, and only two-fifths ignore those lines to disadvantage the plaintiffs, is the observance of political subdivisions the predominant goal between those two?  We are sure appellants do not think so.

				Even within the narrower compass of challenges to a single district, applying a predominant intent test to

 (The reality is that districting inevitably has and is intended to have substantial political consequences).  By contrast, the purpose of segregating voters on the basis of race is not a lawful one, and is much more rarely encountered.  Determining whether the shape of a particular district is so substantially affected by the presence of a rare and constitutionally suspect motive as to invalidate it is quite different from determining whether it is so substantially affected by the excess of an ordinary and lawful motive as to invalidate it.  Moreover, the fact that partisan districting is a lawful and common practice means that there is almost 
				<em>
					always
				</em>
				 room for an election-impeding lawsuit contending that partisan advantage was the predominant motivation; not so for claims of racial gerrymandering.  Finally, courts might be justified in accepting a modest degree of unmanageability to enforce a constitutional command which (like the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a> obligation to refrain from racial discrimination) is clear; whereas they are not justified in inferring a judicially enforceable constitutional obligation (the obligation not to apply 
				<em>
					too much
				</em>
				 partisanship in districting) which is both dubious and severely unmanageable.  For these reasons, to the extent that our racial gerrymandering cases represent a model of discernible and manageable standards, they provide no comfort here.

				The effects prong of appellants proposal replaces the

				(2) the courts examination of the totality of circumstances confirms that the map can thwart the plaintiffs ability to translate a majority of votes into a majority of seats.  Brief for Appellants 20 (emphasis and footnote added).  This test is loosely based on our cases applying §2 of the Voting Rights Act,

Political affiliation is not an immutable characteristic, but may shift from one election to the next; and even within a given election, not all voters follow the party line.  We dare say (and hope) that the political party which puts forward an utterly incompetent candidate will lose even in its registration stronghold.  These facts make it impossible to assess the effects of partisan gerrymandering, to fashion a standard for evaluating a violation, and finally to craft a remedy.  See

				Assuming, however, that the effects of partisan gerrymandering can be determined, appellants test would invalidate the districting only when it prevents a majority of the electorate from electing a majority of representatives.  Before considering whether this particular standard is judicially manageable we question whether it is judicially discernible in the sense of being relevant to some constitutional violation.  Deny it as appellants may (and do), this standard rests upon the principle that groups (or at least political-action groups) have a right to proportional representation.  But the Constitution contains no such principle.  It guarantees equal protection of the law to persons, not equal representation in government to equivalently sized groups.  It nowhere says that farmers or urban dwellers, Christian fundamentalists or Jews, Republicans or Democrats, must be accorded political strength proportionate to their numbers.

				Even if the standard were relevant, however, it is not judicially manageable.  To begin with, how is a partys majority status to be established?  Appellants propose using the results of statewide races as the benchmark of party support.  But as their own complaint describes, in the 2000 Pennsylvania statewide elections some Republicans won and some Democrats won.  See Juris. Statement 137a138a (describing how Democrat candidates received more votes for President and auditor general, and Republicans received more votes for United States Senator, attorney general, and treasurer).  Moreover, to think that majority status in statewide races establishes majority status for district contests, one would have to believe that the only factor determining voting behavior at all levels is political affiliation.  That is assuredly not true.  As one law review comment has put it:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				There is no statewide vote in this country for the House of Representatives or the state legislature.  Rather, there are separate elections between separate candidates in separate districts, and that is all there is.  If the districts change, the candidates change, their strengths and weaknesses change, their campaigns change, their ability to raise money changes, the issues changeeverything changes.  Political parties do not compete for the highest statewide vote totals or the highest mean district vote percentages: They compete for specific seats.  Lowenstein &amp; Steinberg, The Quest for Legislative Districting in the Public Interest: Elusive or Illusory, 33 UCLA L. Rev. 1, 5960 (1985).

				But if we could identify a majority party, we would find it impossible to assure that that party wins a majority of seatsunless we radically revise the States traditional structure for elections.  In any winner-take-all district system, there can be no guarantee, no matter how the district lines are drawn, that a majority of party votes statewide will produce a majority of seats for that party.  The point is proved by the 2000 congressional elections in Pennsylvania, which, according to appellants own pleadings, were conducted under a judicially drawn district map free from partisan gerrymandering.  Juris. Statement 137a.  On this neutral playing fiel[d], the Democrats statewide majority of the major-party vote (50.6%) translated into a minority of seats (10, versus 11 for the Republicans).

				, at 133a, 137a.  Whether by reason of partisan districting or not, party constituents may always wind up packed in some districts and cracked throughout others.  See R. Dixon, Democratic Representation 462 (1968) (All Districting is Gerrymandering ); Schuck, 87 Colum. L. Rev., at 1359.  Consider, for example, a legislature that draws district lines with no objectives in mind except compactness and respect for the lines of political subdivisions.  Under that system, political groups that tend to cluster (as is the case with Democratic voters in cities) would be systematically affected by what might be called a natural packing effect.  See

, have no bearing upon this question, neither in principle nor in practicality.  Not in principle, because to say that each individual must have an equal say in the selection of representatives, and hence that a majority of individuals must have a majority say, is not at all to say that each discernable group, whether farmers or urban dwellers or political parties, must have representation equivalent to its numbers.  And not in practicality, because the easily administrable standard of population equality adopted by 
				<em>

				For many of the same reasons, we also reject the standard suggested by Justice Powell in

He agreed with the plurality that a plaintiff should show intent and effect, but believed that the ultimate inquiry ought to focus on whether district boundaries had been drawn solely for partisan ends to the exclusion of all other neutral factors relevant to the fairness of redistricting.  478 U. S., at 161 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part); see also 
				<em>
					id.

				, at 164165.  Under that inquiry, the courts should consider numerous factors, though [n]o one factor should be dispositive.

				While Justice Powell rightly criticized the

				 plurality for failing to suggest a constitutionally based, judicially manageable standard, the standard proposed in his opinion also falls short of the mark.  It is essentially a totality-of-the-circumstances analysis, where all conceivable factors, none of which is dispositive, are weighed with an eye to ascertaining whether the particular gerrymander has gone too faror, in Justice Powells terminology, whether it is not fair.  Fairness does not seem to us a judicially manageable standard.  Fairness is compatible with noncontiguous districts, it is compatible with districts that straddle political subdivisions, and it is compatible with a partys not winning the number of seats that mirrors the proportion of its vote.  Some criterion more solid and more demonstrably met than that seems to us necessary to enable the state legislatures to discern the limits of their districting discretion, to meaningfully constrain the discretion of the courts, and to win public acceptance for the courts intrusion into a process that is the very foundation of democratic decisionmaking.

        <p class="bodytext">

				<span class="smallcaps">

            <span class="smallcaps">
					Souter

				 avoids the difficulties of those formulations by never telling us what his test is looking for, other than the utterly unhelpful extremity of unfairness.  He vaguely describes the harm he is concerned with as vote dilution, 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, at 10, a term which usually implies some actual effect on the weight of a vote.  But no element of his test looks to the effect of the gerrymander on the electoral success, the electoral opportunity, or even the political influence, of the plaintiff group.  We do not know the precise constitutional deprivation his test is designed to identify and prevent.

        <p class="bodytext">
				

Even if (though it is implausible) 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				 believes that the constitutional deprivation consists of merely vote dilution, his test would not even identify 
				<em>
					that
				</em>
				 effect.  Despite his claimed reliance on the 
				<em>
					McDonnell Douglas
				</em>
				 framework, 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter

				  His reason for this is never stated, but it certainly cannot be that adherence to traditional districting factors negates any possibility of intentional vote dilution.  As we have explained above, packing and cracking, whether intentional or no, are quite consistent with adherence to compactness and respect for political subdivision lines.  See 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 20.  An even better example is the traditional criterion of incumbency protection.  
				<span class="smallcaps">

				 has previously acknowledged it to be a traditional and constitutionally acceptable districting principle.  See 
				<em>
					Vera
				</em>
				, 517 U. S., at 10471048 (dissenting opinion).  Since that is so, his test would not protect those who are packed, and often tightly so, to ensure the reelection of representatives of either party.  Indeed, efforts to maximize partisan representation statewide might well begin with packing voters of the opposing party into the districts of existing incumbents of that party.  By this means an incumbent is protected, a potential adversary to the districting mollified, and votes of the opposing party are diluted.

Is the regular insertion of the judiciary into districting, with the delay and uncertainty that brings to the political process and the partisan enmity it brings upon the courts, worth the benefit to be achievedan accelerated (by some unknown degree) effectuation of the majority will?

						 The States, of course, have taken their own steps to prevent abusive districting practices.  A number have adopted standards for redistricting, and measures designed to insulate the process from politics.  See, e.g., Iowa Code §42.4(5) (2003); N. J. Const., Art. II, §2; Haw. Rev. Stat. §252 (1993); Idaho Code §721506 (19481999); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 21A, §§1206, 1206A (West Supp. 2003); Mont. Code Ann. §51115 (2003); Wash. Rev. Code §44.05.090 (1994).

In the elections for superior court judges conducted just five days after this pronouncement, every Republican candidate standing for the office of superior court judge was victorious at the state level, ibid., a result which the Fourth Circuit thought (with good reason) directly at odds with the recent prediction by the district court, id., at *2, causing it to remand the case for reconsideration.

						 The Constitution also does not share appellants alarm at the asserted tendency of partisan gerrymandering to create more partisan representatives.  Assuming that assertion to be true, the Constitution does not answer the question whether it is better for Democratic voters to have their States congressional delegation include 10 wishy-washy Democrats (because Democratic voters are effectively distributed so as to constitute bare majorities in many districts), or 5 hardcore Democrats (because Democratic voters are tightly packed in a few districts).  Choosing the former dilutes the vote of the radical Democrat; choosing the latter does the same to the moderate.  Neither Article I, §2, nor the Equal Protection Clause takes sides in this dispute.

						 Justice Souter would allow a State, in proving its affirmative defense, to demonstrate that the reasons given for the districts shape were more than a mere pretext for an old-fashioned gerrymander.  Post, at 11.  But the need to establish that affirmative defense does not arise until the plaintiff has established his prima facie case.  And that prima facie case fails when, under step two, the district on its face complies with traditional districting criteria.

				The facts, as alleged by the plaintiffs, are as follows.  The population figures derived from the 2000 census showed that Pennsylvania was entitled to only 19 Representatives in Congress, a decrease in 2 from the Commonwealths previous delegation.  Pennsylvanias General Assembly took up the task of drawing a new districting map.  At the time, the Republican party controlled a majority of both state Houses and held the Governors office.  Prominent national figures in the Republican Party pressured the General Assembly to adopt a partisan redistricting plan as a punitive measure against Democrats for having enacted pro-Democrat redistricting plans elsewhere.  The Republican members of Pennsylvanias House and Senate worked together on such a plan.  On January 3, 2002, the General Assembly passed its plan, which was signed into law by Governor Schweiker as Act 1.

				Political gerrymanders are not new to the American scene.  One scholar traces them back to the Colony of Pennsylvania at the beginning of the 18th century, where several counties conspired to minimize the political power of the city of Philadelphia by refusing to allow it to merge or expand into surrounding jurisdictions, and denying it additional representatives.  See E. Griffith, The Rise and Development of the Gerrymander 2628 (1974) (hereinafter Griffith).  In 1732, two members of His Majestys Council and the attorney general and deputy inspector and comptroller general of affairs of the Province of North Carolina reported that the Governor had proceeded to divide old Precincts established by Law, &amp; to enact new Ones in Places, whereby his Arts he has endeavored to prepossess People in a future election according to his desire, his Designs herein being … either to endeavor by his means to get a Majority of his creatures in the Lower House or to disrupt the assemblys proceedings.  3 Colonial Records of North Carolina 380381 (W. Saunders ed. 1886); see also Griffith 29.  The political gerrymander remained alive and well (though not yet known by that name) at the time of the framing.  There were allegations that Patrick Henry attempted (unsuccessfully) to gerrymander James Madison out of the First Congress.  See 2 W. Rives, Life and Times of James Madison 655, n. 1 (reprint 1970); Letter from Thomas Jefferson to William Short, Feb. 9, 1789, reprinted in 5 Works of Thomas Jefferson 451 (P. Ford ed. 1904).  And in 1812, of course, there occurred the notoriously outrageous political districting in Massachusetts that gave the gerrymander its namean amalgam of the names of Massachusetts Governor Elbridge Gerry and the creature (salamander) which the outline of an election district he was credited with forming was thought to resemble.  See Websters New International Dictionary 1052 (2d ed. 1945).  By 1840 the gerrymander was a recognized force in party politics and was generally attempted in all legislation enacted for the formation of election districts.  It was generally conceded that each party would attempt to gain power which was not proportionate to its numerical strength.  Griffith 123.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				It is significant that the Framers provided a remedy for such practices in the Constitution.  Article 1, §4, while leaving in state legislatures the initial power to draw districts for federal elections, permitted Congress to make or alter those districts if it wished.

				  Many objected to the congressional oversight established by this provision.  In the course of the debates in the Constitutional Convention, Charles Pinkney and John Rutledge moved to strike the relevant language.  James Madison responded in defense of the provision that Congress must be given the power to check partisan manipulation of the election process by the States:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				Whenever the State Legislatures had a favorite measure to carry, they would take care so to mould their regulations as to favor the candidates they wished to succeed.  Besides, the inequality of the Representation in the Legislatures of particular States, would produce a like inequality in their representation in the Natl. Legislature, as it was presumable that the Counties having the power in the former case would secure it to themselves in the latter.  What danger could there be in giving a controuling power to the Natl. Legislature?  2 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, pp. 240241 (M. Farrand ed. 1911).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
Although the motion of Pinkney and Rutledge failed, opposition to the make or alter provision of Article I, §4and the defense that it was needed to prevent political gerrymanderingcontinued to be voiced in the state ratifying debates.  A delegate to the Massachusetts convention warned that state legislatures
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				might make an unequal and partial division of the states into districts for the election of representatives, or they might even disqualify one third of the electors.  Without these powers in Congress, the people can have no remedy; But the 4th section provides a remedy, a controlling power in a legislature, composed of senators and representatives of twelve states, without the influence of our commotions and factions, who will hear impartially, and preserve and restore to the people their equal and sacred rights of election.  2 Debates on the Federal Constitution 27 (J. Elliot 2d ed. 1876).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				The power bestowed on Congress to regulate elections, and in particular to restrain the practice of political gerrymandering, has not lain dormant.  In the Apportionment Act of 1842, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">5</a>Stat.
491, Congress provided that Representatives must be elected from single-member districts composed of contiguous territory.  See Griffith 12 (noting that the law was an attempt to forbid the practice of the gerrymander).  Congress again imposed these requirements in the Apportionment Act of 1862, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">12</a>Stat.
572, and in 1872 further required that districts contai[n] as nearly as practicable an equal number of inhabitants, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">17</a>Stat.
28, §2.  In the Apportionment Act of 1901, Congress imposed a compactness requirement.  
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">31</a>Stat.
733.  The requirements of contiguity, compactness, and equality of population were repeated in the 1911 apportionment legislation, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">37</a>Stat.
13, but were not thereafter continued.  Today, only the single-member-district-requirement remains.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/2/2c.html" class="subref" title="subref">2 U. S. C. §2c</a>.  Recent history, however, attests to Congresss awareness of the sort of districting practices appellants protest, and of its power under Article I, §4 to control them.  Since 1980, no fewer than five bills have been introduced to regulate gerrymandering in congressional districting.  See H. R. 5037, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. (1990); H. R. 1711, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. (1989); H. R. 3468, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. (1983); H. R. 5529, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. (1982); H. R. 2349, 97th Cong., 1st Sess. (1981).

				Over the dissent of three Justices, the Court held in

				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Bandemer
				</em>
				 that, since it was not persuaded that there are no judicially discernible and manageable standards by which political gerrymander cases are to be decided, 478 U. S., at 123, such cases 
				<em>
					were 
				</em>
				justiciable.  The clumsy shifting of the burden of proof for the premise (the Court was not persuaded that standards do not exist, rather than persuaded that they do) was necessitated by the uncomfortable fact that the six-Justice majority could not discern what the judicially discernable standards might be.  There was no majority on that point.  Four of the Justices finding justiciability believed that the standard was one thing, see

				Nor can it be said that the lower courts have, over 18 years, succeeded in shaping the standard that this Court was initially unable to enunciate.  They have simply applied the standard set forth in

				s four-Justice plurality opinion.  This might be thought to prove that the four-Justice plurality standard has met the test of timebut for the fact that its application has almost invariably produced the same result (except for the incurring of attorneys fees) as would have obtained if the question were nonjusticiable: judicial intervention has been refused.  As one commentary has put it, [t]hroughout its subsequent history,

				Eighteen years of judicial effort with virtually nothing to show for it justify us in revisiting the question whether the standard promised by 
				<em>
					Bandemer
				</em>
				 exists.  As the following discussion reveals, no judicially discernible and manageable standards for adjudicating political gerrymandering claims have emerged.  Lacking them, we must conclude that political gerrymandering claims are nonjusticiable and that

				We begin our review of possible standards with that proposed by Justice Whites plurality opinion in 
				<em>
					Bandemer
				</em>
				 because, as the narrowest ground for our decision in that case, it has been the standard employed by the lower courts.  The plurality concluded that a political gerrymandering claim could succeed only where plaintiffs showed both intentional discrimination against an identifiable political group and an actual discriminatory effect on that group.  478 U. S., at 127.  As to the intent element, the plurality acknowledged that [a]s long as redistricting is done by a legislature, it should not be very difficult to prove that the likely political consequences of the reapportionment were intended.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 129.  However, the effects prong was significantly harder to satisfy.  Relief could not be based merely upon the fact that a group of persons banded together for political purposes had failed to achieve representation commensurate with its numbers, or that the apportionment scheme made its winning of elections more difficult.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 132.  Rather, it would have to be shown that, taking into account a variety of historic factors and projected election results, the group had been denied its chance to effectively influence the political process as a whole, which could be achieved even without electing a candidate.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 132133.  It would not be enough to establish, for example, that Democrats had been placed in a district with a supermajority of other Democratic voters or that the district departs from pre-existing political boundaries.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 140141.  Rather, in a challenge to an individual district the inquiry would focus on the opportunity of members of the group to participate in party deliberations in the slating and nomination of candidates, their opportunity to register and vote, and hence their chance to directly influence the election returns and to secure the attention of the winning candidate.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 133.  A statewide challenge, by contrast, would involve an analysis of the voters direct 
				<em>
					or indirect 
				</em>
				influence on the elections of the state legislature as a whole.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				 (emphasis added).  With what has proved to be a gross understatement, the plurality acknowledged this was of necessity a difficult inquiry.

					Id.

				, 
				<em>

				</em>
				, L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law §139, p. 1083 (2d ed. 1988) (Neither Justice Whites nor Justice Powells approach to the question of partisan apportionment gives any real guidance to lower courts forced to adjudicate this issue …); Still, Hunting of the Gerrymander, 38 UCLA L.

L. Rev. 1325, 1365 (1987) (noting that the

				Appellants take a run at enunciating their own workable standard based on Article I, §2, and the Equal Protection Clause.  We consider it at length not only because it reflects the litigants view as to the best that can be derived from 18 years of experience, but also because it shares many features with other proposed standards, so that what is said of it may be said of them as well.  Appellants proposed standard retains the two-pronged framework of the 
				<em>
					Bandemer
				</em>
				 pluralityintent plus effectbut modifies the type of showing sufficient to satisfy each. 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				To satisfy appellants intent standard, a plaintiff must show that the mapmakers acted with a 
				<em>
					predominant intent 
				</em>
				to achieve partisan advantage, which can be shown by direct evidence or by circumstantial evidence that other neutral and legitimate redistricting criteria were subordinated to the goal of achieving partisan advantage.  Brief for Appellants 19 (emphasis added).  As compared with the 
				<em>
					Bandemer
				</em>
				 pluralitys test of mere intent to disadvantage the plaintiffs group, this proposal seemingly makes the standard more difficult to meetbut only at the expense of making the standard more indeterminate.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Predominant intent to disadvantage the plaintiff political group refers to the relative importance of that goal as compared with all the other goals that the map seeks to pursuecontiguity of districts, compactness of districts, observance of the lines of political subdivision, protection of incumbents of all parties, cohesion of natural racial and ethnic neighborhoods, compliance with requirements of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 regarding racial distribution, etc.  Appellants contend that their intent test 
				<em>
					must 
				</em>
				be discernible and manageable because it has been borrowed from our racial gerrymandering cases.  See 
				<em>
					Miller
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Johnson,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/515/900" class="subref" title="subref">515 U. S. 900</a> (1995)

.  To begin with, in a very important respect that is not so.  In the racial gerrymandering context, the predominant intent test has been applied to the challenged district in which the plaintiffs voted.  See 
				<em>
					Miller
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra;
				</em>
            <em>
					United States
				</em>

.  Here, however, appellants do not assert that an apportionment fails their intent test if any single district does so.  Since it would be quixotic to attempt to bar state legislatures from considering politics as they redraw district lines, Brief for Appellants 3, appellants propose a test that is satisfied only when partisan advantage was the predominant motivation 
				<em>
					behind the entire statewide plan
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 32 (emphasis added).  Vague as the predominant motivation test might be when used to evaluate single districts, it all but evaporates when applied statewide.  Does it mean, for instance, that partisan intent must outweigh all other goalscontiguity, compactness, preservation of neighborhoods, etc.
				<em>
					statewide
				</em>
				?  And how is the statewide outweighing to be determined?  If three-fifths of the maps districts forgo the pursuit of partisan ends in favor of strictly observing political-subdivision lines, and only two-fifths ignore those lines to disadvantage the plaintiffs, is the observance of political subdivisions the predominant goal between those two?  We are sure appellants do not think so.  
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Even within the narrower compass of challenges to a single district, applying a predominant intent test to 
				<em>
					racial 
				</em>
				gerrymandering is easier and less disruptive.  The Constitution clearly contemplates districting by political entities, see Article I, §4, and unsurprisingly that turns out to be root-and-branch a matter of politics.  See 
				<em>
					Miller,
				</em>
            <em>
					supra, 
				</em>
				at 914 ([R]edistricting in most cases will implicate a political calculus in which various interests compete for recognition …); 
				<em>
					Shaw, supra, 
				</em>
				at 662 (White, J., dissenting) ([D]istricting inevitably is the expression of interest group politics …);

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">753</a> (1973)
 (The reality is that districting inevitably has and is intended to have substantial political consequences).  By contrast, the purpose of segregating voters on the basis of race is not a lawful one, and is much more rarely encountered.  Determining whether the shape of a particular district is so substantially affected by the presence of a rare and constitutionally suspect motive as to invalidate it is quite different from determining whether it is so substantially affected by the excess of an ordinary and lawful motive as to invalidate it.  Moreover, the fact that partisan districting is a lawful and common practice means that there is almost 
				<em>
					always
				</em>
				 room for an election-impeding lawsuit contending that partisan advantage was the predominant motivation; not so for claims of racial gerrymandering.  Finally, courts might be justified in accepting a modest degree of unmanageability to enforce a constitutional command which (like the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a> obligation to refrain from racial discrimination) is clear; whereas they are not justified in inferring a judicially enforceable constitutional obligation (the obligation not to apply 
				<em>
					too much
				</em>
				 partisanship in districting) which is both dubious and severely unmanageable.  For these reasons, to the extent that our racial gerrymandering cases represent a model of discernible and manageable standards, they provide no comfort here.

				The effects prong of appellants proposal replaces the 
				<em>
					Bandemer
				</em>
				 pluralitys vague test of denied its chance to effectively influence the political process, 478 U. S., at 132133, with criteria that are seemingly more specific.  The requisite effect is established when (1) the plaintiffs show that the districts systematically pack and crack the rival partys voters,

            <em>
					and 
				</em>
				(2) the courts examination of the totality of circumstances confirms that the map can thwart the plaintiffs ability to translate a majority of votes into a majority of seats.  Brief for Appellants 20 (emphasis and footnote added).  This test is loosely based on our cases applying §2 of the Voting Rights Act, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/1973.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §1973</a>, to discrimination by race, see,

.  But a persons politics is rarely as readily discernibleand 
				<em>
					never
				</em>
				 as permanently discernibleas a persons race.  Political affiliation is not an immutable characteristic, but may shift from one election to the next; and even within a given election, not all voters follow the party line.  We dare say (and hope) that the political party which puts forward an utterly incompetent candidate will lose even in its registration stronghold.  These facts make it impossible to assess the effects of partisan gerrymandering, to fashion a standard for evaluating a violation, and finally to craft a remedy.  See 
				<em>
					Bandemer

				Assuming, however, that the effects of partisan gerrymandering can be determined, appellants test would invalidate the districting only when it prevents a majority of the electorate from electing a majority of representatives.  Before considering whether this particular standard is judicially manageable we question whether it is judicially discernible in the sense of being relevant to some constitutional violation.  Deny it as appellants may (and do), this standard rests upon the principle that groups (or at least political-action groups) have a right to proportional representation.  But the Constitution contains no such principle.  It guarantees equal protection of the law to persons, not equal representation in government to equivalently sized groups.  It nowhere says that farmers or urban dwellers, Christian fundamentalists or Jews, Republicans or Democrats, must be accorded political strength proportionate to their numbers.

				Even if the standard were relevant, however, it is not judicially manageable.  To begin with, how is a partys majority status to be established?  Appellants propose using the results of statewide races as the benchmark of party support.  But as their own complaint describes, in the 2000 Pennsylvania statewide elections some Republicans won and some Democrats won.  See Juris. Statement 137a138a (describing how Democrat candidates received more votes for President and auditor general, and Republicans received more votes for United States Senator, attorney general, and treasurer).  Moreover, to think that majority status in statewide races establishes majority status for district contests, one would have to believe that the only factor determining voting behavior at all levels is political affiliation.  That is assuredly not true.  As one law review comment has put it:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				There is no statewide vote in this country for the House of Representatives or the state legislature.  Rather, there are separate elections between separate candidates in separate districts, and that is all there is.  If the districts change, the candidates change, their strengths and weaknesses change, their campaigns change, their ability to raise money changes, the issues changeeverything changes.  Political parties do not compete for the highest statewide vote totals or the highest mean district vote percentages: They compete for specific seats.  Lowenstein &amp; Steinberg, The Quest for Legislative Districting in the Public Interest: Elusive or Illusory, 33 UCLA L. Rev. 1, 5960 (1985).

				But if we could identify a majority party, we would find it impossible to assure that that party wins a majority of seatsunless we radically revise the States traditional structure for elections.  In any winner-take-all district system, there can be no guarantee, no matter how the district lines are drawn, that a majority of party votes statewide will produce a majority of seats for that party.  The point is proved by the 2000 congressional elections in Pennsylvania, which, according to appellants own pleadings, were conducted under a judicially drawn district map free from partisan gerrymandering.  Juris. Statement 137a.  On this neutral playing fiel[d], the Democrats statewide majority of the major-party vote (50.6%) translated into a minority of seats (10, versus 11 for the Republicans).

Consider, for example, a legislature that draws district lines with no objectives in mind except compactness and respect for the lines of political subdivisions.  Under that system, political groups that tend to cluster (as is the case with Democratic voters in cities) would be systematically affected by what might be called a natural packing effect.  See

Not in principle, because to say that each individual must have an equal say in the selection of representatives, and hence that a majority of individuals must have a majority say, is not at all to say that each discernable group, whether farmers or urban dwellers or political parties, must have representation equivalent to its numbers.

				While Justice Powell rightly criticized the

				 plurality for failing to suggest a constitutionally based, judicially manageable standard, the standard proposed in his opinion also falls short of the mark.  It is essentially a totality-of-the-circumstances analysis, where all conceivable factors, none of which is dispositive, are weighed with an eye to ascertaining whether the particular gerrymander has gone too faror, in Justice Powells terminology, whether it is not fair.  Fairness does not seem to us a judicially manageable standard.  Fairness is compatible with noncontiguous districts, it is compatible with districts that straddle political subdivisions, and it is compatible with a partys not winning the number of seats that mirrors the proportion of its vote.  Some criterion more solid and more demonstrably met than that seems to us necessary to enable the state legislatures to discern the limits of their districting discretion, to meaningfully constrain the discretion of the courts, and to win public acceptance for the courts intrusion into a process that is the very foundation of democratic decisionmaking.

				.  In the present context, the test ought to identify deprivation of that minimal degree of representation or influence to which a political group is constitutionally entitled.  As we have seen, the

				<span class="smallcaps">

					Souter

				 avoids the difficulties of those formulations by never telling us what his test is looking for, other than the utterly unhelpful extremity of unfairness.  He vaguely describes the harm he is concerned with as vote dilution, 
				<em>

Even if (though it is implausible) 
				<span class="smallcaps">

					that

				  His reason for this is never stated, but it certainly cannot be that adherence to traditional districting factors negates any possibility of intentional vote dilution.  As we have explained above, packing and cracking, whether intentional or no, are quite consistent with adherence to compactness and respect for political subdivision lines.  See

				<em>
					Vera
				</em>
				, 517 U. S., at 10471048 (dissenting opinion).  Since that is so, his test would not protect those who are packed, and often tightly so, to ensure the reelection of representatives of either party.  Indeed, efforts to maximize partisan representation statewide might well begin with packing voters of the opposing party into the districts of existing incumbents of that party.  By this means an incumbent is protected, a potential adversary to the districting mollified, and votes of the opposing party are diluted.

And the vaguer the test for availability, the more frequently interest rather than necessity will produce litigation.  Is the regular insertion of the judiciary into districting, with the delay and uncertainty that brings to the political process and the partisan enmity it brings upon the courts, worth the benefit to be achievedan accelerated (by some unknown degree) effectuation of the majority will?  We think not.

						 The term political gerrymander has been defined as [t]he practice of dividing a geographical area into electoral districts, often of highly irregular shape, to give one political party an unfair advantage by diluting the oppositions voting strength.  Blacks Law Dictionary 696 (7th ed. 1999).

						 The plaintiffs apparently never amended their complaint to allege that Act 34 was a political gerrymander, yet the District Courts decision in Vieth III resolved that claim on the merits.  Because subject-matter jurisdiction is not implicated and neither party has raised the point, we assume that the District Court deemed the plaintiffs original complaint to have been constructively amended.

						 The Constitution also does not share appellants alarm at the asserted tendency of partisan gerrymandering to create more partisan representatives.  Assuming that assertion to be true, the Constitution does not answer the question whether it is better for Democratic voters to have their States congressional delegation include 10 wishy-washy Democrats (because Democratic voters are effectively distributed so as to constitute bare majorities in many districts), or 5 hardcore Democrats (because Democratic voters are tightly packed in a few districts).  Choosing the former dilutes the vote of the radical Democrat; choosing the latter does the same to the moderate.  Neither Article I, §2, nor the Equal Protection Clause takes sides in this dispute.

						 Justice Souter would allow a State, in proving its affirmative defense, to demonstrate that the reasons given for the districts shape were more than a mere pretext for an old-fashioned gerrymander.  Post, at 11.  But the need to establish that affirmative defense does not arise until the plaintiff has established his prima facie case.  And that prima facie case fails when, under step two, the district on its face complies with traditional districting criteria.

				The facts, as alleged by the plaintiffs, are as follows.  The population figures derived from the 2000 census showed that Pennsylvania was entitled to only 19 Representatives in Congress, a decrease in 2 from the Commonwealths previous delegation.  Pennsylvanias General Assembly took up the task of drawing a new districting map.  At the time, the Republican party controlled a majority of both state Houses and held the Governors office.  Prominent national figures in the Republican Party pressured the General Assembly to adopt a partisan redistricting plan as a punitive measure against Democrats for having enacted pro-Democrat redistricting plans elsewhere.  The Republican members of Pennsylvanias House and Senate worked together on such a plan.  On January 3, 2002, the General Assembly passed its plan, which was signed into law by Governor Schweiker as Act 1.

				Political gerrymanders are not new to the American scene.  One scholar traces them back to the Colony of Pennsylvania at the beginning of the 18th century, where several counties conspired to minimize the political power of the city of Philadelphia by refusing to allow it to merge or expand into surrounding jurisdictions, and denying it additional representatives.  See E. Griffith, The Rise and Development of the Gerrymander 2628 (1974) (hereinafter Griffith).  In 1732, two members of His Majestys Council and the attorney general and deputy inspector and comptroller general of affairs of the Province of North Carolina reported that the Governor had proceeded to divide old Precincts established by Law, &amp; to enact new Ones in Places, whereby his Arts he has endeavored to prepossess People in a future election according to his desire, his Designs herein being … either to endeavor by his means to get a Majority of his creatures in the Lower House or to disrupt the assemblys proceedings.  3 Colonial Records of North Carolina 380381 (W. Saunders ed. 1886); see also Griffith 29.  The political gerrymander remained alive and well (though not yet known by that name) at the time of the framing.  There were allegations that Patrick Henry attempted (unsuccessfully) to gerrymander James Madison out of the First Congress.  See 2 W. Rives, Life and Times of James Madison 655, n. 1 (reprint 1970); Letter from Thomas Jefferson to William Short, Feb. 9, 1789, reprinted in 5 Works of Thomas Jefferson 451 (P. Ford ed. 1904).  And in 1812, of course, there occurred the notoriously outrageous political districting in Massachusetts that gave the gerrymander its namean amalgam of the names of Massachusetts Governor Elbridge Gerry and the creature (salamander) which the outline of an election district he was credited with forming was thought to resemble.  See Websters New International Dictionary 1052 (2d ed. 1945).  By 1840 the gerrymander was a recognized force in party politics and was generally attempted in all legislation enacted for the formation of election districts.  It was generally conceded that each party would attempt to gain power which was not proportionate to its numerical strength.  Griffith 123.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				It is significant that the Framers provided a remedy for such practices in the Constitution.  Article 1, §4, while leaving in state legislatures the initial power to draw districts for federal elections, permitted Congress to make or alter those districts if it wished.

				  Many objected to the congressional oversight established by this provision.  In the course of the debates in the Constitutional Convention, Charles Pinkney and John Rutledge moved to strike the relevant language.  James Madison responded in defense of the provision that Congress must be given the power to check partisan manipulation of the election process by the States:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				Whenever the State Legislatures had a favorite measure to carry, they would take care so to mould their regulations as to favor the candidates they wished to succeed.  Besides, the inequality of the Representation in the Legislatures of particular States, would produce a like inequality in their representation in the Natl. Legislature, as it was presumable that the Counties having the power in the former case would secure it to themselves in the latter.  What danger could there be in giving a controuling power to the Natl. Legislature?  2 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, pp. 240241 (M. Farrand ed. 1911).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
Although the motion of Pinkney and Rutledge failed, opposition to the make or alter provision of Article I, §4and the defense that it was needed to prevent political gerrymanderingcontinued to be voiced in the state ratifying debates.  A delegate to the Massachusetts convention warned that state legislatures
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				might make an unequal and partial division of the states into districts for the election of representatives, or they might even disqualify one third of the electors.  Without these powers in Congress, the people can have no remedy; But the 4th section provides a remedy, a controlling power in a legislature, composed of senators and representatives of twelve states, without the influence of our commotions and factions, who will hear impartially, and preserve and restore to the people their equal and sacred rights of election.  2 Debates on the Federal Constitution 27 (J. Elliot 2d ed. 1876).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				The power bestowed on Congress to regulate elections, and in particular to restrain the practice of political gerrymandering, has not lain dormant.  In the Apportionment Act of 1842, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">5</a>Stat.
491, Congress provided that Representatives must be elected from single-member districts composed of contiguous territory.  See Griffith 12 (noting that the law was an attempt to forbid the practice of the gerrymander).  Congress again imposed these requirements in the Apportionment Act of 1862, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">12</a>Stat.
572, and in 1872 further required that districts contai[n] as nearly as practicable an equal number of inhabitants, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">17</a>Stat.
28, §2.  In the Apportionment Act of 1901, Congress imposed a compactness requirement.  
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">31</a>Stat.
733.  The requirements of contiguity, compactness, and equality of population were repeated in the 1911 apportionment legislation, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">37</a>Stat.
13, but were not thereafter continued.  Today, only the single-member-district-requirement remains.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/2/2c.html" class="subref" title="subref">2 U. S. C. §2c</a>.  Recent history, however, attests to Congresss awareness of the sort of districting practices appellants protest, and of its power under Article I, §4 to control them.  Since 1980, no fewer than five bills have been introduced to regulate gerrymandering in congressional districting.  See H. R. 5037, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. (1990); H. R. 1711, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. (1989); H. R. 3468, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. (1983); H. R. 5529, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. (1982); H. R. 2349, 97th Cong., 1st Sess. (1981).

				Over the dissent of three Justices, the Court held in 
				<em>
					Davis
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Bandemer
				</em>
				 that, since it was not persuaded that there are no judicially discernible and manageable standards by which political gerrymander cases are to be decided, 478 U. S., at 123, such cases 
				<em>
					were 
				</em>
				justiciable.  The clumsy shifting of the burden of proof for the premise (the Court was not persuaded that standards do not exist, rather than persuaded that they do) was necessitated by the uncomfortable fact that the six-Justice majority could not discern what the judicially discernable standards might be.  There was no majority on that point.  Four of the Justices finding justiciability believed that the standard was one thing, see 
				<em>

				</em>
				, at 127 (plurality opinion of White

The lower courts have lived with that assurance of a standard (or more precisely, lack of assurance that there is no standard), coupled with that inability to specify a standard, for the past 18 years.  In that time, they have considered numerous political gerrymandering claims; this Court has never revisited the unanswered question of what standard governs.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Nor can it be said that the lower courts have, over 18 years, succeeded in shaping the standard that this Court was initially unable to enunciate.  They have simply applied the standard set forth in
				<em>
					 Bandemer
				</em>
				s four-Justice plurality opinion.  This might be thought to prove that the four-Justice plurality standard has met the test of timebut for the fact that its application has almost invariably produced the same result (except for the incurring of attorneys fees) as would have obtained if the question were nonjusticiable: judicial intervention has been refused.  As one commentary has put it, [t]hroughout its subsequent history, 
				<em>
					Bandemer
				</em>
				 has served almost exclusively as an invitation to litigation without much prospect of redress.  S. Issacharoff, P. Karlan, &amp; R. Pildes, The Law of Democracy 886 (rev. 2d ed. 2002).  The one case in which relief was provided (and merely preliminary relief, at that) did

As to the intent element, the plurality acknowledged that [a]s long as redistricting is done by a legislature, it should not be very difficult to prove that the likely political consequences of the reapportionment were intended.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 129.  However, the effects prong was significantly harder to satisfy.  Relief could not be based merely upon the fact that a group of persons banded together for political purposes had failed to achieve representation commensurate with its numbers, or that the apportionment scheme made its winning of elections more difficult.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 132.  Rather, it would have to be shown that, taking into account a variety of historic factors and projected election results, the group had been denied its chance to effectively influence the political process as a whole, which could be achieved even without electing a candidate.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 132133.  It would not be enough to establish, for example, that Democrats had been placed in a district with a supermajority of other Democratic voters or that the district departs from pre-existing political boundaries.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 140141.  Rather, in a challenge to an individual district the inquiry would focus on the opportunity of members of the group to participate in party deliberations in the slating and nomination of candidates, their opportunity to register and vote, and hence their chance to directly influence the election returns and to secure the attention of the winning candidate.  
				<em>
					Id.

				<em>
					or indirect 
				</em>
				influence on the elections of the state legislature as a whole.  
				<em>

				</em>

				Appellants take a run at enunciating their own workable standard based on Article I, §2, and the Equal Protection Clause.  We consider it at length not only because it reflects the litigants view as to the best that can be derived from 18 years of experience, but also because it shares many features with other proposed standards, so that what is said of it may be said of them as well.  Appellants proposed standard retains the two-pronged framework of the

				 pluralityintent plus effectbut modifies the type of showing sufficient to satisfy each.

				<em>
					Bandemer
				</em>
				 pluralitys test of mere intent to disadvantage the plaintiffs group, this proposal seemingly makes the standard more difficult to meetbut only at the expense of making the standard more indeterminate.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Predominant intent to disadvantage the plaintiff political group refers to the relative importance of that goal as compared with all the other goals that the map seeks to pursuecontiguity of districts, compactness of districts, observance of the lines of political subdivision, protection of incumbents of all parties, cohesion of natural racial and ethnic neighborhoods, compliance with requirements of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 regarding racial distribution, etc.  Appellants contend that their intent test 
				<em>
					must 
				</em>
				be discernible and manageable because it has been borrowed from our racial gerrymandering cases.  See 
				<em>
					Miller

				 v.

.  To begin with, in a very important respect that is not so.  In the racial gerrymandering context, the predominant intent test has been applied to the challenged district in which the plaintiffs voted.  See 
				<em>
					Miller

				<em>

.  Here, however, appellants do not assert that an apportionment fails their intent test if any single district does so.  Since it would be quixotic to attempt to bar state legislatures from considering politics as they redraw district lines, Brief for Appellants 3, appellants propose a test that is satisfied only when partisan advantage was the predominant motivation 
				<em>
					behind the entire statewide plan
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 32 (emphasis added).  Vague as the predominant motivation test might be when used to evaluate single districts, it all but evaporates when applied statewide.  Does it mean, for instance, that partisan intent must outweigh all other goalscontiguity, compactness, preservation of neighborhoods, etc.
				<em>
					statewide
				</em>
				?  And how is the statewide outweighing to be determined?  If three-fifths of the maps districts forgo the pursuit of partisan ends in favor of strictly observing political-subdivision lines, and only two-fifths ignore those lines to disadvantage the plaintiffs, is the observance of political subdivisions the predominant goal between those two?  We are sure appellants do not think so.  
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Even within the narrower compass of challenges to a single district, applying a predominant intent test to 
				<em>
					racial 
				</em>
				gerrymandering is easier and less disruptive.  The Constitution clearly contemplates districting by political entities, see Article I, §4, and unsurprisingly that turns out to be root-and-branch a matter of politics.  See 
				<em>
					Miller,
				</em>
            <em>

				</em>
				at 914 ([R]edistricting in most cases will implicate a political calculus in which various interests compete for recognition …);

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">753</a> (1973)
 (The reality is that districting inevitably has and is intended to have substantial political consequences).  By contrast, the purpose of segregating voters on the basis of race is not a lawful one, and is much more rarely encountered.  Determining whether the shape of a particular district is so substantially affected by the presence of a rare and constitutionally suspect motive as to invalidate it is quite different from determining whether it is so substantially affected by the excess of an ordinary and lawful motive as to invalidate it.  Moreover, the fact that partisan districting is a lawful and common practice means that there is almost 
				<em>
					always
				</em>
				 room for an election-impeding lawsuit contending that partisan advantage was the predominant motivation; not so for claims of racial gerrymandering.  Finally, courts might be justified in accepting a modest degree of unmanageability to enforce a constitutional command which (like the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a> obligation to refrain from racial discrimination) is clear; whereas they are not justified in inferring a judicially enforceable constitutional obligation (the obligation not to apply 
				<em>
					too much
				</em>
				 partisanship in districting) which is both dubious and severely unmanageable.  For these reasons, to the extent that our racial gerrymandering cases represent a model of discernible and manageable standards, they provide no comfort here.

				The effects prong of appellants proposal replaces the 
				<em>
					Bandemer

				 pluralitys vague test of denied its chance to effectively influence the political process, 478 U. S., at 132133, with criteria that are seemingly more specific.

					and 
				</em>
				(2) the courts examination of the totality of circumstances confirms that the map can thwart the plaintiffs ability to translate a majority of votes into a majority of seats.  Brief for Appellants 20 (emphasis and footnote added).  This test is loosely based on our cases applying §2 of the Voting Rights Act, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/1973.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §1973</a>, to discrimination by race, see,

.  But a persons politics is rarely as readily discernibleand 
				<em>
					never
				</em>
				 as permanently discernibleas a persons race.  Political affiliation is not an immutable characteristic, but may shift from one election to the next; and even within a given election, not all voters follow the party line.  We dare say (and hope) that the political party which puts forward an utterly incompetent candidate will lose even in its registration stronghold.  These facts make it impossible to assess the effects of partisan gerrymandering, to fashion a standard for evaluating a violation, and finally to craft a remedy.  See

				Assuming, however, that the effects of partisan gerrymandering can be determined, appellants test would invalidate the districting only when it prevents a majority of the electorate from electing a majority of representatives.  Before considering whether this particular standard is judicially manageable we question whether it is judicially discernible in the sense of being relevant to some constitutional violation.  Deny it as appellants may (and do), this standard rests upon the principle that groups (or at least political-action groups) have a right to proportional representation.  But the Constitution contains no such principle.  It guarantees equal protection of the law to persons, not equal representation in government to equivalently sized groups.  It nowhere says that farmers or urban dwellers, Christian fundamentalists or Jews, Republicans or Democrats, must be accorded political strength proportionate to their numbers.

				Even if the standard were relevant, however, it is not judicially manageable.  To begin with, how is a partys majority status to be established?  Appellants propose using the results of statewide races as the benchmark of party support.  But as their own complaint describes, in the 2000 Pennsylvania statewide elections some Republicans won and some Democrats won.  See Juris. Statement 137a138a (describing how Democrat candidates received more votes for President and auditor general, and Republicans received more votes for United States Senator, attorney general, and treasurer).  Moreover, to think that majority status in statewide races establishes majority status for district contests, one would have to believe that the only factor determining voting behavior at all levels is political affiliation.  That is assuredly not true.  As one law review comment has put it:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				There is no statewide vote in this country for the House of Representatives or the state legislature.  Rather, there are separate elections between separate candidates in separate districts, and that is all there is.  If the districts change, the candidates change, their strengths and weaknesses change, their campaigns change, their ability to raise money changes, the issues changeeverything changes.  Political parties do not compete for the highest statewide vote totals or the highest mean district vote percentages: They compete for specific seats.  Lowenstein &amp; Steinberg, The Quest for Legislative Districting in the Public Interest: Elusive or Illusory, 33 UCLA L. Rev. 1, 5960 (1985).

				But if we could identify a majority party, we would find it impossible to assure that that party wins a majority of seatsunless we radically revise the States traditional structure for elections.  In any winner-take-all district system, there can be no guarantee, no matter how the district lines are drawn, that a majority of party votes statewide will produce a majority of seats for that party.  The point is proved by the 2000 congressional elections in Pennsylvania, which, according to appellants own pleadings, were conducted under a judicially drawn district map free from partisan gerrymandering.  Juris. Statement 137a.  On this neutral playing fiel[d], the Democrats statewide majority of the major-party vote (50.6%) translated into a minority of seats (10, versus 11 for the Republicans).  
				<em>
					Id.

				, at 133a, 137a.  Whether by reason of partisan districting or not, party constituents may always wind up packed in some districts and cracked throughout others.  See R. Dixon, Democratic Representation 462 (1968) (All Districting is Gerrymandering ); Schuck, 87 Colum. L. Rev., at 1359.  Consider, for example, a legislature that draws district lines with no objectives in mind except compactness and respect for the lines of political subdivisions.  Under that system, political groups that tend to cluster (as is the case with Democratic voters in cities) would be systematically affected by what might be called a natural packing effect.  See

, have no bearing upon this question, neither in principle nor in practicality.  Not in principle, because to say that each individual must have an equal say in the selection of representatives, and hence that a majority of individuals must have a majority say, is not at all to say that each discernable group, whether farmers or urban dwellers or political parties, must have representation equivalent to its numbers.  And not in practicality, because the easily administrable standard of population equality adopted by 
				<em>

				</em>
				and 
				<em>
					Reynolds
				</em>
				 enables judges to decide whether a violation has occurred (and to remedy it) essentially on the basis of three readily determined factorswhere the plaintiff lives, how many voters are in his district, and how many voters are in other districts; whereas requiring judges to decide whether a districting system will produce a statewide majority for a majority party casts them forth upon a sea of imponderables, and asks them to make determinations that not even election experts can agree upon.

				For many of the same reasons, we also reject the standard suggested by Justice Powell in

He agreed with the plurality that a plaintiff should show intent and effect, but believed that the ultimate inquiry ought to focus on whether district boundaries had been drawn solely for partisan ends to the exclusion of all other neutral factors relevant to the fairness of redistricting.  478 U. S., at 161 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part); see also 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 164165.  Under that inquiry, the courts should consider numerous factors, though [n]o one factor should be dispositive.  
				<em>

				</em>
				, at 173.  The most important would be the shapes of voting districts and adherence to established political subdivision boundaries.

				  Other relevant considerations include the nature of the legislative procedures by which the apportionment law was adopted and legislative history reflecting contemporaneous legislative goals.  
				<em>

				While Justice Powell rightly criticized the

				 plurality for failing to suggest a constitutionally based, judicially manageable standard, the standard proposed in his opinion also falls short of the mark.  It is essentially a totality-of-the-circumstances analysis, where all conceivable factors, none of which is dispositive, are weighed with an eye to ascertaining whether the particular gerrymander has gone too faror, in Justice Powells terminology, whether it is not fair.  Fairness does not seem to us a judicially manageable standard.  Fairness is compatible with noncontiguous districts, it is compatible with districts that straddle political subdivisions, and it is compatible with a partys not winning the number of seats that mirrors the proportion of its vote.  Some criterion more solid and more demonstrably met than that seems to us necessary to enable the state legislatures to discern the limits of their districting discretion, to meaningfully constrain the discretion of the courts, and to win public acceptance for the courts intrusion into a process that is the very foundation of democratic decisionmaking.

				<em>
					for
				</em>
				.  In the present context, the test ought to identify deprivation of that minimal degree of representation or influence to which a political group is constitutionally entitled.  As we have seen, the

				</em>
				 test sought (unhelpfully, but at least gamely) to specify what that minimal degree was: [a] chance to effectively influence the political process.  478 U. S., at 133.

				<span class="smallcaps">

            <span class="smallcaps">
					Souter

				 avoids the difficulties of those formulations by never telling us what his test is looking for, other than the utterly unhelpful extremity of unfairness.  He vaguely describes the harm he is concerned with as vote dilution, 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, at 10, a term which usually implies some actual effect on the weight of a vote.  But no element of his test looks to the effect of the gerrymander on the electoral success, the electoral opportunity, or even the political influence, of the plaintiff group.  We do not know the precise constitutional deprivation his test is designed to identify and prevent.

        <p class="bodytext">
				

Even if (though it is implausible) 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				 believes that the constitutional deprivation consists of merely vote dilution, his test would not even identify 
				<em>
					that
				</em>
				 effect.  Despite his claimed reliance on the 
				<em>
					McDonnell Douglas
				</em>
				 framework, 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter

            </a>
				  His reason for this is never stated, but it certainly cannot be that adherence to traditional districting factors negates any possibility of intentional vote dilution.  As we have explained above, packing and cracking, whether intentional or no, are quite consistent with adherence to compactness and respect for political subdivision lines.  See 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 20.  An even better example is the traditional criterion of incumbency protection.  
				<span class="smallcaps">

				 has previously acknowledged it to be a traditional and constitutionally acceptable districting principle.  See 
				<em>
					Vera
				</em>
				, 517 U. S., at 10471048 (dissenting opinion).  Since that is so, his test would not protect those who are packed, and often tightly so, to ensure the reelection of representatives of either party.  Indeed, efforts to maximize partisan representation statewide might well begin with packing voters of the opposing party into the districts of existing incumbents of that party.  By this means an incumbent is protected, a potential adversary to the districting mollified, and votes of the opposing party are diluted.

Is the regular insertion of the judiciary into districting, with the delay and uncertainty that brings to the political process and the partisan enmity it brings upon the courts, worth the benefit to be achievedan accelerated (by some unknown degree) effectuation of the majority will?

				 provides no cover.  There, all of the Justices who concluded that political gerrymandering claims are justiciable proceeded to describe what they regarded as the discernible and manageable standard that rendered it so.  The lower courts were set wandering in the wilderness for 18 years not because the 
				<em>

				 majority thought it a good idea, but because five Justices could not agree upon a single standard, and because the standard the plurality proposed turned out not to work.

				As for 
				<em>
					Baker
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Carr:
				</em>
				 It is true enough that, having had no experience 
				<em>
					whatever
				</em>
				 in apportionment matters of any sort, the Court there refrained from spelling out the equal-protection standard.  (It did so a mere two years later in 
				<em>
					Reynolds
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Sims
				</em>
				.)  But the judgment under review in 
				<em>
					Baker
				</em>
				, unlike the one under review here, did not 
				<em>
					demand
				</em>
				 the determination of a standard.  The lower court in 
				<em>
					Baker 
				</em>
				had held the apportionment claim of the plaintiffs 
				<em>
					nonjusticiable
				</em>
				, and so it was logically possible to dispose of the appeal by simply disagreeing with the nonjusticiability determination.  As we observed earlier, that is not possible here, where the lower court has held the claim 
				<em>
					justiciable
				</em>
				 but unsupported by the facts.  We must either enunciate the standard that causes us to agree or disagree with that merits judgment, or else affirm that the claim is beyond our competence to adjudicate.

What we think would erode confidence is the Courts refusal to do its jobannouncing that there may well be a valid claim here, but we are not yet prepared to figure it out.  Moreover, that course does more than erode confidence; by placing the district courts back in the business of pretending to afford help when they in fact can give none, it deters the political process from affording genuine relief.

				s holding that the judiciary is to address excessive partisan line-drawing, while leaving the issue virtually unenforceable.  Inevitably, as the political party in power uses district lines to lock in its present advantage, the party out of power attempts to stretch the protective cover of the Voting Rights Act, urging dilution of critical standards that may, if accepted, aid their party in the short-run but work to the detriment of persons now protected by the Act in the long-run.

We suggest that they must treat it as a reluctant fifth vote against justiciability at district and statewide levelsa vote that may change in some future case but that holds, for the time being, that this matter is nonjusticiable.

				Considerations of

				 because the majoritys inability to enunciate the judicially discernible and manageable standard that it thought existed (or did not think did not exist) presaged the need for reconsideration in light of subsequent experience.

						 The term political gerrymander has been defined as [t]he practice of dividing a geographical area into electoral districts, often of highly irregular shape, to give one political party an unfair advantage by diluting the oppositions voting strength.  Blacks Law Dictionary 696 (7th ed. 1999).

						 The plaintiffs apparently never amended their complaint to allege that Act 34 was a political gerrymander, yet the District Courts decision in Vieth III resolved that claim on the merits.  Because subject-matter jurisdiction is not implicated and neither party has raised the point, we assume that the District Court deemed the plaintiffs original complaint to have been constructively amended.

In the elections for superior court judges conducted just five days after this pronouncement, every Republican candidate standing for the office of superior court judge was victorious at the state level, ibid., a result which the Fourth Circuit thought (with good reason) directly at odds with the recent prediction by the district court, id., at *2, causing it to remand the case for reconsideration.

						 The Constitution also does not share appellants alarm at the asserted tendency of partisan gerrymandering to create more partisan representatives.  Assuming that assertion to be true, the Constitution does not answer the question whether it is better for Democratic voters to have their States congressional delegation include 10 wishy-washy Democrats (because Democratic voters are effectively distributed so as to constitute bare majorities in many districts), or 5 hardcore Democrats (because Democratic voters are tightly packed in a few districts).  Choosing the former dilutes the vote of the radical Democrat; choosing the latter does the same to the moderate.  Neither Article I, §2, nor the Equal Protection Clause takes sides in this dispute.

						 Justice Souter would allow a State, in proving its affirmative defense, to demonstrate that the reasons given for the districts shape were more than a mere pretext for an old-fashioned gerrymander.  Post, at 11.  But the need to establish that affirmative defense does not arise until the plaintiff has established his prima facie case.  And that prima facie case fails when, under step two, the district on its face complies with traditional districting criteria.

				The facts, as alleged by the plaintiffs, are as follows.  The population figures derived from the 2000 census showed that Pennsylvania was entitled to only 19 Representatives in Congress, a decrease in 2 from the Commonwealths previous delegation.  Pennsylvanias General Assembly took up the task of drawing a new districting map.  At the time, the Republican party controlled a majority of both state Houses and held the Governors office.  Prominent national figures in the Republican Party pressured the General Assembly to adopt a partisan redistricting plan as a punitive measure against Democrats for having enacted pro-Democrat redistricting plans elsewhere.  The Republican members of Pennsylvanias House and Senate worked together on such a plan.  On January 3, 2002, the General Assembly passed its plan, which was signed into law by Governor Schweiker as Act 1.

				Political gerrymanders are not new to the American scene.  One scholar traces them back to the Colony of Pennsylvania at the beginning of the 18th century, where several counties conspired to minimize the political power of the city of Philadelphia by refusing to allow it to merge or expand into surrounding jurisdictions, and denying it additional representatives.  See E. Griffith, The Rise and Development of the Gerrymander 2628 (1974) (hereinafter Griffith).  In 1732, two members of His Majestys Council and the attorney general and deputy inspector and comptroller general of affairs of the Province of North Carolina reported that the Governor had proceeded to divide old Precincts established by Law, &amp; to enact new Ones in Places, whereby his Arts he has endeavored to prepossess People in a future election according to his desire, his Designs herein being … either to endeavor by his means to get a Majority of his creatures in the Lower House or to disrupt the assemblys proceedings.  3 Colonial Records of North Carolina 380381 (W. Saunders ed. 1886); see also Griffith 29.  The political gerrymander remained alive and well (though not yet known by that name) at the time of the framing.  There were allegations that Patrick Henry attempted (unsuccessfully) to gerrymander James Madison out of the First Congress.  See 2 W. Rives, Life and Times of James Madison 655, n. 1 (reprint 1970); Letter from Thomas Jefferson to William Short, Feb. 9, 1789, reprinted in 5 Works of Thomas Jefferson 451 (P. Ford ed. 1904).  And in 1812, of course, there occurred the notoriously outrageous political districting in Massachusetts that gave the gerrymander its namean amalgam of the names of Massachusetts Governor Elbridge Gerry and the creature (salamander) which the outline of an election district he was credited with forming was thought to resemble.  See Websters New International Dictionary 1052 (2d ed. 1945).  By 1840 the gerrymander was a recognized force in party politics and was generally attempted in all legislation enacted for the formation of election districts.  It was generally conceded that each party would attempt to gain power which was not proportionate to its numerical strength.  Griffith 123.

				It is significant that the Framers provided a remedy for such practices in the Constitution.  Article 1, §4, while leaving in state legislatures the initial power to draw districts for federal elections, permitted Congress to make or alter those districts if it wished.

				  Many objected to the congressional oversight established by this provision.  In the course of the debates in the Constitutional Convention, Charles Pinkney and John Rutledge moved to strike the relevant language.  James Madison responded in defense of the provision that Congress must be given the power to check partisan manipulation of the election process by the States:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				Whenever the State Legislatures had a favorite measure to carry, they would take care so to mould their regulations as to favor the candidates they wished to succeed.  Besides, the inequality of the Representation in the Legislatures of particular States, would produce a like inequality in their representation in the Natl. Legislature, as it was presumable that the Counties having the power in the former case would secure it to themselves in the latter.  What danger could there be in giving a controuling power to the Natl. Legislature?  2 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, pp. 240241 (M. Farrand ed. 1911).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
Although the motion of Pinkney and Rutledge failed, opposition to the make or alter provision of Article I, §4and the defense that it was needed to prevent political gerrymanderingcontinued to be voiced in the state ratifying debates.  A delegate to the Massachusetts convention warned that state legislatures
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				might make an unequal and partial division of the states into districts for the election of representatives, or they might even disqualify one third of the electors.  Without these powers in Congress, the people can have no remedy; But the 4th section provides a remedy, a controlling power in a legislature, composed of senators and representatives of twelve states, without the influence of our commotions and factions, who will hear impartially, and preserve and restore to the people their equal and sacred rights of election.  2 Debates on the Federal Constitution 27 (J. Elliot 2d ed. 1876).

				The power bestowed on Congress to regulate elections, and in particular to restrain the practice of political gerrymandering, has not lain dormant.  In the Apportionment Act of 1842, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">5</a>Stat.
491, Congress provided that Representatives must be elected from single-member districts composed of contiguous territory.  See Griffith 12 (noting that the law was an attempt to forbid the practice of the gerrymander).  Congress again imposed these requirements in the Apportionment Act of 1862, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">12</a>Stat.
572, and in 1872 further required that districts contai[n] as nearly as practicable an equal number of inhabitants, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">17</a>Stat.
28, §2.  In the Apportionment Act of 1901, Congress imposed a compactness requirement.  
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">31</a>Stat.
733.  The requirements of contiguity, compactness, and equality of population were repeated in the 1911 apportionment legislation, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">37</a>Stat.
13, but were not thereafter continued.  Today, only the single-member-district-requirement remains.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/2/2c.html" class="subref" title="subref">2 U. S. C. §2c</a>.  Recent history, however, attests to Congresss awareness of the sort of districting practices appellants protest, and of its power under Article I, §4 to control them.  Since 1980, no fewer than five bills have been introduced to regulate gerrymandering in congressional districting.  See H. R. 5037, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. (1990); H. R. 1711, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. (1989); H. R. 3468, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. (1983); H. R. 5529, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. (1982); H. R. 2349, 97th Cong., 1st Sess. (1981).

				Over the dissent of three Justices, the Court held in 
				<em>
					Davis
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Bandemer
				</em>
				 that, since it was not persuaded that there are no judicially discernible and manageable standards by which political gerrymander cases are to be decided, 478 U. S., at 123, such cases 
				<em>
					were 
				</em>
				justiciable.  The clumsy shifting of the burden of proof for the premise (the Court was not persuaded that standards do not exist, rather than persuaded that they do) was necessitated by the uncomfortable fact that the six-Justice majority could not discern what the judicially discernable standards might be.  There was no majority on that point.  Four of the Justices finding justiciability believed that the standard was one thing, see

The lower courts have lived with that assurance of a standard (or more precisely, lack of assurance that there is no standard), coupled with that inability to specify a standard, for the past 18 years.  In that time, they have considered numerous political gerrymandering claims; this Court has never revisited the unanswered question of what standard governs.

				Nor can it be said that the lower courts have, over 18 years, succeeded in shaping the standard that this Court was initially unable to enunciate.  They have simply applied the standard set forth in
				<em>
					 Bandemer
				</em>
				s four-Justice plurality opinion.  This might be thought to prove that the four-Justice plurality standard has met the test of timebut for the fact that its application has almost invariably produced the same result (except for the incurring of attorneys fees) as would have obtained if the question were nonjusticiable: judicial intervention has been refused.  As one commentary has put it, [t]hroughout its subsequent history, 
				<em>

				 has served almost exclusively as an invitation to litigation without much prospect of redress.  S. Issacharoff, P. Karlan, &amp; R. Pildes, The Law of Democracy 886 (rev. 2d ed. 2002).  The one case in which relief was provided (and merely preliminary relief, at that) did

				Eighteen years of judicial effort with virtually nothing to show for it justify us in revisiting the question whether the standard promised by 
				<em>
					Bandemer
				</em>
				 exists.  As the following discussion reveals, no judicially discernible and manageable standards for adjudicating political gerrymandering claims have emerged.  Lacking them, we must conclude that political gerrymandering claims are nonjusticiable and that

				 was wrongly decided.

				We begin our review of possible standards with that proposed by Justice Whites plurality opinion in 
				<em>
					Bandemer
				</em>
				 because, as the narrowest ground for our decision in that case, it has been the standard employed by the lower courts.  The plurality concluded that a political gerrymandering claim could succeed only where plaintiffs showed both intentional discrimination against an identifiable political group and an actual discriminatory effect on that group.  478 U. S., at 127.  As to the intent element, the plurality acknowledged that [a]s long as redistricting is done by a legislature, it should not be very difficult to prove that the likely political consequences of the reapportionment were intended.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 129.  However, the effects prong was significantly harder to satisfy.  Relief could not be based merely upon the fact that a group of persons banded together for political purposes had failed to achieve representation commensurate with its numbers, or that the apportionment scheme made its winning of elections more difficult.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 132.  Rather, it would have to be shown that, taking into account a variety of historic factors and projected election results, the group had been denied its chance to effectively influence the political process as a whole, which could be achieved even without electing a candidate.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 132133.  It would not be enough to establish, for example, that Democrats had been placed in a district with a supermajority of other Democratic voters or that the district departs from pre-existing political boundaries.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 140141.  Rather, in a challenge to an individual district the inquiry would focus on the opportunity of members of the group to participate in party deliberations in the slating and nomination of candidates, their opportunity to register and vote, and hence their chance to directly influence the election returns and to secure the attention of the winning candidate.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 133.  A statewide challenge, by contrast, would involve an analysis of the voters direct 
				<em>
					or indirect 
				</em>
				influence on the elections of the state legislature as a whole.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				 (emphasis added).  With what has proved to be a gross understatement, the plurality acknowledged this was of necessity a difficult inquiry.

Tribe, American Constitutional Law §139, p. 1083 (2d ed. 1988) (Neither Justice Whites nor Justice Powells approach to the question of partisan apportionment gives any real guidance to lower courts forced to adjudicate this issue …); Still, Hunting of the Gerrymander, 38 UCLA L.

L. Rev. 1325, 1365 (1987) (noting that the

				Appellants take a run at enunciating their own workable standard based on Article I, §2, and the Equal Protection Clause.  We consider it at length not only because it reflects the litigants view as to the best that can be derived from 18 years of experience, but also because it shares many features with other proposed standards, so that what is said of it may be said of them as well.  Appellants proposed standard retains the two-pronged framework of the

				Predominant intent to disadvantage the plaintiff political group refers to the relative importance of that goal as compared with all the other goals that the map seeks to pursuecontiguity of districts, compactness of districts, observance of the lines of political subdivision, protection of incumbents of all parties, cohesion of natural racial and ethnic neighborhoods, compliance with requirements of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 regarding racial distribution, etc.  Appellants contend that their intent test

				?  And how is the statewide outweighing to be determined?  If three-fifths of the maps districts forgo the pursuit of partisan ends in favor of strictly observing political-subdivision lines, and only two-fifths ignore those lines to disadvantage the plaintiffs, is the observance of political subdivisions the predominant goal between those two?  We are sure appellants do not think so.

				Even within the narrower compass of challenges to a single district, applying a predominant intent test to

 (The reality is that districting inevitably has and is intended to have substantial political consequences).  By contrast, the purpose of segregating voters on the basis of race is not a lawful one, and is much more rarely encountered.  Determining whether the shape of a particular district is so substantially affected by the presence of a rare and constitutionally suspect motive as to invalidate it is quite different from determining whether it is so substantially affected by the excess of an ordinary and lawful motive as to invalidate it.  Moreover, the fact that partisan districting is a lawful and common practice means that there is almost 
				<em>
					always
				</em>
				 room for an election-impeding lawsuit contending that partisan advantage was the predominant motivation; not so for claims of racial gerrymandering.  Finally, courts might be justified in accepting a modest degree of unmanageability to enforce a constitutional command which (like the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a> obligation to refrain from racial discrimination) is clear; whereas they are not justified in inferring a judicially enforceable constitutional obligation (the obligation not to apply 
				<em>
					too much
				</em>
				 partisanship in districting) which is both dubious and severely unmanageable.  For these reasons, to the extent that our racial gerrymandering cases represent a model of discernible and manageable standards, they provide no comfort here.

				The effects prong of appellants proposal replaces the

				(2) the courts examination of the totality of circumstances confirms that the map can thwart the plaintiffs ability to translate a majority of votes into a majority of seats.  Brief for Appellants 20 (emphasis and footnote added).  This test is loosely based on our cases applying §2 of the Voting Rights Act,

Political affiliation is not an immutable characteristic, but may shift from one election to the next; and even within a given election, not all voters follow the party line.  We dare say (and hope) that the political party which puts forward an utterly incompetent candidate will lose even in its registration stronghold.  These facts make it impossible to assess the effects of partisan gerrymandering, to fashion a standard for evaluating a violation, and finally to craft a remedy.  See

				Assuming, however, that the effects of partisan gerrymandering can be determined, appellants test would invalidate the districting only when it prevents a majority of the electorate from electing a majority of representatives.  Before considering whether this particular standard is judicially manageable we question whether it is judicially discernible in the sense of being relevant to some constitutional violation.  Deny it as appellants may (and do), this standard rests upon the principle that groups (or at least political-action groups) have a right to proportional representation.  But the Constitution contains no such principle.  It guarantees equal protection of the law to persons, not equal representation in government to equivalently sized groups.  It nowhere says that farmers or urban dwellers, Christian fundamentalists or Jews, Republicans or Democrats, must be accorded political strength proportionate to their numbers.

				Even if the standard were relevant, however, it is not judicially manageable.  To begin with, how is a partys majority status to be established?  Appellants propose using the results of statewide races as the benchmark of party support.  But as their own complaint describes, in the 2000 Pennsylvania statewide elections some Republicans won and some Democrats won.  See Juris. Statement 137a138a (describing how Democrat candidates received more votes for President and auditor general, and Republicans received more votes for United States Senator, attorney general, and treasurer).  Moreover, to think that majority status in statewide races establishes majority status for district contests, one would have to believe that the only factor determining voting behavior at all levels is political affiliation.  That is assuredly not true.  As one law review comment has put it:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				There is no statewide vote in this country for the House of Representatives or the state legislature.  Rather, there are separate elections between separate candidates in separate districts, and that is all there is.  If the districts change, the candidates change, their strengths and weaknesses change, their campaigns change, their ability to raise money changes, the issues changeeverything changes.  Political parties do not compete for the highest statewide vote totals or the highest mean district vote percentages: They compete for specific seats.  Lowenstein &amp; Steinberg, The Quest for Legislative Districting in the Public Interest: Elusive or Illusory, 33 UCLA L. Rev. 1, 5960 (1985).

				But if we could identify a majority party, we would find it impossible to assure that that party wins a majority of seatsunless we radically revise the States traditional structure for elections.  In any winner-take-all district system, there can be no guarantee, no matter how the district lines are drawn, that a majority of party votes statewide will produce a majority of seats for that party.  The point is proved by the 2000 congressional elections in Pennsylvania, which, according to appellants own pleadings, were conducted under a judicially drawn district map free from partisan gerrymandering.  Juris. Statement 137a.  On this neutral playing fiel[d], the Democrats statewide majority of the major-party vote (50.6%) translated into a minority of seats (10, versus 11 for the Republicans).

				, at 133a, 137a.  Whether by reason of partisan districting or not, party constituents may always wind up packed in some districts and cracked throughout others.  See R. Dixon, Democratic Representation 462 (1968) (All Districting is Gerrymandering ); Schuck, 87 Colum. L. Rev., at 1359.  Consider, for example, a legislature that draws district lines with no objectives in mind except compactness and respect for the lines of political subdivisions.  Under that system, political groups that tend to cluster (as is the case with Democratic voters in cities) would be systematically affected by what might be called a natural packing effect.  See

, have no bearing upon this question, neither in principle nor in practicality.  Not in principle, because to say that each individual must have an equal say in the selection of representatives, and hence that a majority of individuals must have a majority say, is not at all to say that each discernable group, whether farmers or urban dwellers or political parties, must have representation equivalent to its numbers.  And not in practicality, because the easily administrable standard of population equality adopted by 
				<em>

				For many of the same reasons, we also reject the standard suggested by Justice Powell in

He agreed with the plurality that a plaintiff should show intent and effect, but believed that the ultimate inquiry ought to focus on whether district boundaries had been drawn solely for partisan ends to the exclusion of all other neutral factors relevant to the fairness of redistricting.  478 U. S., at 161 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part); see also 
				<em>
					id.

				, at 164165.  Under that inquiry, the courts should consider numerous factors, though [n]o one factor should be dispositive.

				While Justice Powell rightly criticized the

				 plurality for failing to suggest a constitutionally based, judicially manageable standard, the standard proposed in his opinion also falls short of the mark.  It is essentially a totality-of-the-circumstances analysis, where all conceivable factors, none of which is dispositive, are weighed with an eye to ascertaining whether the particular gerrymander has gone too faror, in Justice Powells terminology, whether it is not fair.  Fairness does not seem to us a judicially manageable standard.  Fairness is compatible with noncontiguous districts, it is compatible with districts that straddle political subdivisions, and it is compatible with a partys not winning the number of seats that mirrors the proportion of its vote.  Some criterion more solid and more demonstrably met than that seems to us necessary to enable the state legislatures to discern the limits of their districting discretion, to meaningfully constrain the discretion of the courts, and to win public acceptance for the courts intrusion into a process that is the very foundation of democratic decisionmaking.

        <p class="bodytext">

				<span class="smallcaps">

            <span class="smallcaps">
					Souter

				 avoids the difficulties of those formulations by never telling us what his test is looking for, other than the utterly unhelpful extremity of unfairness.  He vaguely describes the harm he is concerned with as vote dilution, 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, at 10, a term which usually implies some actual effect on the weight of a vote.  But no element of his test looks to the effect of the gerrymander on the electoral success, the electoral opportunity, or even the political influence, of the plaintiff group.  We do not know the precise constitutional deprivation his test is designed to identify and prevent.

        <p class="bodytext">
				

Even if (though it is implausible) 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				 believes that the constitutional deprivation consists of merely vote dilution, his test would not even identify 
				<em>
					that
				</em>
				 effect.  Despite his claimed reliance on the 
				<em>
					McDonnell Douglas
				</em>
				 framework, 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter

				  His reason for this is never stated, but it certainly cannot be that adherence to traditional districting factors negates any possibility of intentional vote dilution.  As we have explained above, packing and cracking, whether intentional or no, are quite consistent with adherence to compactness and respect for political subdivision lines.  See 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 20.  An even better example is the traditional criterion of incumbency protection.  
				<span class="smallcaps">

				 has previously acknowledged it to be a traditional and constitutionally acceptable districting principle.  See 
				<em>
					Vera
				</em>
				, 517 U. S., at 10471048 (dissenting opinion).  Since that is so, his test would not protect those who are packed, and often tightly so, to ensure the reelection of representatives of either party.  Indeed, efforts to maximize partisan representation statewide might well begin with packing voters of the opposing party into the districts of existing incumbents of that party.  By this means an incumbent is protected, a potential adversary to the districting mollified, and votes of the opposing party are diluted.

Is the regular insertion of the judiciary into districting, with the delay and uncertainty that brings to the political process and the partisan enmity it brings upon the courts, worth the benefit to be achievedan accelerated (by some unknown degree) effectuation of the majority will?

						 The States, of course, have taken their own steps to prevent abusive districting practices.  A number have adopted standards for redistricting, and measures designed to insulate the process from politics.  See, e.g., Iowa Code §42.4(5) (2003); N. J. Const., Art. II, §2; Haw. Rev.

						 The Constitution also does not share appellants alarm at the asserted tendency of partisan gerrymandering to create more partisan representatives.  Assuming that assertion to be true, the Constitution does not answer the question whether it is better for Democratic voters to have their States congressional delegation include 10 wishy-washy Democrats (because Democratic voters are effectively distributed so as to constitute bare majorities in many districts), or 5 hardcore Democrats (because Democratic voters are tightly packed in a few districts).  Choosing the former dilutes the vote of the radical Democrat; choosing the latter does the same to the moderate.  Neither Article I, §2, nor the Equal Protection Clause takes sides in this dispute.

						 Justice Souter would allow a State, in proving its affirmative defense, to demonstrate that the reasons given for the districts shape were more than a mere pretext for an old-fashioned gerrymander.  Post, at 11.  But the need to establish that affirmative defense does not arise until the plaintiff has established his prima facie case.  And that prima facie case fails when, under step two, the district on its face complies with traditional districting criteria.

				A decision ordering the correction of all election district lines drawn for partisan reasons would commit federal and state courts to unprecedented intervention in the American political process.  The Court is correct to refrain from directing this substantial intrusion into the Nations political life.  While agreeing with the plurality that the complaint the appellants filed in the District Court must be dismissed, and while understanding that great caution is necessary when approaching this subject, I would not foreclose all possibility of judicial relief if some limited and precise rationale were found to correct an established violation of the Constitution in some redistricting cases.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				When presented with a claim of injury from partisan gerrymandering, courts confront two obstacles.  First is the lack of comprehensive and neutral principles for drawing electoral boundaries.  No substantive definition of fairness in districting seems to command general assent.  Second is the absence of rules to limit and confine judicial intervention.  With uncertain limits, intervening courtseven when proceeding with best intentionswould risk assuming political, not legal, responsibility for a process that often produces ill will and distrust.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				That courts can grant relief in districting cases where race is involved does not answer our need for fairness principles here.  Those controversies implicate a different inquiry.  They involve sorting permissible classifications in the redistricting context from impermissible ones.  Race is an impermissible classification.  See 
				<em>
					Shaw
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Reno,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/509/630" class="subref" title="subref">509 U. S. 630</a> (1993)
.  Politics is quite a different matter.  See 
				<em>
					Gaffney

				 v. 
				<em>

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				A determination that a gerrymander violates the law must rest on something more than the conclusion that political classifications were applied.  It must rest instead on a conclusion that the classifications, though generally permissible, were applied in an invidious manner or in a way unrelated to any legitimate legislative objective.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">565</a>568 (1964)
.  At first it might seem that courts could determine, by the exercise of their own judgment, whether political classifications are related to this object or instead burden representational rights.  The lack, however, of any agreed upon model of fair and effective representation makes this analysis difficult to pursue.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The second obstaclethe absence of rules to confine judicial interventionis related to the first.  Because there are yet no agreed upon substantive principles of fairness in districting, we have no basis on which to define clear, manageable, and politically neutral standards for measuring the particular burden a given partisan classification imposes on representational rights.  Suitable standards for measuring this burden, however, are critical to our intervention.  Absent sure guidance, the results from one gerrymandering case to the next would likely be disparate and inconsistent.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In this case, we have not overcome these obstacles to determining that the challenged districting violated appellants rights.  The fairness principle appellants propose is that a majority of voters in the Commonwealth should be able to elect a majority of the Commonwealths congressional delegation.  There is no authority for this precept.  Even if the novelty of the proposed principle were accompanied by a convincing rationale for its adoption, there is no obvious way to draw a satisfactory standard from it for measuring an alleged burden on representational rights.  The plurality demonstrates the shortcomings of the other standards that have been considered to date.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at Parts III and IV (demonstrating that the standards proposed in 
				<em>
					Davis
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Bandemer,
				</em>

, by the parties before us, and by our dissenting colleagues are either unmanageable or inconsistent with precedent, or both).  I would add two comments to the pluralitys analysis.  The first is that the parties have not shown us, and I have not been able to discover, helpful discussions on the principles of fair districting discussed in the annals of parliamentary or legislative bodies.  Our attention has not been drawn to statements of principled, well-accepted rules of fairness that should govern districting, or to helpful formulations of the legislators duty in drawing district lines.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, even those criteria that might seem promising at the outset (
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, contiguity and compactness) are not altogether sound as independent judicial standards for measuring a burden on representational rights.  They cannot promise political neutrality when used as the basis for relief.  Instead, it seems, a decision under these standards would unavoidably have significant political effect, whether intended or not.  For example, if we were to demand that congressional districts take a particular shape, we could not assure the parties that this criterion, neutral enough on its face, would not in fact benefit one political party over another.  See 
				<em>
					Gaffney
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 753 (District lines are rarely neutral phenomena.  They can well determine what district will be predominantly Democratic or predominantly Republican, or make a close race likely); see also R. Bork, The Tempting of America: The Political Seduction of the Law 8889 (1990) (documenting the authors service as a special master responsible for redistricting Connecticut and noting that his final plan so benefited the Democratic Party, albeit unintentionally, that the party chairman personally congratulated him); M. Altman, Modeling the Effect of Mandatory District Compactness on Partisan Gerrymanders, 17 Pol. Geography 989, 10001006 (1998) (explaining that compactness standards help Republicans because Democrats are more likely to live in high density regions).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The challenge in finding a manageable standard for assessing burdens on representational rights has long been recognized.  See Lowenstein &amp; Steinberg, The Quest for Legislative Districting in the Public Interest: Elusive or Illusory? 33 UCLA L. Rev. 1, 74 (1985) ([W]hat matters to us, and what we think matters to almost all Americans when district lines are drawn, is how the fortunes of the parties and the policies the parties stand for are affected.  When such things are at stake there is no neutrality.  There is only political contest).  The dearth of helpful historical guidance must, in part, cause this uncertainty.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

    There are, then, weighty arguments for holding cases like these to be nonjusticiable; and those arguments may prevail in the long run.  In my view, however, the arguments are not so compelling that they require us now to bar all future claims of injury from a partisan gerrymander.  It is not in our tradition to foreclose the judicial process from the attempt to define standards and remedies where it is alleged that a constitutional right is burdened or denied.  Nor is it alien to the Judiciary to draw or approve election district lines.  Courts, after all, already do so in many instances.  A determination by the Court to deny all hopes of intervention could erode confidence in the courts as much as would a premature decision to intervene.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Our willingness to enter the political thicket of the apportionment process with respect to one-person, one-vote claims makes it particularly difficult to justify a categorical refusal to entertain claims against this other type of gerrymandering.  The pluralitys conclusion that absent an easily administrable standard, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 21, the appellants claim must be nonjusticiable contrasts starkly with the more patient approach of 
				<em>

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In 
				<em>
					Baker
				</em>
				 the Court made clear that the more abstract standards that guide analysis of all 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a> claims sufficed to assure justiciability of a one-person, one-vote claim.  See 369 U. S.

				 at 226.

        <p class="bodytext">
				Nor need the appellants, in order to succeed in this action, ask the Court to enter upon policy determinations for which judicially manageable standards are lacking.  Judicial standards under the Equal Protection Clause are well developed and familiar, and it has been open to courts since the enactment of the

				<em>
					no

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
The Court said this before the more specific standard with which we are now familiar emerged to measure the burden nonequipopulous districting causes on representational rights.  See 
				<em>
					Reynolds,
				</em>
				 377 U. S., at 565568 (concluding that [s]ince the achieving of fair and effective representation for all citizens is concededly the basic aim of legislative apportionment a legislatures reliance on other apportionment interests is invalid arbitrary and capricious action if it leads to unequal populations among districts).  The pluralitys response that in 
				<em>
					Baker
				</em>
				 this Court sat in review only of a nonjusticiability holding is wide of the mark.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 35.  As the plurality itself instructs: Before a Court can conclude that it has [any] business entertaining [a] claim, it must conclude that some judicially enforceable righ[t] is at issue.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 7.  Whether a manageable standard made the right at issue in 
				<em>
					Baker
				</em>
				 enforceable was as much a necessary inquiry there as it is here.  In light of 
				<em>
					Baker
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Davis
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Bandemer
				</em>
				, which directly address the question of nonjusticiability in the specific context of districting and of asserted violations of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>, the pluralitys further survey of cases involving different approaches to the justiciability of different claims cannot be thought controlling.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 3334.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Even putting 
				<em>
					Baker
				</em>
				 to the sideand so assuming that the existence of a workable standard for measuring a gerrymanders burden on representational rights distinguishes one-person, one-vote claims from partisan gerrymandering claims for justiciability purposesI would still reject the pluralitys conclusions as to nonjusticiability.  Relying on the distinction between a claim having or not having a workable standard of that sort involves a difficult proof: proof of a categorical negative.  That is, the different treatment of claims otherwise so alike hinges entirely on proof that no standard could exist.  This is a difficult proposition to establish, for proving a negative is a challenge in any context.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				That no such standard has emerged in this case should not be taken to prove that none will emerge in the future.  Where important rights are involved, the impossibility of full analytical satisfaction is reason to err on the side of caution.  Allegations of unconstitutional bias in apportionment are most serious claims, for we have long believed that the right to vote is one of those political processes ordinarily to be relied upon to protect minorities.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">153</a>, n. 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">4</a> (1938)
.  If a State passed an enactment that declared All future apportionment shall be drawn so as most to burden Party Xs rights to fair and effective representation, though still in accord with one-person, one-vote principles, we would surely conclude the Constitution had been violated.  If that is so, we should admit the possibility remains that a legislature might attempt to reach the same result without that express directive.  This possibility suggests that in another case a standard might emerge that suitably demonstrates how an apportionments 
				<em>
					de facto
				</em>
				 incorporation of partisan classifications burdens rights of fair and effective representation (and so establishes the classification is unrelated to the aims of apportionment and thus is used in an impermissible fashion).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The plurality says that 18 years, in effect, prove the negative.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 37 (Eighteen years of essentially pointless litigation have persuaded us).  As 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				 is correct to point out, however, during these past 18 years the lower courts could do no more than follow 
				<em>
					Davis
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Bandemer
				</em>
				, which formulated a single, apparently insuperable standard.  See 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, at 3 (dissenting opinion).  Moreover, by the timeline of the law 18 years is rather a short period.  In addition, the rapid evolution of technologies in the apportionment field suggests yet unexplored possibilities.  Computer assisted districting has become so routine and sophisticated that legislatures, experts, and courts can use databases to map electoral districts in a matter of hours, not months.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Larios
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Cox
				</em>
				, 305 F. Supp. 2d 1335 (ND Ga. 2004).  Technology is both a threat and a promise.  On the one hand, if courts refuse to entertain any claims of partisan gerrymandering, the temptation to use partisan favoritism in districting in an unconstitutional manner will grow.  On the other hand, these new technologies may produce new methods of analysis that make more evident the precise nature of the burdens gerrymanders impose on the representational rights of voters and parties.  That would facilitate court efforts to identify and remedy the burdens, with judicial intervention limited by the derived standards.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				If suitable standards with which to measure the burden a gerrymander imposes on representational rights did emerge, hindsight would show that the Court prematurely abandoned the field.  That is a risk the Court should not take.  Instead, we should adjudicate only what is in the papers before us.  See 
				<em>
					Baker
				</em>
				, 369 U. S., at 331 (Harlan, J., dissenting) (concluding that the malapportionment claim should have been dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted  because [u]ntil it is first decided to what extent [the] right [to apportion] is limited by the Federal Constitution, and whether what [a State] has done or failed to do . . . runs afoul of any such limitation, we need not reach the issues of justiciability or political question ).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Because, in the case before us, we have no standard by which to measure the burden appellants claim has been imposed on their representational rights, appellants cannot establish that the alleged political classifications burden those same rights.  Failing to show that the alleged classifications are unrelated to the aims of apportionment, appellants evidence at best demonstrates only that the legislature adopted political classifications.  That describes no constitutional flaw, at least under the governing

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> analysis.  The inquiry is not whether political classifications were used.  The inquiry instead is whether political classifications were used to burden a groups representational rights.  If a court were to find that a State did impose burdens and restrictions on groups or persons by reason of their views, there would likely be a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> violation, unless the State shows some compelling interest.

The equal protection analysis puts its emphasis on the permissibility of an enactments classifications.  This works where race is involved since classifying by race is almost never permissible.  It presents a more complicated question when the inquiry is whether a generally permissible classification has been used for an impermissible purpose.  That question can only be answered in the affirmative by the subsidiary showing that the classification as applied imposes unlawful burdens.  The 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> analysis concentrates on whether the legislation burdens the representational rights of the complaining partys voters for reasons of ideology, beliefs, or political association.

				Finally, I do not understand the plurality to conclude that partisan gerrymandering that disfavors one party is permissible.  Indeed, the Court seems to acknowledge it is not.  See

Excessiveness is not easily determined.  Consider these apportionment schemes: In one State, Party X controls the apportionment process and draws the lines so it captures every congressional seat.  In three other States, Party Y controls the apportionment process.  It is not so blatant or egregious, but proceeds by a more subtle effort, capturing less than all the seats in each State.  Still, the total effect of Party Ys effort is to capture more new seats than Party X captured.  Party Xs gerrymander was more egregious.  Party Ys gerrymander was more subtle.  In my view, however, each is culpable.

				The ordered working of our Republic, and of the democratic process, depends on a sense of decorum and restraint in all branches of government, and in the citizenry itself.  Here, one has the sense that legislative restraint was abandoned.  That should not be thought to serve the interests of our political order.  Nor should it be thought to serve our interest in demonstrating to the world how democracy works.  Whether spoken with concern or pride, it is unfortunate that our legislators have reached the point of declaring that, when it comes to apportionment,  We are in the business of rigging elections.   J.

				Still, the Courts own responsibilities require that we refrain from intervention in this instance.

If workable standards do emerge to measure these burdens, however, courts should be prepared to order relief.  With these observations, I join the judgment of the plurality.

				A decision ordering the correction of all election district lines drawn for partisan reasons would commit federal and state courts to unprecedented intervention in the American political process.  The Court is correct to refrain from directing this substantial intrusion into the Nations political life.  While agreeing with the plurality that the complaint the appellants filed in the District Court must be dismissed, and while understanding that great caution is necessary when approaching this subject, I would not foreclose all possibility of judicial relief if some limited and precise rationale were found to correct an established violation of the Constitution in some redistricting cases.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				When presented with a claim of injury from partisan gerrymandering, courts confront two obstacles.  First is the lack of comprehensive and neutral principles for drawing electoral boundaries.  No substantive definition of fairness in districting seems to command general assent.  Second is the absence of rules to limit and confine judicial intervention.  With uncertain limits, intervening courtseven when proceeding with best intentionswould risk assuming political, not legal, responsibility for a process that often produces ill will and distrust.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				That courts can grant relief in districting cases where race is involved does not answer our need for fairness principles here.  Those controversies implicate a different inquiry.  They involve sorting permissible classifications in the redistricting context from impermissible ones.  Race is an impermissible classification.  See 
				<em>

				A determination that a gerrymander violates the law must rest on something more than the conclusion that political classifications were applied.  It must rest instead on a conclusion that the classifications, though generally permissible, were applied in an invidious manner or in a way unrelated to any legitimate legislative objective.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">565</a>568 (1964)
.  At first it might seem that courts could determine, by the exercise of their own judgment, whether political classifications are related to this object or instead burden representational rights.  The lack, however, of any agreed upon model of fair and effective representation makes this analysis difficult to pursue.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The second obstaclethe absence of rules to confine judicial interventionis related to the first.  Because there are yet no agreed upon substantive principles of fairness in districting, we have no basis on which to define clear, manageable, and politically neutral standards for measuring the particular burden a given partisan classification imposes on representational rights.  Suitable standards for measuring this burden, however, are critical to our intervention.  Absent sure guidance, the results from one gerrymandering case to the next would likely be disparate and inconsistent.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In this case, we have not overcome these obstacles to determining that the challenged districting violated appellants rights.  The fairness principle appellants propose is that a majority of voters in the Commonwealth should be able to elect a majority of the Commonwealths congressional delegation.  There is no authority for this precept.  Even if the novelty of the proposed principle were accompanied by a convincing rationale for its adoption, there is no obvious way to draw a satisfactory standard from it for measuring an alleged burden on representational rights.  The plurality demonstrates the shortcomings of the other standards that have been considered to date.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at Parts III and IV (demonstrating that the standards proposed in 
				<em>
					Davis
				</em>
				 v.

, by the parties before us, and by our dissenting colleagues are either unmanageable or inconsistent with precedent, or both).  I would add two comments to the pluralitys analysis.  The first is that the parties have not shown us, and I have not been able to discover, helpful discussions on the principles of fair districting discussed in the annals of parliamentary or legislative bodies.  Our attention has not been drawn to statements of principled, well-accepted rules of fairness that should govern districting, or to helpful formulations of the legislators duty in drawing district lines.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, even those criteria that might seem promising at the outset (
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, contiguity and compactness) are not altogether sound as independent judicial standards for measuring a burden on representational rights.  They cannot promise political neutrality when used as the basis for relief.  Instead, it seems, a decision under these standards would unavoidably have significant political effect, whether intended or not.  For example, if we were to demand that congressional districts take a particular shape, we could not assure the parties that this criterion, neutral enough on its face, would not in fact benefit one political party over another.  See 
				<em>
					Gaffney
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 753 (District lines are rarely neutral phenomena.  They can well determine what district will be predominantly Democratic or predominantly Republican, or make a close race likely); see also R. Bork, The Tempting of America: The Political Seduction of the Law 8889 (1990) (documenting the authors service as a special master responsible for redistricting Connecticut and noting that his final plan so benefited the Democratic Party, albeit unintentionally, that the party chairman personally congratulated him); M. Altman, Modeling the Effect of Mandatory District Compactness on Partisan Gerrymanders, 17 Pol. Geography 989, 10001006 (1998) (explaining that compactness standards help Republicans because Democrats are more likely to live in high density regions).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The challenge in finding a manageable standard for assessing burdens on representational rights has long been recognized.  See Lowenstein &amp; Steinberg, The Quest for Legislative Districting in the Public Interest: Elusive or Illusory? 33 UCLA L. Rev. 1, 74 (1985) ([W]hat matters to us, and what we think matters to almost all Americans when district lines are drawn, is how the fortunes of the parties and the policies the parties stand for are affected.  When such things are at stake there is no neutrality.  There is only political contest).  The dearth of helpful historical guidance must, in part, cause this uncertainty.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

    There are, then, weighty arguments for holding cases like these to be nonjusticiable; and those arguments may prevail in the long run.  In my view, however, the arguments are not so compelling that they require us now to bar all future claims of injury from a partisan gerrymander.  It is not in our tradition to foreclose the judicial process from the attempt to define standards and remedies where it is alleged that a constitutional right is burdened or denied.  Nor is it alien to the Judiciary to draw or approve election district lines.  Courts, after all, already do so in many instances.  A determination by the Court to deny all hopes of intervention could erode confidence in the courts as much as would a premature decision to intervene.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Our willingness to enter the political thicket of the apportionment process with respect to one-person, one-vote claims makes it particularly difficult to justify a categorical refusal to entertain claims against this other type of gerrymandering.  The pluralitys conclusion that absent an easily administrable standard,

				<em>

The pluralitys response that in 
				<em>
					Baker
				</em>
				 this Court sat in review only of a nonjusticiability holding is wide of the mark.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 35.  As the plurality itself instructs: Before a Court can conclude that it has [any] business entertaining [a] claim, it must conclude that some judicially enforceable righ[t] is at issue.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 7.  Whether a manageable standard made the right at issue in 
				<em>
					Baker
				</em>
				 enforceable was as much a necessary inquiry there as it is here.  In light of 
				<em>
					Baker
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Davis
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Bandemer
				</em>
				, which directly address the question of nonjusticiability in the specific context of districting and of asserted violations of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>, the pluralitys further survey of cases involving different approaches to the justiciability of different claims cannot be thought controlling.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 3334.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Even putting 
				<em>
					Baker
				</em>
				 to the sideand so assuming that the existence of a workable standard for measuring a gerrymanders burden on representational rights distinguishes one-person, one-vote claims from partisan gerrymandering claims for justiciability purposesI would still reject the pluralitys conclusions as to nonjusticiability.  Relying on the distinction between a claim having or not having a workable standard of that sort involves a difficult proof: proof of a categorical negative.  That is, the different treatment of claims otherwise so alike hinges entirely on proof that no standard could exist.  This is a difficult proposition to establish, for proving a negative is a challenge in any context.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				That no such standard has emerged in this case should not be taken to prove that none will emerge in the future.  Where important rights are involved, the impossibility of full analytical satisfaction is reason to err on the side of caution.  Allegations of unconstitutional bias in apportionment are most serious claims, for we have long believed that the right to vote is one of those political processes ordinarily to be relied upon to protect minorities.

.  If a State passed an enactment that declared All future apportionment shall be drawn so as most to burden Party Xs rights to fair and effective representation, though still in accord with one-person, one-vote principles, we would surely conclude the Constitution had been violated.  If that is so, we should admit the possibility remains that a legislature might attempt to reach the same result without that express directive.  This possibility suggests that in another case a standard might emerge that suitably demonstrates how an apportionments 
				<em>
					de facto
				</em>
				 incorporation of partisan classifications burdens rights of fair and effective representation (and so establishes the classification is unrelated to the aims of apportionment and thus is used in an impermissible fashion).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The plurality says that 18 years, in effect, prove the negative.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 37 (Eighteen years of essentially pointless litigation have persuaded us).  As 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				 is correct to point out, however, during these past 18 years the lower courts could do no more than follow 
				<em>
					Davis
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Bandemer
				</em>
				, which formulated a single, apparently insuperable standard.  See 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, at 3 (dissenting opinion).  Moreover, by the timeline of the law 18 years is rather a short period.  In addition, the rapid evolution of technologies in the apportionment field suggests yet unexplored possibilities.  Computer assisted districting has become so routine and sophisticated that legislatures, experts, and courts can use databases to map electoral districts in a matter of hours, not months.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Larios
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Cox
				</em>
				, 305 F. Supp. 2d 1335 (ND Ga. 2004).  Technology is both a threat and a promise.  On the one hand, if courts refuse to entertain any claims of partisan gerrymandering, the temptation to use partisan favoritism in districting in an unconstitutional manner will grow.  On the other hand, these new technologies may produce new methods of analysis that make more evident the precise nature of the burdens gerrymanders impose on the representational rights of voters and parties.  That would facilitate court efforts to identify and remedy the burdens, with judicial intervention limited by the derived standards.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				If suitable standards with which to measure the burden a gerrymander imposes on representational rights did emerge, hindsight would show that the Court prematurely abandoned the field.  That is a risk the Court should not take.  Instead, we should adjudicate only what is in the papers before us.  See

				Because, in the case before us, we have no standard by which to measure the burden appellants claim has been imposed on their representational rights, appellants cannot establish that the alleged political classifications burden those same rights.  Failing to show that the alleged classifications are unrelated to the aims of apportionment, appellants evidence at best demonstrates only that the legislature adopted political classifications.  That describes no constitutional flaw, at least under the governing

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> in this area.  See

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> analysis.  The inquiry is not whether political classifications were used.  The inquiry instead is whether political classifications were used to burden a groups representational rights.  If a court were to find that a State did impose burdens and restrictions on groups or persons by reason of their views, there would likely be a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> violation, unless the State shows some compelling interest.

The equal protection analysis puts its emphasis on the permissibility of an enactments classifications.  This works where race is involved since classifying by race is almost never permissible.  It presents a more complicated question when the inquiry is whether a generally permissible classification has been used for an impermissible purpose.  That question can only be answered in the affirmative by the subsidiary showing that the classification as applied imposes unlawful burdens.  The 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> analysis concentrates on whether the legislation burdens the representational rights of the complaining partys voters for reasons of ideology, beliefs, or political association.

				Finally, I do not understand the plurality to conclude that partisan gerrymandering that disfavors one party is permissible.  Indeed, the Court seems to acknowledge it is not.  See

Excessiveness is not easily determined.  Consider these apportionment schemes: In one State, Party X controls the apportionment process and draws the lines so it captures every congressional seat.  In three other States, Party Y controls the apportionment process.  It is not so blatant or egregious, but proceeds by a more subtle effort, capturing less than all the seats in each State.  Still, the total effect of Party Ys effort is to capture more new seats than Party X captured.  Party Xs gerrymander was more egregious.  Party Ys gerrymander was more subtle.  In my view, however, each is culpable.

				The ordered working of our Republic, and of the democratic process, depends on a sense of decorum and restraint in all branches of government, and in the citizenry itself.  Here, one has the sense that legislative restraint was abandoned.  That should not be thought to serve the interests of our political order.  Nor should it be thought to serve our interest in demonstrating to the world how democracy works.  Whether spoken with concern or pride, it is unfortunate that our legislators have reached the point of declaring that, when it comes to apportionment,  We are in the business of rigging elections.   J.

				Still, the Courts own responsibilities require that we refrain from intervention in this instance.

If workable standards do emerge to measure these burdens, however, courts should be prepared to order relief.  With these observations, I join the judgment of the plurality.

				A decision ordering the correction of all election district lines drawn for partisan reasons would commit federal and state courts to unprecedented intervention in the American political process.  The Court is correct to refrain from directing this substantial intrusion into the Nations political life.  While agreeing with the plurality that the complaint the appellants filed in the District Court must be dismissed, and while understanding that great caution is necessary when approaching this subject, I would not foreclose all possibility of judicial relief if some limited and precise rationale were found to correct an established violation of the Constitution in some redistricting cases.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				When presented with a claim of injury from partisan gerrymandering, courts confront two obstacles.  First is the lack of comprehensive and neutral principles for drawing electoral boundaries.  No substantive definition of fairness in districting seems to command general assent.  Second is the absence of rules to limit and confine judicial intervention.  With uncertain limits, intervening courtseven when proceeding with best intentionswould risk assuming political, not legal, responsibility for a process that often produces ill will and distrust.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				That courts can grant relief in districting cases where race is involved does not answer our need for fairness principles here.  Those controversies implicate a different inquiry.  They involve sorting permissible classifications in the redistricting context from impermissible ones.  Race is an impermissible classification.  See 
				<em>

				A determination that a gerrymander violates the law must rest on something more than the conclusion that political classifications were applied.  It must rest instead on a conclusion that the classifications, though generally permissible, were applied in an invidious manner or in a way unrelated to any legitimate legislative objective.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">565</a>568 (1964)
.  At first it might seem that courts could determine, by the exercise of their own judgment, whether political classifications are related to this object or instead burden representational rights.  The lack, however, of any agreed upon model of fair and effective representation makes this analysis difficult to pursue.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The second obstaclethe absence of rules to confine judicial interventionis related to the first.  Because there are yet no agreed upon substantive principles of fairness in districting, we have no basis on which to define clear, manageable, and politically neutral standards for measuring the particular burden a given partisan classification imposes on representational rights.  Suitable standards for measuring this burden, however, are critical to our intervention.  Absent sure guidance, the results from one gerrymandering case to the next would likely be disparate and inconsistent.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In this case, we have not overcome these obstacles to determining that the challenged districting violated appellants rights.  The fairness principle appellants propose is that a majority of voters in the Commonwealth should be able to elect a majority of the Commonwealths congressional delegation.  There is no authority for this precept.  Even if the novelty of the proposed principle were accompanied by a convincing rationale for its adoption, there is no obvious way to draw a satisfactory standard from it for measuring an alleged burden on representational rights.  The plurality demonstrates the shortcomings of the other standards that have been considered to date.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at Parts III and IV (demonstrating that the standards proposed in 
				<em>
					Davis
				</em>
				 v.

, by the parties before us, and by our dissenting colleagues are either unmanageable or inconsistent with precedent, or both).  I would add two comments to the pluralitys analysis.  The first is that the parties have not shown us, and I have not been able to discover, helpful discussions on the principles of fair districting discussed in the annals of parliamentary or legislative bodies.  Our attention has not been drawn to statements of principled, well-accepted rules of fairness that should govern districting, or to helpful formulations of the legislators duty in drawing district lines.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, even those criteria that might seem promising at the outset (
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, contiguity and compactness) are not altogether sound as independent judicial standards for measuring a burden on representational rights.  They cannot promise political neutrality when used as the basis for relief.  Instead, it seems, a decision under these standards would unavoidably have significant political effect, whether intended or not.  For example, if we were to demand that congressional districts take a particular shape, we could not assure the parties that this criterion, neutral enough on its face, would not in fact benefit one political party over another.  See 
				<em>
					Gaffney
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 753 (District lines are rarely neutral phenomena.  They can well determine what district will be predominantly Democratic or predominantly Republican, or make a close race likely); see also R. Bork, The Tempting of America: The Political Seduction of the Law 8889 (1990) (documenting the authors service as a special master responsible for redistricting Connecticut and noting that his final plan so benefited the Democratic Party, albeit unintentionally, that the party chairman personally congratulated him); M. Altman, Modeling the Effect of Mandatory District Compactness on Partisan Gerrymanders, 17 Pol. Geography 989, 10001006 (1998) (explaining that compactness standards help Republicans because Democrats are more likely to live in high density regions).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The challenge in finding a manageable standard for assessing burdens on representational rights has long been recognized.  See Lowenstein &amp; Steinberg, The Quest for Legislative Districting in the Public Interest: Elusive or Illusory? 33 UCLA L. Rev. 1, 74 (1985) ([W]hat matters to us, and what we think matters to almost all Americans when district lines are drawn, is how the fortunes of the parties and the policies the parties stand for are affected.  When such things are at stake there is no neutrality.  There is only political contest).  The dearth of helpful historical guidance must, in part, cause this uncertainty.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

    There are, then, weighty arguments for holding cases like these to be nonjusticiable; and those arguments may prevail in the long run.  In my view, however, the arguments are not so compelling that they require us now to bar all future claims of injury from a partisan gerrymander.  It is not in our tradition to foreclose the judicial process from the attempt to define standards and remedies where it is alleged that a constitutional right is burdened or denied.  Nor is it alien to the Judiciary to draw or approve election district lines.  Courts, after all, already do so in many instances.  A determination by the Court to deny all hopes of intervention could erode confidence in the courts as much as would a premature decision to intervene.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Our willingness to enter the political thicket of the apportionment process with respect to one-person, one-vote claims makes it particularly difficult to justify a categorical refusal to entertain claims against this other type of gerrymandering.  The pluralitys conclusion that absent an easily administrable standard,

				<em>

The pluralitys response that in 
				<em>
					Baker
				</em>
				 this Court sat in review only of a nonjusticiability holding is wide of the mark.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 35.  As the plurality itself instructs: Before a Court can conclude that it has [any] business entertaining [a] claim, it must conclude that some judicially enforceable righ[t] is at issue.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 7.  Whether a manageable standard made the right at issue in 
				<em>
					Baker
				</em>
				 enforceable was as much a necessary inquiry there as it is here.  In light of 
				<em>
					Baker
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Davis
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Bandemer
				</em>
				, which directly address the question of nonjusticiability in the specific context of districting and of asserted violations of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>, the pluralitys further survey of cases involving different approaches to the justiciability of different claims cannot be thought controlling.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 3334.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Even putting 
				<em>
					Baker
				</em>
				 to the sideand so assuming that the existence of a workable standard for measuring a gerrymanders burden on representational rights distinguishes one-person, one-vote claims from partisan gerrymandering claims for justiciability purposesI would still reject the pluralitys conclusions as to nonjusticiability.  Relying on the distinction between a claim having or not having a workable standard of that sort involves a difficult proof: proof of a categorical negative.  That is, the different treatment of claims otherwise so alike hinges entirely on proof that no standard could exist.  This is a difficult proposition to establish, for proving a negative is a challenge in any context.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				That no such standard has emerged in this case should not be taken to prove that none will emerge in the future.  Where important rights are involved, the impossibility of full analytical satisfaction is reason to err on the side of caution.  Allegations of unconstitutional bias in apportionment are most serious claims, for we have long believed that the right to vote is one of those political processes ordinarily to be relied upon to protect minorities.

.  If a State passed an enactment that declared All future apportionment shall be drawn so as most to burden Party Xs rights to fair and effective representation, though still in accord with one-person, one-vote principles, we would surely conclude the Constitution had been violated.  If that is so, we should admit the possibility remains that a legislature might attempt to reach the same result without that express directive.  This possibility suggests that in another case a standard might emerge that suitably demonstrates how an apportionments 
				<em>
					de facto
				</em>
				 incorporation of partisan classifications burdens rights of fair and effective representation (and so establishes the classification is unrelated to the aims of apportionment and thus is used in an impermissible fashion).

				The plurality says that 18 years, in effect, prove the negative.

In addition, the rapid evolution of technologies in the apportionment field suggests yet unexplored possibilities.  Computer assisted districting has become so routine and sophisticated that legislatures, experts, and courts can use databases to map electoral districts in a matter of hours, not months.  See,

On the one hand, if courts refuse to entertain any claims of partisan gerrymandering, the temptation to use partisan favoritism in districting in an unconstitutional manner will grow.  On the other hand, these new technologies may produce new methods of analysis that make more evident the precise nature of the burdens gerrymanders impose on the representational rights of voters and parties.  That would facilitate court efforts to identify and remedy the burdens, with judicial intervention limited by the derived standards.

				Because, in the case before us, we have no standard by which to measure the burden appellants claim has been imposed on their representational rights, appellants cannot establish that the alleged political classifications burden those same rights.

The inquiry instead is whether political classifications were used to burden a groups representational rights.

The equal protection analysis puts its emphasis on the permissibility of an enactments classifications.  This works where race is involved since classifying by race is almost never permissible.  It presents a more complicated question when the inquiry is whether a generally permissible classification has been used for an impermissible purpose.  That question can only be answered in the affirmative by the subsidiary showing that the classification as applied imposes unlawful burdens.  The 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> analysis concentrates on whether the legislation burdens the representational rights of the complaining partys voters for reasons of ideology, beliefs, or political association.

				Finally, I do not understand the plurality to conclude that partisan gerrymandering that disfavors one party is permissible.  Indeed, the Court seems to acknowledge it is not.  See

Excessiveness is not easily determined.  Consider these apportionment schemes: In one State, Party X controls the apportionment process and draws the lines so it captures every congressional seat.  In three other States, Party Y controls the apportionment process.  It is not so blatant or egregious, but proceeds by a more subtle effort, capturing less than all the seats in each State.  Still, the total effect of Party Ys effort is to capture more new seats than Party X captured.  Party Xs gerrymander was more egregious.  Party Ys gerrymander was more subtle.  In my view, however, each is culpable.

				The ordered working of our Republic, and of the democratic process, depends on a sense of decorum and restraint in all branches of government, and in the citizenry itself.  Here, one has the sense that legislative restraint was abandoned.  That should not be thought to serve the interests of our political order.  Nor should it be thought to serve our interest in demonstrating to the world how democracy works.  Whether spoken with concern or pride, it is unfortunate that our legislators have reached the point of declaring that, when it comes to apportionment,  We are in the business of rigging elections.   J.

				Still, the Courts own responsibilities require that we refrain from intervention in this instance.

If workable standards do emerge to measure these burdens, however, courts should be prepared to order relief.  With these observations, I join the judgment of the plurality.

				A decision ordering the correction of all election district lines drawn for partisan reasons would commit federal and state courts to unprecedented intervention in the American political process.  The Court is correct to refrain from directing this substantial intrusion into the Nations political life.  While agreeing with the plurality that the complaint the appellants filed in the District Court must be dismissed, and while understanding that great caution is necessary when approaching this subject, I would not foreclose all possibility of judicial relief if some limited and precise rationale were found to correct an established violation of the Constitution in some redistricting cases.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				When presented with a claim of injury from partisan gerrymandering, courts confront two obstacles.  First is the lack of comprehensive and neutral principles for drawing electoral boundaries.  No substantive definition of fairness in districting seems to command general assent.  Second is the absence of rules to limit and confine judicial intervention.  With uncertain limits, intervening courtseven when proceeding with best intentionswould risk assuming political, not legal, responsibility for a process that often produces ill will and distrust.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				That courts can grant relief in districting cases where race is involved does not answer our need for fairness principles here.  Those controversies implicate a different inquiry.  They involve sorting permissible classifications in the redistricting context from impermissible ones.  Race is an impermissible classification.  See 
				<em>

				A determination that a gerrymander violates the law must rest on something more than the conclusion that political classifications were applied.  It must rest instead on a conclusion that the classifications, though generally permissible, were applied in an invidious manner or in a way unrelated to any legitimate legislative objective.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">565</a>568 (1964)
.  At first it might seem that courts could determine, by the exercise of their own judgment, whether political classifications are related to this object or instead burden representational rights.  The lack, however, of any agreed upon model of fair and effective representation makes this analysis difficult to pursue.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The second obstaclethe absence of rules to confine judicial interventionis related to the first.  Because there are yet no agreed upon substantive principles of fairness in districting, we have no basis on which to define clear, manageable, and politically neutral standards for measuring the particular burden a given partisan classification imposes on representational rights.  Suitable standards for measuring this burden, however, are critical to our intervention.  Absent sure guidance, the results from one gerrymandering case to the next would likely be disparate and inconsistent.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In this case, we have not overcome these obstacles to determining that the challenged districting violated appellants rights.  The fairness principle appellants propose is that a majority of voters in the Commonwealth should be able to elect a majority of the Commonwealths congressional delegation.  There is no authority for this precept.  Even if the novelty of the proposed principle were accompanied by a convincing rationale for its adoption, there is no obvious way to draw a satisfactory standard from it for measuring an alleged burden on representational rights.  The plurality demonstrates the shortcomings of the other standards that have been considered to date.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at Parts III and IV (demonstrating that the standards proposed in 
				<em>

, by the parties before us, and by our dissenting colleagues are either unmanageable or inconsistent with precedent, or both).  I would add two comments to the pluralitys analysis.  The first is that the parties have not shown us, and I have not been able to discover, helpful discussions on the principles of fair districting discussed in the annals of parliamentary or legislative bodies.  Our attention has not been drawn to statements of principled, well-accepted rules of fairness that should govern districting, or to helpful formulations of the legislators duty in drawing district lines.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, even those criteria that might seem promising at the outset (
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, contiguity and compactness) are not altogether sound as independent judicial standards for measuring a burden on representational rights.  They cannot promise political neutrality when used as the basis for relief.  Instead, it seems, a decision under these standards would unavoidably have significant political effect, whether intended or not.  For example, if we were to demand that congressional districts take a particular shape, we could not assure the parties that this criterion, neutral enough on its face, would not in fact benefit one political party over another.  See 
				<em>
					Gaffney
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 753 (District lines are rarely neutral phenomena.  They can well determine what district will be predominantly Democratic or predominantly Republican, or make a close race likely); see also R. Bork, The Tempting of America: The Political Seduction of the Law 8889 (1990) (documenting the authors service as a special master responsible for redistricting Connecticut and noting that his final plan so benefited the Democratic Party, albeit unintentionally, that the party chairman personally congratulated him); M. Altman, Modeling the Effect of Mandatory District Compactness on Partisan Gerrymanders, 17 Pol. Geography 989, 10001006 (1998) (explaining that compactness standards help Republicans because Democrats are more likely to live in high density regions).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The challenge in finding a manageable standard for assessing burdens on representational rights has long been recognized.  See Lowenstein &amp; Steinberg, The Quest for Legislative Districting in the Public Interest: Elusive or Illusory? 33 UCLA L. Rev. 1, 74 (1985) ([W]hat matters to us, and what we think matters to almost all Americans when district lines are drawn, is how the fortunes of the parties and the policies the parties stand for are affected.  When such things are at stake there is no neutrality.  There is only political contest).  The dearth of helpful historical guidance must, in part, cause this uncertainty.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

    There are, then, weighty arguments for holding cases like these to be nonjusticiable; and those arguments may prevail in the long run.  In my view, however, the arguments are not so compelling that they require us now to bar all future claims of injury from a partisan gerrymander.  It is not in our tradition to foreclose the judicial process from the attempt to define standards and remedies where it is alleged that a constitutional right is burdened or denied.  Nor is it alien to the Judiciary to draw or approve election district lines.  Courts, after all, already do so in many instances.  A determination by the Court to deny all hopes of intervention could erode confidence in the courts as much as would a premature decision to intervene.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Our willingness to enter the political thicket of the apportionment process with respect to one-person, one-vote claims makes it particularly difficult to justify a categorical refusal to entertain claims against this other type of gerrymandering.  The pluralitys conclusion that absent an easily administrable standard,

The pluralitys response that in 
				<em>
					Baker
				</em>
				 this Court sat in review only of a nonjusticiability holding is wide of the mark.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 35.  As the plurality itself instructs: Before a Court can conclude that it has [any] business entertaining [a] claim, it must conclude that some judicially enforceable righ[t] is at issue.  
				<em>
					Ante

				<em>

				</em>
				 enforceable was as much a necessary inquiry there as it is here.  In light of 
				<em>
					Baker
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>

				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>

				</em>
				, which directly address the question of nonjusticiability in the specific context of districting and of asserted violations of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>, the pluralitys further survey of cases involving different approaches to the justiciability of different claims cannot be thought controlling.  See

				, at 3334.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Even putting 
				<em>
					Baker
				</em>
				 to the sideand so assuming that the existence of a workable standard for measuring a gerrymanders burden on representational rights distinguishes one-person, one-vote claims from partisan gerrymandering claims for justiciability purposesI would still reject the pluralitys conclusions as to nonjusticiability.  Relying on the distinction between a claim having or not having a workable standard of that sort involves a difficult proof: proof of a categorical negative.  That is, the different treatment of claims otherwise so alike hinges entirely on proof that no standard could exist.  This is a difficult proposition to establish, for proving a negative is a challenge in any context.

				That no such standard has emerged in this case should not be taken to prove that none will emerge in the future.  Where important rights are involved, the impossibility of full analytical satisfaction is reason to err on the side of caution.

If a State passed an enactment that declared All future apportionment shall be drawn so as most to burden Party Xs rights to fair and effective representation, though still in accord with one-person, one-vote principles, we would surely conclude the Constitution had been violated.  If that is so, we should admit the possibility remains that a legislature might attempt to reach the same result without that express directive.  This possibility suggests that in another case a standard might emerge that suitably demonstrates how an apportionments

				, at 3 (dissenting opinion).  Moreover, by the timeline of the law 18 years is rather a short period.  In addition, the rapid evolution of technologies in the apportionment field suggests yet unexplored possibilities.  Computer assisted districting has become so routine and sophisticated that legislatures, experts, and courts can use databases to map electoral districts in a matter of hours, not months.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Larios
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Cox
				</em>
				, 305 F. Supp. 2d 1335 (ND Ga. 2004).  Technology is both a threat and a promise.  On the one hand, if courts refuse to entertain any claims of partisan gerrymandering, the temptation to use partisan favoritism in districting in an unconstitutional manner will grow.  On the other hand, these new technologies may produce new methods of analysis that make more evident the precise nature of the burdens gerrymanders impose on the representational rights of voters and parties.  That would facilitate court efforts to identify and remedy the burdens, with judicial intervention limited by the derived standards.

				If suitable standards with which to measure the burden a gerrymander imposes on representational rights did emerge, hindsight would show that the Court prematurely abandoned the field.  That is a risk the Court should not take.  Instead, we should adjudicate only what is in the papers before us.  See

				Because, in the case before us, we have no standard by which to measure the burden appellants claim has been imposed on their representational rights, appellants cannot establish that the alleged political classifications burden those same rights.  Failing to show that the alleged classifications are unrelated to the aims of apportionment, appellants evidence at best demonstrates only that the legislature adopted political classifications.

				The plurality suggests there is no place for the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> in this area.  See 
				<em>

				, at 25.  The implication is that under the

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> analysis.  The inquiry is not whether political classifications were used.  The inquiry instead is whether political classifications were used to burden a groups representational rights.  If a court were to find that a State did impose burdens and restrictions on groups or persons by reason of their views, there would likely be a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> violation, unless the State shows some compelling interest.

				Where it is alleged that a gerrymander had the purpose and effect of imposing burdens on a disfavored party and its voters, the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> may offer a sounder and more prudential basis for intervention than does the Equal Protection Clause.  The equal protection analysis puts its emphasis on the permissibility of an enactments classifications.  This works where race is involved since classifying by race is almost never permissible.  It presents a more complicated question when the inquiry is whether a generally permissible classification has been used for an impermissible purpose.  That question can only be answered in the affirmative by the subsidiary showing that the classification as applied imposes unlawful burdens.  The 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> analysis concentrates on whether the legislation burdens the representational rights of the complaining partys voters for reasons of ideology, beliefs, or political association.

				Finally, I do not understand the plurality to conclude that partisan gerrymandering that disfavors one party is permissible.  Indeed, the Court seems to acknowledge it is not.  See

				, at 23 (We do not disagree with [the] judgment that partisan gerrymanders [are incompatible] with democratic principles);

				<em>
					Baker

				, 369 U. S., at 226.  That said, courts must be cautious about adopting a standard that turns on whether the partisan interests in the redistricting process were excessive.  Excessiveness is not easily determined.  Consider these apportionment schemes: In one State, Party X controls the apportionment process and draws the lines so it captures every congressional seat.  In three other States, Party Y controls the apportionment process.  It is not so blatant or egregious, but proceeds by a more subtle effort, capturing less than all the seats in each State.  Still, the total effect of Party Ys effort is to capture more new seats than Party X captured.  Party Xs gerrymander was more egregious.  Party Ys gerrymander was more subtle.  In my view, however, each is culpable.

				The ordered working of our Republic, and of the democratic process, depends on a sense of decorum and restraint in all branches of government, and in the citizenry itself.  Here, one has the sense that legislative restraint was abandoned.  That should not be thought to serve the interests of our political order.  Nor should it be thought to serve our interest in demonstrating to the world how democracy works.  Whether spoken with concern or pride, it is unfortunate that our legislators have reached the point of declaring that, when it comes to apportionment,  We are in the business of rigging elections.   J.

				Still, the Courts own responsibilities require that we refrain from intervention in this instance.  The failings of the many proposed standards for measuring the burden a gerrymander imposes on representational rights make our intervention improper.  If workable standards do emerge to measure these burdens, however, courts should be prepared to order relief.  With these observations, I join the judgment of the plurality.

				A decision ordering the correction of all election district lines drawn for partisan reasons would commit federal and state courts to unprecedented intervention in the American political process.  The Court is correct to refrain from directing this substantial intrusion into the Nations political life.  While agreeing with the plurality that the complaint the appellants filed in the District Court must be dismissed, and while understanding that great caution is necessary when approaching this subject, I would not foreclose all possibility of judicial relief if some limited and precise rationale were found to correct an established violation of the Constitution in some redistricting cases.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				When presented with a claim of injury from partisan gerrymandering, courts confront two obstacles.  First is the lack of comprehensive and neutral principles for drawing electoral boundaries.  No substantive definition of fairness in districting seems to command general assent.  Second is the absence of rules to limit and confine judicial intervention.  With uncertain limits, intervening courtseven when proceeding with best intentionswould risk assuming political, not legal, responsibility for a process that often produces ill will and distrust.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				That courts can grant relief in districting cases where race is involved does not answer our need for fairness principles here.  Those controversies implicate a different inquiry.  They involve sorting permissible classifications in the redistricting context from impermissible ones.  Race is an impermissible classification.  See 
				<em>

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				A determination that a gerrymander violates the law must rest on something more than the conclusion that political classifications were applied.  It must rest instead on a conclusion that the classifications, though generally permissible, were applied in an invidious manner or in a way unrelated to any legitimate legislative objective.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">565</a>568 (1964)
.  At first it might seem that courts could determine, by the exercise of their own judgment, whether political classifications are related to this object or instead burden representational rights.  The lack, however, of any agreed upon model of fair and effective representation makes this analysis difficult to pursue.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The second obstaclethe absence of rules to confine judicial interventionis related to the first.  Because there are yet no agreed upon substantive principles of fairness in districting, we have no basis on which to define clear, manageable, and politically neutral standards for measuring the particular burden a given partisan classification imposes on representational rights.  Suitable standards for measuring this burden, however, are critical to our intervention.  Absent sure guidance, the results from one gerrymandering case to the next would likely be disparate and inconsistent.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In this case, we have not overcome these obstacles to determining that the challenged districting violated appellants rights.  The fairness principle appellants propose is that a majority of voters in the Commonwealth should be able to elect a majority of the Commonwealths congressional delegation.  There is no authority for this precept.  Even if the novelty of the proposed principle were accompanied by a convincing rationale for its adoption, there is no obvious way to draw a satisfactory standard from it for measuring an alleged burden on representational rights.  The plurality demonstrates the shortcomings of the other standards that have been considered to date.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at Parts III and IV (demonstrating that the standards proposed in 
				<em>
					Davis

, by the parties before us, and by our dissenting colleagues are either unmanageable or inconsistent with precedent, or both).  I would add two comments to the pluralitys analysis.  The first is that the parties have not shown us, and I have not been able to discover, helpful discussions on the principles of fair districting discussed in the annals of parliamentary or legislative bodies.  Our attention has not been drawn to statements of principled, well-accepted rules of fairness that should govern districting, or to helpful formulations of the legislators duty in drawing district lines.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, even those criteria that might seem promising at the outset (
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, contiguity and compactness) are not altogether sound as independent judicial standards for measuring a burden on representational rights.  They cannot promise political neutrality when used as the basis for relief.  Instead, it seems, a decision under these standards would unavoidably have significant political effect, whether intended or not.  For example, if we were to demand that congressional districts take a particular shape, we could not assure the parties that this criterion, neutral enough on its face, would not in fact benefit one political party over another.  See 
				<em>
					Gaffney
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 753 (District lines are rarely neutral phenomena.  They can well determine what district will be predominantly Democratic or predominantly Republican, or make a close race likely); see also R. Bork, The Tempting of America: The Political Seduction of the Law 8889 (1990) (documenting the authors service as a special master responsible for redistricting Connecticut and noting that his final plan so benefited the Democratic Party, albeit unintentionally, that the party chairman personally congratulated him); M. Altman, Modeling the Effect of Mandatory District Compactness on Partisan Gerrymanders, 17 Pol. Geography 989, 10001006 (1998) (explaining that compactness standards help Republicans because Democrats are more likely to live in high density regions).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The challenge in finding a manageable standard for assessing burdens on representational rights has long been recognized.  See Lowenstein &amp; Steinberg, The Quest for Legislative Districting in the Public Interest: Elusive or Illusory? 33 UCLA L. Rev. 1, 74 (1985) ([W]hat matters to us, and what we think matters to almost all Americans when district lines are drawn, is how the fortunes of the parties and the policies the parties stand for are affected.  When such things are at stake there is no neutrality.  There is only political contest).  The dearth of helpful historical guidance must, in part, cause this uncertainty.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

    There are, then, weighty arguments for holding cases like these to be nonjusticiable; and those arguments may prevail in the long run.  In my view, however, the arguments are not so compelling that they require us now to bar all future claims of injury from a partisan gerrymander.  It is not in our tradition to foreclose the judicial process from the attempt to define standards and remedies where it is alleged that a constitutional right is burdened or denied.  Nor is it alien to the Judiciary to draw or approve election district lines.  Courts, after all, already do so in many instances.  A determination by the Court to deny all hopes of intervention could erode confidence in the courts as much as would a premature decision to intervene.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Our willingness to enter the political thicket of the apportionment process with respect to one-person, one-vote claims makes it particularly difficult to justify a categorical refusal to entertain claims against this other type of gerrymandering.  The pluralitys conclusion that absent an easily administrable standard,

The pluralitys response that in 
				<em>
					Baker
				</em>
				 this Court sat in review only of a nonjusticiability holding is wide of the mark.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 35.  As the plurality itself instructs: Before a Court can conclude that it has [any] business entertaining [a] claim, it must conclude that some judicially enforceable righ[t] is at issue.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 7.  Whether a manageable standard made the right at issue in 
				<em>
					Baker
				</em>
				 enforceable was as much a necessary inquiry there as it is here.  In light of 
				<em>
					Baker
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Davis
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>

				</em>
				, which directly address the question of nonjusticiability in the specific context of districting and of asserted violations of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>, the pluralitys further survey of cases involving different approaches to the justiciability of different claims cannot be thought controlling.  See

				, at 3334.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Even putting 
				<em>
					Baker
				</em>
				 to the sideand so assuming that the existence of a workable standard for measuring a gerrymanders burden on representational rights distinguishes one-person, one-vote claims from partisan gerrymandering claims for justiciability purposesI would still reject the pluralitys conclusions as to nonjusticiability.  Relying on the distinction between a claim having or not having a workable standard of that sort involves a difficult proof: proof of a categorical negative.  That is, the different treatment of claims otherwise so alike hinges entirely on proof that no standard could exist.  This is a difficult proposition to establish, for proving a negative is a challenge in any context.

				That no such standard has emerged in this case should not be taken to prove that none will emerge in the future.  Where important rights are involved, the impossibility of full analytical satisfaction is reason to err on the side of caution.

If a State passed an enactment that declared All future apportionment shall be drawn so as most to burden Party Xs rights to fair and effective representation, though still in accord with one-person, one-vote principles, we would surely conclude the Constitution had been violated.  If that is so, we should admit the possibility remains that a legislature might attempt to reach the same result without that express directive.  This possibility suggests that in another case a standard might emerge that suitably demonstrates how an apportionments

				, at 3 (dissenting opinion).  Moreover, by the timeline of the law 18 years is rather a short period.  In addition, the rapid evolution of technologies in the apportionment field suggests yet unexplored possibilities.  Computer assisted districting has become so routine and sophisticated that legislatures, experts, and courts can use databases to map electoral districts in a matter of hours, not months.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Larios
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Cox
				</em>
				, 305 F. Supp. 2d 1335 (ND Ga. 2004).  Technology is both a threat and a promise.  On the one hand, if courts refuse to entertain any claims of partisan gerrymandering, the temptation to use partisan favoritism in districting in an unconstitutional manner will grow.  On the other hand, these new technologies may produce new methods of analysis that make more evident the precise nature of the burdens gerrymanders impose on the representational rights of voters and parties.  That would facilitate court efforts to identify and remedy the burdens, with judicial intervention limited by the derived standards.

				If suitable standards with which to measure the burden a gerrymander imposes on representational rights did emerge, hindsight would show that the Court prematurely abandoned the field.  That is a risk the Court should not take.  Instead, we should adjudicate only what is in the papers before us.  See

				Because, in the case before us, we have no standard by which to measure the burden appellants claim has been imposed on their representational rights, appellants cannot establish that the alleged political classifications burden those same rights.  Failing to show that the alleged classifications are unrelated to the aims of apportionment, appellants evidence at best demonstrates only that the legislature adopted political classifications.  That describes no constitutional flaw, at least under the governing

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> concerns arise where a State enacts a law that has the purpose and effect of subjecting a group of voters or their party to disfavored treatment by reason of their views.

				The plurality suggests there is no place for the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> in this area.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 25.  The implication is that under the

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> analysis.  The inquiry is not whether political classifications were used.  The inquiry instead is whether political classifications were used to burden a groups representational rights.  If a court were to find that a State did impose burdens and restrictions on groups or persons by reason of their views, there would likely be a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> violation, unless the State shows some compelling interest. Of course, all this depends first on courts having available a manageable standard by which to measure the effect of the apportionment and so to conclude that the State did impose a burden or restriction on the rights of a partys voters.

				Where it is alleged that a gerrymander had the purpose and effect of imposing burdens on a disfavored party and its voters, the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> may offer a sounder and more prudential basis for intervention than does the Equal Protection Clause.  The equal protection analysis puts its emphasis on the permissibility of an enactments classifications.  This works where race is involved since classifying by race is almost never permissible.  It presents a more complicated question when the inquiry is whether a generally permissible classification has been used for an impermissible purpose.  That question can only be answered in the affirmative by the subsidiary showing that the classification as applied imposes unlawful burdens.  The 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> analysis concentrates on whether the legislation burdens the representational rights of the complaining partys voters for reasons of ideology, beliefs, or political association.

				Finally, I do not understand the plurality to conclude that partisan gerrymandering that disfavors one party is permissible.  Indeed, the Court seems to acknowledge it is not.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 23 (We do not disagree with [the] judgment that partisan gerrymanders [are incompatible] with democratic principles); 
				<em>

				<em>
					excessive
				</em>
				 injection of politics [in districting] is 
				<em>
					un

				<em>
					no
				</em>
				 policy, but simply arbitrary and capricious action.  
				<em>
					Baker
				</em>
				, 369 U. S., at 226.  That said, courts must be cautious about adopting a standard that turns on whether the partisan interests in the redistricting process were excessive.  Excessiveness is not easily determined.  Consider these apportionment schemes: In one State, Party X controls the apportionment process and draws the lines so it captures every congressional seat.  In three other States, Party Y controls the apportionment process.  It is not so blatant or egregious, but proceeds by a more subtle effort, capturing less than all the seats in each State.  Still, the total effect of Party Ys effort is to capture more new seats than Party X captured.  Party Xs gerrymander was more egregious.  Party Ys gerrymander was more subtle.  In my view, however, each is culpable.

				The ordered working of our Republic, and of the democratic process, depends on a sense of decorum and restraint in all branches of government, and in the citizenry itself.  Here, one has the sense that legislative restraint was abandoned.  That should not be thought to serve the interests of our political order.  Nor should it be thought to serve our interest in demonstrating to the world how democracy works.  Whether spoken with concern or pride, it is unfortunate that our legislators have reached the point of declaring that, when it comes to apportionment,  We are in the business of rigging elections.   J.

				Still, the Courts own responsibilities require that we refrain from intervention in this instance.  The failings of the many proposed standards for measuring the burden a gerrymander imposes on representational rights make our intervention improper.  If workable standards do emerge to measure these burdens, however, courts should be prepared to order relief.  With these observations, I join the judgment of the plurality.

				A decision ordering the correction of all election district lines drawn for partisan reasons would commit federal and state courts to unprecedented intervention in the American political process.  The Court is correct to refrain from directing this substantial intrusion into the Nations political life.  While agreeing with the plurality that the complaint the appellants filed in the District Court must be dismissed, and while understanding that great caution is necessary when approaching this subject, I would not foreclose all possibility of judicial relief if some limited and precise rationale were found to correct an established violation of the Constitution in some redistricting cases.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				When presented with a claim of injury from partisan gerrymandering, courts confront two obstacles.  First is the lack of comprehensive and neutral principles for drawing electoral boundaries.  No substantive definition of fairness in districting seems to command general assent.  Second is the absence of rules to limit and confine judicial intervention.  With uncertain limits, intervening courtseven when proceeding with best intentionswould risk assuming political, not legal, responsibility for a process that often produces ill will and distrust.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				That courts can grant relief in districting cases where race is involved does not answer our need for fairness principles here.  Those controversies implicate a different inquiry.  They involve sorting permissible classifications in the redistricting context from impermissible ones.  Race is an impermissible classification.  See 
				<em>
					Shaw
				</em>
				 v.

					Reno,

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				A determination that a gerrymander violates the law must rest on something more than the conclusion that political classifications were applied.  It must rest instead on a conclusion that the classifications, though generally permissible, were applied in an invidious manner or in a way unrelated to any legitimate legislative objective.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">565</a>568 (1964)
.  At first it might seem that courts could determine, by the exercise of their own judgment, whether political classifications are related to this object or instead burden representational rights.  The lack, however, of any agreed upon model of fair and effective representation makes this analysis difficult to pursue.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The second obstaclethe absence of rules to confine judicial interventionis related to the first.  Because there are yet no agreed upon substantive principles of fairness in districting, we have no basis on which to define clear, manageable, and politically neutral standards for measuring the particular burden a given partisan classification imposes on representational rights.  Suitable standards for measuring this burden, however, are critical to our intervention.  Absent sure guidance, the results from one gerrymandering case to the next would likely be disparate and inconsistent.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In this case, we have not overcome these obstacles to determining that the challenged districting violated appellants rights.  The fairness principle appellants propose is that a majority of voters in the Commonwealth should be able to elect a majority of the Commonwealths congressional delegation.  There is no authority for this precept.  Even if the novelty of the proposed principle were accompanied by a convincing rationale for its adoption, there is no obvious way to draw a satisfactory standard from it for measuring an alleged burden on representational rights.  The plurality demonstrates the shortcomings of the other standards that have been considered to date.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at Parts III and IV (demonstrating that the standards proposed in 
				<em>
					Davis
				</em>
				 v.

, by the parties before us, and by our dissenting colleagues are either unmanageable or inconsistent with precedent, or both).  I would add two comments to the pluralitys analysis.  The first is that the parties have not shown us, and I have not been able to discover, helpful discussions on the principles of fair districting discussed in the annals of parliamentary or legislative bodies.  Our attention has not been drawn to statements of principled, well-accepted rules of fairness that should govern districting, or to helpful formulations of the legislators duty in drawing district lines.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, even those criteria that might seem promising at the outset (
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, contiguity and compactness) are not altogether sound as independent judicial standards for measuring a burden on representational rights.  They cannot promise political neutrality when used as the basis for relief.  Instead, it seems, a decision under these standards would unavoidably have significant political effect, whether intended or not.  For example, if we were to demand that congressional districts take a particular shape, we could not assure the parties that this criterion, neutral enough on its face, would not in fact benefit one political party over another.  See 
				<em>
					Gaffney
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 753 (District lines are rarely neutral phenomena.  They can well determine what district will be predominantly Democratic or predominantly Republican, or make a close race likely); see also R. Bork, The Tempting of America: The Political Seduction of the Law 8889 (1990) (documenting the authors service as a special master responsible for redistricting Connecticut and noting that his final plan so benefited the Democratic Party, albeit unintentionally, that the party chairman personally congratulated him); M. Altman, Modeling the Effect of Mandatory District Compactness on Partisan Gerrymanders, 17 Pol. Geography 989, 10001006 (1998) (explaining that compactness standards help Republicans because Democrats are more likely to live in high density regions).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The challenge in finding a manageable standard for assessing burdens on representational rights has long been recognized.  See Lowenstein &amp; Steinberg, The Quest for Legislative Districting in the Public Interest: Elusive or Illusory? 33 UCLA L. Rev. 1, 74 (1985) ([W]hat matters to us, and what we think matters to almost all Americans when district lines are drawn, is how the fortunes of the parties and the policies the parties stand for are affected.  When such things are at stake there is no neutrality.  There is only political contest).  The dearth of helpful historical guidance must, in part, cause this uncertainty.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

    There are, then, weighty arguments for holding cases like these to be nonjusticiable; and those arguments may prevail in the long run.  In my view, however, the arguments are not so compelling that they require us now to bar all future claims of injury from a partisan gerrymander.  It is not in our tradition to foreclose the judicial process from the attempt to define standards and remedies where it is alleged that a constitutional right is burdened or denied.  Nor is it alien to the Judiciary to draw or approve election district lines.  Courts, after all, already do so in many instances.  A determination by the Court to deny all hopes of intervention could erode confidence in the courts as much as would a premature decision to intervene.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Our willingness to enter the political thicket of the apportionment process with respect to one-person, one-vote claims makes it particularly difficult to justify a categorical refusal to entertain claims against this other type of gerrymandering.  The pluralitys conclusion that absent an easily administrable standard,

The pluralitys response that in 
				<em>
					Baker
				</em>
				 this Court sat in review only of a nonjusticiability holding is wide of the mark.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 35.  As the plurality itself instructs: Before a Court can conclude that it has [any] business entertaining [a] claim, it must conclude that some judicially enforceable righ[t] is at issue.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 7.  Whether a manageable standard made the right at issue in 
				<em>
					Baker
				</em>
				 enforceable was as much a necessary inquiry there as it is here.  In light of 
				<em>
					Baker
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Davis
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>

				</em>
				, which directly address the question of nonjusticiability in the specific context of districting and of asserted violations of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>, the pluralitys further survey of cases involving different approaches to the justiciability of different claims cannot be thought controlling.  See 
				<em>

				, at 3334.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Even putting 
				<em>
					Baker
				</em>
				 to the sideand so assuming that the existence of a workable standard for measuring a gerrymanders burden on representational rights distinguishes one-person, one-vote claims from partisan gerrymandering claims for justiciability purposesI would still reject the pluralitys conclusions as to nonjusticiability.  Relying on the distinction between a claim having or not having a workable standard of that sort involves a difficult proof: proof of a categorical negative.  That is, the different treatment of claims otherwise so alike hinges entirely on proof that no standard could exist.  This is a difficult proposition to establish, for proving a negative is a challenge in any context.

				That no such standard has emerged in this case should not be taken to prove that none will emerge in the future.  Where important rights are involved, the impossibility of full analytical satisfaction is reason to err on the side of caution.  Allegations of unconstitutional bias in apportionment are most serious claims, for we have long believed that the right to vote is one of those political processes ordinarily to be relied upon to protect minorities.

.  If a State passed an enactment that declared All future apportionment shall be drawn so as most to burden Party Xs rights to fair and effective representation, though still in accord with one-person, one-vote principles, we would surely conclude the Constitution had been violated.  If that is so, we should admit the possibility remains that a legislature might attempt to reach the same result without that express directive.  This possibility suggests that in another case a standard might emerge that suitably demonstrates how an apportionments 
				<em>
					de facto
				</em>
				 incorporation of partisan classifications burdens rights of fair and effective representation (and so establishes the classification is unrelated to the aims of apportionment and thus is used in an impermissible fashion).

				, at 3 (dissenting opinion).  Moreover, by the timeline of the law 18 years is rather a short period.  In addition, the rapid evolution of technologies in the apportionment field suggests yet unexplored possibilities.  Computer assisted districting has become so routine and sophisticated that legislatures, experts, and courts can use databases to map electoral districts in a matter of hours, not months.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Larios
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Cox
				</em>
				, 305 F. Supp. 2d 1335 (ND Ga. 2004).  Technology is both a threat and a promise.  On the one hand, if courts refuse to entertain any claims of partisan gerrymandering, the temptation to use partisan favoritism in districting in an unconstitutional manner will grow.  On the other hand, these new technologies may produce new methods of analysis that make more evident the precise nature of the burdens gerrymanders impose on the representational rights of voters and parties.  That would facilitate court efforts to identify and remedy the burdens, with judicial intervention limited by the derived standards.

				If suitable standards with which to measure the burden a gerrymander imposes on representational rights did emerge, hindsight would show that the Court prematurely abandoned the field.

				Because, in the case before us, we have no standard by which to measure the burden appellants claim has been imposed on their representational rights, appellants cannot establish that the alleged political classifications burden those same rights.  Failing to show that the alleged classifications are unrelated to the aims of apportionment, appellants evidence at best demonstrates only that the legislature adopted political classifications.

				The plurality suggests there is no place for the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> in this area.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 25.  The implication is that under the

				<em>

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> analysis.  The inquiry is not whether political classifications were used.  The inquiry instead is whether political classifications were used to burden a groups representational rights.  If a court were to find that a State did impose burdens and restrictions on groups or persons by reason of their views, there would likely be a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> violation, unless the State shows some compelling interest. Of course, all this depends first on courts having available a manageable standard by which to measure the effect of the apportionment and so to conclude that the State did impose a burden or restriction on the rights of a partys voters.

				Where it is alleged that a gerrymander had the purpose and effect of imposing burdens on a disfavored party and its voters, the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> may offer a sounder and more prudential basis for intervention than does the Equal Protection Clause.  The equal protection analysis puts its emphasis on the permissibility of an enactments classifications.  This works where race is involved since classifying by race is almost never permissible.  It presents a more complicated question when the inquiry is whether a generally permissible classification has been used for an impermissible purpose.  That question can only be answered in the affirmative by the subsidiary showing that the classification as applied imposes unlawful burdens.  The 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> analysis concentrates on whether the legislation burdens the representational rights of the complaining partys voters for reasons of ideology, beliefs, or political association.

				Finally, I do not understand the plurality to conclude that partisan gerrymandering that disfavors one party is permissible.  Indeed, the Court seems to acknowledge it is not.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 23 (We do not disagree with [the] judgment that partisan gerrymanders [are incompatible] with democratic principles); 
				<em>

				<em>
					excessive
				</em>
				 injection of politics [in districting] is 
				<em>

				<em>
					no
				</em>
				 policy, but simply arbitrary and capricious action.  
				<em>
					Baker
				</em>
				, 369 U. S., at 226.  That said, courts must be cautious about adopting a standard that turns on whether the partisan interests in the redistricting process were excessive.  Excessiveness is not easily determined.  Consider these apportionment schemes: In one State, Party X controls the apportionment process and draws the lines so it captures every congressional seat.  In three other States, Party Y controls the apportionment process.  It is not so blatant or egregious, but proceeds by a more subtle effort, capturing less than all the seats in each State.  Still, the total effect of Party Ys effort is to capture more new seats than Party X captured.  Party Xs gerrymander was more egregious.  Party Ys gerrymander was more subtle.  In my view, however, each is culpable.

				The ordered working of our Republic, and of the democratic process, depends on a sense of decorum and restraint in all branches of government, and in the citizenry itself.  Here, one has the sense that legislative restraint was abandoned.  That should not be thought to serve the interests of our political order.  Nor should it be thought to serve our interest in demonstrating to the world how democracy works.  Whether spoken with concern or pride, it is unfortunate that our legislators have reached the point of declaring that, when it comes to apportionment,  We are in the business of rigging elections.   J.

				Still, the Courts own responsibilities require that we refrain from intervention in this instance.  The failings of the many proposed standards for measuring the burden a gerrymander imposes on representational rights make our intervention improper.  If workable standards do emerge to measure these burdens, however, courts should be prepared to order relief.  With these observations, I join the judgment of the plurality.

				A decision ordering the correction of all election district lines drawn for partisan reasons would commit federal and state courts to unprecedented intervention in the American political process.  The Court is correct to refrain from directing this substantial intrusion into the Nations political life.  While agreeing with the plurality that the complaint the appellants filed in the District Court must be dismissed, and while understanding that great caution is necessary when approaching this subject, I would not foreclose all possibility of judicial relief if some limited and precise rationale were found to correct an established violation of the Constitution in some redistricting cases.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				When presented with a claim of injury from partisan gerrymandering, courts confront two obstacles.  First is the lack of comprehensive and neutral principles for drawing electoral boundaries.  No substantive definition of fairness in districting seems to command general assent.  Second is the absence of rules to limit and confine judicial intervention.  With uncertain limits, intervening courtseven when proceeding with best intentionswould risk assuming political, not legal, responsibility for a process that often produces ill will and distrust.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				That courts can grant relief in districting cases where race is involved does not answer our need for fairness principles here.  Those controversies implicate a different inquiry.  They involve sorting permissible classifications in the redistricting context from impermissible ones.  Race is an impermissible classification.  See 
				<em>
					Shaw

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				A determination that a gerrymander violates the law must rest on something more than the conclusion that political classifications were applied.  It must rest instead on a conclusion that the classifications, though generally permissible, were applied in an invidious manner or in a way unrelated to any legitimate legislative objective.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">565</a>568 (1964)
.  At first it might seem that courts could determine, by the exercise of their own judgment, whether political classifications are related to this object or instead burden representational rights.  The lack, however, of any agreed upon model of fair and effective representation makes this analysis difficult to pursue.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The second obstaclethe absence of rules to confine judicial interventionis related to the first.  Because there are yet no agreed upon substantive principles of fairness in districting, we have no basis on which to define clear, manageable, and politically neutral standards for measuring the particular burden a given partisan classification imposes on representational rights.  Suitable standards for measuring this burden, however, are critical to our intervention.  Absent sure guidance, the results from one gerrymandering case to the next would likely be disparate and inconsistent.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In this case, we have not overcome these obstacles to determining that the challenged districting violated appellants rights.  The fairness principle appellants propose is that a majority of voters in the Commonwealth should be able to elect a majority of the Commonwealths congressional delegation.  There is no authority for this precept.  Even if the novelty of the proposed principle were accompanied by a convincing rationale for its adoption, there is no obvious way to draw a satisfactory standard from it for measuring an alleged burden on representational rights.  The plurality demonstrates the shortcomings of the other standards that have been considered to date.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at Parts III and IV (demonstrating that the standards proposed in 
				<em>
					Davis

, by the parties before us, and by our dissenting colleagues are either unmanageable or inconsistent with precedent, or both).  I would add two comments to the pluralitys analysis.  The first is that the parties have not shown us, and I have not been able to discover, helpful discussions on the principles of fair districting discussed in the annals of parliamentary or legislative bodies.  Our attention has not been drawn to statements of principled, well-accepted rules of fairness that should govern districting, or to helpful formulations of the legislators duty in drawing district lines.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, even those criteria that might seem promising at the outset (
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, contiguity and compactness) are not altogether sound as independent judicial standards for measuring a burden on representational rights.  They cannot promise political neutrality when used as the basis for relief.  Instead, it seems, a decision under these standards would unavoidably have significant political effect, whether intended or not.  For example, if we were to demand that congressional districts take a particular shape, we could not assure the parties that this criterion, neutral enough on its face, would not in fact benefit one political party over another.  See 
				<em>
					Gaffney
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 753 (District lines are rarely neutral phenomena.  They can well determine what district will be predominantly Democratic or predominantly Republican, or make a close race likely); see also R. Bork, The Tempting of America: The Political Seduction of the Law 8889 (1990) (documenting the authors service as a special master responsible for redistricting Connecticut and noting that his final plan so benefited the Democratic Party, albeit unintentionally, that the party chairman personally congratulated him); M. Altman, Modeling the Effect of Mandatory District Compactness on Partisan Gerrymanders, 17 Pol. Geography 989, 10001006 (1998) (explaining that compactness standards help Republicans because Democrats are more likely to live in high density regions).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The challenge in finding a manageable standard for assessing burdens on representational rights has long been recognized.  See Lowenstein &amp; Steinberg, The Quest for Legislative Districting in the Public Interest: Elusive or Illusory? 33 UCLA L. Rev. 1, 74 (1985) ([W]hat matters to us, and what we think matters to almost all Americans when district lines are drawn, is how the fortunes of the parties and the policies the parties stand for are affected.  When such things are at stake there is no neutrality.  There is only political contest).  The dearth of helpful historical guidance must, in part, cause this uncertainty.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

    There are, then, weighty arguments for holding cases like these to be nonjusticiable; and those arguments may prevail in the long run.  In my view, however, the arguments are not so compelling that they require us now to bar all future claims of injury from a partisan gerrymander.  It is not in our tradition to foreclose the judicial process from the attempt to define standards and remedies where it is alleged that a constitutional right is burdened or denied.  Nor is it alien to the Judiciary to draw or approve election district lines.  Courts, after all, already do so in many instances.  A determination by the Court to deny all hopes of intervention could erode confidence in the courts as much as would a premature decision to intervene.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Our willingness to enter the political thicket of the apportionment process with respect to one-person, one-vote claims makes it particularly difficult to justify a categorical refusal to entertain claims against this other type of gerrymandering.  The pluralitys conclusion that absent an easily administrable standard,

The pluralitys response that in 
				<em>
					Baker
				</em>
				 this Court sat in review only of a nonjusticiability holding is wide of the mark.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 35.  As the plurality itself instructs: Before a Court can conclude that it has [any] business entertaining [a] claim, it must conclude that some judicially enforceable righ[t] is at issue.  
				<em>

				</em>
				 and 
				<em>

				, which directly address the question of nonjusticiability in the specific context of districting and of asserted violations of the

				Even putting

				 to the sideand so assuming that the existence of a workable standard for measuring a gerrymanders burden on representational rights distinguishes one-person, one-vote claims from partisan gerrymandering claims for justiciability purposesI would still reject the pluralitys conclusions as to nonjusticiability.  Relying on the distinction between a claim having or not having a workable standard of that sort involves a difficult proof: proof of a categorical negative.  That is, the different treatment of claims otherwise so alike hinges entirely on proof that no standard could exist.  This is a difficult proposition to establish, for proving a negative is a challenge in any context.

				That no such standard has emerged in this case should not be taken to prove that none will emerge in the future.  Where important rights are involved, the impossibility of full analytical satisfaction is reason to err on the side of caution.  Allegations of unconstitutional bias in apportionment are most serious claims, for we have long believed that the right to vote is one of those political processes ordinarily to be relied upon to protect minorities.

If a State passed an enactment that declared All future apportionment shall be drawn so as most to burden Party Xs rights to fair and effective representation, though still in accord with one-person, one-vote principles, we would surely conclude the Constitution had been violated.  If that is so, we should admit the possibility remains that a legislature might attempt to reach the same result without that express directive.  This possibility suggests that in another case a standard might emerge that suitably demonstrates how an apportionments

In addition, the rapid evolution of technologies in the apportionment field suggests yet unexplored possibilities.  Computer assisted districting has become so routine and sophisticated that legislatures, experts, and courts can use databases to map electoral districts in a matter of hours, not months.  See,

				, 305 F. Supp. 2d 1335 (ND Ga. 2004).  Technology is both a threat and a promise.  On the one hand, if courts refuse to entertain any claims of partisan gerrymandering, the temptation to use partisan favoritism in districting in an unconstitutional manner will grow.  On the other hand, these new technologies may produce new methods of analysis that make more evident the precise nature of the burdens gerrymanders impose on the representational rights of voters and parties.  That would facilitate court efforts to identify and remedy the burdens, with judicial intervention limited by the derived standards.

				If suitable standards with which to measure the burden a gerrymander imposes on representational rights did emerge, hindsight would show that the Court prematurely abandoned the field.

				Because, in the case before us, we have no standard by which to measure the burden appellants claim has been imposed on their representational rights, appellants cannot establish that the alleged political classifications burden those same rights.

				The plurality suggests there is no place for the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> in this area.  See

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> analysis.  The inquiry is not whether political classifications were used.  The inquiry instead is whether political classifications were used to burden a groups representational rights.  If a court were to find that a State did impose burdens and restrictions on groups or persons by reason of their views, there would likely be a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> violation, unless the State shows some compelling interest. Of course, all this depends first on courts having available a manageable standard by which to measure the effect of the apportionment and so to conclude that the State did impose a burden or restriction on the rights of a partys voters.

				Where it is alleged that a gerrymander had the purpose and effect of imposing burdens on a disfavored party and its voters, the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> may offer a sounder and more prudential basis for intervention than does the Equal Protection Clause.  The equal protection analysis puts its emphasis on the permissibility of an enactments classifications.  This works where race is involved since classifying by race is almost never permissible.  It presents a more complicated question when the inquiry is whether a generally permissible classification has been used for an impermissible purpose.  That question can only be answered in the affirmative by the subsidiary showing that the classification as applied imposes unlawful burdens.  The 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> analysis concentrates on whether the legislation burdens the representational rights of the complaining partys voters for reasons of ideology, beliefs, or political association.

				Finally, I do not understand the plurality to conclude that partisan gerrymandering that disfavors one party is permissible.  Indeed, the Court seems to acknowledge it is not.  See 
				<em>

				</em>
				, at 23 (We do not disagree with [the] judgment that partisan gerrymanders [are incompatible] with democratic principles);

				 policy, but simply arbitrary and capricious action.  
				<em>
					Baker
				</em>
				, 369 U. S., at 226.  That said, courts must be cautious about adopting a standard that turns on whether the partisan interests in the redistricting process were excessive.  Excessiveness is not easily determined.  Consider these apportionment schemes: In one State, Party X controls the apportionment process and draws the lines so it captures every congressional seat.  In three other States, Party Y controls the apportionment process.  It is not so blatant or egregious, but proceeds by a more subtle effort, capturing less than all the seats in each State.  Still, the total effect of Party Ys effort is to capture more new seats than Party X captured.  Party Xs gerrymander was more egregious.  Party Ys gerrymander was more subtle.  In my view, however, each is culpable.

				The ordered working of our Republic, and of the democratic process, depends on a sense of decorum and restraint in all branches of government, and in the citizenry itself.  Here, one has the sense that legislative restraint was abandoned.  That should not be thought to serve the interests of our political order.  Nor should it be thought to serve our interest in demonstrating to the world how democracy works.  Whether spoken with concern or pride, it is unfortunate that our legislators have reached the point of declaring that, when it comes to apportionment,  We are in the business of rigging elections.   J.

				A decision ordering the correction of all election district lines drawn for partisan reasons would commit federal and state courts to unprecedented intervention in the American political process.  The Court is correct to refrain from directing this substantial intrusion into the Nations political life.  While agreeing with the plurality that the complaint the appellants filed in the District Court must be dismissed, and while understanding that great caution is necessary when approaching this subject, I would not foreclose all possibility of judicial relief if some limited and precise rationale were found to correct an established violation of the Constitution in some redistricting cases.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				When presented with a claim of injury from partisan gerrymandering, courts confront two obstacles.  First is the lack of comprehensive and neutral principles for drawing electoral boundaries.  No substantive definition of fairness in districting seems to command general assent.  Second is the absence of rules to limit and confine judicial intervention.  With uncertain limits, intervening courtseven when proceeding with best intentionswould risk assuming political, not legal, responsibility for a process that often produces ill will and distrust.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				That courts can grant relief in districting cases where race is involved does not answer our need for fairness principles here.  Those controversies implicate a different inquiry.  They involve sorting permissible classifications in the redistricting context from impermissible ones.  Race is an impermissible classification.  See 
				<em>

				A determination that a gerrymander violates the law must rest on something more than the conclusion that political classifications were applied.  It must rest instead on a conclusion that the classifications, though generally permissible, were applied in an invidious manner or in a way unrelated to any legitimate legislative objective.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">565</a>568 (1964)
.  At first it might seem that courts could determine, by the exercise of their own judgment, whether political classifications are related to this object or instead burden representational rights.  The lack, however, of any agreed upon model of fair and effective representation makes this analysis difficult to pursue.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The second obstaclethe absence of rules to confine judicial interventionis related to the first.  Because there are yet no agreed upon substantive principles of fairness in districting, we have no basis on which to define clear, manageable, and politically neutral standards for measuring the particular burden a given partisan classification imposes on representational rights.  Suitable standards for measuring this burden, however, are critical to our intervention.  Absent sure guidance, the results from one gerrymandering case to the next would likely be disparate and inconsistent.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In this case, we have not overcome these obstacles to determining that the challenged districting violated appellants rights.  The fairness principle appellants propose is that a majority of voters in the Commonwealth should be able to elect a majority of the Commonwealths congressional delegation.  There is no authority for this precept.  Even if the novelty of the proposed principle were accompanied by a convincing rationale for its adoption, there is no obvious way to draw a satisfactory standard from it for measuring an alleged burden on representational rights.  The plurality demonstrates the shortcomings of the other standards that have been considered to date.  See 
				<em>

				</em>
				, at Parts III and IV (demonstrating that the standards proposed in

, by the parties before us, and by our dissenting colleagues are either unmanageable or inconsistent with precedent, or both).  I would add two comments to the pluralitys analysis.  The first is that the parties have not shown us, and I have not been able to discover, helpful discussions on the principles of fair districting discussed in the annals of parliamentary or legislative bodies.  Our attention has not been drawn to statements of principled, well-accepted rules of fairness that should govern districting, or to helpful formulations of the legislators duty in drawing district lines.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, even those criteria that might seem promising at the outset (
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, contiguity and compactness) are not altogether sound as independent judicial standards for measuring a burden on representational rights.  They cannot promise political neutrality when used as the basis for relief.  Instead, it seems, a decision under these standards would unavoidably have significant political effect, whether intended or not.  For example, if we were to demand that congressional districts take a particular shape, we could not assure the parties that this criterion, neutral enough on its face, would not in fact benefit one political party over another.  See 
				<em>
					Gaffney
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 753 (District lines are rarely neutral phenomena.  They can well determine what district will be predominantly Democratic or predominantly Republican, or make a close race likely); see also R. Bork, The Tempting of America: The Political Seduction of the Law 8889 (1990) (documenting the authors service as a special master responsible for redistricting Connecticut and noting that his final plan so benefited the Democratic Party, albeit unintentionally, that the party chairman personally congratulated him); M. Altman, Modeling the Effect of Mandatory District Compactness on Partisan Gerrymanders, 17 Pol. Geography 989, 10001006 (1998) (explaining that compactness standards help Republicans because Democrats are more likely to live in high density regions).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The challenge in finding a manageable standard for assessing burdens on representational rights has long been recognized.  See Lowenstein &amp; Steinberg, The Quest for Legislative Districting in the Public Interest: Elusive or Illusory? 33 UCLA L. Rev. 1, 74 (1985) ([W]hat matters to us, and what we think matters to almost all Americans when district lines are drawn, is how the fortunes of the parties and the policies the parties stand for are affected.  When such things are at stake there is no neutrality.  There is only political contest).  The dearth of helpful historical guidance must, in part, cause this uncertainty.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

    There are, then, weighty arguments for holding cases like these to be nonjusticiable; and those arguments may prevail in the long run.  In my view, however, the arguments are not so compelling that they require us now to bar all future claims of injury from a partisan gerrymander.  It is not in our tradition to foreclose the judicial process from the attempt to define standards and remedies where it is alleged that a constitutional right is burdened or denied.  Nor is it alien to the Judiciary to draw or approve election district lines.  Courts, after all, already do so in many instances.  A determination by the Court to deny all hopes of intervention could erode confidence in the courts as much as would a premature decision to intervene.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Our willingness to enter the political thicket of the apportionment process with respect to one-person, one-vote claims makes it particularly difficult to justify a categorical refusal to entertain claims against this other type of gerrymandering.  The pluralitys conclusion that absent an easily administrable standard,

				Even putting

				 to the sideand so assuming that the existence of a workable standard for measuring a gerrymanders burden on representational rights distinguishes one-person, one-vote claims from partisan gerrymandering claims for justiciability purposesI would still reject the pluralitys conclusions as to nonjusticiability.  Relying on the distinction between a claim having or not having a workable standard of that sort involves a difficult proof: proof of a categorical negative.  That is, the different treatment of claims otherwise so alike hinges entirely on proof that no standard could exist.  This is a difficult proposition to establish, for proving a negative is a challenge in any context.

				That no such standard has emerged in this case should not be taken to prove that none will emerge in the future.  Where important rights are involved, the impossibility of full analytical satisfaction is reason to err on the side of caution.  Allegations of unconstitutional bias in apportionment are most serious claims, for we have long believed that the right to vote is one of those political processes ordinarily to be relied upon to protect minorities.

If a State passed an enactment that declared All future apportionment shall be drawn so as most to burden Party Xs rights to fair and effective representation, though still in accord with one-person, one-vote principles, we would surely conclude the Constitution had been violated.  If that is so, we should admit the possibility remains that a legislature might attempt to reach the same result without that express directive.  This possibility suggests that in another case a standard might emerge that suitably demonstrates how an apportionments

				, at 3 (dissenting opinion).  Moreover, by the timeline of the law 18 years is rather a short period.  In addition, the rapid evolution of technologies in the apportionment field suggests yet unexplored possibilities.  Computer assisted districting has become so routine and sophisticated that legislatures, experts, and courts can use databases to map electoral districts in a matter of hours, not months.  See,

					Larios
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>

				</em>
				, 305 F. Supp. 2d 1335 (ND Ga. 2004).  Technology is both a threat and a promise.  On the one hand, if courts refuse to entertain any claims of partisan gerrymandering, the temptation to use partisan favoritism in districting in an unconstitutional manner will grow.  On the other hand, these new technologies may produce new methods of analysis that make more evident the precise nature of the burdens gerrymanders impose on the representational rights of voters and parties.  That would facilitate court efforts to identify and remedy the burdens, with judicial intervention limited by the derived standards.

				If suitable standards with which to measure the burden a gerrymander imposes on representational rights did emerge, hindsight would show that the Court prematurely abandoned the field.

				Because, in the case before us, we have no standard by which to measure the burden appellants claim has been imposed on their representational rights, appellants cannot establish that the alleged political classifications burden those same rights.  Failing to show that the alleged classifications are unrelated to the aims of apportionment, appellants evidence at best demonstrates only that the legislature adopted political classifications.

				The plurality suggests there is no place for the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> in this area.  See

				, at 25.  The implication is that under the

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> analysis.  The inquiry is not whether political classifications were used.  The inquiry instead is whether political classifications were used to burden a groups representational rights.  If a court were to find that a State did impose burdens and restrictions on groups or persons by reason of their views, there would likely be a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> violation, unless the State shows some compelling interest. Of course, all this depends first on courts having available a manageable standard by which to measure the effect of the apportionment and so to conclude that the State did impose a burden or restriction on the rights of a partys voters.

				Where it is alleged that a gerrymander had the purpose and effect of imposing burdens on a disfavored party and its voters, the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> may offer a sounder and more prudential basis for intervention than does the Equal Protection Clause.  The equal protection analysis puts its emphasis on the permissibility of an enactments classifications.  This works where race is involved since classifying by race is almost never permissible.  It presents a more complicated question when the inquiry is whether a generally permissible classification has been used for an impermissible purpose.  That question can only be answered in the affirmative by the subsidiary showing that the classification as applied imposes unlawful burdens.  The 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> analysis concentrates on whether the legislation burdens the representational rights of the complaining partys voters for reasons of ideology, beliefs, or political association.

				Finally, I do not understand the plurality to conclude that partisan gerrymandering that disfavors one party is permissible.  Indeed, the Court seems to acknowledge it is not.  See 
				<em>

				</em>
				, at 23 (We do not disagree with [the] judgment that partisan gerrymanders [are incompatible] with democratic principles);

				<em>

				 policy, but simply arbitrary and capricious action.  
				<em>
					Baker
				</em>
				, 369 U. S., at 226.  That said, courts must be cautious about adopting a standard that turns on whether the partisan interests in the redistricting process were excessive.  Excessiveness is not easily determined.  Consider these apportionment schemes: In one State, Party X controls the apportionment process and draws the lines so it captures every congressional seat.  In three other States, Party Y controls the apportionment process.  It is not so blatant or egregious, but proceeds by a more subtle effort, capturing less than all the seats in each State.  Still, the total effect of Party Ys effort is to capture more new seats than Party X captured.  Party Xs gerrymander was more egregious.  Party Ys gerrymander was more subtle.  In my view, however, each is culpable.

				The ordered working of our Republic, and of the democratic process, depends on a sense of decorum and restraint in all branches of government, and in the citizenry itself.  Here, one has the sense that legislative restraint was abandoned.  That should not be thought to serve the interests of our political order.  Nor should it be thought to serve our interest in demonstrating to the world how democracy works.  Whether spoken with concern or pride, it is unfortunate that our legislators have reached the point of declaring that, when it comes to apportionment,  We are in the business of rigging elections.   J.

				A decision ordering the correction of all election district lines drawn for partisan reasons would commit federal and state courts to unprecedented intervention in the American political process.  The Court is correct to refrain from directing this substantial intrusion into the Nations political life.  While agreeing with the plurality that the complaint the appellants filed in the District Court must be dismissed, and while understanding that great caution is necessary when approaching this subject, I would not foreclose all possibility of judicial relief if some limited and precise rationale were found to correct an established violation of the Constitution in some redistricting cases.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				When presented with a claim of injury from partisan gerrymandering, courts confront two obstacles.  First is the lack of comprehensive and neutral principles for drawing electoral boundaries.  No substantive definition of fairness in districting seems to command general assent.  Second is the absence of rules to limit and confine judicial intervention.  With uncertain limits, intervening courtseven when proceeding with best intentionswould risk assuming political, not legal, responsibility for a process that often produces ill will and distrust.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				That courts can grant relief in districting cases where race is involved does not answer our need for fairness principles here.  Those controversies implicate a different inquiry.  They involve sorting permissible classifications in the redistricting context from impermissible ones.  Race is an impermissible classification.  See 
				<em>

				A determination that a gerrymander violates the law must rest on something more than the conclusion that political classifications were applied.  It must rest instead on a conclusion that the classifications, though generally permissible, were applied in an invidious manner or in a way unrelated to any legitimate legislative objective.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">565</a>568 (1964)
.  At first it might seem that courts could determine, by the exercise of their own judgment, whether political classifications are related to this object or instead burden representational rights.  The lack, however, of any agreed upon model of fair and effective representation makes this analysis difficult to pursue.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The second obstaclethe absence of rules to confine judicial interventionis related to the first.  Because there are yet no agreed upon substantive principles of fairness in districting, we have no basis on which to define clear, manageable, and politically neutral standards for measuring the particular burden a given partisan classification imposes on representational rights.  Suitable standards for measuring this burden, however, are critical to our intervention.  Absent sure guidance, the results from one gerrymandering case to the next would likely be disparate and inconsistent.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In this case, we have not overcome these obstacles to determining that the challenged districting violated appellants rights.  The fairness principle appellants propose is that a majority of voters in the Commonwealth should be able to elect a majority of the Commonwealths congressional delegation.  There is no authority for this precept.  Even if the novelty of the proposed principle were accompanied by a convincing rationale for its adoption, there is no obvious way to draw a satisfactory standard from it for measuring an alleged burden on representational rights.  The plurality demonstrates the shortcomings of the other standards that have been considered to date.  See 
				<em>

				</em>
				, at Parts III and IV (demonstrating that the standards proposed in

, by the parties before us, and by our dissenting colleagues are either unmanageable or inconsistent with precedent, or both).  I would add two comments to the pluralitys analysis.  The first is that the parties have not shown us, and I have not been able to discover, helpful discussions on the principles of fair districting discussed in the annals of parliamentary or legislative bodies.  Our attention has not been drawn to statements of principled, well-accepted rules of fairness that should govern districting, or to helpful formulations of the legislators duty in drawing district lines.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, even those criteria that might seem promising at the outset (
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, contiguity and compactness) are not altogether sound as independent judicial standards for measuring a burden on representational rights.  They cannot promise political neutrality when used as the basis for relief.  Instead, it seems, a decision under these standards would unavoidably have significant political effect, whether intended or not.  For example, if we were to demand that congressional districts take a particular shape, we could not assure the parties that this criterion, neutral enough on its face, would not in fact benefit one political party over another.  See 
				<em>
					Gaffney
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 753 (District lines are rarely neutral phenomena.  They can well determine what district will be predominantly Democratic or predominantly Republican, or make a close race likely); see also R. Bork, The Tempting of America: The Political Seduction of the Law 8889 (1990) (documenting the authors service as a special master responsible for redistricting Connecticut and noting that his final plan so benefited the Democratic Party, albeit unintentionally, that the party chairman personally congratulated him); M. Altman, Modeling the Effect of Mandatory District Compactness on Partisan Gerrymanders, 17 Pol. Geography 989, 10001006 (1998) (explaining that compactness standards help Republicans because Democrats are more likely to live in high density regions).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The challenge in finding a manageable standard for assessing burdens on representational rights has long been recognized.  See Lowenstein &amp; Steinberg, The Quest for Legislative Districting in the Public Interest: Elusive or Illusory? 33 UCLA L. Rev. 1, 74 (1985) ([W]hat matters to us, and what we think matters to almost all Americans when district lines are drawn, is how the fortunes of the parties and the policies the parties stand for are affected.  When such things are at stake there is no neutrality.  There is only political contest).  The dearth of helpful historical guidance must, in part, cause this uncertainty.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

    There are, then, weighty arguments for holding cases like these to be nonjusticiable; and those arguments may prevail in the long run.  In my view, however, the arguments are not so compelling that they require us now to bar all future claims of injury from a partisan gerrymander.  It is not in our tradition to foreclose the judicial process from the attempt to define standards and remedies where it is alleged that a constitutional right is burdened or denied.  Nor is it alien to the Judiciary to draw or approve election district lines.  Courts, after all, already do so in many instances.  A determination by the Court to deny all hopes of intervention could erode confidence in the courts as much as would a premature decision to intervene.

				Our willingness to enter the political thicket of the apportionment process with respect to one-person, one-vote claims makes it particularly difficult to justify a categorical refusal to entertain claims against this other type of gerrymandering.  The pluralitys conclusion that absent an easily administrable standard,

				Even putting 
				<em>
					Baker
				</em>
				 to the sideand so assuming that the existence of a workable standard for measuring a gerrymanders burden on representational rights distinguishes one-person, one-vote claims from partisan gerrymandering claims for justiciability purposesI would still reject the pluralitys conclusions as to nonjusticiability.  Relying on the distinction between a claim having or not having a workable standard of that sort involves a difficult proof: proof of a categorical negative.  That is, the different treatment of claims otherwise so alike hinges entirely on proof that no standard could exist.  This is a difficult proposition to establish, for proving a negative is a challenge in any context.

				That no such standard has emerged in this case should not be taken to prove that none will emerge in the future.  Where important rights are involved, the impossibility of full analytical satisfaction is reason to err on the side of caution.  Allegations of unconstitutional bias in apportionment are most serious claims, for we have long believed that the right to vote is one of those political processes ordinarily to be relied upon to protect minorities.

.  If a State passed an enactment that declared All future apportionment shall be drawn so as most to burden Party Xs rights to fair and effective representation, though still in accord with one-person, one-vote principles, we would surely conclude the Constitution had been violated.  If that is so, we should admit the possibility remains that a legislature might attempt to reach the same result without that express directive.  This possibility suggests that in another case a standard might emerge that suitably demonstrates how an apportionments 
				<em>

				 incorporation of partisan classifications burdens rights of fair and effective representation (and so establishes the classification is unrelated to the aims of apportionment and thus is used in an impermissible fashion).

				The plurality says that 18 years, in effect, prove the negative.

				, at 37 (Eighteen years of essentially pointless litigation have persuaded us).  As 
				<span class="smallcaps">

				<em>

				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>

				</em>
				, which formulated a single, apparently insuperable standard.  See 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, at 3 (dissenting opinion).  Moreover, by the timeline of the law 18 years is rather a short period.  In addition, the rapid evolution of technologies in the apportionment field suggests yet unexplored possibilities.  Computer assisted districting has become so routine and sophisticated that legislatures, experts, and courts can use databases to map electoral districts in a matter of hours, not months.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Larios
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Cox
				</em>
				, 305 F. Supp. 2d 1335 (ND Ga. 2004).  Technology is both a threat and a promise.  On the one hand, if courts refuse to entertain any claims of partisan gerrymandering, the temptation to use partisan favoritism in districting in an unconstitutional manner will grow.  On the other hand, these new technologies may produce new methods of analysis that make more evident the precise nature of the burdens gerrymanders impose on the representational rights of voters and parties.  That would facilitate court efforts to identify and remedy the burdens, with judicial intervention limited by the derived standards.

				If suitable standards with which to measure the burden a gerrymander imposes on representational rights did emerge, hindsight would show that the Court prematurely abandoned the field.  That is a risk the Court should not take.  Instead, we should adjudicate only what is in the papers before us.  See

				Because, in the case before us, we have no standard by which to measure the burden appellants claim has been imposed on their representational rights, appellants cannot establish that the alleged political classifications burden those same rights.  Failing to show that the alleged classifications are unrelated to the aims of apportionment, appellants evidence at best demonstrates only that the legislature adopted political classifications.

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> concerns arise where a State enacts a law that has the purpose and effect of subjecting a group of voters or their party to disfavored treatment by reason of their views.

				The plurality suggests there is no place for the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> in this area.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 25.  The implication is that under the

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> analysis.  The inquiry is not whether political classifications were used.  The inquiry instead is whether political classifications were used to burden a groups representational rights.  If a court were to find that a State did impose burdens and restrictions on groups or persons by reason of their views, there would likely be a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> violation, unless the State shows some compelling interest. Of course, all this depends first on courts having available a manageable standard by which to measure the effect of the apportionment and so to conclude that the State did impose a burden or restriction on the rights of a partys voters.

				Where it is alleged that a gerrymander had the purpose and effect of imposing burdens on a disfavored party and its voters, the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> may offer a sounder and more prudential basis for intervention than does the Equal Protection Clause.  The equal protection analysis puts its emphasis on the permissibility of an enactments classifications.  This works where race is involved since classifying by race is almost never permissible.  It presents a more complicated question when the inquiry is whether a generally permissible classification has been used for an impermissible purpose.  That question can only be answered in the affirmative by the subsidiary showing that the classification as applied imposes unlawful burdens.  The 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> analysis concentrates on whether the legislation burdens the representational rights of the complaining partys voters for reasons of ideology, beliefs, or political association.

				Finally, I do not understand the plurality to conclude that partisan gerrymandering that disfavors one party is permissible.  Indeed, the Court seems to acknowledge it is not.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 23 (We do not disagree with [the] judgment that partisan gerrymanders [are incompatible] with democratic principles); 
				<em>

				<em>
					excessive
				</em>
				 injection of politics [in districting] is 
				<em>

				<em>
					no
				</em>
				 policy, but simply arbitrary and capricious action.  
				<em>
					Baker
				</em>
				, 369 U. S., at 226.  That said, courts must be cautious about adopting a standard that turns on whether the partisan interests in the redistricting process were excessive.  Excessiveness is not easily determined.  Consider these apportionment schemes: In one State, Party X controls the apportionment process and draws the lines so it captures every congressional seat.  In three other States, Party Y controls the apportionment process.  It is not so blatant or egregious, but proceeds by a more subtle effort, capturing less than all the seats in each State.  Still, the total effect of Party Ys effort is to capture more new seats than Party X captured.  Party Xs gerrymander was more egregious.  Party Ys gerrymander was more subtle.  In my view, however, each is culpable.

				The ordered working of our Republic, and of the democratic process, depends on a sense of decorum and restraint in all branches of government, and in the citizenry itself.  Here, one has the sense that legislative restraint was abandoned.  That should not be thought to serve the interests of our political order.  Nor should it be thought to serve our interest in demonstrating to the world how democracy works.  Whether spoken with concern or pride, it is unfortunate that our legislators have reached the point of declaring that, when it comes to apportionment,  We are in the business of rigging elections.   J.

				Still, the Courts own responsibilities require that we refrain from intervention in this instance.

If workable standards do emerge to measure these burdens, however, courts should be prepared to order relief.  With these observations, I join the judgment of the plurality.

				A decision ordering the correction of all election district lines drawn for partisan reasons would commit federal and state courts to unprecedented intervention in the American political process.  The Court is correct to refrain from directing this substantial intrusion into the Nations political life.  While agreeing with the plurality that the complaint the appellants filed in the District Court must be dismissed, and while understanding that great caution is necessary when approaching this subject, I would not foreclose all possibility of judicial relief if some limited and precise rationale were found to correct an established violation of the Constitution in some redistricting cases.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				When presented with a claim of injury from partisan gerrymandering, courts confront two obstacles.  First is the lack of comprehensive and neutral principles for drawing electoral boundaries.  No substantive definition of fairness in districting seems to command general assent.  Second is the absence of rules to limit and confine judicial intervention.  With uncertain limits, intervening courtseven when proceeding with best intentionswould risk assuming political, not legal, responsibility for a process that often produces ill will and distrust.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				That courts can grant relief in districting cases where race is involved does not answer our need for fairness principles here.  Those controversies implicate a different inquiry.  They involve sorting permissible classifications in the redistricting context from impermissible ones.  Race is an impermissible classification.  See 
				<em>

				A determination that a gerrymander violates the law must rest on something more than the conclusion that political classifications were applied.  It must rest instead on a conclusion that the classifications, though generally permissible, were applied in an invidious manner or in a way unrelated to any legitimate legislative objective.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">565</a>568 (1964)
.  At first it might seem that courts could determine, by the exercise of their own judgment, whether political classifications are related to this object or instead burden representational rights.  The lack, however, of any agreed upon model of fair and effective representation makes this analysis difficult to pursue.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The second obstaclethe absence of rules to confine judicial interventionis related to the first.  Because there are yet no agreed upon substantive principles of fairness in districting, we have no basis on which to define clear, manageable, and politically neutral standards for measuring the particular burden a given partisan classification imposes on representational rights.  Suitable standards for measuring this burden, however, are critical to our intervention.  Absent sure guidance, the results from one gerrymandering case to the next would likely be disparate and inconsistent.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In this case, we have not overcome these obstacles to determining that the challenged districting violated appellants rights.  The fairness principle appellants propose is that a majority of voters in the Commonwealth should be able to elect a majority of the Commonwealths congressional delegation.  There is no authority for this precept.  Even if the novelty of the proposed principle were accompanied by a convincing rationale for its adoption, there is no obvious way to draw a satisfactory standard from it for measuring an alleged burden on representational rights.  The plurality demonstrates the shortcomings of the other standards that have been considered to date.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at Parts III and IV (demonstrating that the standards proposed in 
				<em>
					Davis

, by the parties before us, and by our dissenting colleagues are either unmanageable or inconsistent with precedent, or both).  I would add two comments to the pluralitys analysis.  The first is that the parties have not shown us, and I have not been able to discover, helpful discussions on the principles of fair districting discussed in the annals of parliamentary or legislative bodies.  Our attention has not been drawn to statements of principled, well-accepted rules of fairness that should govern districting, or to helpful formulations of the legislators duty in drawing district lines.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, even those criteria that might seem promising at the outset (
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, contiguity and compactness) are not altogether sound as independent judicial standards for measuring a burden on representational rights.  They cannot promise political neutrality when used as the basis for relief.  Instead, it seems, a decision under these standards would unavoidably have significant political effect, whether intended or not.  For example, if we were to demand that congressional districts take a particular shape, we could not assure the parties that this criterion, neutral enough on its face, would not in fact benefit one political party over another.  See 
				<em>
					Gaffney
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 753 (District lines are rarely neutral phenomena.  They can well determine what district will be predominantly Democratic or predominantly Republican, or make a close race likely); see also R. Bork, The Tempting of America: The Political Seduction of the Law 8889 (1990) (documenting the authors service as a special master responsible for redistricting Connecticut and noting that his final plan so benefited the Democratic Party, albeit unintentionally, that the party chairman personally congratulated him); M. Altman, Modeling the Effect of Mandatory District Compactness on Partisan Gerrymanders, 17 Pol. Geography 989, 10001006 (1998) (explaining that compactness standards help Republicans because Democrats are more likely to live in high density regions).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The challenge in finding a manageable standard for assessing burdens on representational rights has long been recognized.  See Lowenstein &amp; Steinberg, The Quest for Legislative Districting in the Public Interest: Elusive or Illusory? 33 UCLA L. Rev. 1, 74 (1985) ([W]hat matters to us, and what we think matters to almost all Americans when district lines are drawn, is how the fortunes of the parties and the policies the parties stand for are affected.  When such things are at stake there is no neutrality.  There is only political contest).  The dearth of helpful historical guidance must, in part, cause this uncertainty.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

    There are, then, weighty arguments for holding cases like these to be nonjusticiable; and those arguments may prevail in the long run.  In my view, however, the arguments are not so compelling that they require us now to bar all future claims of injury from a partisan gerrymander.  It is not in our tradition to foreclose the judicial process from the attempt to define standards and remedies where it is alleged that a constitutional right is burdened or denied.  Nor is it alien to the Judiciary to draw or approve election district lines.  Courts, after all, already do so in many instances.  A determination by the Court to deny all hopes of intervention could erode confidence in the courts as much as would a premature decision to intervene.

				Our willingness to enter the political thicket of the apportionment process with respect to one-person, one-vote claims makes it particularly difficult to justify a categorical refusal to entertain claims against this other type of gerrymandering.  The pluralitys conclusion that absent an easily administrable standard,

The Court said this before the more specific standard with which we are now familiar emerged to measure the burden nonequipopulous districting causes on representational rights.  See

S., at 565568 (concluding that [s]ince the achieving of fair and effective representation for all citizens is concededly the basic aim of legislative apportionment a legislatures reliance on other apportionment interests is invalid arbitrary and capricious action if it leads to unequal populations among districts).  The pluralitys response that in 
				<em>
					Baker

				 this Court sat in review only of a nonjusticiability holding is wide of the mark.  See 
				<em>
					ante

				 and

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>, the pluralitys further survey of cases involving different approaches to the justiciability of different claims cannot be thought controlling.  See

				Even putting 
				<em>
					Baker
				</em>
				 to the sideand so assuming that the existence of a workable standard for measuring a gerrymanders burden on representational rights distinguishes one-person, one-vote claims from partisan gerrymandering claims for justiciability purposesI would still reject the pluralitys conclusions as to nonjusticiability.  Relying on the distinction between a claim having or not having a workable standard of that sort involves a difficult proof: proof of a categorical negative.  That is, the different treatment of claims otherwise so alike hinges entirely on proof that no standard could exist.  This is a difficult proposition to establish, for proving a negative is a challenge in any context.

				That no such standard has emerged in this case should not be taken to prove that none will emerge in the future.  Where important rights are involved, the impossibility of full analytical satisfaction is reason to err on the side of caution.  Allegations of unconstitutional bias in apportionment are most serious claims, for we have long believed that the right to vote is one of those political processes ordinarily to be relied upon to protect minorities.

If a State passed an enactment that declared All future apportionment shall be drawn so as most to burden Party Xs rights to fair and effective representation, though still in accord with one-person, one-vote principles, we would surely conclude the Constitution had been violated.  If that is so, we should admit the possibility remains that a legislature might attempt to reach the same result without that express directive.  This possibility suggests that in another case a standard might emerge that suitably demonstrates how an apportionments 
				<em>

				<span class="smallcaps">

				<em>

				, which formulated a single, apparently insuperable standard.  See 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, at 3 (dissenting opinion).  Moreover, by the timeline of the law 18 years is rather a short period.  In addition, the rapid evolution of technologies in the apportionment field suggests yet unexplored possibilities.  Computer assisted districting has become so routine and sophisticated that legislatures, experts, and courts can use databases to map electoral districts in a matter of hours, not months.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Larios
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Cox
				</em>
				, 305 F. Supp. 2d 1335 (ND Ga. 2004).  Technology is both a threat and a promise.  On the one hand, if courts refuse to entertain any claims of partisan gerrymandering, the temptation to use partisan favoritism in districting in an unconstitutional manner will grow.  On the other hand, these new technologies may produce new methods of analysis that make more evident the precise nature of the burdens gerrymanders impose on the representational rights of voters and parties.  That would facilitate court efforts to identify and remedy the burdens, with judicial intervention limited by the derived standards.

				If suitable standards with which to measure the burden a gerrymander imposes on representational rights did emerge, hindsight would show that the Court prematurely abandoned the field.

				Because, in the case before us, we have no standard by which to measure the burden appellants claim has been imposed on their representational rights, appellants cannot establish that the alleged political classifications burden those same rights.

				The plurality suggests there is no place for the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> in this area.  See

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> analysis.  The inquiry is not whether political classifications were used.  The inquiry instead is whether political classifications were used to burden a groups representational rights.  If a court were to find that a State did impose burdens and restrictions on groups or persons by reason of their views, there would likely be a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> violation, unless the State shows some compelling interest. Of course, all this depends first on courts having available a manageable standard by which to measure the effect of the apportionment and so to conclude that the State did impose a burden or restriction on the rights of a partys voters.

				Where it is alleged that a gerrymander had the purpose and effect of imposing burdens on a disfavored party and its voters, the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> may offer a sounder and more prudential basis for intervention than does the Equal Protection Clause.  The equal protection analysis puts its emphasis on the permissibility of an enactments classifications.  This works where race is involved since classifying by race is almost never permissible.  It presents a more complicated question when the inquiry is whether a generally permissible classification has been used for an impermissible purpose.  That question can only be answered in the affirmative by the subsidiary showing that the classification as applied imposes unlawful burdens.  The 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> analysis concentrates on whether the legislation burdens the representational rights of the complaining partys voters for reasons of ideology, beliefs, or political association.

				Finally, I do not understand the plurality to conclude that partisan gerrymandering that disfavors one party is permissible.  Indeed, the Court seems to acknowledge it is not.  See 
				<em>

				</em>
				, at 23 (We do not disagree with [the] judgment that partisan gerrymanders [are incompatible] with democratic principles);

				 policy, but simply arbitrary and capricious action.  
				<em>
					Baker
				</em>
				, 369 U. S., at 226.  That said, courts must be cautious about adopting a standard that turns on whether the partisan interests in the redistricting process were excessive.  Excessiveness is not easily determined.  Consider these apportionment schemes: In one State, Party X controls the apportionment process and draws the lines so it captures every congressional seat.  In three other States, Party Y controls the apportionment process.  It is not so blatant or egregious, but proceeds by a more subtle effort, capturing less than all the seats in each State.  Still, the total effect of Party Ys effort is to capture more new seats than Party X captured.  Party Xs gerrymander was more egregious.  Party Ys gerrymander was more subtle.  In my view, however, each is culpable.

				The ordered working of our Republic, and of the democratic process, depends on a sense of decorum and restraint in all branches of government, and in the citizenry itself.  Here, one has the sense that legislative restraint was abandoned.  That should not be thought to serve the interests of our political order.  Nor should it be thought to serve our interest in demonstrating to the world how democracy works.  Whether spoken with concern or pride, it is unfortunate that our legislators have reached the point of declaring that, when it comes to apportionment,  We are in the business of rigging elections.   J.

If workable standards do emerge to measure these burdens, however, courts should be prepared to order relief.  With these observations, I join the judgment of the plurality.

				A decision ordering the correction of all election district lines drawn for partisan reasons would commit federal and state courts to unprecedented intervention in the American political process.  The Court is correct to refrain from directing this substantial intrusion into the Nations political life.  While agreeing with the plurality that the complaint the appellants filed in the District Court must be dismissed, and while understanding that great caution is necessary when approaching this subject, I would not foreclose all possibility of judicial relief if some limited and precise rationale were found to correct an established violation of the Constitution in some redistricting cases.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				When presented with a claim of injury from partisan gerrymandering, courts confront two obstacles.  First is the lack of comprehensive and neutral principles for drawing electoral boundaries.  No substantive definition of fairness in districting seems to command general assent.  Second is the absence of rules to limit and confine judicial intervention.  With uncertain limits, intervening courtseven when proceeding with best intentionswould risk assuming political, not legal, responsibility for a process that often produces ill will and distrust.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				That courts can grant relief in districting cases where race is involved does not answer our need for fairness principles here.  Those controversies implicate a different inquiry.  They involve sorting permissible classifications in the redistricting context from impermissible ones.  Race is an impermissible classification.  See 
				<em>

				A determination that a gerrymander violates the law must rest on something more than the conclusion that political classifications were applied.  It must rest instead on a conclusion that the classifications, though generally permissible, were applied in an invidious manner or in a way unrelated to any legitimate legislative objective.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">565</a>568 (1964)
.  At first it might seem that courts could determine, by the exercise of their own judgment, whether political classifications are related to this object or instead burden representational rights.  The lack, however, of any agreed upon model of fair and effective representation makes this analysis difficult to pursue.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The second obstaclethe absence of rules to confine judicial interventionis related to the first.  Because there are yet no agreed upon substantive principles of fairness in districting, we have no basis on which to define clear, manageable, and politically neutral standards for measuring the particular burden a given partisan classification imposes on representational rights.  Suitable standards for measuring this burden, however, are critical to our intervention.  Absent sure guidance, the results from one gerrymandering case to the next would likely be disparate and inconsistent.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In this case, we have not overcome these obstacles to determining that the challenged districting violated appellants rights.  The fairness principle appellants propose is that a majority of voters in the Commonwealth should be able to elect a majority of the Commonwealths congressional delegation.  There is no authority for this precept.  Even if the novelty of the proposed principle were accompanied by a convincing rationale for its adoption, there is no obvious way to draw a satisfactory standard from it for measuring an alleged burden on representational rights.  The plurality demonstrates the shortcomings of the other standards that have been considered to date.  See 
				<em>

				</em>
				, at Parts III and IV (demonstrating that the standards proposed in 
				<em>

, by the parties before us, and by our dissenting colleagues are either unmanageable or inconsistent with precedent, or both).  I would add two comments to the pluralitys analysis.  The first is that the parties have not shown us, and I have not been able to discover, helpful discussions on the principles of fair districting discussed in the annals of parliamentary or legislative bodies.  Our attention has not been drawn to statements of principled, well-accepted rules of fairness that should govern districting, or to helpful formulations of the legislators duty in drawing district lines.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, even those criteria that might seem promising at the outset (
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, contiguity and compactness) are not altogether sound as independent judicial standards for measuring a burden on representational rights.  They cannot promise political neutrality when used as the basis for relief.  Instead, it seems, a decision under these standards would unavoidably have significant political effect, whether intended or not.  For example, if we were to demand that congressional districts take a particular shape, we could not assure the parties that this criterion, neutral enough on its face, would not in fact benefit one political party over another.  See 
				<em>
					Gaffney
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 753 (District lines are rarely neutral phenomena.  They can well determine what district will be predominantly Democratic or predominantly Republican, or make a close race likely); see also R. Bork, The Tempting of America: The Political Seduction of the Law 8889 (1990) (documenting the authors service as a special master responsible for redistricting Connecticut and noting that his final plan so benefited the Democratic Party, albeit unintentionally, that the party chairman personally congratulated him); M. Altman, Modeling the Effect of Mandatory District Compactness on Partisan Gerrymanders, 17 Pol. Geography 989, 10001006 (1998) (explaining that compactness standards help Republicans because Democrats are more likely to live in high density regions).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The challenge in finding a manageable standard for assessing burdens on representational rights has long been recognized.  See Lowenstein &amp; Steinberg, The Quest for Legislative Districting in the Public Interest: Elusive or Illusory? 33 UCLA L. Rev. 1, 74 (1985) ([W]hat matters to us, and what we think matters to almost all Americans when district lines are drawn, is how the fortunes of the parties and the policies the parties stand for are affected.  When such things are at stake there is no neutrality.  There is only political contest).  The dearth of helpful historical guidance must, in part, cause this uncertainty.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

    There are, then, weighty arguments for holding cases like these to be nonjusticiable; and those arguments may prevail in the long run.  In my view, however, the arguments are not so compelling that they require us now to bar all future claims of injury from a partisan gerrymander.  It is not in our tradition to foreclose the judicial process from the attempt to define standards and remedies where it is alleged that a constitutional right is burdened or denied.  Nor is it alien to the Judiciary to draw or approve election district lines.  Courts, after all, already do so in many instances.  A determination by the Court to deny all hopes of intervention could erode confidence in the courts as much as would a premature decision to intervene.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Our willingness to enter the political thicket of the apportionment process with respect to one-person, one-vote claims makes it particularly difficult to justify a categorical refusal to entertain claims against this other type of gerrymandering.  The pluralitys conclusion that absent an easily administrable standard,

The pluralitys response that in

				 and

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>, the pluralitys further survey of cases involving different approaches to the justiciability of different claims cannot be thought controlling.  See

				Even putting 
				<em>
					Baker
				</em>
				 to the sideand so assuming that the existence of a workable standard for measuring a gerrymanders burden on representational rights distinguishes one-person, one-vote claims from partisan gerrymandering claims for justiciability purposesI would still reject the pluralitys conclusions as to nonjusticiability.  Relying on the distinction between a claim having or not having a workable standard of that sort involves a difficult proof: proof of a categorical negative.  That is, the different treatment of claims otherwise so alike hinges entirely on proof that no standard could exist.  This is a difficult proposition to establish, for proving a negative is a challenge in any context.

				That no such standard has emerged in this case should not be taken to prove that none will emerge in the future.  Where important rights are involved, the impossibility of full analytical satisfaction is reason to err on the side of caution.  Allegations of unconstitutional bias in apportionment are most serious claims, for we have long believed that the right to vote is one of those political processes ordinarily to be relied upon to protect minorities.

If a State passed an enactment that declared All future apportionment shall be drawn so as most to burden Party Xs rights to fair and effective representation, though still in accord with one-person, one-vote principles, we would surely conclude the Constitution had been violated.  If that is so, we should admit the possibility remains that a legislature might attempt to reach the same result without that express directive.  This possibility suggests that in another case a standard might emerge that suitably demonstrates how an apportionments 
				<em>

				<span class="smallcaps">

				<em>

				<em>

				</em>
				, at 3 (dissenting opinion).  Moreover, by the timeline of the law 18 years is rather a short period.  In addition, the rapid evolution of technologies in the apportionment field suggests yet unexplored possibilities.  Computer assisted districting has become so routine and sophisticated that legislatures, experts, and courts can use databases to map electoral districts in a matter of hours, not months.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Larios
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Cox
				</em>
				, 305 F. Supp. 2d 1335 (ND Ga. 2004).  Technology is both a threat and a promise.  On the one hand, if courts refuse to entertain any claims of partisan gerrymandering, the temptation to use partisan favoritism in districting in an unconstitutional manner will grow.  On the other hand, these new technologies may produce new methods of analysis that make more evident the precise nature of the burdens gerrymanders impose on the representational rights of voters and parties.  That would facilitate court efforts to identify and remedy the burdens, with judicial intervention limited by the derived standards.

				If suitable standards with which to measure the burden a gerrymander imposes on representational rights did emerge, hindsight would show that the Court prematurely abandoned the field.  That is a risk the Court should not take.  Instead, we should adjudicate only what is in the papers before us.  See

				Because, in the case before us, we have no standard by which to measure the burden appellants claim has been imposed on their representational rights, appellants cannot establish that the alleged political classifications burden those same rights.  Failing to show that the alleged classifications are unrelated to the aims of apportionment, appellants evidence at best demonstrates only that the legislature adopted political classifications.

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> in this area.  See

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> analysis.  The inquiry is not whether political classifications were used.  The inquiry instead is whether political classifications were used to burden a groups representational rights.  If a court were to find that a State did impose burdens and restrictions on groups or persons by reason of their views, there would likely be a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> violation, unless the State shows some compelling interest. Of course, all this depends first on courts having available a manageable standard by which to measure the effect of the apportionment and so to conclude that the State did impose a burden or restriction on the rights of a partys voters.

				Where it is alleged that a gerrymander had the purpose and effect of imposing burdens on a disfavored party and its voters, the

The equal protection analysis puts its emphasis on the permissibility of an enactments classifications.  This works where race is involved since classifying by race is almost never permissible.  It presents a more complicated question when the inquiry is whether a generally permissible classification has been used for an impermissible purpose.  That question can only be answered in the affirmative by the subsidiary showing that the classification as applied imposes unlawful burdens.  The 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> analysis concentrates on whether the legislation burdens the representational rights of the complaining partys voters for reasons of ideology, beliefs, or political association.

				Finally, I do not understand the plurality to conclude that partisan gerrymandering that disfavors one party is permissible.  Indeed, the Court seems to acknowledge it is not.  See 
				<em>

				</em>
				, at 23 (We do not disagree with [the] judgment that partisan gerrymanders [are incompatible] with democratic principles); 
				<em>

				 policy, but simply arbitrary and capricious action.  
				<em>
					Baker
				</em>
				, 369 U. S., at 226.  That said, courts must be cautious about adopting a standard that turns on whether the partisan interests in the redistricting process were excessive.  Excessiveness is not easily determined.  Consider these apportionment schemes: In one State, Party X controls the apportionment process and draws the lines so it captures every congressional seat.  In three other States, Party Y controls the apportionment process.  It is not so blatant or egregious, but proceeds by a more subtle effort, capturing less than all the seats in each State.  Still, the total effect of Party Ys effort is to capture more new seats than Party X captured.  Party Xs gerrymander was more egregious.  Party Ys gerrymander was more subtle.  In my view, however, each is culpable.

				The ordered working of our Republic, and of the democratic process, depends on a sense of decorum and restraint in all branches of government, and in the citizenry itself.  Here, one has the sense that legislative restraint was abandoned.  That should not be thought to serve the interests of our political order.  Nor should it be thought to serve our interest in demonstrating to the world how democracy works.  Whether spoken with concern or pride, it is unfortunate that our legislators have reached the point of declaring that, when it comes to apportionment,  We are in the business of rigging elections.   J.

				A decision ordering the correction of all election district lines drawn for partisan reasons would commit federal and state courts to unprecedented intervention in the American political process.  The Court is correct to refrain from directing this substantial intrusion into the Nations political life.  While agreeing with the plurality that the complaint the appellants filed in the District Court must be dismissed, and while understanding that great caution is necessary when approaching this subject, I would not foreclose all possibility of judicial relief if some limited and precise rationale were found to correct an established violation of the Constitution in some redistricting cases.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				When presented with a claim of injury from partisan gerrymandering, courts confront two obstacles.  First is the lack of comprehensive and neutral principles for drawing electoral boundaries.  No substantive definition of fairness in districting seems to command general assent.  Second is the absence of rules to limit and confine judicial intervention.  With uncertain limits, intervening courtseven when proceeding with best intentionswould risk assuming political, not legal, responsibility for a process that often produces ill will and distrust.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				That courts can grant relief in districting cases where race is involved does not answer our need for fairness principles here.  Those controversies implicate a different inquiry.  They involve sorting permissible classifications in the redistricting context from impermissible ones.  Race is an impermissible classification.  See 
				<em>

				A determination that a gerrymander violates the law must rest on something more than the conclusion that political classifications were applied.  It must rest instead on a conclusion that the classifications, though generally permissible, were applied in an invidious manner or in a way unrelated to any legitimate legislative objective.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">565</a>568 (1964)
.  At first it might seem that courts could determine, by the exercise of their own judgment, whether political classifications are related to this object or instead burden representational rights.  The lack, however, of any agreed upon model of fair and effective representation makes this analysis difficult to pursue.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The second obstaclethe absence of rules to confine judicial interventionis related to the first.  Because there are yet no agreed upon substantive principles of fairness in districting, we have no basis on which to define clear, manageable, and politically neutral standards for measuring the particular burden a given partisan classification imposes on representational rights.  Suitable standards for measuring this burden, however, are critical to our intervention.  Absent sure guidance, the results from one gerrymandering case to the next would likely be disparate and inconsistent.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In this case, we have not overcome these obstacles to determining that the challenged districting violated appellants rights.  The fairness principle appellants propose is that a majority of voters in the Commonwealth should be able to elect a majority of the Commonwealths congressional delegation.  There is no authority for this precept.  Even if the novelty of the proposed principle were accompanied by a convincing rationale for its adoption, there is no obvious way to draw a satisfactory standard from it for measuring an alleged burden on representational rights.  The plurality demonstrates the shortcomings of the other standards that have been considered to date.  See 
				<em>

				</em>
				, at Parts III and IV (demonstrating that the standards proposed in

, by the parties before us, and by our dissenting colleagues are either unmanageable or inconsistent with precedent, or both).  I would add two comments to the pluralitys analysis.  The first is that the parties have not shown us, and I have not been able to discover, helpful discussions on the principles of fair districting discussed in the annals of parliamentary or legislative bodies.  Our attention has not been drawn to statements of principled, well-accepted rules of fairness that should govern districting, or to helpful formulations of the legislators duty in drawing district lines.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, even those criteria that might seem promising at the outset (
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, contiguity and compactness) are not altogether sound as independent judicial standards for measuring a burden on representational rights.  They cannot promise political neutrality when used as the basis for relief.  Instead, it seems, a decision under these standards would unavoidably have significant political effect, whether intended or not.  For example, if we were to demand that congressional districts take a particular shape, we could not assure the parties that this criterion, neutral enough on its face, would not in fact benefit one political party over another.  See 
				<em>
					Gaffney
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 753 (District lines are rarely neutral phenomena.  They can well determine what district will be predominantly Democratic or predominantly Republican, or make a close race likely); see also R. Bork, The Tempting of America: The Political Seduction of the Law 8889 (1990) (documenting the authors service as a special master responsible for redistricting Connecticut and noting that his final plan so benefited the Democratic Party, albeit unintentionally, that the party chairman personally congratulated him); M. Altman, Modeling the Effect of Mandatory District Compactness on Partisan Gerrymanders, 17 Pol. Geography 989, 10001006 (1998) (explaining that compactness standards help Republicans because Democrats are more likely to live in high density regions).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The challenge in finding a manageable standard for assessing burdens on representational rights has long been recognized.  See Lowenstein &amp; Steinberg, The Quest for Legislative Districting in the Public Interest: Elusive or Illusory? 33 UCLA L. Rev. 1, 74 (1985) ([W]hat matters to us, and what we think matters to almost all Americans when district lines are drawn, is how the fortunes of the parties and the policies the parties stand for are affected.  When such things are at stake there is no neutrality.  There is only political contest).  The dearth of helpful historical guidance must, in part, cause this uncertainty.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

    There are, then, weighty arguments for holding cases like these to be nonjusticiable; and those arguments may prevail in the long run.  In my view, however, the arguments are not so compelling that they require us now to bar all future claims of injury from a partisan gerrymander.  It is not in our tradition to foreclose the judicial process from the attempt to define standards and remedies where it is alleged that a constitutional right is burdened or denied.  Nor is it alien to the Judiciary to draw or approve election district lines.  Courts, after all, already do so in many instances.  A determination by the Court to deny all hopes of intervention could erode confidence in the courts as much as would a premature decision to intervene.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Our willingness to enter the political thicket of the apportionment process with respect to one-person, one-vote claims makes it particularly difficult to justify a categorical refusal to entertain claims against this other type of gerrymandering.  The pluralitys conclusion that absent an easily administrable standard,

The pluralitys response that in

				<em>
					ante

				</em>
				 and 
				<em>

				</em>
				, which directly address the question of nonjusticiability in the specific context of districting and of asserted violations of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>, the pluralitys further survey of cases involving different approaches to the justiciability of different claims cannot be thought controlling.  See

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Even putting 
				<em>
					Baker
				</em>
				 to the sideand so assuming that the existence of a workable standard for measuring a gerrymanders burden on representational rights distinguishes one-person, one-vote claims from partisan gerrymandering claims for justiciability purposesI would still reject the pluralitys conclusions as to nonjusticiability.  Relying on the distinction between a claim having or not having a workable standard of that sort involves a difficult proof: proof of a categorical negative.  That is, the different treatment of claims otherwise so alike hinges entirely on proof that no standard could exist.  This is a difficult proposition to establish, for proving a negative is a challenge in any context.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				That no such standard has emerged in this case should not be taken to prove that none will emerge in the future.  Where important rights are involved, the impossibility of full analytical satisfaction is reason to err on the side of caution.  Allegations of unconstitutional bias in apportionment are most serious claims, for we have long believed that the right to vote is one of those political processes ordinarily to be relied upon to protect minorities.

.  If a State passed an enactment that declared All future apportionment shall be drawn so as most to burden Party Xs rights to fair and effective representation, though still in accord with one-person, one-vote principles, we would surely conclude the Constitution had been violated.  If that is so, we should admit the possibility remains that a legislature might attempt to reach the same result without that express directive.  This possibility suggests that in another case a standard might emerge that suitably demonstrates how an apportionments 
				<em>
					de facto
				</em>
				 incorporation of partisan classifications burdens rights of fair and effective representation (and so establishes the classification is unrelated to the aims of apportionment and thus is used in an impermissible fashion).

				The plurality says that 18 years, in effect, prove the negative.  
				<em>
					Ante

				, at 37 (Eighteen years of essentially pointless litigation have persuaded us).  As 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter

				<em>
					Davis
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Bandemer
				</em>
				, which formulated a single, apparently insuperable standard.  See 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, at 3 (dissenting opinion).  Moreover, by the timeline of the law 18 years is rather a short period.  In addition, the rapid evolution of technologies in the apportionment field suggests yet unexplored possibilities.  Computer assisted districting has become so routine and sophisticated that legislatures, experts, and courts can use databases to map electoral districts in a matter of hours, not months.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Larios
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Cox
				</em>
				, 305 F. Supp. 2d 1335 (ND Ga. 2004).  Technology is both a threat and a promise.  On the one hand, if courts refuse to entertain any claims of partisan gerrymandering, the temptation to use partisan favoritism in districting in an unconstitutional manner will grow.  On the other hand, these new technologies may produce new methods of analysis that make more evident the precise nature of the burdens gerrymanders impose on the representational rights of voters and parties.  That would facilitate court efforts to identify and remedy the burdens, with judicial intervention limited by the derived standards.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				If suitable standards with which to measure the burden a gerrymander imposes on representational rights did emerge, hindsight would show that the Court prematurely abandoned the field.  That is a risk the Court should not take.  Instead, we should adjudicate only what is in the papers before us.  See 
				<em>

				, 369 U. S., at 331 (Harlan, J., dissenting) (concluding that the malapportionment claim should have been dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted  because [u]ntil it is first decided to what extent [the] right [to apportion] is limited by the Federal Constitution, and whether what [a State] has done or failed to do . . . runs afoul of any such limitation, we need not reach the issues of justiciability or political question ).

				Because, in the case before us, we have no standard by which to measure the burden appellants claim has been imposed on their representational rights, appellants cannot establish that the alleged political classifications burden those same rights.  Failing to show that the alleged classifications are unrelated to the aims of apportionment, appellants evidence at best demonstrates only that the legislature adopted political classifications.

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> concerns arise where a State enacts a law that has the purpose and effect of subjecting a group of voters or their party to disfavored treatment by reason of their views.

				The plurality suggests there is no place for the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> in this area.  See 
				<em>

				, at 25.  The implication is that under the

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> analysis.  The inquiry is not whether political classifications were used.  The inquiry instead is whether political classifications were used to burden a groups representational rights.  If a court were to find that a State did impose burdens and restrictions on groups or persons by reason of their views, there would likely be a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> violation, unless the State shows some compelling interest. Of course, all this depends first on courts having available a manageable standard by which to measure the effect of the apportionment and so to conclude that the State did impose a burden or restriction on the rights of a partys voters.

				Where it is alleged that a gerrymander had the purpose and effect of imposing burdens on a disfavored party and its voters, the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> may offer a sounder and more prudential basis for intervention than does the Equal Protection Clause.  The equal protection analysis puts its emphasis on the permissibility of an enactments classifications.  This works where race is involved since classifying by race is almost never permissible.  It presents a more complicated question when the inquiry is whether a generally permissible classification has been used for an impermissible purpose.  That question can only be answered in the affirmative by the subsidiary showing that the classification as applied imposes unlawful burdens.  The 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> analysis concentrates on whether the legislation burdens the representational rights of the complaining partys voters for reasons of ideology, beliefs, or political association.

				Finally, I do not understand the plurality to conclude that partisan gerrymandering that disfavors one party is permissible.  Indeed, the Court seems to acknowledge it is not.  See

				 policy, but simply arbitrary and capricious action.  
				<em>
					Baker
				</em>
				, 369 U. S., at 226.  That said, courts must be cautious about adopting a standard that turns on whether the partisan interests in the redistricting process were excessive.  Excessiveness is not easily determined.  Consider these apportionment schemes: In one State, Party X controls the apportionment process and draws the lines so it captures every congressional seat.  In three other States, Party Y controls the apportionment process.  It is not so blatant or egregious, but proceeds by a more subtle effort, capturing less than all the seats in each State.  Still, the total effect of Party Ys effort is to capture more new seats than Party X captured.  Party Xs gerrymander was more egregious.  Party Ys gerrymander was more subtle.  In my view, however, each is culpable.

				The ordered working of our Republic, and of the democratic process, depends on a sense of decorum and restraint in all branches of government, and in the citizenry itself.  Here, one has the sense that legislative restraint was abandoned.  That should not be thought to serve the interests of our political order.  Nor should it be thought to serve our interest in demonstrating to the world how democracy works.  Whether spoken with concern or pride, it is unfortunate that our legislators have reached the point of declaring that, when it comes to apportionment,  We are in the business of rigging elections.   J.

If workable standards do emerge to measure these burdens, however, courts should be prepared to order relief.  With these observations, I join the judgment of the plurality.

				The central question presented by this case is whether political gerrymandering claims are justiciable.  Although our reasons for coming to this conclusion differ, five Members of the Court are convinced that the pluralitys answer to that question is erroneous.  Moreover, as is apparent from our separate writings today, we share the view that, even if these appellants are not entitled to prevail, it would be contrary to precedent and profoundly unwise to foreclose all judicial review of similar claims that might be advanced in the future.  That we presently have somewhat differing viewsconcerning both the precedential value of some of our recent cases and the standard that should be applied in future casesshould not obscure the fact that the areas of agreement set forth in the separate opinions are of far greater significance.

				At issue in this case, as the plurality states,

				<em>

				<em>

				Given this clear line of precedents, I should have thought the question of justiciability in cases such as thiswhere a set of plaintiffs argues that a single motivation resulted in a districting scheme with discriminatory effectsto be well settled.  The pluralitys contrary conclusion cannot be squared with our long history of voting rights decisions. Especially perplexing is the pluralitys 
				<em>
					ipse dixit
				</em>
				 distinction of our racial gerrymandering cases.  Notably, the plurality does not argue that the judicially manageable standards that have been used to adjudicate racial gerrymandering claims would not be equally manageable in political gerrymandering cases.  Instead, its distinction of those cases rests on its view that race as a districting criterion is much more rarely encountered than partisanship, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16, and that determining whether racea rare and constitutionally suspect motivedominated a districting decision is quite different from determining whether [such a decision] is so substantially affected by the excess of an ordinary and lawful motive as to [be] invali[d], 
				<em>

				  But those considerations are wholly irrelevant to the issue of justiciability.

				The plurality opinion in 
				<em>

				 dealt with a claim that the Indiana apportionment scheme for state legislative districts discriminated against Democratic voters on a statewide basis.  478 U. S., at 127.  In my judgment, the 
				<em>

				</em>
				 Court was correct to entertain that statewide challenge, because the plaintiffs in that case alleged a group harm that affected members of their party throughout the State.  In the subsequent line of racial gerrymandering cases, however, the Court shifted its focus from statewide challenges and required, as a matter of standing, that plaintiffs stating race-based equal protection claims actually reside in the districts they are challenging.

				<em>
					Hays

				  But that does not end the matter.  Challenges to specific districts, such as those considered in the

Much like the plaintiff-appellees in

				  That requirement applies with full force to districting decisions.  The line that divides a racial or ethnic minority unevenly between school districts can be entirely legitimate if chosen on the basis of neutral factorscounty lines, for example, or a natural boundary such as a river or major thoroughfare.  But if the district lines were chosen for the purpose of limiting the number of minority students in the school, or the number of families holding unpopular religious or political views, that invidious purpose surely would invalidate the district.

				Consistent with that principle, our recent racial gerrymandering cases have examined the shape of the district and the purpose of the districting body to determine whether race, above all other criteria, predominated in the line-drawing process.  We began by holding in 
				<em>
					Shaw I
				</em>
				 that a districting scheme could be so irrational on its face that it [could] be understood only as an effort to segregate voters into separate voting districts because of their race.  509 U. S., at 658.  Then, in 
				<em>
					Miller
				</em>
				, we explained that 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
            <em>
					Shaw I
				</em>
				s irrational-shape test did not treat the bizarreness of a districts lines itself as a constitutional violation; rather, the irregularity of the districts contours in 
				<em>
					Shaw I
				</em>
				 was persuasive circumstantial evidence that race for its own sake, and not other districting principles, was the legislatures dominant and controlling rationale in drawing its district lines.  515 U. S., at 913.  Under the 
				<em>
					Shaw
				</em>
				 cases, then, the use of race as a criterion in redistricting is not 
				<em>
					per se
				</em>
				 impermissible, see

				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/517/899" class="subref" title="subref">517 U. S. 899</a>, but when race is elevated to paramount statuswhen it is the be-all and end-all of the redistricting processthe legislature has gone too far.  Race must not simply have been

				Just as irrational shape can serve as an objective indicator of an impermissible legislative purpose, other objective features of a districting map can save the plan from invalidation.  We have explained that traditional districting principles, which include compactness, contiguity, and respect for political subdivisions, are important not because they are constitutionally required … but because they are objective factors that may serve to defeat a claim that a district has been gerrymandered on racial lines.

				In my view, the same standards should apply to claims of political gerrymandering, for the essence of a gerrymander is the same regardless of whether the group is identified as political or racial.  Gerrymandering always involves the drawing of district boundaries to maximize the voting strength of the dominant political faction and to minimize the strength of one or more groups of opponents.

				The racial gerrymandering cases therefore supply a judicially manageable standard for determining when partisanship, like race, has played too great of a role in the districting process.  Just as race can be a factor in, but cannot dictate the outcome of, the districting process, so too can partisanship be a permissible consideration in drawing district lines, so long as it does not predominate.  If, as plaintiff-appellant Furey has alleged, the predominant motive of the legislators who designed District 6, and the sole justification for its bizarre shape, was a purpose to discriminate against a political minority, that invidious purpose should invalidate the district.

				  Thus, the view that the plurality implicitly embraces todaythat a gerrymander contrived for the sole purpose of disadvantaging a political minority is less objectionable than one seeking to benefit a racial minorityis doubly flawed.  It disregards the obvious distinction between an invidious and a benign purpose, and it mistakenly assumes that race cannot provide a legitimate basis for making political judgments.

				  Because this complaint states a claim under a judicially manage-

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The plurality candidly acknowledges that legislatures can fashion standards to remedy political gerrymandering that are perfectly manageable and, indeed, that the legislatures in Iowa and elsewhere have done so.

				, at 7, n. 4.  If a violation of the Constitution is found, a court could impose a remedy patterned after such a statute.  Thus, the problem, in the pluralitys view, is not that there is no judicially manageable standard to fix an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander, but rather that the Judiciary lacks the ability to determine when a state legislature has violated its duty to govern impartially. 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Quite obviously, however, several standards for identifying impermissible partisan influence are available to judges who have the will to enforce them.  We could hold that every district boundary must have a neutral justification; we could apply Justice Powells three-factor approach in 
				<em>

						 In Colegrove, for example, the Illinois Legislature had drawn the States district lines under the 1901 State Apportionment Act and had not reapportioned in the four ensuing decades, despite census figures indicating great changes in the distribution of the population.  328 U. S., at 569 (Black, J., dissenting).  The populations of Illinois districts in 1945 consequently ranged from 112,000 in the least populous district to 900,000 in the most.  Ibid.  Nonetheless, the Court, per Justice Frankfurter, concluded that due regard for the effective working of our Government revealed this issue to be of a peculiarly political nature and therefore not meet for judicial determination.  Id., at 552.  Fewer than 20 years later, the Court, confronted with a strikingly similar set of factsa Tennessee apportionment plan set by a 1901 statute that had remained virtually unchanged despite dramatic population growthheld, in obvious tension with Colegrove, that the complaint stated a justiciable cause of action.  Baker, 369 U. S., at 192, 197198.  The Court distinguished Colegrove as simply a refusal to exercise equitys powers.  369 U. S., at 235.

						 The plurality opinion seems to assume that the dissenting opinions in Umbehr, 518 U. S., at 686 (Scalia, J.), and Rutan, 497 U. S., at 92 (Scalia, J.), correctly state the lawnamely, that when a practice not expressly prohibited by the text of the Bill of Rights bears the endorsement of a long tradition of open, widespread, and unchallenged use that dates back to the beginning of the Republic, we have no proper basis for striking it down, id., at 95.  Cf. ante, at 4 (tracing the history of political gerrymanders to the beginning of the 18th century).  But [o]ur inquiry does not begin with the judgment of history; [r]ather, inquiry must commence with identification of the constitutional limitations implicated by a challenged governmental practice.  Elrod, 427 U.

						 The plurality explains that it is willing to accep[t] a modest degree of unmanageability where the constitutional command … is clear, but not where the constitutional obligation … is both dubious and severely unmanageable.  Ante, at 1617.

						 The pluralitys reluctance to recognize the justiciability of partisan gerrymanders seems driven in part by a fear that recognizing such claims will give rise to a flood of litigation.  See ante, at 16.  But the list of cases that it cites in its lengthy footnote 6, ante, at 1011, suggests that in the two decades since Bandemer, there has been an average of just three or four partisan gerrymandering cases filed every year.  That volume is obviously trivial when compared, for example, to the amount of litigation that followed our adoption of the one-person, one-vote rule.  See Reynolds v. Sims, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/377/533" class="subref" title="subref">377 U. S. 533</a> (1964)

						 Writing for the Court in Bandemer, Justice White put it well: That the characteristics of the complaining group are not immutable or that the group has not been subject to the same historical stigma may be relevant to the manner in which the case is adjudicated, but these differences do not justify a refusal to entertain such a case.  478 U.

						 The cases that the plurality cites today, ante, at 1012, n. 6, support the conclusion that it would have been wise to endorse the views expressed in Justice Powells dissent in Bandemer, 478 U. S., at 161, and my concurrence in Karcher v. Daggett, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/462/725" class="subref" title="subref">462 U. S. 725</a>,

.  I remain convinced that our opinions correctly interpreted the law.  If that standard were applied to the statewide challenge in this case, a trial of the entire case would be required.  For the purpose of deciding this case, even though I dissented from our decision in Shaw I and remain convinced that it was incorrectly decided, I would give the Shaw cases stare decisis effect in the political gerrymandering context.  Given the Courts illogical disposition of this case, however, in future cases I would feel free to reexamine the standing issue.  I surely would not suggest that a plaintiff would never have standing to litigate a statewide claim.

						 In this sense the partisan gerrymander is the American cousin of the English rotten borough.  In the English system, Members of Parliament were elected from geographic units that remained unchanged despite population changes wrought by the Industrial Revolution.  Because representation was not based on population, vast inequities developed over time in the form of the so-called rotten boroughs.  Old Sarum, for instance, had no human residentsonly a few sheepyet sent the same number of representatives to Parliament as Yorkshire, with nearly a million inhabitants.  R. Zagarri, The Politics of Size: Representation in the United States, 17761850, p. 37 (1987) (footnote omitted).  As a result of this system, many insignificant places returned members, while many important towns did not, and even in large towns the members were often elected by a tiny fraction of the population.  J. Butler, The Passing of the Great Reform Bill 176 (1914).  Meanwhile, [t]he Government bribed the patron or member or both by means of distinctions and offices or by actual cash, and [t]he patron and member bribed the electors in the same way.  Ibid.  The rotten boroughs clearly would violate our familiar one-person, one-vote rule, but they were also troubling because the representative of such a borough owed his primary loyalty to his patron and the government rather than to his constituents (if he had any).  Similarly, in gerrymandered districts, instead of local groups defined by neutral criteria selecting their representatives, it is the architects of the districts who select the constituencies and, in effect, the representatives.

						 In the realm of federal elections, the requirement of governmental neutrality is buttressed by this Courts recognition that the Elections Clause is not  a source of power to dictate electoral outcomes, to favor or disfavor a class of candidates, or to evade important constitutional restraints.   Cook v. Gralike, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/531/510" class="subref" title="subref">531 U. S. 510</a>,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">833</a>834 (1995)
).  And this duty to govern impartially extends to executive and legislative officials alike.  Beginning as early as its first session in 1789, Congress has passed a number of statutes designed to guarantee that Executive Branch employees neutrally carry out their duties.  See Ex parte Curtis, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/106/371" class="subref" title="subref">106 U. S. 371</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">372</a>373 (1882)
.  Some of those laws avoided the danger that the government itself may be made to furnish indirectly the money to defray the expenses of keeping the political party in power that happens to have for the time being the control of the public patronage.  Id., at 375.  It is fundamental that federal employees are expected to enforce the law and execute programs of the Government without bias or favoritism for or against any political party or group or the members thereof.  Civil Service Commn v. Letter Carriers, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/413/548" class="subref" title="subref">413 U. S. 548</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">564</a>565 (1973)

						 In Washington v. Davis, we referred to an earlier challenge to a New York reapportionment statute that had failed because the plaintiffs had not shown that the statute was  the product of a state contrivance to segregate on the basis of race or place of origin.   426 U.

						 I have elsewhere explained my view that race as a factor in the districting process is no different from any other political consideration.  Creating a majority-minority district is no better and no worse than creating an Irish-American, or Polish-American, or Italian-American district.  In all events the relevant question is whether the sovereign abrogated its obligation to govern neutrally.  See Karcher, 462 U. S., at 753754 (Stevens, J., concurring); Mobile, 446 U. S., at 88 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment); Cousins v. City Council of Chicago, 466 F. 2d 830, 850853 (CA7 1972) (Stevens, J., dissenting).

						 The pluralitys long discussion of the history of political gerrymanders is interesting, ante, at 47, but it surely is not intended to suggest that the vintage of an invidious practiceeven an American political tradition as old as the Republic, Board of Commrs, Wabaunsee Cty. v.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">729</a> (2003)
.  The historical discussion might be relevant if it attempted to justify political gerrymandering as an acceptable use of governmental power.  In the end, however, the pluralitys defense of its position comes down to the unconvincing assertion that it lacks the juridical capacity to administer the standards the Court fashioned in its recent racial gerrymandering jurisprudence.

.  Consistent with these statements, the District Court in a recent case correctly described political gerrymandering as a purely partisan exercise and an abuse of power that, at its core, evinces a fundamental distrust of voters, serving the self-interest of the political parties at the expense of the public good.  App. to Juris.

						 Because race so seldom provides a rational basis for a governmental decision, racial classifications almost always fail to survive rational basis scrutiny.  But [n]ot every decision influenced by race is equally objectionable.  Grutter v. Bollinger, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/539/306" class="subref" title="subref">539 U. S. 306</a>,

.  When race is used as the basis for making predictive political judgments, it may be as reliable (or unreliable) as other group characteristics, such as political affiliation, economic status, or national origin.  The fact that race is an immutable characteristic does not mean that there is anything immutable or certain about the political behavior of the members of any racial class.  See Mobile v. Bolden, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/446/55" class="subref" title="subref">446 U. S. 55</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">88</a> (1980)
 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment).  Registered Republicans of all races sometimes vote for Democratic candidates, and vice versa.


The plurality asserts that a persons politics, unlike her race, is not readily discernible.  Ante, at 17.  But that assertion is belied by the evidence that the architects of political gerrymanders seem to have no difficulty in discerning the voters political affiliation.  After all, eligibility to vote in primary elections often requires the citizen to register her party affiliation, but it never requires her to register her race.

						 The one-person, one-vote rule obviously constitutes a neutral districting criterion, but our gerrymandering cases have never cited that principle as one of the traditional criteria that may serve to defeat a claim that a district has been gerrymandered on racial lines.  Shaw I, 509 U. S., at 647.  Thus, I would require that a district be justified with reference to both the one-person, one-vote rule and some other neutral criterion.  See Bandemer, 478 U.

				The central question presented by this case is whether political gerrymandering claims are justiciable.  Although our reasons for coming to this conclusion differ, five Members of the Court are convinced that the pluralitys answer to that question is erroneous.  Moreover, as is apparent from our separate writings today, we share the view that, even if these appellants are not entitled to prevail, it would be contrary to precedent and profoundly unwise to foreclose all judicial review of similar claims that might be advanced in the future.  That we presently have somewhat differing viewsconcerning both the precedential value of some of our recent cases and the standard that should be applied in future casesshould not obscure the fact that the areas of agreement set forth in the separate opinions are of far greater significance.

.  Todays plurality opinion would exempt governing officials from that duty in the context of legislative redistricting and would give license, for the first time, to partisan gerrymanders that are devoid
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				of any rational justification.  In my view, when parti-

, we have not reached agreement on the standard that should govern partisan gerrymanderying claims.  I would decide this case on a narrow ground.  Plaintiff-appellants urge us to craft new rules that in effect would authorize judicial review of statewide election results to protect the democratic process from a transient majoritys abuse of its power to define voting districts.  I agree with the Courts refusal to undertake that ambitious project.  
				<em>
					Ante

				, at 15.  I am persuaded, however, that the District Court failed to apply well-settled propositions of law when it granted the defendants motion to dismiss plaintiff-appellant Susan Fureys gerrymandering claim.

				According to the complaint, Furey is a registered Democrat who resides at an address in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, that was located under the 1992 districting plan in Congressional District 13.

				 pluralitys rejection of a statewide claim of political gerrymandering; and (3) that she has stated a claim that, at least with respect to District 6, Pennsylvanias redistricting plan violates the equal protection principles enunciated in our voting rights cases both before and after

				At issue in this case, as the plurality states,

				<em>

				<em>
					Bandemer

				 v. 
				<em>

, the Court invalidated an Alabama statute that altered the boundaries of the city of Tuskegee from a square to an uncouth twenty-eight-sided figure for the sole purpose of preventing African-Americans from voting in municipal elections.  The allegations of bizarre shape and improper motive, if proven, would abundantly [have] establish[ed] that Act 140 was not an ordinary geographic redistricting measure even within familiar abuses of gerrymandering.

, which referred to gerrymandering as the deliberate and arbitrary distortion of district boundaries and populations for partisan or personal political purposes, also identified both shape and purpose as relevant standards.  The maps attached as exhibits in 
				<em>
					Gomillion

				, 364 U. S., at 348 (Appendix to opinion of the Court), and in subsequent voting rights cases demonstrate that an uncouth or bizarre shape can easily identify a district designed for a single-minded, nonneutral purpose.

				With purpose as the ultimate inquiry, other considerations have supplied ready standards for testing the lawfulness of a gerrymander.  In his dissent in

				Given this clear line of precedents, I should have thought the question of justiciability in cases such as thiswhere a set of plaintiffs argues that a single motivation resulted in a districting scheme with discriminatory effectsto be well settled.  The pluralitys contrary conclusion cannot be squared with our long history of voting rights decisions. Especially perplexing is the pluralitys 
				<em>
					ipse dixit
				</em>
				 distinction of our racial gerrymandering cases.  Notably, the plurality does not argue that the judicially manageable standards that have been used to adjudicate racial gerrymandering claims would not be equally manageable in political gerrymandering cases.  Instead, its distinction of those cases rests on its view that race as a districting criterion is much more rarely encountered than partisanship, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16, and that determining whether racea rare and constitutionally suspect motivedominated a districting decision is quite different from determining whether [such a decision] is so substantially affected by the excess of an ordinary and lawful motive as to [be] invali[d], 
				<em>

				The plurality opinion in 
				<em>
					Bandemer
				</em>
				 dealt with a claim that the Indiana apportionment scheme for state legislative districts discriminated against Democratic voters on a statewide basis.  478 U. S., at 127.  In my judgment, the 
				<em>
					Bandemer
				</em>
				 Court was correct to entertain that statewide challenge, because the plaintiffs in that case alleged a group harm that affected members of their party throughout the State.  In the subsequent line of racial gerrymandering cases, however, the Court shifted its focus from statewide challenges and required, as a matter of standing, that plaintiffs stating race-based equal protection claims actually reside in the districts they are challenging.  See 
				<em>
					United States

				 v.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">745</a> (1995)
.  Because 
				<em>
					Hays
				</em>
				 has altered the standing rules for gerrymandering claimsand because, in my view, racial and political gerrymanders are species of the same constitutional concernthe 
				<em>
					Hays
				</em>
				 standing rule requires dismissal of the statewide claim.

				  But that does not end the matter.  Challenges to specific districts, such as those considered in the 
				<em>
					Shaw
				</em>
				 cases, relate to a different type of representational harm, and those allegations necessarily must be considered on a district-by-district basis.

				In a challenge to a statewide districting plan, the plaintiff-appellants complain that they have been injured because of their membership in a particular, identifiable group.  The plaintiff-appellees in

				, for example, alleged that Democratic voters over the State as a whole, not Democratic voters in particular districts, ha[d] been subjected to unconstitutional discrimination.  478 U.

They specifically claimed that they were injured as members of a group because the number of Democratic representatives was not commensurate with the number of Democratic voters throughout Indiana.  Much like the plaintiff-appellees in 
				<em>
					Bandemer, 
				</em>
				the plaintiff-appellants in this case allege that the statewide plan will enable Republicans, who constitute about half of Pennsylvanias voters, to elect 13 or 14 members of the States 19-person congressional delegation.

				  That requirement applies with full force to districting decisions.  The line that divides a racial or ethnic minority unevenly between school districts can be entirely legitimate if chosen on the basis of neutral factorscounty lines, for example, or a natural boundary such as a river or major thoroughfare.  But if the district lines were chosen for the purpose of limiting the number of minority students in the school, or the number of families holding unpopular religious or political views, that invidious purpose surely would invalidate the district.

				Consistent with that principle, our recent racial gerrymandering cases have examined the shape of the district and the purpose of the districting body to determine whether race, above all other criteria, predominated in the line-drawing process.  We began by holding in 
				<em>
					Shaw I
				</em>
				 that a districting scheme could be so irrational on its face that it [could] be understood only as an effort to segregate voters into separate voting districts because of their race.  509 U. S., at 658.  Then, in 
				<em>
					Miller

				<span class="softbreak"></span>
            <em>

				</em>
				s irrational-shape test did not treat the bizarreness of a districts lines itself as a constitutional violation; rather, the irregularity of the districts contours in 
				<em>
					Shaw I
				</em>
				 was persuasive circumstantial evidence that race for its own sake, and not other districting principles, was the legislatures dominant and controlling rationale in drawing its district lines.  515 U. S., at 913.  Under the 
				<em>

				Just as irrational shape can serve as an objective indicator of an impermissible legislative purpose, other objective features of a districting map can save the plan from invalidation.

				In my view, the same standards should apply to claims of political gerrymandering, for the essence of a gerrymander is the same regardless of whether the group is identified as political or racial.  Gerrymandering always involves the drawing of district boundaries to maximize the voting strength of the dominant political faction and to minimize the strength of one or more groups of opponents.

				The racial gerrymandering cases therefore supply a judicially manageable standard for determining when partisanship, like race, has played too great of a role in the districting process.  Just as race can be a factor in, but cannot dictate the outcome of, the districting process, so too can partisanship be a permissible consideration in drawing district lines, so long as it does not predominate.  If, as plaintiff-appellant Furey has alleged, the predominant motive of the legislators who designed District 6, and the sole justification for its bizarre shape, was a purpose to discriminate against a political minority, that invidious purpose should invalidate the district.

				  Thus, the view that the plurality implicitly embraces todaythat a gerrymander contrived for the sole purpose of disadvantaging a political minority is less objectionable than one seeking to benefit a racial minorityis doubly flawed.  It disregards the obvious distinction between an invidious and a benign purpose, and it mistakenly assumes that race cannot provide a legitimate basis for making political judgments.

				  Under my analysis, if no neutral criterion can be identified to justify the lines drawn, and if the only possible explanation for a districts bizarre shape is a naked desire to increase partisan strength, then no rational basis exists to save the district from an equal protection challenge.

						 In Colegrove, for example, the Illinois Legislature had drawn the States district lines under the 1901 State Apportionment Act and had not reapportioned in the four ensuing decades, despite census figures indicating great changes in the distribution of the population.  328 U.

Nonetheless, the Court, per Justice Frankfurter, concluded that due regard for the effective working of our Government revealed this issue to be of a peculiarly political nature and therefore not meet for judicial determination.  Id., at 552.

						 The plurality opinion seems to assume that the dissenting opinions in Umbehr, 518 U. S., at 686 (Scalia, J.), and Rutan, 497 U. S., at 92 (Scalia, J.), correctly state the lawnamely, that when a practice not expressly prohibited by the text of the Bill of Rights bears the endorsement of a long tradition of open, widespread, and unchallenged use that dates back to the beginning of the Republic, we have no proper basis for striking it down, id., at 95.  Cf. ante, at 4 (tracing the history of political gerrymanders to the beginning of the 18th century).  But [o]ur inquiry does not begin with the judgment of history; [r]ather, inquiry must commence with identification of the constitutional limitations implicated by a challenged governmental practice.  Elrod, 427 U. S., at 354355.

						 The plurality explains that it is willing to accep[t] a modest degree of unmanageability where the constitutional command … is clear, but not where the constitutional obligation … is both dubious and severely unmanageable.  Ante, at 1617.  Not only does this statement cast doubt on the pluralitys faith in our racial gerrymandering cases, but its reasoning is clearly tautological.

						 The pluralitys reluctance to recognize the justiciability of partisan gerrymanders seems driven in part by a fear that recognizing such claims will give rise to a flood of litigation.  See ante, at 16.  But the list of cases that it cites in its lengthy footnote 6, ante, at 1011, suggests that in the two decades since Bandemer, there has been an average of just three or four partisan gerrymandering cases filed every year.  That volume is obviously trivial when compared, for example, to the amount of litigation that followed our adoption of the one-person, one-vote rule.  See Reynolds v. Sims, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/377/533" class="subref" title="subref">377 U. S. 533</a> (1964)

						 Writing for the Court in Bandemer, Justice White put it well: That the characteristics of the complaining group are not immutable or that the group has not been subject to the same historical stigma may be relevant to the manner in which the case is adjudicated, but these differences do not justify a refusal to entertain such a case.  478 U.

						 The cases that the plurality cites today, ante, at 1012, n. 6, support the conclusion that it would have been wise to endorse the views expressed in Justice Powells dissent in Bandemer, 478 U. S., at 161, and my concurrence in Karcher v. Daggett, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/462/725" class="subref" title="subref">462 U. S. 725</a>,

.  I remain convinced that our opinions correctly interpreted the law.  If that standard were applied to the statewide challenge in this case, a trial of the entire case would be required.  For the purpose of deciding this case, even though I dissented from our decision in Shaw I and remain convinced that it was incorrectly decided, I would give the Shaw cases stare decisis effect in the political gerrymandering context.  Given the Courts illogical disposition of this case, however, in future cases I would feel free to reexamine the standing issue.  I surely would not suggest that a plaintiff would never have standing to litigate a statewide claim.

						 Plaintiff-appellants Richard and Norma Jean Vieth are registered Democrats who reside in District 16.  App. to Juris. Statement 129a.

						 In this sense the partisan gerrymander is the American cousin of the English rotten borough.  In the English system, Members of Parliament were elected from geographic units that remained unchanged despite population changes wrought by the Industrial Revolution.  Because representation was not based on population, vast inequities developed over time in the form of the so-called rotten boroughs.  Old Sarum, for instance, had no human residentsonly a few sheepyet sent the same number of representatives to Parliament as Yorkshire, with nearly a million inhabitants.  R. Zagarri, The Politics of Size: Representation in the United States, 17761850, p. 37 (1987) (footnote omitted).  As a result of this system, many insignificant places returned members, while many important towns did not, and even in large towns the members were often elected by a tiny fraction of the population.  J. Butler, The Passing of the Great Reform Bill 176 (1914).  Meanwhile, [t]he Government bribed the patron or member or both by means of distinctions and offices or by actual cash, and [t]he patron and member bribed the electors in the same way.  Ibid.  The rotten boroughs clearly would violate our familiar one-person, one-vote rule, but they were also troubling because the representative of such a borough owed his primary loyalty to his patron and the government rather than to his constituents (if he had any).  Similarly, in gerrymandered districts, instead of local groups defined by neutral criteria selecting their representatives, it is the architects of the districts who select the constituencies and, in effect, the representatives.

						 In the realm of federal elections, the requirement of governmental neutrality is buttressed by this Courts recognition that the Elections Clause is not  a source of power to dictate electoral outcomes, to favor or disfavor a class of candidates, or to evade important constitutional restraints.   Cook v. Gralike, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/531/510" class="subref" title="subref">531 U. S. 510</a>,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">833</a>834 (1995)
).  And this duty to govern impartially extends to executive and legislative officials alike.  Beginning as early as its first session in 1789, Congress has passed a number of statutes designed to guarantee that Executive Branch employees neutrally carry out their duties.  See Ex parte Curtis, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/106/371" class="subref" title="subref">106 U. S. 371</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">372</a>373 (1882)
.  Some of those laws avoided the danger that the government itself may be made to furnish indirectly the money to defray the expenses of keeping the political party in power that happens to have for the time being the control of the public patronage.  Id., at 375.  It is fundamental that federal employees are expected to enforce the law and execute programs of the Government without bias or favoritism for or against any political party or group or the members thereof.  Civil Service Commn v. Letter Carriers, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/413/548" class="subref" title="subref">413 U. S. 548</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">564</a>565 (1973)
.  That expectation reflects the principle that the impartial execution of the laws is a great end of Government.  Id., at 565.

						 In Washington v. Davis, we referred to an earlier challenge to a New York reapportionment statute that had failed because the plaintiffs had not shown that the statute was  the product of a state contrivance to segregate on the basis of race or place of origin.   426 U.

						 I have elsewhere explained my view that race as a factor in the districting process is no different from any other political consideration.  Creating a majority-minority district is no better and no worse than creating an Irish-American, or Polish-American, or Italian-American district.  In all events the relevant question is whether the sovereign abrogated its obligation to govern neutrally.  See Karcher, 462 U. S., at 753754 (Stevens, J., concurring); Mobile, 446 U. S., at 88 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment); Cousins v. City Council of Chicago, 466 F. 2d 830, 850853 (CA7 1972) (Stevens, J., dissenting).

						 The pluralitys long discussion of the history of political gerrymanders is interesting, ante, at 47, but it surely is not intended to suggest that the vintage of an invidious practiceeven an American political tradition as old as the Republic, Board of Commrs, Wabaunsee Cty. v.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/518/668" class="subref" title="subref">518 U. S. 668</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">688</a> (1996)
 (Scalia, J., dissenting)should insulate it from constitutional review.  Compare, e.g., Bradwell v. State, 16 Wall. 130 (1873), with Nevada Dept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/538/721" class="subref" title="subref">538 U. S. 721</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">729</a> (2003)
.  The historical discussion might be relevant if it attempted to justify political gerrymandering as an acceptable use of governmental power.  In the end, however, the pluralitys defense of its position comes down to the unconvincing assertion that it lacks the juridical capacity to administer the standards the Court fashioned in its recent racial gerrymandering jurisprudence.

						 Because race so seldom provides a rational basis for a governmental decision, racial classifications almost always fail to survive rational basis scrutiny.  But [n]ot every decision influenced by race is equally objectionable.  Grutter v. Bollinger, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/539/306" class="subref" title="subref">539 U. S. 306</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">327</a> (2003)
.  When race is used as the basis for making predictive political judgments, it may be as reliable (or unreliable) as other group characteristics, such as political affiliation, economic status, or national origin.  The fact that race is an immutable characteristic does not mean that there is anything immutable or certain about the political behavior of the members of any racial class.  See Mobile v. Bolden, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/446/55" class="subref" title="subref">446 U. S. 55</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">88</a> (1980)
 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment).  Registered Republicans of all races sometimes vote for Democratic candidates, and vice versa.


The plurality asserts that a persons politics, unlike her race, is not readily discernible.  Ante, at 17.  But that assertion is belied by the evidence that the architects of political gerrymanders seem to have no difficulty in discerning the voters political affiliation.  After all, eligibility to vote in primary elections often requires the citizen to register her party affiliation, but it never requires her to register her race.

						 The one-person, one-vote rule obviously constitutes a neutral districting criterion, but our gerrymandering cases have never cited that principle as one of the traditional criteria that may serve to defeat a claim that a district has been gerrymandered on racial lines.  Shaw I, 509 U.

				The central question presented by this case is whether political gerrymandering claims are justiciable.  Although our reasons for coming to this conclusion differ, five Members of the Court are convinced that the pluralitys answer to that question is erroneous.  Moreover, as is apparent from our separate writings today, we share the view that, even if these appellants are not entitled to prevail, it would be contrary to precedent and profoundly unwise to foreclose all judicial review of similar claims that might be advanced in the future.  That we presently have somewhat differing viewsconcerning both the precedential value of some of our recent cases and the standard that should be applied in future casesshould not obscure the fact that the areas of agreement set forth in the separate opinions are of far greater significance.

				<em>

				<em>
					Gomillion

				With purpose as the ultimate inquiry, other considerations have supplied ready standards for testing the lawfulness of a gerrymander.  In his dissent in

				Given this clear line of precedents, I should have thought the question of justiciability in cases such as thiswhere a set of plaintiffs argues that a single motivation resulted in a districting scheme with discriminatory effectsto be well settled.  The pluralitys contrary conclusion cannot be squared with our long history of voting rights decisions. Especially perplexing is the pluralitys 
				<em>
					ipse dixit
				</em>
				 distinction of our racial gerrymandering cases.  Notably, the plurality does not argue that the judicially manageable standards that have been used to adjudicate racial gerrymandering claims would not be equally manageable in political gerrymandering cases.  Instead, its distinction of those cases rests on its view that race as a districting criterion is much more rarely encountered than partisanship, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16, and that determining whether racea rare and constitutionally suspect motivedominated a districting decision is quite different from determining whether [such a decision] is so substantially affected by the excess of an ordinary and lawful motive as to [be] invali[d],

				The plurality opinion in

				 Court was correct to entertain that statewide challenge, because the plaintiffs in that case alleged a group harm that affected members of their party throughout the State.  In the subsequent line of racial gerrymandering cases, however, the Court shifted its focus from statewide challenges and required, as a matter of standing, that plaintiffs stating race-based equal protection claims actually reside in the districts they are challenging.

				Consistent with that principle, our recent racial gerrymandering cases have examined the shape of the district and the purpose of the districting body to determine whether race, above all other criteria, predominated in the line-drawing process.  We began by holding in 
				<em>
					Shaw I
				</em>
				 that a districting scheme could be so irrational on its face that it [could] be understood only as an effort to segregate voters into separate voting districts because of their race.  509 U. S., at 658.  Then, in 
				<em>
					Miller

				<span class="softbreak"></span>
            <em>
					Shaw I
				</em>
				s irrational-shape test did not treat the bizarreness of a districts lines itself as a constitutional violation; rather, the irregularity of the districts contours in 
				<em>
					Shaw I
				</em>
				 was persuasive circumstantial evidence that race for its own sake, and not other districting principles, was the legislatures dominant and controlling rationale in drawing its district lines.  515 U. S., at 913.  Under the 
				<em>
					Shaw
				</em>
				 cases, then, the use of race as a criterion in redistricting is not 
				<em>
					per se
				</em>
				 impermissible, see 
				<em>

				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/517/899" class="subref" title="subref">517 U. S. 899</a>, but when race is elevated to paramount statuswhen it is the be-all and end-all of the redistricting processthe legislature has gone too far.  Race must not simply have been

				Just as irrational shape can serve as an objective indicator of an impermissible legislative purpose, other objective features of a districting map can save the plan from invalidation.  We have explained that traditional districting principles, which include compactness, contiguity, and respect for political subdivisions, are important not because they are constitutionally required … but because they are objective factors that may serve to defeat a claim that a district has been gerrymandered on racial lines.

				In my view, the same standards should apply to claims of political gerrymandering, for the essence of a gerrymander is the same regardless of whether the group is identified as political or racial.

				The racial gerrymandering cases therefore supply a judicially manageable standard for determining when partisanship, like race, has played too great of a role in the districting process.  Just as race can be a factor in, but cannot dictate the outcome of, the districting process, so too can partisanship be a permissible consideration in drawing district lines, so long as it does not predominate.  If, as plaintiff-appellant Furey has alleged, the predominant motive of the legislators who designed District 6, and the sole justification for its bizarre shape, was a purpose to discriminate against a political minority, that invidious purpose should invalidate the district.

A legislature controlled by one party could not, for instance, impose special taxes on members of the minority party, or use tax revenues to pay the majority partys campaign expenses.

				  Thus, the view that the plurality implicitly embraces todaythat a gerrymander contrived for the sole purpose of disadvantaging a political minority is less objectionable than one seeking to benefit a racial minorityis doubly flawed.  It disregards the obvious distinction between an invidious and a benign purpose, and it mistakenly assumes that race cannot provide a legitimate basis for making political judgments.

				  Under my analysis, if no neutral criterion can be identified to justify the lines drawn, and if the only possible explanation for a districts bizarre shape is a naked desire to increase partisan strength, then no rational basis exists to save the district from an equal protection challenge.

						 In Colegrove, for example, the Illinois Legislature had drawn the States district lines under the 1901 State Apportionment Act and had not reapportioned in the four ensuing decades, despite census figures indicating great changes in the distribution of the population.  328 U. S., at 569 (Black, J., dissenting).  The populations of Illinois districts in 1945 consequently ranged from 112,000 in the least populous district to 900,000 in the most.  Ibid.  Nonetheless, the Court, per Justice Frankfurter, concluded that due regard for the effective working of our Government revealed this issue to be of a peculiarly political nature and therefore not meet for judicial determination.  Id., at 552.  Fewer than 20 years later, the Court, confronted with a strikingly similar set of factsa Tennessee apportionment plan set by a 1901 statute that had remained virtually unchanged despite dramatic population growthheld, in obvious tension with Colegrove, that the complaint stated a justiciable cause of action.  Baker, 369 U. S., at 192, 197198.  The Court distinguished Colegrove as simply a refusal to exercise equitys powers.  369 U. S., at 235.

						 The pluralitys reluctance to recognize the justiciability of partisan gerrymanders seems driven in part by a fear that recognizing such claims will give rise to a flood of litigation.  See ante, at 16.  But the list of cases that it cites in its lengthy footnote 6, ante, at 1011, suggests that in the two decades since Bandemer, there has been an average of just three or four partisan gerrymandering cases filed every year.  That volume is obviously trivial when compared, for example, to the amount of litigation that followed our adoption of the one-person, one-vote rule.  See Reynolds v. Sims,

.  I remain convinced that our opinions correctly interpreted the law.  If that standard were applied to the statewide challenge in this case, a trial of the entire case would be required.  For the purpose of deciding this case, even though I dissented from our decision in Shaw I and remain convinced that it was incorrectly decided, I would give the Shaw cases stare decisis effect in the political gerrymandering context.  Given the Courts illogical disposition of this case, however, in future cases I would feel free to reexamine the standing issue.  I surely would not suggest that a plaintiff would never have standing to litigate a statewide claim.

						 In this sense the partisan gerrymander is the American cousin of the English rotten borough.  In the English system, Members of Parliament were elected from geographic units that remained unchanged despite population changes wrought by the Industrial Revolution.  Because representation was not based on population, vast inequities developed over time in the form of the so-called rotten boroughs.  Old Sarum, for instance, had no human residentsonly a few sheepyet sent the same number of representatives to Parliament as Yorkshire, with nearly a million inhabitants.  R. Zagarri, The Politics of Size: Representation in the United States, 17761850, p. 37 (1987) (footnote omitted).  As a result of this system, many insignificant places returned members, while many important towns did not, and even in large towns the members were often elected by a tiny fraction of the population.  J.

Meanwhile, [t]he Government bribed the patron or member or both by means of distinctions and offices or by actual cash, and [t]he patron and member bribed the electors in the same way.  Ibid.  The rotten boroughs clearly would violate our familiar one-person, one-vote rule, but they were also troubling because the representative of such a borough owed his primary loyalty to his patron and the government rather than to his constituents (if he had any).  Similarly, in gerrymandered districts, instead of local groups defined by neutral criteria selecting their representatives, it is the architects of the districts who select the constituencies and, in effect, the representatives.

						 In the realm of federal elections, the requirement of governmental neutrality is buttressed by this Courts recognition that the Elections Clause is not  a source of power to dictate electoral outcomes, to favor or disfavor a class of candidates, or to evade important constitutional restraints.   Cook v. Gralike,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">833</a>834 (1995)
).  And this duty to govern impartially extends to executive and legislative officials alike.  Beginning as early as its first session in 1789, Congress has passed a number of statutes designed to guarantee that Executive Branch employees neutrally carry out their duties.  See Ex parte Curtis, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/106/371" class="subref" title="subref">106 U. S. 371</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">372</a>373 (1882)
.  Some of those laws avoided the danger that the government itself may be made to furnish indirectly the money to defray the expenses of keeping the political party in power that happens to have for the time being the control of the public patronage.  Id., at 375.  It is fundamental that federal employees are expected to enforce the law and execute programs of the Government without bias or favoritism for or against any political party or group or the members thereof.  Civil Service Commn v. Letter Carriers,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">564</a>565 (1973)
.  That expectation reflects the principle that the impartial execution of the laws is a great end of Government.  Id., at 565.

						 In Washington v.

						 I have elsewhere explained my view that race as a factor in the districting process is no different from any other political consideration.  Creating a majority-minority district is no better and no worse than creating an Irish-American, or Polish-American, or Italian-American district.  In all events the relevant question is whether the sovereign abrogated its obligation to govern neutrally.  See Karcher, 462 U. S., at 753754 (Stevens, J., concurring); Mobile, 446 U.

						 The pluralitys long discussion of the history of political gerrymanders is interesting, ante, at 47, but it surely is not intended to suggest that the vintage of an invidious practiceeven an American political tradition as old as the Republic, Board of Commrs, Wabaunsee Cty. v.

 (Scalia, J., dissenting)should insulate it from constitutional review.  Compare, e.g., Bradwell v. State, 16 Wall. 130 (1873), with Nevada Dept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">729</a> (2003)
.  The historical discussion might be relevant if it attempted to justify political gerrymandering as an acceptable use of governmental power.  In the end, however, the pluralitys defense of its position comes down to the unconvincing assertion that it lacks the juridical capacity to administer the standards the Court fashioned in its recent racial gerrymandering jurisprudence.

						 Because race so seldom provides a rational basis for a governmental decision, racial classifications almost always fail to survive rational basis scrutiny.  But [n]ot every decision influenced by race is equally objectionable.  Grutter v. Bollinger, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/539/306" class="subref" title="subref">539 U. S. 306</a>,

.  When race is used as the basis for making predictive political judgments, it may be as reliable (or unreliable) as other group characteristics, such as political affiliation, economic status, or national origin.  The fact that race is an immutable characteristic does not mean that there is anything immutable or certain about the political behavior of the members of any racial class.  See Mobile v. Bolden, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/446/55" class="subref" title="subref">446 U. S. 55</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">88</a> (1980)
 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment).  Registered Republicans of all races sometimes vote for Democratic candidates, and vice versa.


The plurality asserts that a persons politics, unlike her race, is not readily discernible.  Ante, at 17.  But that assertion is belied by the evidence that the architects of political gerrymanders seem to have no difficulty in discerning the voters political affiliation.  After all, eligibility to vote in primary elections often requires the citizen to register her party affiliation, but it never requires her to register her race.

						 The one-person, one-vote rule obviously constitutes a neutral districting criterion, but our gerrymandering cases have never cited that principle as one of the traditional criteria that may serve to defeat a claim that a district has been gerrymandered on racial lines.  Shaw I, 509 U. S., at 647.  Thus, I would require that a district be justified with reference to both the one-person, one-vote rule and some other neutral criterion.  See Bandemer, 478 U.

				The central question presented by this case is whether political gerrymandering claims are justiciable.  Although our reasons for coming to this conclusion differ, five Members of the Court are convinced that the pluralitys answer to that question is erroneous.  Moreover, as is apparent from our separate writings today, we share the view that, even if these appellants are not entitled to prevail, it would be contrary to precedent and profoundly unwise to foreclose all judicial review of similar claims that might be advanced in the future.  That we presently have somewhat differing viewsconcerning both the precedential value of some of our recent cases and the standard that should be applied in future casesshould not obscure the fact that the areas of agreement set forth in the separate opinions are of far greater significance.

.  Todays plurality opinion would exempt governing officials from that duty in the context of legislative redistricting and would give license, for the first time, to partisan gerrymanders that are devoid
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				of any rational justification.  In my view, when parti-

, we have not reached agreement on the standard that should govern partisan gerrymanderying claims.  I would decide this case on a narrow ground.  Plaintiff-appellants urge us to craft new rules that in effect would authorize judicial review of statewide election results to protect the democratic process from a transient majoritys abuse of its power to define voting districts.  I agree with the Courts refusal to undertake that ambitious project.  
				<em>

				<em>

				Given this clear line of precedents, I should have thought the question of justiciability in cases such as thiswhere a set of plaintiffs argues that a single motivation resulted in a districting scheme with discriminatory effectsto be well settled.  The pluralitys contrary conclusion cannot be squared with our long history of voting rights decisions. Especially perplexing is the pluralitys 
				<em>
					ipse dixit
				</em>
				 distinction of our racial gerrymandering cases.  Notably, the plurality does not argue that the judicially manageable standards that have been used to adjudicate racial gerrymandering claims would not be equally manageable in political gerrymandering cases.  Instead, its distinction of those cases rests on its view that race as a districting criterion is much more rarely encountered than partisanship, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16, and that determining whether racea rare and constitutionally suspect motivedominated a districting decision is quite different from determining whether [such a decision] is so substantially affected by the excess of an ordinary and lawful motive as to [be] invali[d], 
				<em>
					ibid.

				  But those considerations are wholly irrelevant to the issue of justiciability.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				To begin with, the plurality errs in assuming that politics is an ordinary and lawful motive.  We have squarely rejected the notion that a purpose to discriminate on the basis of politics,

In any event, as I understand the pluralitys opinion, it seems to agree that if the State goes too farif it engages in political gerrymandering for politics sakeit violates the Constitution in the same way as if it undertakes racial gerrymandering for races sake.

				The plurality opinion in 
				<em>

				 dealt with a claim that the Indiana apportionment scheme for state legislative districts discriminated against Democratic voters on a statewide basis.  478 U. S., at 127.  In my judgment, the 
				<em>

				</em>
				 Court was correct to entertain that statewide challenge, because the plaintiffs in that case alleged a group harm that affected members of their party throughout the State.  In the subsequent line of racial gerrymandering cases, however, the Court shifted its focus from statewide challenges and required, as a matter of standing, that plaintiffs stating race-based equal protection claims actually reside in the districts they are challenging.

				<em>

The line that divides a racial or ethnic minority unevenly between school districts can be entirely legitimate if chosen on the basis of neutral factorscounty lines, for example, or a natural boundary such as a river or major thoroughfare.

				Consistent with that principle, our recent racial gerrymandering cases have examined the shape of the district and the purpose of the districting body to determine whether race, above all other criteria, predominated in the line-drawing process.  We began by holding in 
				<em>
					Shaw I
				</em>
				 that a districting scheme could be so irrational on its face that it [could] be understood only as an effort to segregate voters into separate voting districts because of their race.  509 U. S., at 658.  Then, in 
				<em>
					Miller

				, we explained that 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
            <em>
					Shaw I
				</em>
				s irrational-shape test did not treat the bizarreness of a districts lines itself as a constitutional violation; rather, the irregularity of the districts contours in 
				<em>
					Shaw I
				</em>
				 was persuasive circumstantial evidence that race for its own sake, and not other districting principles, was the legislatures dominant and controlling rationale in drawing its district lines.  515 U. S., at 913.  Under the 
				<em>
					Shaw
				</em>
				 cases, then, the use of race as a criterion in redistricting is not

				Just as irrational shape can serve as an objective indicator of an impermissible legislative purpose, other objective features of a districting map can save the plan from invalidation.  We have explained that traditional districting principles, which include compactness, contiguity, and respect for political subdivisions, are important not because they are constitutionally required … but because they are objective factors that may serve to defeat a claim that a district has been gerrymandered on racial lines.

				In my view, the same standards should apply to claims of political gerrymandering, for the essence of a gerrymander is the same regardless of whether the group is identified as political or racial.  Gerrymandering always involves the drawing of district boundaries to maximize the voting strength of the dominant political faction and to minimize the strength of one or more groups of opponents.

				The racial gerrymandering cases therefore supply a judicially manageable standard for determining when partisanship, like race, has played too great of a role in the districting process.  Just as race can be a factor in, but cannot dictate the outcome of, the districting process, so too can partisanship be a permissible consideration in drawing district lines, so long as it does not predominate.  If, as plaintiff-appellant Furey has alleged, the predominant motive of the legislators who designed District 6, and the sole justification for its bizarre shape, was a purpose to discriminate against a political minority, that invidious purpose should invalidate the district.

				  Thus, the view that the plurality implicitly embraces todaythat a gerrymander contrived for the sole purpose of disadvantaging a political minority is less objectionable than one seeking to benefit a racial minorityis doubly flawed.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Quite obviously, however, several standards for identifying impermissible partisan influence are available to judges who have the will to enforce them.  We could hold that every district boundary must have a neutral justification; we could apply Justice Powells three-factor approach in 
				<em>
					Bandemer;
				</em>
				 we could apply the predominant motivation standard fashioned by the Court in its racial gerrymandering cases; or we could endorse either of the approaches advocated today by 
				<span class="smallcaps">

				and
				<span class="smallcaps">
					 Justice Breyer

						 In Colegrove, for example, the Illinois Legislature had drawn the States district lines under the 1901 State Apportionment Act and had not reapportioned in the four ensuing decades, despite census figures indicating great changes in the distribution of the population.  328 U. S., at 569 (Black, J., dissenting).  The populations of Illinois districts in 1945 consequently ranged from 112,000 in the least populous district to 900,000 in the most.  Ibid.  Nonetheless, the Court, per Justice Frankfurter, concluded that due regard for the effective working of our Government revealed this issue to be of a peculiarly political nature and therefore not meet for judicial determination.  Id., at 552.  Fewer than 20 years later, the Court, confronted with a strikingly similar set of factsa Tennessee apportionment plan set by a 1901 statute that had remained virtually unchanged despite dramatic population growthheld, in obvious tension with Colegrove, that the complaint stated a justiciable cause of action.  Baker, 369 U. S., at 192, 197198.  The Court distinguished Colegrove as simply a refusal to exercise equitys powers.  369 U. S., at 235.

						 The plurality opinion seems to assume that the dissenting opinions in Umbehr, 518 U. S., at 686 (Scalia, J.), and Rutan, 497 U. S., at 92 (Scalia, J.), correctly state the lawnamely, that when a practice not expressly prohibited by the text of the Bill of Rights bears the endorsement of a long tradition of open, widespread, and unchallenged use that dates back to the beginning of the Republic, we have no proper basis for striking it down, id., at 95.  Cf. ante, at 4 (tracing the history of political gerrymanders to the beginning of the 18th century).  But [o]ur inquiry does not begin with the judgment of history; [r]ather, inquiry must commence with identification of the constitutional limitations implicated by a challenged governmental practice.  Elrod, 427 U. S., at 354355.

						 The plurality explains that it is willing to accep[t] a modest degree of unmanageability where the constitutional command … is clear, but not where the constitutional obligation … is both dubious and severely unmanageable.  Ante, at 1617.  Not only does this statement cast doubt on the pluralitys faith in our racial gerrymandering cases, but its reasoning is clearly tautological.

						 The pluralitys reluctance to recognize the justiciability of partisan gerrymanders seems driven in part by a fear that recognizing such claims will give rise to a flood of litigation.  See ante, at 16.  But the list of cases that it cites in its lengthy footnote 6, ante, at 1011, suggests that in the two decades since Bandemer, there has been an average of just three or four partisan gerrymandering cases filed every year.  That volume is obviously trivial when compared, for example, to the amount of litigation that followed our adoption of the one-person, one-vote rule.  See Reynolds v. Sims, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/377/533" class="subref" title="subref">377 U. S. 533</a> (1964)

						 Writing for the Court in Bandemer, Justice White put it well: That the characteristics of the complaining group are not immutable or that the group has not been subject to the same historical stigma may be relevant to the manner in which the case is adjudicated, but these differences do not justify a refusal to entertain such a case.  478 U.

						 The cases that the plurality cites today, ante, at 1012, n. 6, support the conclusion that it would have been wise to endorse the views expressed in Justice Powells dissent in Bandemer, 478 U. S., at 161, and my concurrence in Karcher v. Daggett, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/462/725" class="subref" title="subref">462 U. S. 725</a>,

.  I remain convinced that our opinions correctly interpreted the law.  If that standard were applied to the statewide challenge in this case, a trial of the entire case would be required.  For the purpose of deciding this case, even though I dissented from our decision in Shaw I and remain convinced that it was incorrectly decided, I would give the Shaw cases stare decisis effect in the political gerrymandering context.  Given the Courts illogical disposition of this case, however, in future cases I would feel free to reexamine the standing issue.  I surely would not suggest that a plaintiff would never have standing to litigate a statewide claim.

						 In this sense the partisan gerrymander is the American cousin of the English rotten borough.  In the English system, Members of Parliament were elected from geographic units that remained unchanged despite population changes wrought by the Industrial Revolution.  Because representation was not based on population, vast inequities developed over time in the form of the so-called rotten boroughs.  Old Sarum, for instance, had no human residentsonly a few sheepyet sent the same number of representatives to Parliament as Yorkshire, with nearly a million inhabitants.  R. Zagarri, The Politics of Size: Representation in the United States, 17761850, p. 37 (1987) (footnote omitted).  As a result of this system, many insignificant places returned members, while many important towns did not, and even in large towns the members were often elected by a tiny fraction of the population.  J. Butler, The Passing of the Great Reform Bill 176 (1914).  Meanwhile, [t]he Government bribed the patron or member or both by means of distinctions and offices or by actual cash, and [t]he patron and member bribed the electors in the same way.  Ibid.  The rotten boroughs clearly would violate our familiar one-person, one-vote rule, but they were also troubling because the representative of such a borough owed his primary loyalty to his patron and the government rather than to his constituents (if he had any).  Similarly, in gerrymandered districts, instead of local groups defined by neutral criteria selecting their representatives, it is the architects of the districts who select the constituencies and, in effect, the representatives.

						 In the realm of federal elections, the requirement of governmental neutrality is buttressed by this Courts recognition that the Elections Clause is not  a source of power to dictate electoral outcomes, to favor or disfavor a class of candidates, or to evade important constitutional restraints.   Cook v. Gralike, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/531/510" class="subref" title="subref">531 U. S. 510</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">523</a> (2001)

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">833</a>834 (1995)
).  And this duty to govern impartially extends to executive and legislative officials alike.  Beginning as early as its first session in 1789, Congress has passed a number of statutes designed to guarantee that Executive Branch employees neutrally carry out their duties.  See Ex parte Curtis, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/106/371" class="subref" title="subref">106 U. S. 371</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">372</a>373 (1882)
.  Some of those laws avoided the danger that the government itself may be made to furnish indirectly the money to defray the expenses of keeping the political party in power that happens to have for the time being the control of the public patronage.  Id., at 375.  It is fundamental that federal employees are expected to enforce the law and execute programs of the Government without bias or favoritism for or against any political party or group or the members thereof.  Civil Service Commn v. Letter Carriers, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/413/548" class="subref" title="subref">413 U. S. 548</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">564</a>565 (1973)
.  That expectation reflects the principle that the impartial execution of the laws is a great end of Government.  Id., at 565.

						 In Washington v. Davis, we referred to an earlier challenge to a New York reapportionment statute that had failed because the plaintiffs had not shown that the statute was  the product of a state contrivance to segregate on the basis of race or place of origin.   426 U.

						 I have elsewhere explained my view that race as a factor in the districting process is no different from any other political consideration.  Creating a majority-minority district is no better and no worse than creating an Irish-American, or Polish-American, or Italian-American district.  In all events the relevant question is whether the sovereign abrogated its obligation to govern neutrally.  See Karcher, 462 U. S., at 753754 (Stevens, J., concurring); Mobile, 446 U. S., at 88 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment); Cousins v. City Council of Chicago, 466 F. 2d 830, 850853 (CA7 1972) (Stevens, J., dissenting).

						 The pluralitys long discussion of the history of political gerrymanders is interesting, ante, at 47, but it surely is not intended to suggest that the vintage of an invidious practiceeven an American political tradition as old as the Republic, Board of Commrs, Wabaunsee Cty. v.

 (Scalia, J., dissenting)should insulate it from constitutional review.  Compare, e.g., Bradwell v. State, 16 Wall. 130 (1873), with Nevada Dept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">729</a> (2003)
.  The historical discussion might be relevant if it attempted to justify political gerrymandering as an acceptable use of governmental power.  In the end, however, the pluralitys defense of its position comes down to the unconvincing assertion that it lacks the juridical capacity to administer the standards the Court fashioned in its recent racial gerrymandering jurisprudence.

 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment).  Registered Republicans of all races sometimes vote for Democratic candidates, and vice versa.


The plurality asserts that a persons politics, unlike her race, is not readily discernible.  Ante, at 17.  But that assertion is belied by the evidence that the architects of political gerrymanders seem to have no difficulty in discerning the voters political affiliation.  After all, eligibility to vote in primary elections often requires the citizen to register her party affiliation, but it never requires her to register her race.

						 The one-person, one-vote rule obviously constitutes a neutral districting criterion, but our gerrymandering cases have never cited that principle as one of the traditional criteria that may serve to defeat a claim that a district has been gerrymandered on racial lines.  Shaw I, 509 U. S., at 647.  Thus, I would require that a district be justified with reference to both the one-person, one-vote rule and some other neutral criterion.  See Bandemer, 478 U.

				The central question presented by this case is whether political gerrymandering claims are justiciable.  Although our reasons for coming to this conclusion differ, five Members of the Court are convinced that the pluralitys answer to that question is erroneous.  Moreover, as is apparent from our separate writings today, we share the view that, even if these appellants are not entitled to prevail, it would be contrary to precedent and profoundly unwise to foreclose all judicial review of similar claims that might be advanced in the future.  That we presently have somewhat differing viewsconcerning both the precedential value of some of our recent cases and the standard that should be applied in future casesshould not obscure the fact that the areas of agreement set forth in the separate opinions are of far greater significance.

.  Todays plurality opinion would exempt governing officials from that duty in the context of legislative redistricting and would give license, for the first time, to partisan gerrymanders that are devoid

, we have not reached agreement on the standard that should govern partisan gerrymanderying claims.  I would decide this case on a narrow ground.  Plaintiff-appellants urge us to craft new rules that in effect would authorize judicial review of statewide election results to protect the democratic process from a transient majoritys abuse of its power to define voting districts.  I agree with the Courts refusal to undertake that ambitious project.  
				<em>
					Ante

				<em>

				 pluralitys rejection of a statewide claim of political gerrymandering; and (3) that she has stated a claim that, at least with respect to District 6, Pennsylvanias redistricting plan violates the equal protection principles enunciated in our voting rights cases both before and after

				At issue in this case, as the plurality states, 
				<em>
					ante

				<em>

				s second testthe presence or absence of judicially manageable standards.  The judicial standards applicable to gerrymandering claims are deeply rooted in decisions that long preceded 
				<em>
					Bandemer 
				</em>
				and have been refined in later cases.  Among those well-settled principles is the understanding that a districts peculiar shape might be a symptom of an illicit purpose in the line-drawing process.  Most notably, in 
				<em>

				 v. 
				<em>
					Lightfoot,

, the Court invalidated an Alabama statute that altered the boundaries of the city of Tuskegee from a square to an uncouth twenty-eight-sided figure for the sole purpose of preventing African-Americans from voting in municipal elections.  The allegations of bizarre shape and improper motive, if proven, would abundantly [have] establish[ed] that Act 140 was not an ordinary geographic redistricting measure even within familiar abuses of gerrymandering.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">538</a> (1969)
, which referred to gerrymandering as the deliberate and arbitrary distortion of district boundaries and populations for partisan or personal political purposes, also identified both shape and purpose as relevant standards.  The maps attached as exhibits in 
				<em>
					Gomillion
				</em>
				, 364 U. S., at 348 (Appendix to opinion of the Court), and in subsequent voting rights cases demonstrate that an uncouth or bizarre shape can easily identify a district designed for a single-minded, nonneutral purpose.

				With purpose as the ultimate inquiry, other considerations have supplied ready standards for testing the lawfulness of a gerrymander.  In his dissent in

				Given this clear line of precedents, I should have thought the question of justiciability in cases such as thiswhere a set of plaintiffs argues that a single motivation resulted in a districting scheme with discriminatory effectsto be well settled.

Notably, the plurality does not argue that the judicially manageable standards that have been used to adjudicate racial gerrymandering claims would not be equally manageable in political gerrymandering cases.  Instead, its distinction of those cases rests on its view that race as a districting criterion is much more rarely encountered than partisanship,

				The plurality opinion in 
				<em>

				 dealt with a claim that the Indiana apportionment scheme for state legislative districts discriminated against Democratic voters on a statewide basis.  478 U. S., at 127.  In my judgment, the 
				<em>
					Bandemer
				</em>
				 Court was correct to entertain that statewide challenge, because the plaintiffs in that case alleged a group harm that affected members of their party throughout the State.  In the subsequent line of racial gerrymandering cases, however, the Court shifted its focus from statewide challenges and required, as a matter of standing, that plaintiffs stating race-based equal protection claims actually reside in the districts they are challenging.  See

.  Because 
				<em>
					Hays
				</em>
				 has altered the standing rules for gerrymandering claimsand because, in my view, racial and political gerrymanders are species of the same constitutional concernthe 
				<em>

				</em>
				 standing rule requires dismissal of the statewide claim.

Much like the plaintiff-appellees in

				Consistent with that principle, our recent racial gerrymandering cases have examined the shape of the district and the purpose of the districting body to determine whether race, above all other criteria, predominated in the line-drawing process.  We began by holding in 
				<em>
					Shaw I
				</em>
				 that a districting scheme could be so irrational on its face that it [could] be understood only as an effort to segregate voters into separate voting districts because of their race.  509 U. S., at 658.  Then, in 
				<em>
					Miller
				</em>
				, we explained that 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
            <em>
					Shaw I
				</em>
				s irrational-shape test did not treat the bizarreness of a districts lines itself as a constitutional violation; rather, the irregularity of the districts contours in 
				<em>
					Shaw I
				</em>
				 was persuasive circumstantial evidence that race for its own sake, and not other districting principles, was the legislatures dominant and controlling rationale in drawing its district lines.  515 U. S., at 913.  Under the 
				<em>
					Shaw
				</em>
				 cases, then, the use of race as a criterion in redistricting is not 
				<em>
					per se
				</em>
				 impermissible, see

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/517/899" class="subref" title="subref">517 U. S. 899</a>, but when race is elevated to paramount statuswhen it is the be-all and end-all of the redistricting processthe legislature has gone too far.  Race must not simply have been

				Just as irrational shape can serve as an objective indicator of an impermissible legislative purpose, other objective features of a districting map can save the plan from invalidation.  We have explained that traditional districting principles, which include compactness, contiguity, and respect for political subdivisions, are important not because they are constitutionally required … but because they are objective factors that may serve to defeat a claim that a district has been gerrymandered on racial lines.

				In my view, the same standards should apply to claims of political gerrymandering, for the essence of a gerrymander is the same regardless of whether the group is identified as political or racial.  Gerrymandering always involves the drawing of district boundaries to maximize the voting strength of the dominant political faction and to minimize the strength of one or more groups of opponents.  
				<em>
					Mobile
				</em>
				, 446 U. S., at 87 (
				<span class="smallcaps">

In seeking the desired result, legislators necessarily make judgments about the probability that the members of identifiable groupswhether economic, religious, ethnic, or racialwill vote in a certain way.  The overriding purpose of those predictions is political.  See

				The racial gerrymandering cases therefore supply a judicially manageable standard for determining when partisanship, like race, has played too great of a role in the districting process.  Just as race can be a factor in, but cannot dictate the outcome of, the districting process, so too can partisanship be a permissible consideration in drawing district lines, so long as it does not predominate.  If, as plaintiff-appellant Furey has alleged, the predominant motive of the legislators who designed District 6, and the sole justification for its bizarre shape, was a purpose to discriminate against a political minority, that invidious purpose should invalidate the district.

				  Purely partisan motives are rational in a literal sense, but there must be a limiting principle.  [T]he word rationalfor me at leastincludes elements of legitimacy and neutrality that must always characterize the performance of the sovereigns duty to govern impartially.

A legislature controlled by one party could not, for instance, impose special taxes on members of the minority party, or use tax revenues to pay the majority partys campaign expenses.

				The Constitution does not, of course, require proportional representation of racial, ethnic, or political groups.  In that I agree with the plurality.  
				<em>

				<em>
					Gaffney,

				 412 U. S., at 754, and
				<em>

				  Thus, the view that the plurality implicitly embraces todaythat a gerrymander contrived for the sole purpose of disadvantaging a political minority is less objectionable than one seeking to benefit a racial minorityis doubly flawed.  It disregards the obvious distinction between an invidious and a benign purpose, and it mistakenly assumes that race cannot provide a legitimate basis for making political judgments.

				  Under my analysis, if no neutral criterion can be identified to justify the lines drawn, and if the only possible explanation for a districts bizarre shape is a naked desire to increase partisan strength, then no rational basis exists to save the district from an equal protection challenge.

						 In Colegrove, for example, the Illinois Legislature had drawn the States district lines under the 1901 State Apportionment Act and had not reapportioned in the four ensuing decades, despite census figures indicating great changes in the distribution of the population.  328 U.

Nonetheless, the Court, per Justice Frankfurter, concluded that due regard for the effective working of our Government revealed this issue to be of a peculiarly political nature and therefore not meet for judicial determination.  Id., at 552.

						 The pluralitys reluctance to recognize the justiciability of partisan gerrymanders seems driven in part by a fear that recognizing such claims will give rise to a flood of litigation.  See ante, at 16.  But the list of cases that it cites in its lengthy footnote 6, ante, at 1011, suggests that in the two decades since Bandemer, there has been an average of just three or four partisan gerrymandering cases filed every year.  That volume is obviously trivial when compared, for example, to the amount of litigation that followed our adoption of the one-person, one-vote rule.  See Reynolds v. Sims, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/377/533" class="subref" title="subref">377 U. S. 533</a> (1964)

						 Writing for the Court in Bandemer, Justice White put it well: That the characteristics of the complaining group are not immutable or that the group has not been subject to the same historical stigma may be relevant to the manner in which the case is adjudicated, but these differences do not justify a refusal to entertain such a case.  478 U. S., at 125.

						 The cases that the plurality cites today, ante, at 1012, n. 6, support the conclusion that it would have been wise to endorse the views expressed in Justice Powells dissent in Bandemer, 478 U. S., at 161, and my concurrence in Karcher v. Daggett, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/462/725" class="subref" title="subref">462 U. S. 725</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">744</a> (1983)
.  I remain convinced that our opinions correctly interpreted the law.  If that standard were applied to the statewide challenge in this case, a trial of the entire case would be required.  For the purpose of deciding this case, even though I dissented from our decision in Shaw I and remain convinced that it was incorrectly decided, I would give the Shaw cases stare decisis effect in the political gerrymandering context.  Given the Courts illogical disposition of this case, however, in future cases I would feel free to reexamine the standing issue.  I surely would not suggest that a plaintiff would never have standing to litigate a statewide claim.

						 In this sense the partisan gerrymander is the American cousin of the English rotten borough.  In the English system, Members of Parliament were elected from geographic units that remained unchanged despite population changes wrought by the Industrial Revolution.  Because representation was not based on population, vast inequities developed over time in the form of the so-called rotten boroughs.  Old Sarum, for instance, had no human residentsonly a few sheepyet sent the same number of representatives to Parliament as Yorkshire, with nearly a million inhabitants.  R. Zagarri, The Politics of Size: Representation in the United States, 17761850, p. 37 (1987) (footnote omitted).  As a result of this system, many insignificant places returned members, while many important towns did not, and even in large towns the members were often elected by a tiny fraction of the population.  J. Butler, The Passing of the Great Reform Bill 176 (1914).  Meanwhile, [t]he Government bribed the patron or member or both by means of distinctions and offices or by actual cash, and [t]he patron and member bribed the electors in the same way.  Ibid.  The rotten boroughs clearly would violate our familiar one-person, one-vote rule, but they were also troubling because the representative of such a borough owed his primary loyalty to his patron and the government rather than to his constituents (if he had any).  Similarly, in gerrymandered districts, instead of local groups defined by neutral criteria selecting their representatives, it is the architects of the districts who select the constituencies and, in effect, the representatives.

						 In the realm of federal elections, the requirement of governmental neutrality is buttressed by this Courts recognition that the Elections Clause is not  a source of power to dictate electoral outcomes, to favor or disfavor a class of candidates, or to evade important constitutional restraints.   Cook v. Gralike,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">833</a>834 (1995)
).  And this duty to govern impartially extends to executive and legislative officials alike.  Beginning as early as its first session in 1789, Congress has passed a number of statutes designed to guarantee that Executive Branch employees neutrally carry out their duties.  See Ex parte Curtis, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/106/371" class="subref" title="subref">106 U. S. 371</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">372</a>373 (1882)
.  Some of those laws avoided the danger that the government itself may be made to furnish indirectly the money to defray the expenses of keeping the political party in power that happens to have for the time being the control of the public patronage.  Id., at 375.  It is fundamental that federal employees are expected to enforce the law and execute programs of the Government without bias or favoritism for or against any political party or group or the members thereof.  Civil Service Commn v. Letter Carriers,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">564</a>565 (1973)

						 In Washington v.

						 I have elsewhere explained my view that race as a factor in the districting process is no different from any other political consideration.  Creating a majority-minority district is no better and no worse than creating an Irish-American, or Polish-American, or Italian-American district.  In all events the relevant question is whether the sovereign abrogated its obligation to govern neutrally.  See Karcher, 462 U. S., at 753754 (Stevens, J., concurring); Mobile, 446 U. S., at 88 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment); Cousins v. City Council of Chicago, 466 F. 2d 830, 850853 (CA7 1972) (Stevens, J., dissenting).

						 The pluralitys long discussion of the history of political gerrymanders is interesting, ante, at 47, but it surely is not intended to suggest that the vintage of an invidious practiceeven an American political tradition as old as the Republic, Board of Commrs, Wabaunsee Cty. v. Umbehr, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/518/668" class="subref" title="subref">518 U. S. 668</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">688</a> (1996)
 (Scalia, J., dissenting)should insulate it from constitutional review.  Compare, e.g., Bradwell v. State, 16 Wall. 130 (1873), with Nevada Dept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/538/721" class="subref" title="subref">538 U. S. 721</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">729</a> (2003)
.  The historical discussion might be relevant if it attempted to justify political gerrymandering as an acceptable use of governmental power.  In the end, however, the pluralitys defense of its position comes down to the unconvincing assertion that it lacks the juridical capacity to administer the standards the Court fashioned in its recent racial gerrymandering jurisprudence.

						 Because race so seldom provides a rational basis for a governmental decision, racial classifications almost always fail to survive rational basis scrutiny.  But [n]ot every decision influenced by race is equally objectionable.  Grutter v. Bollinger,

.  When race is used as the basis for making predictive political judgments, it may be as reliable (or unreliable) as other group characteristics, such as political affiliation, economic status, or national origin.  The fact that race is an immutable characteristic does not mean that there is anything immutable or certain about the political behavior of the members of any racial class.  See Mobile v. Bolden,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">88</a> (1980)
 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment).  Registered Republicans of all races sometimes vote for Democratic candidates, and vice versa.


The plurality asserts that a persons politics, unlike her race, is not readily discernible.  Ante, at 17.  But that assertion is belied by the evidence that the architects of political gerrymanders seem to have no difficulty in discerning the voters political affiliation.  After all, eligibility to vote in primary elections often requires the citizen to register her party affiliation, but it never requires her to register her race.

						 The one-person, one-vote rule obviously constitutes a neutral districting criterion, but our gerrymandering cases have never cited that principle as one of the traditional criteria that may serve to defeat a claim that a district has been gerrymandered on racial lines.  Shaw I, 509 U. S., at 647.  Thus, I would require that a district be justified with reference to both the one-person, one-vote rule and some other neutral criterion.  See Bandemer, 478 U.

				The central question presented by this case is whether political gerrymandering claims are justiciable.  Although our reasons for coming to this conclusion differ, five Members of the Court are convinced that the pluralitys answer to that question is erroneous.  Moreover, as is apparent from our separate writings today, we share the view that, even if these appellants are not entitled to prevail, it would be contrary to precedent and profoundly unwise to foreclose all judicial review of similar claims that might be advanced in the future.  That we presently have somewhat differing viewsconcerning both the precedential value of some of our recent cases and the standard that should be applied in future casesshould not obscure the fact that the areas of agreement set forth in the separate opinions are of far greater significance.

.  Todays plurality opinion would exempt governing officials from that duty in the context of legislative redistricting and would give license, for the first time, to partisan gerrymanders that are devoid

, we have not reached agreement on the standard that should govern partisan gerrymanderying claims.  I would decide this case on a narrow ground.

I agree with the Courts refusal to undertake that ambitious project.

				<em>

				Given this clear line of precedents, I should have thought the question of justiciability in cases such as thiswhere a set of plaintiffs argues that a single motivation resulted in a districting scheme with discriminatory effectsto be well settled.  The pluralitys contrary conclusion cannot be squared with our long history of voting rights decisions. Especially perplexing is the pluralitys 
				<em>
					ipse dixit
				</em>
				 distinction of our racial gerrymandering cases.  Notably, the plurality does not argue that the judicially manageable standards that have been used to adjudicate racial gerrymandering claims would not be equally manageable in political gerrymandering cases.  Instead, its distinction of those cases rests on its view that race as a districting criterion is much more rarely encountered than partisanship, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16, and that determining whether racea rare and constitutionally suspect motivedominated a districting decision is quite different from determining whether [such a decision] is so substantially affected by the excess of an ordinary and lawful motive as to [be] invali[d],

				 Court was correct to entertain that statewide challenge, because the plaintiffs in that case alleged a group harm that affected members of their party throughout the State.

				  That requirement applies with full force to districting decisions.  The line that divides a racial or ethnic minority unevenly between school districts can be entirely legitimate if chosen on the basis of neutral factorscounty lines, for example, or a natural boundary such as a river or major thoroughfare.

				Consistent with that principle, our recent racial gerrymandering cases have examined the shape of the district and the purpose of the districting body to determine whether race, above all other criteria, predominated in the line-drawing process.  We began by holding in 
				<em>
					Shaw I
				</em>
				 that a districting scheme could be so irrational on its face that it [could] be understood only as an effort to segregate voters into separate voting districts because of their race.  509 U. S., at 658.  Then, in 
				<em>
					Miller

				, we explained that 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
            <em>
					Shaw I
				</em>
				s irrational-shape test did not treat the bizarreness of a districts lines itself as a constitutional violation; rather, the irregularity of the districts contours in 
				<em>
					Shaw I
				</em>
				 was persuasive circumstantial evidence that race for its own sake, and not other districting principles, was the legislatures dominant and controlling rationale in drawing its district lines.  515 U. S., at 913.  Under the 
				<em>
					Shaw
				</em>
				 cases, then, the use of race as a criterion in redistricting is not 
				<em>
					per se
				</em>
				 impermissible, see

				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/517/899" class="subref" title="subref">517 U. S. 899</a>, but when race is elevated to paramount statuswhen it is the be-all and end-all of the redistricting processthe legislature has gone too far.  Race must not simply have been

				Just as irrational shape can serve as an objective indicator of an impermissible legislative purpose, other objective features of a districting map can save the plan from invalidation.  We have explained that traditional districting principles, which include compactness, contiguity, and respect for political subdivisions, are important not because they are constitutionally required … but because they are objective factors that may serve to defeat a claim that a district has been gerrymandered on racial lines.

				In my view, the same standards should apply to claims of political gerrymandering, for the essence of a gerrymander is the same regardless of whether the group is identified as political or racial.  Gerrymandering always involves the drawing of district boundaries to maximize the voting strength of the dominant political faction and to minimize the strength of one or more groups of opponents.

				The racial gerrymandering cases therefore supply a judicially manageable standard for determining when partisanship, like race, has played too great of a role in the districting process.  Just as race can be a factor in, but cannot dictate the outcome of, the districting process, so too can partisanship be a permissible consideration in drawing district lines, so long as it does not predominate.  If, as plaintiff-appellant Furey has alleged, the predominant motive of the legislators who designed District 6, and the sole justification for its bizarre shape, was a purpose to discriminate against a political minority, that invidious purpose should invalidate the district.

				  Under my analysis, if no neutral criterion can be identified to justify the lines drawn, and if the only possible explanation for a districts bizarre shape is a naked desire to increase partisan strength, then no rational basis exists to save the district from an equal protection challenge.

				  Because this complaint states a claim under a judicially manage-

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The plurality candidly acknowledges that legislatures can fashion standards to remedy political gerrymandering that are perfectly manageable and, indeed, that the legislatures in Iowa and elsewhere have done so.

				, at 7, n. 4.  If a violation of the Constitution is found, a court could impose a remedy patterned after such a statute.  Thus, the problem, in the pluralitys view, is not that there is no judicially manageable standard to fix an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander, but rather that the Judiciary lacks the ability to determine when a state legislature has violated its duty to govern impartially. 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">

						 In Colegrove, for example, the Illinois Legislature had drawn the States district lines under the 1901 State Apportionment Act and had not reapportioned in the four ensuing decades, despite census figures indicating great changes in the distribution of the population.  328 U. S., at 569 (Black, J., dissenting).  The populations of Illinois districts in 1945 consequently ranged from 112,000 in the least populous district to 900,000 in the most.  Ibid.  Nonetheless, the Court, per Justice Frankfurter, concluded that due regard for the effective working of our Government revealed this issue to be of a peculiarly political nature and therefore not meet for judicial determination.  Id., at 552.  Fewer than 20 years later, the Court, confronted with a strikingly similar set of factsa Tennessee apportionment plan set by a 1901 statute that had remained virtually unchanged despite dramatic population growthheld, in obvious tension with Colegrove, that the complaint stated a justiciable cause of action.  Baker, 369 U. S., at 192, 197198.  The Court distinguished Colegrove as simply a refusal to exercise equitys powers.  369 U. S., at 235.

						 The plurality opinion seems to assume that the dissenting opinions in Umbehr, 518 U. S., at 686 (Scalia, J.), and Rutan, 497 U.

Cf. ante, at 4 (tracing the history of political gerrymanders to the beginning of the 18th century).  But [o]ur inquiry does not begin with the judgment of history; [r]ather, inquiry must commence with identification of the constitutional limitations implicated by a challenged governmental practice.  Elrod, 427 U.

						 The pluralitys reluctance to recognize the justiciability of partisan gerrymanders seems driven in part by a fear that recognizing such claims will give rise to a flood of litigation.  See ante, at 16.  But the list of cases that it cites in its lengthy footnote 6, ante, at 1011, suggests that in the two decades since Bandemer, there has been an average of just three or four partisan gerrymandering cases filed every year.  That volume is obviously trivial when compared, for example, to the amount of litigation that followed our adoption of the one-person, one-vote rule.  See Reynolds v. Sims, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/377/533" class="subref" title="subref">377 U. S. 533</a> (1964)

						 Writing for the Court in Bandemer, Justice White put it well: That the characteristics of the complaining group are not immutable or that the group has not been subject to the same historical stigma may be relevant to the manner in which the case is adjudicated, but these differences do not justify a refusal to entertain such a case.  478 U.

						 The cases that the plurality cites today, ante, at 1012, n. 6, support the conclusion that it would have been wise to endorse the views expressed in Justice Powells dissent in Bandemer, 478 U. S., at 161, and my concurrence in Karcher v. Daggett,

.  I remain convinced that our opinions correctly interpreted the law.  If that standard were applied to the statewide challenge in this case, a trial of the entire case would be required.  For the purpose of deciding this case, even though I dissented from our decision in Shaw I and remain convinced that it was incorrectly decided, I would give the Shaw cases stare decisis effect in the political gerrymandering context.  Given the Courts illogical disposition of this case, however, in future cases I would feel free to reexamine the standing issue.  I surely would not suggest that a plaintiff would never have standing to litigate a statewide claim.

						 In this sense the partisan gerrymander is the American cousin of the English rotten borough.  In the English system, Members of Parliament were elected from geographic units that remained unchanged despite population changes wrought by the Industrial Revolution.  Because representation was not based on population, vast inequities developed over time in the form of the so-called rotten boroughs.  Old Sarum, for instance, had no human residentsonly a few sheepyet sent the same number of representatives to Parliament as Yorkshire, with nearly a million inhabitants.  R. Zagarri, The Politics of Size: Representation in the United States, 17761850, p. 37 (1987) (footnote omitted).  As a result of this system, many insignificant places returned members, while many important towns did not, and even in large towns the members were often elected by a tiny fraction of the population.  J. Butler, The Passing of the Great Reform Bill 176 (1914).  Meanwhile, [t]he Government bribed the patron or member or both by means of distinctions and offices or by actual cash, and [t]he patron and member bribed the electors in the same way.  Ibid.  The rotten boroughs clearly would violate our familiar one-person, one-vote rule, but they were also troubling because the representative of such a borough owed his primary loyalty to his patron and the government rather than to his constituents (if he had any).  Similarly, in gerrymandered districts, instead of local groups defined by neutral criteria selecting their representatives, it is the architects of the districts who select the constituencies and, in effect, the representatives.

						 In the realm of federal elections, the requirement of governmental neutrality is buttressed by this Courts recognition that the Elections Clause is not  a source of power to dictate electoral outcomes, to favor or disfavor a class of candidates, or to evade important constitutional restraints.   Cook v. Gralike,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">833</a>834 (1995)
).  And this duty to govern impartially extends to executive and legislative officials alike.  Beginning as early as its first session in 1789, Congress has passed a number of statutes designed to guarantee that Executive Branch employees neutrally carry out their duties.  See Ex parte Curtis, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/106/371" class="subref" title="subref">106 U. S. 371</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">372</a>373 (1882)
.  Some of those laws avoided the danger that the government itself may be made to furnish indirectly the money to defray the expenses of keeping the political party in power that happens to have for the time being the control of the public patronage.  Id., at 375.  It is fundamental that federal employees are expected to enforce the law and execute programs of the Government without bias or favoritism for or against any political party or group or the members thereof.  Civil Service Commn v. Letter Carriers,

						 I have elsewhere explained my view that race as a factor in the districting process is no different from any other political consideration.  Creating a majority-minority district is no better and no worse than creating an Irish-American, or Polish-American, or Italian-American district.  In all events the relevant question is whether the sovereign abrogated its obligation to govern neutrally.  See Karcher, 462 U. S., at 753754 (Stevens, J., concurring); Mobile, 446 U. S., at 88 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment); Cousins v. City Council of Chicago, 466 F. 2d 830, 850853 (CA7 1972) (Stevens, J., dissenting).

						 The pluralitys long discussion of the history of political gerrymanders is interesting, ante, at 47, but it surely is not intended to suggest that the vintage of an invidious practiceeven an American political tradition as old as the Republic, Board of Commrs, Wabaunsee Cty. v.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">688</a> (1996)
 (Scalia, J., dissenting)should insulate it from constitutional review.  Compare, e.g., Bradwell v. State, 16 Wall. 130 (1873), with Nevada Dept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/538/721" class="subref" title="subref">538 U. S. 721</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">729</a> (2003)
.  The historical discussion might be relevant if it attempted to justify political gerrymandering as an acceptable use of governmental power.  In the end, however, the pluralitys defense of its position comes down to the unconvincing assertion that it lacks the juridical capacity to administer the standards the Court fashioned in its recent racial gerrymandering jurisprudence.

Consistent with these statements, the District Court in a recent case correctly described political gerrymandering as a purely partisan exercise and an abuse of power that, at its core, evinces a fundamental distrust of voters, serving the self-interest of the political parties at the expense of the public good.  App. to Juris.

						 Because race so seldom provides a rational basis for a governmental decision, racial classifications almost always fail to survive rational basis scrutiny.  But [n]ot every decision influenced by race is equally objectionable.  Grutter v. Bollinger, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/539/306" class="subref" title="subref">539 U. S. 306</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">327</a> (2003)
.  When race is used as the basis for making predictive political judgments, it may be as reliable (or unreliable) as other group characteristics, such as political affiliation, economic status, or national origin.  The fact that race is an immutable characteristic does not mean that there is anything immutable or certain about the political behavior of the members of any racial class.  See Mobile v. Bolden, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/446/55" class="subref" title="subref">446 U. S. 55</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">88</a> (1980)
 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment).  Registered Republicans of all races sometimes vote for Democratic candidates, and vice versa.


The plurality asserts that a persons politics, unlike her race, is not readily discernible.  Ante, at 17.  But that assertion is belied by the evidence that the architects of political gerrymanders seem to have no difficulty in discerning the voters political affiliation.  After all, eligibility to vote in primary elections often requires the citizen to register her party affiliation, but it never requires her to register her race.

						 The one-person, one-vote rule obviously constitutes a neutral districting criterion, but our gerrymandering cases have never cited that principle as one of the traditional criteria that may serve to defeat a claim that a district has been gerrymandered on racial lines.  Shaw I, 509 U. S., at 647.  Thus, I would require that a district be justified with reference to both the one-person, one-vote rule and some other neutral criterion.  See Bandemer, 478 U.

				The central question presented by this case is whether political gerrymandering claims are justiciable.  Although our reasons for coming to this conclusion differ, five Members of the Court are convinced that the pluralitys answer to that question is erroneous.  Moreover, as is apparent from our separate writings today, we share the view that, even if these appellants are not entitled to prevail, it would be contrary to precedent and profoundly unwise to foreclose all judicial review of similar claims that might be advanced in the future.  That we presently have somewhat differing viewsconcerning both the precedential value of some of our recent cases and the standard that should be applied in future casesshould not obscure the fact that the areas of agreement set forth in the separate opinions are of far greater significance.

.  Todays plurality opinion would exempt governing officials from that duty in the context of legislative redistricting and would give license, for the first time, to partisan gerrymanders that are devoid
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				of any rational justification.  In my view, when parti-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>

, we have not reached agreement on the standard that should govern partisan gerrymanderying claims.  I would decide this case on a narrow ground.  Plaintiff-appellants urge us to craft new rules that in effect would authorize judicial review of statewide election results to protect the democratic process from a transient majoritys abuse of its power to define voting districts.  I agree with the Courts refusal to undertake that ambitious project.  
				<em>
					Ante

				, at 15.  I am persuaded, however, that the District Court failed to apply well-settled propositions of law when it granted the defendants motion to dismiss plaintiff-appellant Susan Fureys gerrymandering claim.

				 pluralitys rejection of a statewide claim of political gerrymandering; and (3) that she has stated a claim that, at least with respect to District 6, Pennsylvanias redistricting plan violates the equal protection principles enunciated in our voting rights cases both before and after

				<em>

, the Court invalidated an Alabama statute that altered the boundaries of the city of Tuskegee from a square to an uncouth twenty-eight-sided figure for the sole purpose of preventing African-Americans from voting in municipal elections.  The allegations of bizarre shape and improper motive, if proven, would abundantly [have] establish[ed] that Act 140 was not an ordinary geographic redistricting measure even within familiar abuses of gerrymandering.

				Given this clear line of precedents, I should have thought the question of justiciability in cases such as thiswhere a set of plaintiffs argues that a single motivation resulted in a districting scheme with discriminatory effectsto be well settled.  The pluralitys contrary conclusion cannot be squared with our long history of voting rights decisions. Especially perplexing is the pluralitys 
				<em>
					ipse dixit
				</em>
				 distinction of our racial gerrymandering cases.  Notably, the plurality does not argue that the judicially manageable standards that have been used to adjudicate racial gerrymandering claims would not be equally manageable in political gerrymandering cases.  Instead, its distinction of those cases rests on its view that race as a districting criterion is much more rarely encountered than partisanship, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16, and that determining whether racea rare and constitutionally suspect motivedominated a districting decision is quite different from determining whether [such a decision] is so substantially affected by the excess of an ordinary and lawful motive as to [be] invali[d], 
				<em>

				The plurality opinion in 
				<em>

				 dealt with a claim that the Indiana apportionment scheme for state legislative districts discriminated against Democratic voters on a statewide basis.  478 U. S., at 127.  In my judgment, the 
				<em>
					Bandemer
				</em>
				 Court was correct to entertain that statewide challenge, because the plaintiffs in that case alleged a group harm that affected members of their party throughout the State.  In the subsequent line of racial gerrymandering cases, however, the Court shifted its focus from statewide challenges and required, as a matter of standing, that plaintiffs stating race-based equal protection claims actually reside in the districts they are challenging.

				<em>
					Hays
				</em>
				 has altered the standing rules for gerrymandering claimsand because, in my view, racial and political gerrymanders are species of the same constitutional concernthe

Much like the plaintiff-appellees in

				  That requirement applies with full force to districting decisions.  The line that divides a racial or ethnic minority unevenly between school districts can be entirely legitimate if chosen on the basis of neutral factorscounty lines, for example, or a natural boundary such as a river or major thoroughfare.

				Consistent with that principle, our recent racial gerrymandering cases have examined the shape of the district and the purpose of the districting body to determine whether race, above all other criteria, predominated in the line-drawing process.  We began by holding in 
				<em>
					Shaw I
				</em>
				 that a districting scheme could be so irrational on its face that it [could] be understood only as an effort to segregate voters into separate voting districts because of their race.  509 U. S., at 658.  Then, in

				<span class="softbreak"></span>
            <em>

				</em>
				s irrational-shape test did not treat the bizarreness of a districts lines itself as a constitutional violation; rather, the irregularity of the districts contours in 
				<em>
					Shaw I
				</em>
				 was persuasive circumstantial evidence that race for its own sake, and not other districting principles, was the legislatures dominant and controlling rationale in drawing its district lines.  515 U. S., at 913.  Under the 
				<em>

				Just as irrational shape can serve as an objective indicator of an impermissible legislative purpose, other objective features of a districting map can save the plan from invalidation.

				In my view, the same standards should apply to claims of political gerrymandering, for the essence of a gerrymander is the same regardless of whether the group is identified as political or racial.  Gerrymandering always involves the drawing of district boundaries to maximize the voting strength of the dominant political faction and to minimize the strength of one or more groups of opponents.

				The racial gerrymandering cases therefore supply a judicially manageable standard for determining when partisanship, like race, has played too great of a role in the districting process.  Just as race can be a factor in, but cannot dictate the outcome of, the districting process, so too can partisanship be a permissible consideration in drawing district lines, so long as it does not predominate.  If, as plaintiff-appellant Furey has alleged, the predominant motive of the legislators who designed District 6, and the sole justification for its bizarre shape, was a purpose to discriminate against a political minority, that invidious purpose should invalidate the district.

				  Thus, the view that the plurality implicitly embraces todaythat a gerrymander contrived for the sole purpose of disadvantaging a political minority is less objectionable than one seeking to benefit a racial minorityis doubly flawed.

				  Under my analysis, if no neutral criterion can be identified to justify the lines drawn, and if the only possible explanation for a districts bizarre shape is a naked desire to increase partisan strength, then no rational basis exists to save the district from an equal protection challenge.

See ante, at 16.  But the list of cases that it cites in its lengthy footnote 6, ante, at 1011, suggests that in the two decades since Bandemer, there has been an average of just three or four partisan gerrymandering cases filed every year.  That volume is obviously trivial when compared, for example, to the amount of litigation that followed our adoption of the one-person, one-vote rule.  See Reynolds v. Sims,

.  I remain convinced that our opinions correctly interpreted the law.  If that standard were applied to the statewide challenge in this case, a trial of the entire case would be required.  For the purpose of deciding this case, even though I dissented from our decision in Shaw I and remain convinced that it was incorrectly decided, I would give the Shaw cases stare decisis effect in the political gerrymandering context.  Given the Courts illogical disposition of this case, however, in future cases I would feel free to reexamine the standing issue.  I surely would not suggest that a plaintiff would never have standing to litigate a statewide claim.

						 In this sense the partisan gerrymander is the American cousin of the English rotten borough.  In the English system, Members of Parliament were elected from geographic units that remained unchanged despite population changes wrought by the Industrial Revolution.  Because representation was not based on population, vast inequities developed over time in the form of the so-called rotten boroughs.  Old Sarum, for instance, had no human residentsonly a few sheepyet sent the same number of representatives to Parliament as Yorkshire, with nearly a million inhabitants.  R. Zagarri, The Politics of Size: Representation in the United States, 17761850, p. 37 (1987) (footnote omitted).  As a result of this system, many insignificant places returned members, while many important towns did not, and even in large towns the members were often elected by a tiny fraction of the population.  J. Butler, The Passing of the Great Reform Bill 176 (1914).  Meanwhile, [t]he Government bribed the patron or member or both by means of distinctions and offices or by actual cash, and [t]he patron and member bribed the electors in the same way.  Ibid.  The rotten boroughs clearly would violate our familiar one-person, one-vote rule, but they were also troubling because the representative of such a borough owed his primary loyalty to his patron and the government rather than to his constituents (if he had any).  Similarly, in gerrymandered districts, instead of local groups defined by neutral criteria selecting their representatives, it is the architects of the districts who select the constituencies and, in effect, the representatives.

						 In the realm of federal elections, the requirement of governmental neutrality is buttressed by this Courts recognition that the Elections Clause is not  a source of power to dictate electoral outcomes, to favor or disfavor a class of candidates, or to evade important constitutional restraints.   Cook v. Gralike,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">833</a>834 (1995)
).  And this duty to govern impartially extends to executive and legislative officials alike.  Beginning as early as its first session in 1789, Congress has passed a number of statutes designed to guarantee that Executive Branch employees neutrally carry out their duties.  See Ex parte Curtis, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/106/371" class="subref" title="subref">106 U. S. 371</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">372</a>373 (1882)
.  Some of those laws avoided the danger that the government itself may be made to furnish indirectly the money to defray the expenses of keeping the political party in power that happens to have for the time being the control of the public patronage.  Id., at 375.  It is fundamental that federal employees are expected to enforce the law and execute programs of the Government without bias or favoritism for or against any political party or group or the members thereof.  Civil Service Commn v. Letter Carriers,

						 In Washington v.

						 I have elsewhere explained my view that race as a factor in the districting process is no different from any other political consideration.  Creating a majority-minority district is no better and no worse than creating an Irish-American, or Polish-American, or Italian-American district.  In all events the relevant question is whether the sovereign abrogated its obligation to govern neutrally.  See Karcher, 462 U. S., at 753754 (Stevens, J., concurring); Mobile, 446 U.

						 The pluralitys long discussion of the history of political gerrymanders is interesting, ante, at 47, but it surely is not intended to suggest that the vintage of an invidious practiceeven an American political tradition as old as the Republic, Board of Commrs, Wabaunsee Cty. v.

.  The historical discussion might be relevant if it attempted to justify political gerrymandering as an acceptable use of governmental power.

						 Because race so seldom provides a rational basis for a governmental decision, racial classifications almost always fail to survive rational basis scrutiny.  But [n]ot every decision influenced by race is equally objectionable.  Grutter v. Bollinger,

.  When race is used as the basis for making predictive political judgments, it may be as reliable (or unreliable) as other group characteristics, such as political affiliation, economic status, or national origin.  The fact that race is an immutable characteristic does not mean that there is anything immutable or certain about the political behavior of the members of any racial class.  See Mobile v. Bolden, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/446/55" class="subref" title="subref">446 U. S. 55</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">88</a> (1980)
 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment).  Registered Republicans of all races sometimes vote for Democratic candidates, and vice versa.


The plurality asserts that a persons politics, unlike her race, is not readily discernible.  Ante, at 17.  But that assertion is belied by the evidence that the architects of political gerrymanders seem to have no difficulty in discerning the voters political affiliation.  After all, eligibility to vote in primary elections often requires the citizen to register her party affiliation, but it never requires her to register her race.

						 The one-person, one-vote rule obviously constitutes a neutral districting criterion, but our gerrymandering cases have never cited that principle as one of the traditional criteria that may serve to defeat a claim that a district has been gerrymandered on racial lines.  Shaw I, 509 U.

				The central question presented by this case is whether political gerrymandering claims are justiciable.  Although our reasons for coming to this conclusion differ, five Members of the Court are convinced that the pluralitys answer to that question is erroneous.  Moreover, as is apparent from our separate writings today, we share the view that, even if these appellants are not entitled to prevail, it would be contrary to precedent and profoundly unwise to foreclose all judicial review of similar claims that might be advanced in the future.  That we presently have somewhat differing viewsconcerning both the precedential value of some of our recent cases and the standard that should be applied in future casesshould not obscure the fact that the areas of agreement set forth in the separate opinions are of far greater significance.

.  Todays plurality opinion would exempt governing officials from that duty in the context of legislative redistricting and would give license, for the first time, to partisan gerrymanders that are devoid

, we have not reached agreement on the standard that should govern partisan gerrymanderying claims.  I would decide this case on a narrow ground.  Plaintiff-appellants urge us to craft new rules that in effect would authorize judicial review of statewide election results to protect the democratic process from a transient majoritys abuse of its power to define voting districts.  I agree with the Courts refusal to undertake that ambitious project.  
				<em>

				, at 15.  I am persuaded, however, that the District Court failed to apply well-settled propositions of law when it granted the defendants motion to dismiss plaintiff-appellant Susan Fureys gerrymandering claim.

				According to the complaint, Furey is a registered Democrat who resides at an address in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, that was located under the 1992 districting plan in Congressional District 13.

				  In my judgment, Fureys allegations are plainly sufficient to establish: (1) that she has standing to challenge the constitutionality of District 6; (2) that her district-specific claim is not foreclosed by the 
				<em>
					Bandemer
				</em>
				 pluralitys rejection of a statewide claim of political gerrymandering; and (3) that she has stated a claim that, at least with respect to District 6, Pennsylvanias redistricting plan violates the equal protection principles enunciated in our voting rights cases both before and after

				.  The District Court therefore erred when it granted the defendants motion to dismiss Fureys claim.

Nor need the appellants, in order to succeed in this action, ask the Court to enter upon policy determinations for which judicially manageable standards are lacking.  Judicial standards under the Equal Protection Clause are well developed and familiar, and it has been open to courts since the enactment of the

				At issue in this case, as the plurality states, 
				<em>
					ante

				<em>
					Baker
				</em>
				s second testthe presence or absence of judicially manageable standards.  The judicial standards applicable to gerrymandering claims are deeply rooted in decisions that long preceded 
				<em>
					Bandemer 
				</em>
				and have been refined in later cases.  Among those well-settled principles is the understanding that a districts peculiar shape might be a symptom of an illicit purpose in the line-drawing process.  Most notably, in 
				<em>
					Gomillion
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Lightfoot,

            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/364/339" class="subref" title="subref">364 U. S. 339</a>,

, the Court invalidated an Alabama statute that altered the boundaries of the city of Tuskegee from a square to an uncouth twenty-eight-sided figure for the sole purpose of preventing African-Americans from voting in municipal elections.  The allegations of bizarre shape and improper motive, if proven, would abundantly [have] establish[ed] that Act 140 was not an ordinary geographic redistricting measure even within familiar abuses of gerrymandering.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">538</a> (1969)
, which referred to gerrymandering as the deliberate and arbitrary distortion of district boundaries and populations for partisan or personal political purposes, also identified both shape and purpose as relevant standards.  The maps attached as exhibits in 
				<em>
					Gomillion
				</em>
				, 364 U. S., at 348 (Appendix to opinion of the Court), and in subsequent voting rights cases demonstrate that an uncouth or bizarre shape can easily identify a district designed for a single-minded, nonneutral purpose.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				With purpose as the ultimate inquiry, other considerations have supplied ready standards for testing the lawfulness of a gerrymander.  In his dissent in 
				<em>
					Bandemer
				</em>
				, Justice Powell explained that the merits of a gerrymandering claim must be determined by reference to the configurations of the districts, the observance of political subdivision lines, and other criteria that have independent relevance to the fairness of redistricting.  478 U. S., at 165.  Applying this three-part standard, Justice Powell first reviewed the procedures used in Indianas redistricting process and noted that the party in power had excluded the opposition from its deliberations and had placed excessive weight on data concerning party voting trends.

				The Court has made use of all three parts of Justice Powells standard in its recent racial gerrymandering jurisprudence.

				Given this clear line of precedents, I should have thought the question of justiciability in cases such as thiswhere a set of plaintiffs argues that a single motivation resulted in a districting scheme with discriminatory effectsto be well settled.  The pluralitys contrary conclusion cannot be squared with our long history of voting rights decisions. Especially perplexing is the pluralitys 
				<em>
					ipse dixit
				</em>
				 distinction of our racial gerrymandering cases.  Notably, the plurality does not argue that the judicially manageable standards that have been used to adjudicate racial gerrymandering claims would not be equally manageable in political gerrymandering cases.  Instead, its distinction of those cases rests on its view that race as a districting criterion is much more rarely encountered than partisanship, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16, and that determining whether racea rare and constitutionally suspect motivedominated a districting decision is quite different from determining whether [such a decision] is so substantially affected by the excess of an ordinary and lawful motive as to [be] invali[d],

				The plurality opinion in 
				<em>
					Bandemer

				 dealt with a claim that the Indiana apportionment scheme for state legislative districts discriminated against Democratic voters on a statewide basis.  478 U. S., at 127.  In my judgment, the 
				<em>
					Bandemer
				</em>
				 Court was correct to entertain that statewide challenge, because the plaintiffs in that case alleged a group harm that affected members of their party throughout the State.  In the subsequent line of racial gerrymandering cases, however, the Court shifted its focus from statewide challenges and required, as a matter of standing, that plaintiffs stating race-based equal protection claims actually reside in the districts they are challenging.  See 
				<em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">745</a> (1995)
.  Because 
				<em>
					Hays
				</em>
				 has altered the standing rules for gerrymandering claimsand because, in my view, racial and political gerrymanders are species of the same constitutional concernthe 
				<em>
					Hays
				</em>
				 standing rule requires dismissal of the statewide claim.

				In a challenge to a statewide districting plan, the plaintiff-appellants complain that they have been injured because of their membership in a particular, identifiable group.  The plaintiff-appellees in

They specifically claimed that they were injured as members of a group because the number of Democratic representatives was not commensurate with the number of Democratic voters throughout Indiana.  Much like the plaintiff-appellees in 
				<em>

				Consistent with that principle, our recent racial gerrymandering cases have examined the shape of the district and the purpose of the districting body to determine whether race, above all other criteria, predominated in the line-drawing process.  We began by holding in 
				<em>
					Shaw I
				</em>
				 that a districting scheme could be so irrational on its face that it [could] be understood only as an effort to segregate voters into separate voting districts because of their race.  509 U. S., at 658.  Then, in 
				<em>
					Miller

				<span class="softbreak"></span>
            <em>
					Shaw I

				s irrational-shape test did not treat the bizarreness of a districts lines itself as a constitutional violation; rather, the irregularity of the districts contours in 
				<em>
					Shaw I
				</em>
				 was persuasive circumstantial evidence that race for its own sake, and not other districting principles, was the legislatures dominant and controlling rationale in drawing its district lines.  515 U. S., at 913.  Under the 
				<em>
					Shaw
				</em>
				 cases, then, the use of race as a criterion in redistricting is not 
				<em>
					per se
				</em>
				 impermissible, see

				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/517/899" class="subref" title="subref">517 U. S. 899</a>, but when race is elevated to paramount statuswhen it is the be-all and end-all of the redistricting processthe legislature has gone too far.  Race must not simply have been

				Just as irrational shape can serve as an objective indicator of an impermissible legislative purpose, other objective features of a districting map can save the plan from invalidation.  We have explained that traditional districting principles, which include compactness, contiguity, and respect for political subdivisions, are important not because they are constitutionally required … but because they are objective factors that may serve to defeat a claim that a district has been gerrymandered on racial lines.

				The racial gerrymandering cases therefore supply a judicially manageable standard for determining when partisanship, like race, has played too great of a role in the districting process.  Just as race can be a factor in, but cannot dictate the outcome of, the districting process, so too can partisanship be a permissible consideration in drawing district lines, so long as it does not predominate.  If, as plaintiff-appellant Furey has alleged, the predominant motive of the legislators who designed District 6, and the sole justification for its bizarre shape, was a purpose to discriminate against a political minority, that invidious purpose should invalidate the district.

				  Thus, the view that the plurality implicitly embraces todaythat a gerrymander contrived for the sole purpose of disadvantaging a political minority is less objectionable than one seeking to benefit a racial minorityis doubly flawed.

						 In Colegrove, for example, the Illinois Legislature had drawn the States district lines under the 1901 State Apportionment Act and had not reapportioned in the four ensuing decades, despite census figures indicating great changes in the distribution of the population.  328 U. S., at 569 (Black, J., dissenting).  The populations of Illinois districts in 1945 consequently ranged from 112,000 in the least populous district to 900,000 in the most.  Ibid.  Nonetheless, the Court, per Justice Frankfurter, concluded that due regard for the effective working of our Government revealed this issue to be of a peculiarly political nature and therefore not meet for judicial determination.  Id., at 552.  Fewer than 20 years later, the Court, confronted with a strikingly similar set of factsa Tennessee apportionment plan set by a 1901 statute that had remained virtually unchanged despite dramatic population growthheld, in obvious tension with Colegrove, that the complaint stated a justiciable cause of action.

See ante, at 16.  But the list of cases that it cites in its lengthy footnote 6, ante, at 1011, suggests that in the two decades since Bandemer, there has been an average of just three or four partisan gerrymandering cases filed every year.

.  I remain convinced that our opinions correctly interpreted the law.  If that standard were applied to the statewide challenge in this case, a trial of the entire case would be required.  For the purpose of deciding this case, even though I dissented from our decision in Shaw I and remain convinced that it was incorrectly decided, I would give the Shaw cases stare decisis effect in the political gerrymandering context.  Given the Courts illogical disposition of this case, however, in future cases I would feel free to reexamine the standing issue.  I surely would not suggest that a plaintiff would never have standing to litigate a statewide claim.

						 Plaintiff-appellants Richard and Norma Jean Vieth are registered Democrats who reside in District 16.  App. to Juris. Statement 129a.  The complaint does not claim that they resided in a different district under the old districting scheme, nor does it anywhere allege, as it does on Fureys behalf, that District 16 in particular is irregularly shaped.  A glance at the appended map, infra, at 27, reveals that District 16 is not especially unusual in its contours.  Without more specific allegations regarding District 16, I would limit the analysis to District 6.

						 In this sense the partisan gerrymander is the American cousin of the English rotten borough.  In the English system, Members of Parliament were elected from geographic units that remained unchanged despite population changes wrought by the Industrial Revolution.  Because representation was not based on population, vast inequities developed over time in the form of the so-called rotten boroughs.  Old Sarum, for instance, had no human residentsonly a few sheepyet sent the same number of representatives to Parliament as Yorkshire, with nearly a million inhabitants.  R. Zagarri, The Politics of Size: Representation in the United States, 17761850, p. 37 (1987) (footnote omitted).  As a result of this system, many insignificant places returned members, while many important towns did not, and even in large towns the members were often elected by a tiny fraction of the population.  J. Butler, The Passing of the Great Reform Bill 176 (1914).  Meanwhile, [t]he Government bribed the patron or member or both by means of distinctions and offices or by actual cash, and [t]he patron and member bribed the electors in the same way.  Ibid.  The rotten boroughs clearly would violate our familiar one-person, one-vote rule, but they were also troubling because the representative of such a borough owed his primary loyalty to his patron and the government rather than to his constituents (if he had any).  Similarly, in gerrymandered districts, instead of local groups defined by neutral criteria selecting their representatives, it is the architects of the districts who select the constituencies and, in effect, the representatives.

						 In the realm of federal elections, the requirement of governmental neutrality is buttressed by this Courts recognition that the Elections Clause is not  a source of power to dictate electoral outcomes, to favor or disfavor a class of candidates, or to evade important constitutional restraints.   Cook v. Gralike,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">833</a>834 (1995)
).  And this duty to govern impartially extends to executive and legislative officials alike.  Beginning as early as its first session in 1789, Congress has passed a number of statutes designed to guarantee that Executive Branch employees neutrally carry out their duties.  See Ex parte Curtis,

.  Some of those laws avoided the danger that the government itself may be made to furnish indirectly the money to defray the expenses of keeping the political party in power that happens to have for the time being the control of the public patronage.  Id., at 375.  It is fundamental that federal employees are expected to enforce the law and execute programs of the Government without bias or favoritism for or against any political party or group or the members thereof.  Civil Service Commn v.

						 I have elsewhere explained my view that race as a factor in the districting process is no different from any other political consideration.  Creating a majority-minority district is no better and no worse than creating an Irish-American, or Polish-American, or Italian-American district.  In all events the relevant question is whether the sovereign abrogated its obligation to govern neutrally.  See Karcher, 462 U. S., at 753754 (Stevens, J., concurring); Mobile, 446 U. S., at 88 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment); Cousins v. City Council of Chicago, 466 F. 2d 830, 850853 (CA7 1972) (Stevens, J., dissenting).

						 The pluralitys long discussion of the history of political gerrymanders is interesting, ante, at 47, but it surely is not intended to suggest that the vintage of an invidious practiceeven an American political tradition as old as the Republic, Board of Commrs, Wabaunsee Cty. v.

 (Scalia, J., dissenting)should insulate it from constitutional review.  Compare, e.g., Bradwell v. State, 16 Wall. 130 (1873), with Nevada Dept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">729</a> (2003)
.  The historical discussion might be relevant if it attempted to justify political gerrymandering as an acceptable use of governmental power.  In the end, however, the pluralitys defense of its position comes down to the unconvincing assertion that it lacks the juridical capacity to administer the standards the Court fashioned in its recent racial gerrymandering jurisprudence.

						 Because race so seldom provides a rational basis for a governmental decision, racial classifications almost always fail to survive rational basis scrutiny.  But [n]ot every decision influenced by race is equally objectionable.  Grutter v. Bollinger,

.  When race is used as the basis for making predictive political judgments, it may be as reliable (or unreliable) as other group characteristics, such as political affiliation, economic status, or national origin.  The fact that race is an immutable characteristic does not mean that there is anything immutable or certain about the political behavior of the members of any racial class.  See Mobile v. Bolden, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/446/55" class="subref" title="subref">446 U. S. 55</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">88</a> (1980)
 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment).  Registered Republicans of all races sometimes vote for Democratic candidates, and vice versa.


The plurality asserts that a persons politics, unlike her race, is not readily discernible.  Ante, at 17.  But that assertion is belied by the evidence that the architects of political gerrymanders seem to have no difficulty in discerning the voters political affiliation.  After all, eligibility to vote in primary elections often requires the citizen to register her party affiliation, but it never requires her to register her race.

				The central question presented by this case is whether political gerrymandering claims are justiciable.  Although our reasons for coming to this conclusion differ, five Members of the Court are convinced that the pluralitys answer to that question is erroneous.  Moreover, as is apparent from our separate writings today, we share the view that, even if these appellants are not entitled to prevail, it would be contrary to precedent and profoundly unwise to foreclose all judicial review of similar claims that might be advanced in the future.  That we presently have somewhat differing viewsconcerning both the precedential value of some of our recent cases and the standard that should be applied in future casesshould not obscure the fact that the areas of agreement set forth in the separate opinions are of far greater significance.

.  Todays plurality opinion would exempt governing officials from that duty in the context of legislative redistricting and would give license, for the first time, to partisan gerrymanders that are devoid

, we have not reached agreement on the standard that should govern partisan gerrymanderying claims.  I would decide this case on a narrow ground.

I agree with the Courts refusal to undertake that ambitious project.

				At issue in this case, as the plurality states,

				<em>

				Given this clear line of precedents, I should have thought the question of justiciability in cases such as thiswhere a set of plaintiffs argues that a single motivation resulted in a districting scheme with discriminatory effectsto be well settled.  The pluralitys contrary conclusion cannot be squared with our long history of voting rights decisions. Especially perplexing is the pluralitys 
				<em>
					ipse dixit
				</em>
				 distinction of our racial gerrymandering cases.  Notably, the plurality does not argue that the judicially manageable standards that have been used to adjudicate racial gerrymandering claims would not be equally manageable in political gerrymandering cases.  Instead, its distinction of those cases rests on its view that race as a districting criterion is much more rarely encountered than partisanship, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16, and that determining whether racea rare and constitutionally suspect motivedominated a districting decision is quite different from determining whether [such a decision] is so substantially affected by the excess of an ordinary and lawful motive as to [be] invali[d], 
				<em>

				  But those considerations are wholly irrelevant to the issue of justiciability.

				The plurality opinion in 
				<em>

				 dealt with a claim that the Indiana apportionment scheme for state legislative districts discriminated against Democratic voters on a statewide basis.  478 U. S., at 127.  In my judgment, the

				</em>
				 Court was correct to entertain that statewide challenge, because the plaintiffs in that case alleged a group harm that affected members of their party throughout the State.  In the subsequent line of racial gerrymandering cases, however, the Court shifted its focus from statewide challenges and required, as a matter of standing, that plaintiffs stating race-based equal protection claims actually reside in the districts they are challenging.

				<em>
					Hays

				  That requirement applies with full force to districting decisions.  The line that divides a racial or ethnic minority unevenly between school districts can be entirely legitimate if chosen on the basis of neutral factorscounty lines, for example, or a natural boundary such as a river or major thoroughfare.

				Consistent with that principle, our recent racial gerrymandering cases have examined the shape of the district and the purpose of the districting body to determine whether race, above all other criteria, predominated in the line-drawing process.  We began by holding in 
				<em>
					Shaw I
				</em>
				 that a districting scheme could be so irrational on its face that it [could] be understood only as an effort to segregate voters into separate voting districts because of their race.  509 U. S., at 658.  Then, in 
				<em>
					Miller
				</em>
				, we explained that 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
            <em>
					Shaw I
				</em>
				s irrational-shape test did not treat the bizarreness of a districts lines itself as a constitutional violation; rather, the irregularity of the districts contours in 
				<em>
					Shaw I
				</em>
				 was persuasive circumstantial evidence that race for its own sake, and not other districting principles, was the legislatures dominant and controlling rationale in drawing its district lines.  515 U. S., at 913.  Under the 
				<em>
					Shaw
				</em>
				 cases, then, the use of race as a criterion in redistricting is not 
				<em>
					per se
				</em>
				 impermissible, see

				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/517/899" class="subref" title="subref">517 U. S. 899</a>, but when race is elevated to paramount statuswhen it is the be-all and end-all of the redistricting processthe legislature has gone too far.  Race must not simply have been

				Just as irrational shape can serve as an objective indicator of an impermissible legislative purpose, other objective features of a districting map can save the plan from invalidation.  We have explained that traditional districting principles, which include compactness, contiguity, and respect for political subdivisions, are important not because they are constitutionally required … but because they are objective factors that may serve to defeat a claim that a district has been gerrymandered on racial lines.

				In my view, the same standards should apply to claims of political gerrymandering, for the essence of a gerrymander is the same regardless of whether the group is identified as political or racial.  Gerrymandering always involves the drawing of district boundaries to maximize the voting strength of the dominant political faction and to minimize the strength of one or more groups of opponents.

				  It follows that the standards that enable courts to identify and redress a racial gerrymander could also perform the same function for other species of gerrymanders.  See

				The racial gerrymandering cases therefore supply a judicially manageable standard for determining when partisanship, like race, has played too great of a role in the districting process.  Just as race can be a factor in, but cannot dictate the outcome of, the districting process, so too can partisanship be a permissible consideration in drawing district lines, so long as it does not predominate.  If, as plaintiff-appellant Furey has alleged, the predominant motive of the legislators who designed District 6, and the sole justification for its bizarre shape, was a purpose to discriminate against a political minority, that invidious purpose should invalidate the district.

				  Thus, the view that the plurality implicitly embraces todaythat a gerrymander contrived for the sole purpose of disadvantaging a political minority is less objectionable than one seeking to benefit a racial minorityis doubly flawed.  It disregards the obvious distinction between an invidious and a benign purpose, and it mistakenly assumes that race cannot provide a legitimate basis for making political judgments.

				  Because this complaint states a claim under a judicially manage-

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The plurality candidly acknowledges that legislatures can fashion standards to remedy political gerrymandering that are perfectly manageable and, indeed, that the legislatures in Iowa and elsewhere have done so.

				, at 7, n. 4.  If a violation of the Constitution is found, a court could impose a remedy patterned after such a statute.  Thus, the problem, in the pluralitys view, is not that there is no judicially manageable standard to fix an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander, but rather that the Judiciary lacks the ability to determine when a state legislature has violated its duty to govern impartially. 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Quite obviously, however, several standards for identifying impermissible partisan influence are available to judges who have the will to enforce them.  We could hold that every district boundary must have a neutral justification; we could apply Justice Powells three-factor approach in

						 In Colegrove, for example, the Illinois Legislature had drawn the States district lines under the 1901 State Apportionment Act and had not reapportioned in the four ensuing decades, despite census figures indicating great changes in the distribution of the population.  328 U. S., at 569 (Black, J., dissenting).  The populations of Illinois districts in 1945 consequently ranged from 112,000 in the least populous district to 900,000 in the most.  Ibid.  Nonetheless, the Court, per Justice Frankfurter, concluded that due regard for the effective working of our Government revealed this issue to be of a peculiarly political nature and therefore not meet for judicial determination.  Id., at 552.  Fewer than 20 years later, the Court, confronted with a strikingly similar set of factsa Tennessee apportionment plan set by a 1901 statute that had remained virtually unchanged despite dramatic population growthheld, in obvious tension with Colegrove, that the complaint stated a justiciable cause of action.  Baker, 369 U. S., at 192, 197198.  The Court distinguished Colegrove as simply a refusal to exercise equitys powers.  369 U. S., at 235.

						 The plurality opinion seems to assume that the dissenting opinions in Umbehr, 518 U. S., at 686 (Scalia, J.), and Rutan, 497 U. S., at 92 (Scalia, J.), correctly state the lawnamely, that when a practice not expressly prohibited by the text of the Bill of Rights bears the endorsement of a long tradition of open, widespread, and unchallenged use that dates back to the beginning of the Republic, we have no proper basis for striking it down, id., at 95.  Cf. ante, at 4 (tracing the history of political gerrymanders to the beginning of the 18th century).  But [o]ur inquiry does not begin with the judgment of history; [r]ather, inquiry must commence with identification of the constitutional limitations implicated by a challenged governmental practice.  Elrod, 427 U. S., at 354355.

						 The plurality explains that it is willing to accep[t] a modest degree of unmanageability where the constitutional command … is clear, but not where the constitutional obligation … is both dubious and severely unmanageable.  Ante, at 1617.

						 The pluralitys reluctance to recognize the justiciability of partisan gerrymanders seems driven in part by a fear that recognizing such claims will give rise to a flood of litigation.  See ante, at 16.  But the list of cases that it cites in its lengthy footnote 6, ante, at 1011, suggests that in the two decades since Bandemer, there has been an average of just three or four partisan gerrymandering cases filed every year.  That volume is obviously trivial when compared, for example, to the amount of litigation that followed our adoption of the one-person, one-vote rule.  See Reynolds v. Sims, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/377/533" class="subref" title="subref">377 U. S. 533</a> (1964)

						 Writing for the Court in Bandemer, Justice White put it well: That the characteristics of the complaining group are not immutable or that the group has not been subject to the same historical stigma may be relevant to the manner in which the case is adjudicated, but these differences do not justify a refusal to entertain such a case.  478 U.

						 The cases that the plurality cites today, ante, at 1012, n. 6, support the conclusion that it would have been wise to endorse the views expressed in Justice Powells dissent in Bandemer, 478 U. S., at 161, and my concurrence in Karcher v. Daggett, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/462/725" class="subref" title="subref">462 U. S. 725</a>,

.  I remain convinced that our opinions correctly interpreted the law.  If that standard were applied to the statewide challenge in this case, a trial of the entire case would be required.  For the purpose of deciding this case, even though I dissented from our decision in Shaw I and remain convinced that it was incorrectly decided, I would give the Shaw cases stare decisis effect in the political gerrymandering context.  Given the Courts illogical disposition of this case, however, in future cases I would feel free to reexamine the standing issue.  I surely would not suggest that a plaintiff would never have standing to litigate a statewide claim.

						 In this sense the partisan gerrymander is the American cousin of the English rotten borough.  In the English system, Members of Parliament were elected from geographic units that remained unchanged despite population changes wrought by the Industrial Revolution.  Because representation was not based on population, vast inequities developed over time in the form of the so-called rotten boroughs.  Old Sarum, for instance, had no human residentsonly a few sheepyet sent the same number of representatives to Parliament as Yorkshire, with nearly a million inhabitants.  R. Zagarri, The Politics of Size: Representation in the United States, 17761850, p. 37 (1987) (footnote omitted).  As a result of this system, many insignificant places returned members, while many important towns did not, and even in large towns the members were often elected by a tiny fraction of the population.  J. Butler, The Passing of the Great Reform Bill 176 (1914).  Meanwhile, [t]he Government bribed the patron or member or both by means of distinctions and offices or by actual cash, and [t]he patron and member bribed the electors in the same way.  Ibid.  The rotten boroughs clearly would violate our familiar one-person, one-vote rule, but they were also troubling because the representative of such a borough owed his primary loyalty to his patron and the government rather than to his constituents (if he had any).  Similarly, in gerrymandered districts, instead of local groups defined by neutral criteria selecting their representatives, it is the architects of the districts who select the constituencies and, in effect, the representatives.

						 In the realm of federal elections, the requirement of governmental neutrality is buttressed by this Courts recognition that the Elections Clause is not  a source of power to dictate electoral outcomes, to favor or disfavor a class of candidates, or to evade important constitutional restraints.   Cook v. Gralike, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/531/510" class="subref" title="subref">531 U. S. 510</a>,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">833</a>834 (1995)
).  And this duty to govern impartially extends to executive and legislative officials alike.  Beginning as early as its first session in 1789, Congress has passed a number of statutes designed to guarantee that Executive Branch employees neutrally carry out their duties.  See Ex parte Curtis, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/106/371" class="subref" title="subref">106 U. S. 371</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">372</a>373 (1882)
.  Some of those laws avoided the danger that the government itself may be made to furnish indirectly the money to defray the expenses of keeping the political party in power that happens to have for the time being the control of the public patronage.  Id., at 375.  It is fundamental that federal employees are expected to enforce the law and execute programs of the Government without bias or favoritism for or against any political party or group or the members thereof.  Civil Service Commn v. Letter Carriers, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/413/548" class="subref" title="subref">413 U. S. 548</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">564</a>565 (1973)

						 In Washington v. Davis, we referred to an earlier challenge to a New York reapportionment statute that had failed because the plaintiffs had not shown that the statute was  the product of a state contrivance to segregate on the basis of race or place of origin.   426 U.

						 I have elsewhere explained my view that race as a factor in the districting process is no different from any other political consideration.  Creating a majority-minority district is no better and no worse than creating an Irish-American, or Polish-American, or Italian-American district.  In all events the relevant question is whether the sovereign abrogated its obligation to govern neutrally.  See Karcher, 462 U. S., at 753754 (Stevens, J., concurring); Mobile, 446 U. S., at 88 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment); Cousins v. City Council of Chicago, 466 F. 2d 830, 850853 (CA7 1972) (Stevens, J., dissenting).

						 The pluralitys long discussion of the history of political gerrymanders is interesting, ante, at 47, but it surely is not intended to suggest that the vintage of an invidious practiceeven an American political tradition as old as the Republic, Board of Commrs, Wabaunsee Cty. v.

 (Scalia, J., dissenting)should insulate it from constitutional review.  Compare, e.g., Bradwell v. State, 16 Wall. 130 (1873), with Nevada Dept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">729</a> (2003)
.  The historical discussion might be relevant if it attempted to justify political gerrymandering as an acceptable use of governmental power.  In the end, however, the pluralitys defense of its position comes down to the unconvincing assertion that it lacks the juridical capacity to administer the standards the Court fashioned in its recent racial gerrymandering jurisprudence.

.  Consistent with these statements, the District Court in a recent case correctly described political gerrymandering as a purely partisan exercise and an abuse of power that, at its core, evinces a fundamental distrust of voters, serving the self-interest of the political parties at the expense of the public good.  App. to Juris.

						 Because race so seldom provides a rational basis for a governmental decision, racial classifications almost always fail to survive rational basis scrutiny.  But [n]ot every decision influenced by race is equally objectionable.  Grutter v. Bollinger,

.  When race is used as the basis for making predictive political judgments, it may be as reliable (or unreliable) as other group characteristics, such as political affiliation, economic status, or national origin.  The fact that race is an immutable characteristic does not mean that there is anything immutable or certain about the political behavior of the members of any racial class.  See Mobile v. Bolden, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/446/55" class="subref" title="subref">446 U. S. 55</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">88</a> (1980)
 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment).  Registered Republicans of all races sometimes vote for Democratic candidates, and vice versa.


The plurality asserts that a persons politics, unlike her race, is not readily discernible.  Ante, at 17.  But that assertion is belied by the evidence that the architects of political gerrymanders seem to have no difficulty in discerning the voters political affiliation.  After all, eligibility to vote in primary elections often requires the citizen to register her party affiliation, but it never requires her to register her race.

						 The one-person, one-vote rule obviously constitutes a neutral districting criterion, but our gerrymandering cases have never cited that principle as one of the traditional criteria that may serve to defeat a claim that a district has been gerrymandered on racial lines.  Shaw I, 509 U. S., at 647.  Thus, I would require that a district be justified with reference to both the one-person, one-vote rule and some other neutral criterion.  See Bandemer, 478 U.

				The central question presented by this case is whether political gerrymandering claims are justiciable.  Although our reasons for coming to this conclusion differ, five Members of the Court are convinced that the pluralitys answer to that question is erroneous.  Moreover, as is apparent from our separate writings today, we share the view that, even if these appellants are not entitled to prevail, it would be contrary to precedent and profoundly unwise to foreclose all judicial review of similar claims that might be advanced in the future.  That we presently have somewhat differing viewsconcerning both the precedential value of some of our recent cases and the standard that should be applied in future casesshould not obscure the fact that the areas of agreement set forth in the separate opinions are of far greater significance.

.  Todays plurality opinion would exempt governing officials from that duty in the context of legislative redistricting and would give license, for the first time, to partisan gerrymanders that are devoid
				<span class="softbreak"></span>

, we have not reached agreement on the standard that should govern partisan gerrymanderying claims.  I would decide this case on a narrow ground.  Plaintiff-appellants urge us to craft new rules that in effect would authorize judicial review of statewide election results to protect the democratic process from a transient majoritys abuse of its power to define voting districts.  I agree with the Courts refusal to undertake that ambitious project.  
				<em>
					Ante

				, at 15.  I am persuaded, however, that the District Court failed to apply well-settled propositions of law when it granted the defendants motion to dismiss plaintiff-appellant Susan Fureys gerrymandering claim.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				According to the complaint, Furey is a registered Democrat who resides at an address in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, that was located under the 1992 districting plan in Congressional District 13.

				<em>

				 pluralitys rejection of a statewide claim of political gerrymandering; and (3) that she has stated a claim that, at least with respect to District 6, Pennsylvanias redistricting plan violates the equal protection principles enunciated in our voting rights cases both before and after

				At issue in this case, as the plurality states,

				<em>
					Bandemer

				and have been refined in later cases.  Among those well-settled principles is the understanding that a districts peculiar shape might be a symptom of an illicit purpose in the line-drawing process.  Most notably, in

				 v. 
				<em>

, the Court invalidated an Alabama statute that altered the boundaries of the city of Tuskegee from a square to an uncouth twenty-eight-sided figure for the sole purpose of preventing African-Americans from voting in municipal elections.  The allegations of bizarre shape and improper motive, if proven, would abundantly [have] establish[ed] that Act 140 was not an ordinary geographic redistricting measure even within familiar abuses of gerrymandering.

, which referred to gerrymandering as the deliberate and arbitrary distortion of district boundaries and populations for partisan or personal political purposes, also identified both shape and purpose as relevant standards.  The maps attached as exhibits in 
				<em>
					Gomillion

				, 364 U. S., at 348 (Appendix to opinion of the Court), and in subsequent voting rights cases demonstrate that an uncouth or bizarre shape can easily identify a district designed for a single-minded, nonneutral purpose.

				With purpose as the ultimate inquiry, other considerations have supplied ready standards for testing the lawfulness of a gerrymander.  In his dissent in

				Given this clear line of precedents, I should have thought the question of justiciability in cases such as thiswhere a set of plaintiffs argues that a single motivation resulted in a districting scheme with discriminatory effectsto be well settled.  The pluralitys contrary conclusion cannot be squared with our long history of voting rights decisions. Especially perplexing is the pluralitys 
				<em>
					ipse dixit
				</em>
				 distinction of our racial gerrymandering cases.  Notably, the plurality does not argue that the judicially manageable standards that have been used to adjudicate racial gerrymandering claims would not be equally manageable in political gerrymandering cases.  Instead, its distinction of those cases rests on its view that race as a districting criterion is much more rarely encountered than partisanship, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16, and that determining whether racea rare and constitutionally suspect motivedominated a districting decision is quite different from determining whether [such a decision] is so substantially affected by the excess of an ordinary and lawful motive as to [be] invali[d],

				The plurality opinion in 
				<em>
					Bandemer
				</em>
				 dealt with a claim that the Indiana apportionment scheme for state legislative districts discriminated against Democratic voters on a statewide basis.  478 U. S., at 127.  In my judgment, the 
				<em>
					Bandemer
				</em>
				 Court was correct to entertain that statewide challenge, because the plaintiffs in that case alleged a group harm that affected members of their party throughout the State.  In the subsequent line of racial gerrymandering cases, however, the Court shifted its focus from statewide challenges and required, as a matter of standing, that plaintiffs stating race-based equal protection claims actually reside in the districts they are challenging.  See 
				<em>
					United States

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">745</a> (1995)
.  Because 
				<em>
					Hays
				</em>
				 has altered the standing rules for gerrymandering claimsand because, in my view, racial and political gerrymanders are species of the same constitutional concernthe 
				<em>

				</em>
				 standing rule requires dismissal of the statewide claim.

				  But that does not end the matter.  Challenges to specific districts, such as those considered in the 
				<em>

				 cases, relate to a different type of representational harm, and those allegations necessarily must be considered on a district-by-district basis.

				In a challenge to a statewide districting plan, the plaintiff-appellants complain that they have been injured because of their membership in a particular, identifiable group.  The plaintiff-appellees in

				, for example, alleged that Democratic voters over the State as a whole, not Democratic voters in particular districts, ha[d] been subjected to unconstitutional discrimination.  478 U.

They specifically claimed that they were injured as members of a group because the number of Democratic representatives was not commensurate with the number of Democratic voters throughout Indiana.  Much like the plaintiff-appellees in 
				<em>

				the plaintiff-appellants in this case allege that the statewide plan will enable Republicans, who constitute about half of Pennsylvanias voters, to elect 13 or 14 members of the States 19-person congressional delegation.

				  That requirement applies with full force to districting decisions.  The line that divides a racial or ethnic minority unevenly between school districts can be entirely legitimate if chosen on the basis of neutral factorscounty lines, for example, or a natural boundary such as a river or major thoroughfare.  But if the district lines were chosen for the purpose of limiting the number of minority students in the school, or the number of families holding unpopular religious or political views, that invidious purpose surely would invalidate the district.

				Consistent with that principle, our recent racial gerrymandering cases have examined the shape of the district and the purpose of the districting body to determine whether race, above all other criteria, predominated in the line-drawing process.  We began by holding in 
				<em>

				</em>
				 that a districting scheme could be so irrational on its face that it [could] be understood only as an effort to segregate voters into separate voting districts because of their race.  509 U. S., at 658.  Then, in

				<span class="softbreak"></span>

				s irrational-shape test did not treat the bizarreness of a districts lines itself as a constitutional violation; rather, the irregularity of the districts contours in 
				<em>
					Shaw I

				 was persuasive circumstantial evidence that race for its own sake, and not other districting principles, was the legislatures dominant and controlling rationale in drawing its district lines.  515 U. S., at 913.  Under the

				In my view, the same standards should apply to claims of political gerrymandering, for the essence of a gerrymander is the same regardless of whether the group is identified as political or racial.  Gerrymandering always involves the drawing of district boundaries to maximize the voting strength of the dominant political faction and to minimize the strength of one or more groups of opponents.

				The racial gerrymandering cases therefore supply a judicially manageable standard for determining when partisanship, like race, has played too great of a role in the districting process.  Just as race can be a factor in, but cannot dictate the outcome of, the districting process, so too can partisanship be a permissible consideration in drawing district lines, so long as it does not predominate.  If, as plaintiff-appellant Furey has alleged, the predominant motive of the legislators who designed District 6, and the sole justification for its bizarre shape, was a purpose to discriminate against a political minority, that invidious purpose should invalidate the district.

				  Thus, the view that the plurality implicitly embraces todaythat a gerrymander contrived for the sole purpose of disadvantaging a political minority is less objectionable than one seeking to benefit a racial minorityis doubly flawed.

				  Under my analysis, if no neutral criterion can be identified to justify the lines drawn, and if the only possible explanation for a districts bizarre shape is a naked desire to increase partisan strength, then no rational basis exists to save the district from an equal protection challenge.

S., at 92 (Scalia, J.), correctly state the lawnamely, that when a practice not expressly prohibited by the text of the Bill of Rights bears the endorsement of a long tradition of open, widespread, and unchallenged use that dates back to the beginning of the Republic, we have no proper basis for striking it down, id., at 95.  Cf. ante, at 4 (tracing the history of political gerrymanders to the beginning of the 18th century).  But [o]ur inquiry does not begin with the judgment of history; [r]ather, inquiry must commence with identification of the constitutional limitations implicated by a challenged governmental practice.  Elrod, 427 U. S., at 354355.

						 The plurality explains that it is willing to accep[t] a modest degree of unmanageability where the constitutional command … is clear, but not where the constitutional obligation … is both dubious and severely unmanageable.  Ante, at 1617.  Not only does this statement cast doubt on the pluralitys faith in our racial gerrymandering cases, but its reasoning is clearly tautological.

						 The pluralitys reluctance to recognize the justiciability of partisan gerrymanders seems driven in part by a fear that recognizing such claims will give rise to a flood of litigation.  See ante, at 16.  But the list of cases that it cites in its lengthy footnote 6, ante, at 1011, suggests that in the two decades since Bandemer, there has been an average of just three or four partisan gerrymandering cases filed every year.  That volume is obviously trivial when compared, for example, to the amount of litigation that followed our adoption of the one-person, one-vote rule.  See Reynolds v. Sims,

						 Writing for the Court in Bandemer, Justice White put it well: That the characteristics of the complaining group are not immutable or that the group has not been subject to the same historical stigma may be relevant to the manner in which the case is adjudicated, but these differences do not justify a refusal to entertain such a case.  478 U.

						 The cases that the plurality cites today, ante, at 1012, n. 6, support the conclusion that it would have been wise to endorse the views expressed in Justice Powells dissent in Bandemer, 478 U. S., at 161, and my concurrence in Karcher v. Daggett,

.  I remain convinced that our opinions correctly interpreted the law.  If that standard were applied to the statewide challenge in this case, a trial of the entire case would be required.  For the purpose of deciding this case, even though I dissented from our decision in Shaw I and remain convinced that it was incorrectly decided, I would give the Shaw cases stare decisis effect in the political gerrymandering context.  Given the Courts illogical disposition of this case, however, in future cases I would feel free to reexamine the standing issue.  I surely would not suggest that a plaintiff would never have standing to litigate a statewide claim.

						 In this sense the partisan gerrymander is the American cousin of the English rotten borough.  In the English system, Members of Parliament were elected from geographic units that remained unchanged despite population changes wrought by the Industrial Revolution.  Because representation was not based on population, vast inequities developed over time in the form of the so-called rotten boroughs.  Old Sarum, for instance, had no human residentsonly a few sheepyet sent the same number of representatives to Parliament as Yorkshire, with nearly a million inhabitants.  R. Zagarri, The Politics of Size: Representation in the United States, 17761850, p. 37 (1987) (footnote omitted).  As a result of this system, many insignificant places returned members, while many important towns did not, and even in large towns the members were often elected by a tiny fraction of the population.  J. Butler, The Passing of the Great Reform Bill 176 (1914).  Meanwhile, [t]he Government bribed the patron or member or both by means of distinctions and offices or by actual cash, and [t]he patron and member bribed the electors in the same way.  Ibid.  The rotten boroughs clearly would violate our familiar one-person, one-vote rule, but they were also troubling because the representative of such a borough owed his primary loyalty to his patron and the government rather than to his constituents (if he had any).  Similarly, in gerrymandered districts, instead of local groups defined by neutral criteria selecting their representatives, it is the architects of the districts who select the constituencies and, in effect, the representatives.

						 In the realm of federal elections, the requirement of governmental neutrality is buttressed by this Courts recognition that the Elections Clause is not  a source of power to dictate electoral outcomes, to favor or disfavor a class of candidates, or to evade important constitutional restraints.   Cook v. Gralike, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/531/510" class="subref" title="subref">531 U. S. 510</a>,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">833</a>834 (1995)
).  And this duty to govern impartially extends to executive and legislative officials alike.  Beginning as early as its first session in 1789, Congress has passed a number of statutes designed to guarantee that Executive Branch employees neutrally carry out their duties.  See Ex parte Curtis, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/106/371" class="subref" title="subref">106 U. S. 371</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">372</a>373 (1882)
.  Some of those laws avoided the danger that the government itself may be made to furnish indirectly the money to defray the expenses of keeping the political party in power that happens to have for the time being the control of the public patronage.  Id., at 375.  It is fundamental that federal employees are expected to enforce the law and execute programs of the Government without bias or favoritism for or against any political party or group or the members thereof.  Civil Service Commn v. Letter Carriers, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/413/548" class="subref" title="subref">413 U. S. 548</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">564</a>565 (1973)

						 In Washington v.

						 I have elsewhere explained my view that race as a factor in the districting process is no different from any other political consideration.  Creating a majority-minority district is no better and no worse than creating an Irish-American, or Polish-American, or Italian-American district.  In all events the relevant question is whether the sovereign abrogated its obligation to govern neutrally.  See Karcher, 462 U. S., at 753754 (Stevens, J., concurring); Mobile, 446 U. S., at 88 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment); Cousins v. City Council of Chicago, 466 F. 2d 830, 850853 (CA7 1972) (Stevens, J., dissenting).

						 The pluralitys long discussion of the history of political gerrymanders is interesting, ante, at 47, but it surely is not intended to suggest that the vintage of an invidious practiceeven an American political tradition as old as the Republic, Board of Commrs, Wabaunsee Cty. v.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">688</a> (1996)
 (Scalia, J., dissenting)should insulate it from constitutional review.  Compare, e.g., Bradwell v. State, 16 Wall. 130 (1873), with Nevada Dept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">729</a> (2003)
.  The historical discussion might be relevant if it attempted to justify political gerrymandering as an acceptable use of governmental power.  In the end, however, the pluralitys defense of its position comes down to the unconvincing assertion that it lacks the juridical capacity to administer the standards the Court fashioned in its recent racial gerrymandering jurisprudence.

						 Because race so seldom provides a rational basis for a governmental decision, racial classifications almost always fail to survive rational basis scrutiny.  But [n]ot every decision influenced by race is equally objectionable.  Grutter v. Bollinger,

.  When race is used as the basis for making predictive political judgments, it may be as reliable (or unreliable) as other group characteristics, such as political affiliation, economic status, or national origin.  The fact that race is an immutable characteristic does not mean that there is anything immutable or certain about the political behavior of the members of any racial class.  See Mobile v. Bolden, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/446/55" class="subref" title="subref">446 U. S. 55</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">88</a> (1980)
 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment).  Registered Republicans of all races sometimes vote for Democratic candidates, and vice versa.


The plurality asserts that a persons politics, unlike her race, is not readily discernible.  Ante, at 17.  But that assertion is belied by the evidence that the architects of political gerrymanders seem to have no difficulty in discerning the voters political affiliation.  After all, eligibility to vote in primary elections often requires the citizen to register her party affiliation, but it never requires her to register her race.

						 The one-person, one-vote rule obviously constitutes a neutral districting criterion, but our gerrymandering cases have never cited that principle as one of the traditional criteria that may serve to defeat a claim that a district has been gerrymandered on racial lines.  Shaw I, 509 U. S., at 647.  Thus, I would require that a district be justified with reference to both the one-person, one-vote rule and some other neutral criterion.  See Bandemer, 478 U.

				The central question presented by this case is whether political gerrymandering claims are justiciable.  Although our reasons for coming to this conclusion differ, five Members of the Court are convinced that the pluralitys answer to that question is erroneous.  Moreover, as is apparent from our separate writings today, we share the view that, even if these appellants are not entitled to prevail, it would be contrary to precedent and profoundly unwise to foreclose all judicial review of similar claims that might be advanced in the future.  That we presently have somewhat differing viewsconcerning both the precedential value of some of our recent cases and the standard that should be applied in future casesshould not obscure the fact that the areas of agreement set forth in the separate opinions are of far greater significance.

				<em>

				With purpose as the ultimate inquiry, other considerations have supplied ready standards for testing the lawfulness of a gerrymander.  In his dissent in

				Given this clear line of precedents, I should have thought the question of justiciability in cases such as thiswhere a set of plaintiffs argues that a single motivation resulted in a districting scheme with discriminatory effectsto be well settled.  The pluralitys contrary conclusion cannot be squared with our long history of voting rights decisions. Especially perplexing is the pluralitys 
				<em>
					ipse dixit
				</em>
				 distinction of our racial gerrymandering cases.  Notably, the plurality does not argue that the judicially manageable standards that have been used to adjudicate racial gerrymandering claims would not be equally manageable in political gerrymandering cases.  Instead, its distinction of those cases rests on its view that race as a districting criterion is much more rarely encountered than partisanship, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16, and that determining whether racea rare and constitutionally suspect motivedominated a districting decision is quite different from determining whether [such a decision] is so substantially affected by the excess of an ordinary and lawful motive as to [be] invali[d],

				The plurality opinion in 
				<em>

				 dealt with a claim that the Indiana apportionment scheme for state legislative districts discriminated against Democratic voters on a statewide basis.  478 U. S., at 127.  In my judgment, the 
				<em>
					Bandemer
				</em>
				 Court was correct to entertain that statewide challenge, because the plaintiffs in that case alleged a group harm that affected members of their party throughout the State.  In the subsequent line of racial gerrymandering cases, however, the Court shifted its focus from statewide challenges and required, as a matter of standing, that plaintiffs stating race-based equal protection claims actually reside in the districts they are challenging.

				<em>

				 has altered the standing rules for gerrymandering claimsand because, in my view, racial and political gerrymanders are species of the same constitutional concernthe

				  That requirement applies with full force to districting decisions.  The line that divides a racial or ethnic minority unevenly between school districts can be entirely legitimate if chosen on the basis of neutral factorscounty lines, for example, or a natural boundary such as a river or major thoroughfare.

				Consistent with that principle, our recent racial gerrymandering cases have examined the shape of the district and the purpose of the districting body to determine whether race, above all other criteria, predominated in the line-drawing process.  We began by holding in 
				<em>
					Shaw I
				</em>
				 that a districting scheme could be so irrational on its face that it [could] be understood only as an effort to segregate voters into separate voting districts because of their race.  509 U. S., at 658.  Then, in 
				<em>
					Miller

				, we explained that 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
            <em>
					Shaw I
				</em>
				s irrational-shape test did not treat the bizarreness of a districts lines itself as a constitutional violation; rather, the irregularity of the districts contours in 
				<em>
					Shaw I
				</em>
				 was persuasive circumstantial evidence that race for its own sake, and not other districting principles, was the legislatures dominant and controlling rationale in drawing its district lines.  515 U. S., at 913.  Under the 
				<em>
					Shaw
				</em>
				 cases, then, the use of race as a criterion in redistricting is not 
				<em>
					per se
				</em>
				 impermissible, see 
				<em>
					Shaw I

				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/517/899" class="subref" title="subref">517 U. S. 899</a>, but when race is elevated to paramount statuswhen it is the be-all and end-all of the redistricting processthe legislature has gone too far.  Race must not simply have been 
				<em>

				 motivation … but the

				Just as irrational shape can serve as an objective indicator of an impermissible legislative purpose, other objective features of a districting map can save the plan from invalidation.  We have explained that traditional districting principles, which include compactness, contiguity, and respect for political subdivisions, are important not because they are constitutionally required … but because they are objective factors that may serve to defeat a claim that a district has been gerrymandered on racial lines.

				In my view, the same standards should apply to claims of political gerrymandering, for the essence of a gerrymander is the same regardless of whether the group is identified as political or racial.  Gerrymandering always involves the drawing of district boundaries to maximize the voting strength of the dominant political faction and to minimize the strength of one or more groups of opponents.

				The racial gerrymandering cases therefore supply a judicially manageable standard for determining when partisanship, like race, has played too great of a role in the districting process.  Just as race can be a factor in, but cannot dictate the outcome of, the districting process, so too can partisanship be a permissible consideration in drawing district lines, so long as it does not predominate.  If, as plaintiff-appellant Furey has alleged, the predominant motive of the legislators who designed District 6, and the sole justification for its bizarre shape, was a purpose to discriminate against a political minority, that invidious purpose should invalidate the district.

A legislature controlled by one party could not, for instance, impose special taxes on members of the minority party, or use tax revenues to pay the majority partys campaign expenses.

				The Constitution does not, of course, require proportional representation of racial, ethnic, or political groups.  In that I agree with the plurality.

				  Thus, the view that the plurality implicitly embraces todaythat a gerrymander contrived for the sole purpose of disadvantaging a political minority is less objectionable than one seeking to benefit a racial minorityis doubly flawed.  It disregards the obvious distinction between an invidious and a benign purpose, and it mistakenly assumes that race cannot provide a legitimate basis for making political judgments.

				  Under my analysis, if no neutral criterion can be identified to justify the lines drawn, and if the only possible explanation for a districts bizarre shape is a naked desire to increase partisan strength, then no rational basis exists to save the district from an equal protection challenge.  Such a narrow test would cover only a few meritorious claims, but it would preclude extreme abuses, such as those disclosed by the record in

				The plurality candidly acknowledges that legislatures can fashion standards to remedy political gerrymandering that are perfectly manageable and, indeed, that the legislatures in Iowa and elsewhere have done so.

				, at 7, n. 4.  If a violation of the Constitution is found, a court could impose a remedy patterned after such a statute.  Thus, the problem, in the pluralitys view, is not that there is no judicially manageable standard to fix an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander, but rather that the Judiciary lacks the ability to determine when a state legislature has violated its duty to govern impartially.

						 In Colegrove, for example, the Illinois Legislature had drawn the States district lines under the 1901 State Apportionment Act and had not reapportioned in the four ensuing decades, despite census figures indicating great changes in the distribution of the population.  328 U. S., at 569 (Black, J., dissenting).  The populations of Illinois districts in 1945 consequently ranged from 112,000 in the least populous district to 900,000 in the most.  Ibid.  Nonetheless, the Court, per Justice Frankfurter, concluded that due regard for the effective working of our Government revealed this issue to be of a peculiarly political nature and therefore not meet for judicial determination.  Id., at 552.  Fewer than 20 years later, the Court, confronted with a strikingly similar set of factsa Tennessee apportionment plan set by a 1901 statute that had remained virtually unchanged despite dramatic population growthheld, in obvious tension with Colegrove, that the complaint stated a justiciable cause of action.  Baker, 369 U. S., at 192, 197198.  The Court distinguished Colegrove as simply a refusal to exercise equitys powers.  369 U. S., at 235.

						 The plurality opinion seems to assume that the dissenting opinions in Umbehr, 518 U. S., at 686 (Scalia, J.), and Rutan, 497 U. S., at 92 (Scalia, J.), correctly state the lawnamely, that when a practice not expressly prohibited by the text of the Bill of Rights bears the endorsement of a long tradition of open, widespread, and unchallenged use that dates back to the beginning of the Republic, we have no proper basis for striking it down, id., at 95.  Cf. ante, at 4 (tracing the history of political gerrymanders to the beginning of the 18th century).

						 The pluralitys reluctance to recognize the justiciability of partisan gerrymanders seems driven in part by a fear that recognizing such claims will give rise to a flood of litigation.  See ante, at 16.  But the list of cases that it cites in its lengthy footnote 6, ante, at 1011, suggests that in the two decades since Bandemer, there has been an average of just three or four partisan gerrymandering cases filed every year.  That volume is obviously trivial when compared, for example, to the amount of litigation that followed our adoption of the one-person, one-vote rule.  See Reynolds v. Sims,

						 Writing for the Court in Bandemer, Justice White put it well: That the characteristics of the complaining group are not immutable or that the group has not been subject to the same historical stigma may be relevant to the manner in which the case is adjudicated, but these differences do not justify a refusal to entertain such a case.  478 U.

.  I remain convinced that our opinions correctly interpreted the law.  If that standard were applied to the statewide challenge in this case, a trial of the entire case would be required.  For the purpose of deciding this case, even though I dissented from our decision in Shaw I and remain convinced that it was incorrectly decided, I would give the Shaw cases stare decisis effect in the political gerrymandering context.  Given the Courts illogical disposition of this case, however, in future cases I would feel free to reexamine the standing issue.  I surely would not suggest that a plaintiff would never have standing to litigate a statewide claim.

						 In this sense the partisan gerrymander is the American cousin of the English rotten borough.  In the English system, Members of Parliament were elected from geographic units that remained unchanged despite population changes wrought by the Industrial Revolution.  Because representation was not based on population, vast inequities developed over time in the form of the so-called rotten boroughs.  Old Sarum, for instance, had no human residentsonly a few sheepyet sent the same number of representatives to Parliament as Yorkshire, with nearly a million inhabitants.  R. Zagarri, The Politics of Size: Representation in the United States, 17761850, p. 37 (1987) (footnote omitted).  As a result of this system, many insignificant places returned members, while many important towns did not, and even in large towns the members were often elected by a tiny fraction of the population.  J. Butler, The Passing of the Great Reform Bill 176 (1914).  Meanwhile, [t]he Government bribed the patron or member or both by means of distinctions and offices or by actual cash, and [t]he patron and member bribed the electors in the same way.  Ibid.  The rotten boroughs clearly would violate our familiar one-person, one-vote rule, but they were also troubling because the representative of such a borough owed his primary loyalty to his patron and the government rather than to his constituents (if he had any).  Similarly, in gerrymandered districts, instead of local groups defined by neutral criteria selecting their representatives, it is the architects of the districts who select the constituencies and, in effect, the representatives.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/531/510" class="subref" title="subref">531 U. S. 510</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">523</a> (2001)
 (citing U. S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/514/779" class="subref" title="subref">514 U. S. 779</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">833</a>834 (1995)
).  And this duty to govern impartially extends to executive and legislative officials alike.  Beginning as early as its first session in 1789, Congress has passed a number of statutes designed to guarantee that Executive Branch employees neutrally carry out their duties.  See Ex parte Curtis, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/106/371" class="subref" title="subref">106 U. S. 371</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">372</a>373 (1882)
.  Some of those laws avoided the danger that the government itself may be made to furnish indirectly the money to defray the expenses of keeping the political party in power that happens to have for the time being the control of the public patronage.  Id., at 375.  It is fundamental that federal employees are expected to enforce the law and execute programs of the Government without bias or favoritism for or against any political party or group or the members thereof.  Civil Service Commn v. Letter Carriers, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/413/548" class="subref" title="subref">413 U. S. 548</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">564</a>565 (1973)
.  That expectation reflects the principle that the impartial execution of the laws is a great end of Government.  Id., at 565.

						 In Washington v. Davis, we referred to an earlier challenge to a New York reapportionment statute that had failed because the plaintiffs had not shown that the statute was  the product of a state contrivance to segregate on the basis of race or place of origin.   426 U.

).  We emphasized that the Court in Wright had been unanimous in identifying the issue as whether the boundaries … were purposefully drawn on racial lines.   426 U. S., at 240 (quoting Wright, 376 U. S., at 67).

						 I have elsewhere explained my view that race as a factor in the districting process is no different from any other political consideration.  Creating a majority-minority district is no better and no worse than creating an Irish-American, or Polish-American, or Italian-American district.  In all events the relevant question is whether the sovereign abrogated its obligation to govern neutrally.  See Karcher, 462 U. S., at 753754 (Stevens, J., concurring); Mobile, 446 U. S., at 88 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment); Cousins v. City Council of Chicago, 466 F. 2d 830, 850853 (CA7 1972) (Stevens, J., dissenting).

						 The pluralitys long discussion of the history of political gerrymanders is interesting, ante, at 47, but it surely is not intended to suggest that the vintage of an invidious practiceeven an American political tradition as old as the Republic, Board of Commrs, Wabaunsee Cty. v.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">688</a> (1996)
 (Scalia, J., dissenting)should insulate it from constitutional review.  Compare, e.g., Bradwell v. State, 16 Wall. 130 (1873), with Nevada Dept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">729</a> (2003)
.  The historical discussion might be relevant if it attempted to justify political gerrymandering as an acceptable use of governmental power.  In the end, however, the pluralitys defense of its position comes down to the unconvincing assertion that it lacks the juridical capacity to administer the standards the Court fashioned in its recent racial gerrymandering jurisprudence.

Consistent with these statements, the District Court in a recent case correctly described political gerrymandering as a purely partisan exercise and an abuse of power that, at its core, evinces a fundamental distrust of voters, serving the self-interest of the political parties at the expense of the public good.  App. to Juris.

						 Because race so seldom provides a rational basis for a governmental decision, racial classifications almost always fail to survive rational basis scrutiny.  But [n]ot every decision influenced by race is equally objectionable.  Grutter v. Bollinger, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/539/306" class="subref" title="subref">539 U. S. 306</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">327</a> (2003)
.  When race is used as the basis for making predictive political judgments, it may be as reliable (or unreliable) as other group characteristics, such as political affiliation, economic status, or national origin.  The fact that race is an immutable characteristic does not mean that there is anything immutable or certain about the political behavior of the members of any racial class.  See Mobile v. Bolden, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/446/55" class="subref" title="subref">446 U. S. 55</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">88</a> (1980)
 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment).  Registered Republicans of all races sometimes vote for Democratic candidates, and vice versa.


The plurality asserts that a persons politics, unlike her race, is not readily discernible.  Ante, at 17.  But that assertion is belied by the evidence that the architects of political gerrymanders seem to have no difficulty in discerning the voters political affiliation.  After all, eligibility to vote in primary elections often requires the citizen to register her party affiliation, but it never requires her to register her race.

						 The one-person, one-vote rule obviously constitutes a neutral districting criterion, but our gerrymandering cases have never cited that principle as one of the traditional criteria that may serve to defeat a claim that a district has been gerrymandered on racial lines.  Shaw I, 509 U. S., at 647.  Thus, I would require that a district be justified with reference to both the one-person, one-vote rule and some other neutral criterion.  See Bandemer, 478 U.

				The central question presented by this case is whether political gerrymandering claims are justiciable.  Although our reasons for coming to this conclusion differ, five Members of the Court are convinced that the pluralitys answer to that question is erroneous.  Moreover, as is apparent from our separate writings today, we share the view that, even if these appellants are not entitled to prevail, it would be contrary to precedent and profoundly unwise to foreclose all judicial review of similar claims that might be advanced in the future.  That we presently have somewhat differing viewsconcerning both the precedential value of some of our recent cases and the standard that should be applied in future casesshould not obscure the fact that the areas of agreement set forth in the separate opinions are of far greater significance.

.  Todays plurality opinion would exempt governing officials from that duty in the context of legislative redistricting and would give license, for the first time, to partisan gerrymanders that are devoid
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				of any rational justification.  In my view, when parti-

, we have not reached agreement on the standard that should govern partisan gerrymanderying claims.  I would decide this case on a narrow ground.  Plaintiff-appellants urge us to craft new rules that in effect would authorize judicial review of statewide election results to protect the democratic process from a transient majoritys abuse of its power to define voting districts.  I agree with the Courts refusal to undertake that ambitious project.  
				<em>

				At issue in this case, as the plurality states, 
				<em>

				, at 8, is 
				<em>
					Baker
				</em>
				s second testthe presence or absence of judicially manageable standards.  The judicial standards applicable to gerrymandering claims are deeply rooted in decisions that long preceded 
				<em>
					Bandemer 
				</em>
				and have been refined in later cases.  Among those well-settled principles is the understanding that a districts peculiar shape might be a symptom of an illicit purpose in the line-drawing process.  Most notably, in

, the Court invalidated an Alabama statute that altered the boundaries of the city of Tuskegee from a square to an uncouth twenty-eight-sided figure for the sole purpose of preventing African-Americans from voting in municipal elections.  The allegations of bizarre shape and improper motive, if proven, would abundantly [have] establish[ed] that Act 140 was not an ordinary geographic redistricting measure even within familiar abuses of gerrymandering.

				<em>
					Gomillion

				With purpose as the ultimate inquiry, other considerations have supplied ready standards for testing the lawfulness of a gerrymander.  In his dissent in

				Given this clear line of precedents, I should have thought the question of justiciability in cases such as thiswhere a set of plaintiffs argues that a single motivation resulted in a districting scheme with discriminatory effectsto be well settled.  The pluralitys contrary conclusion cannot be squared with our long history of voting rights decisions. Especially perplexing is the pluralitys 
				<em>
					ipse dixit
				</em>
				 distinction of our racial gerrymandering cases.  Notably, the plurality does not argue that the judicially manageable standards that have been used to adjudicate racial gerrymandering claims would not be equally manageable in political gerrymandering cases.  Instead, its distinction of those cases rests on its view that race as a districting criterion is much more rarely encountered than partisanship, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16, and that determining whether racea rare and constitutionally suspect motivedominated a districting decision is quite different from determining whether [such a decision] is so substantially affected by the excess of an ordinary and lawful motive as to [be] invali[d], 
				<em>
					ibid.
				</em>
				  But those considerations are wholly irrelevant to the issue of justiciability.      
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				To begin with, the plurality errs in assuming that politics is an ordinary and lawful motive.  We have squarely rejected the notion that a purpose to discriminate on the basis of politics,

In any event, as I understand the pluralitys opinion, it seems to agree that if the State goes too farif it engages in political gerrymandering for politics sakeit violates the Constitution in the same way as if it undertakes racial gerrymandering for races sake.

				The plurality opinion in 
				<em>
					Bandemer

				 dealt with a claim that the Indiana apportionment scheme for state legislative districts discriminated against Democratic voters on a statewide basis.  478 U. S., at 127.  In my judgment, the 
				<em>
					Bandemer
				</em>
				 Court was correct to entertain that statewide challenge, because the plaintiffs in that case alleged a group harm that affected members of their party throughout the State.  In the subsequent line of racial gerrymandering cases, however, the Court shifted its focus from statewide challenges and required, as a matter of standing, that plaintiffs stating race-based equal protection claims actually reside in the districts they are challenging.

				<em>
					Hays

				  That requirement applies with full force to districting decisions.  The line that divides a racial or ethnic minority unevenly between school districts can be entirely legitimate if chosen on the basis of neutral factorscounty lines, for example, or a natural boundary such as a river or major thoroughfare.  But if the district lines were chosen for the purpose of limiting the number of minority students in the school, or the number of families holding unpopular religious or political views, that invidious purpose surely would invalidate the district.

				Consistent with that principle, our recent racial gerrymandering cases have examined the shape of the district and the purpose of the districting body to determine whether race, above all other criteria, predominated in the line-drawing process.  We began by holding in 
				<em>
					Shaw I
				</em>
				 that a districting scheme could be so irrational on its face that it [could] be understood only as an effort to segregate voters into separate voting districts because of their race.  509 U. S., at 658.  Then, in 
				<em>
					Miller
				</em>
				, we explained that 
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
            <em>
					Shaw I
				</em>
				s irrational-shape test did not treat the bizarreness of a districts lines itself as a constitutional violation; rather, the irregularity of the districts contours in 
				<em>
					Shaw I
				</em>
				 was persuasive circumstantial evidence that race for its own sake, and not other districting principles, was the legislatures dominant and controlling rationale in drawing its district lines.  515 U. S., at 913.  Under the 
				<em>
					Shaw
				</em>
				 cases, then, the use of race as a criterion in redistricting is not

				Just as irrational shape can serve as an objective indicator of an impermissible legislative purpose, other objective features of a districting map can save the plan from invalidation.  We have explained that traditional districting principles, which include compactness, contiguity, and respect for political subdivisions, are important not because they are constitutionally required … but because they are objective factors that may serve to defeat a claim that a district has been gerrymandered on racial lines.

				In my view, the same standards should apply to claims of political gerrymandering, for the essence of a gerrymander is the same regardless of whether the group is identified as political or racial.  Gerrymandering always involves the drawing of district boundaries to maximize the voting strength of the dominant political faction and to minimize the strength of one or more groups of opponents.

				The racial gerrymandering cases therefore supply a judicially manageable standard for determining when partisanship, like race, has played too great of a role in the districting process.  Just as race can be a factor in, but cannot dictate the outcome of, the districting process, so too can partisanship be a permissible consideration in drawing district lines, so long as it does not predominate.  If, as plaintiff-appellant Furey has alleged, the predominant motive of the legislators who designed District 6, and the sole justification for its bizarre shape, was a purpose to discriminate against a political minority, that invidious purpose should invalidate the district.

				  Thus, the view that the plurality implicitly embraces todaythat a gerrymander contrived for the sole purpose of disadvantaging a political minority is less objectionable than one seeking to benefit a racial minorityis doubly flawed.  It disregards the obvious distinction between an invidious and a benign purpose, and it mistakenly assumes that race cannot provide a legitimate basis for making political judgments.

				  Under my analysis, if no neutral criterion can be identified to justify the lines drawn, and if the only possible explanation for a districts bizarre shape is a naked desire to increase partisan strength, then no rational basis exists to save the district from an equal protection challenge.

						 In Colegrove, for example, the Illinois Legislature had drawn the States district lines under the 1901 State Apportionment Act and had not reapportioned in the four ensuing decades, despite census figures indicating great changes in the distribution of the population.  328 U. S., at 569 (Black, J., dissenting).  The populations of Illinois districts in 1945 consequently ranged from 112,000 in the least populous district to 900,000 in the most.  Ibid.  Nonetheless, the Court, per Justice Frankfurter, concluded that due regard for the effective working of our Government revealed this issue to be of a peculiarly political nature and therefore not meet for judicial determination.  Id., at 552.  Fewer than 20 years later, the Court, confronted with a strikingly similar set of factsa Tennessee apportionment plan set by a 1901 statute that had remained virtually unchanged despite dramatic population growthheld, in obvious tension with Colegrove, that the complaint stated a justiciable cause of action.  Baker, 369 U. S., at 192, 197198.  The Court distinguished Colegrove as simply a refusal to exercise equitys powers.  369 U. S., at 235.

						 The plurality opinion seems to assume that the dissenting opinions in Umbehr, 518 U. S., at 686 (Scalia, J.), and Rutan, 497 U.

						 The pluralitys reluctance to recognize the justiciability of partisan gerrymanders seems driven in part by a fear that recognizing such claims will give rise to a flood of litigation.  See ante, at 16.  But the list of cases that it cites in its lengthy footnote 6, ante, at 1011, suggests that in the two decades since Bandemer, there has been an average of just three or four partisan gerrymandering cases filed every year.  That volume is obviously trivial when compared, for example, to the amount of litigation that followed our adoption of the one-person, one-vote rule.  See Reynolds v. Sims,

.  I remain convinced that our opinions correctly interpreted the law.  If that standard were applied to the statewide challenge in this case, a trial of the entire case would be required.  For the purpose of deciding this case, even though I dissented from our decision in Shaw I and remain convinced that it was incorrectly decided, I would give the Shaw cases stare decisis effect in the political gerrymandering context.  Given the Courts illogical disposition of this case, however, in future cases I would feel free to reexamine the standing issue.  I surely would not suggest that a plaintiff would never have standing to litigate a statewide claim.

						 In this sense the partisan gerrymander is the American cousin of the English rotten borough.  In the English system, Members of Parliament were elected from geographic units that remained unchanged despite population changes wrought by the Industrial Revolution.  Because representation was not based on population, vast inequities developed over time in the form of the so-called rotten boroughs.  Old Sarum, for instance, had no human residentsonly a few sheepyet sent the same number of representatives to Parliament as Yorkshire, with nearly a million inhabitants.  R. Zagarri, The Politics of Size: Representation in the United States, 17761850, p. 37 (1987) (footnote omitted).  As a result of this system, many insignificant places returned members, while many important towns did not, and even in large towns the members were often elected by a tiny fraction of the population.  J. Butler, The Passing of the Great Reform Bill 176 (1914).  Meanwhile, [t]he Government bribed the patron or member or both by means of distinctions and offices or by actual cash, and [t]he patron and member bribed the electors in the same way.  Ibid.  The rotten boroughs clearly would violate our familiar one-person, one-vote rule, but they were also troubling because the representative of such a borough owed his primary loyalty to his patron and the government rather than to his constituents (if he had any).  Similarly, in gerrymandered districts, instead of local groups defined by neutral criteria selecting their representatives, it is the architects of the districts who select the constituencies and, in effect, the representatives.

						 In the realm of federal elections, the requirement of governmental neutrality is buttressed by this Courts recognition that the Elections Clause is not  a source of power to dictate electoral outcomes, to favor or disfavor a class of candidates, or to evade important constitutional restraints.   Cook v. Gralike, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/531/510" class="subref" title="subref">531 U. S. 510</a>,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">833</a>834 (1995)
).  And this duty to govern impartially extends to executive and legislative officials alike.  Beginning as early as its first session in 1789, Congress has passed a number of statutes designed to guarantee that Executive Branch employees neutrally carry out their duties.  See Ex parte Curtis, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/106/371" class="subref" title="subref">106 U. S. 371</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">372</a>373 (1882)
.  Some of those laws avoided the danger that the government itself may be made to furnish indirectly the money to defray the expenses of keeping the political party in power that happens to have for the time being the control of the public patronage.  Id., at 375.  It is fundamental that federal employees are expected to enforce the law and execute programs of the Government without bias or favoritism for or against any political party or group or the members thereof.  Civil Service Commn v. Letter Carriers,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">564</a>565 (1973)

						 In Washington v.

						 I have elsewhere explained my view that race as a factor in the districting process is no different from any other political consideration.  Creating a majority-minority district is no better and no worse than creating an Irish-American, or Polish-American, or Italian-American district.  In all events the relevant question is whether the sovereign abrogated its obligation to govern neutrally.  See Karcher, 462 U. S., at 753754 (Stevens, J., concurring); Mobile, 446 U.

						 The pluralitys long discussion of the history of political gerrymanders is interesting, ante, at 47, but it surely is not intended to suggest that the vintage of an invidious practiceeven an American political tradition as old as the Republic, Board of Commrs, Wabaunsee Cty. v.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">729</a> (2003)
.  The historical discussion might be relevant if it attempted to justify political gerrymandering as an acceptable use of governmental power.  In the end, however, the pluralitys defense of its position comes down to the unconvincing assertion that it lacks the juridical capacity to administer the standards the Court fashioned in its recent racial gerrymandering jurisprudence.

						 Because race so seldom provides a rational basis for a governmental decision, racial classifications almost always fail to survive rational basis scrutiny.  But [n]ot every decision influenced by race is equally objectionable.  Grutter v. Bollinger, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/539/306" class="subref" title="subref">539 U. S. 306</a>,

.  When race is used as the basis for making predictive political judgments, it may be as reliable (or unreliable) as other group characteristics, such as political affiliation, economic status, or national origin.  The fact that race is an immutable characteristic does not mean that there is anything immutable or certain about the political behavior of the members of any racial class.  See Mobile v. Bolden, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/446/55" class="subref" title="subref">446 U. S. 55</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">88</a> (1980)
 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment).  Registered Republicans of all races sometimes vote for Democratic candidates, and vice versa.


The plurality asserts that a persons politics, unlike her race, is not readily discernible.  Ante, at 17.  But that assertion is belied by the evidence that the architects of political gerrymanders seem to have no difficulty in discerning the voters political affiliation.  After all, eligibility to vote in primary elections often requires the citizen to register her party affiliation, but it never requires her to register her race.

						 The one-person, one-vote rule obviously constitutes a neutral districting criterion, but our gerrymandering cases have never cited that principle as one of the traditional criteria that may serve to defeat a claim that a district has been gerrymandered on racial lines.  Shaw I, 509 U.

						 The California districting scheme at issue in Badham featured a large number of districts with highly irregular shapes, all designed, the plaintiff-appellants alleged, to dilute Republican voting strength throughout the State.  See Juris. Statement in Badham v. Eu, O. T. 1987, No. 871818, Exh. D, p. 77a.  Three Members of this Court dissented from the summary affirmance in Badham and would have noted probable jurisdiction.

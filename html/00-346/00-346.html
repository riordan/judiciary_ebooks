				In her complaint filed in the District Court, respondent alleged that her son died as a result of injuries sustained while performing sandblasting aboard a vessel berthed in the navigable waters of the United States.  She further asserted that the injuries were caused by the negligence of petitioner and another, and prayed for damages under general maritime law.  The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a federal claim, stating that no cause of action exists, under general maritime law, for death resulting from negligence.  The Fourth Circuit reversed, explaining that although this Court had not yet recognized a maritime cause of action for wrongful death resulting from negligence, the principles contained in 
				<em>
					Moragne
				</em>

            <em>
					Held:
				</em>
				 The general maritime cause of action recognized in 
				<em>
					Moragne
				</em>
				for death caused by violation of maritime duties, 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 409is available for the negligent breach of a maritime duty of care.  Although 
				<em>
					Moragne
				</em>
				s opinion did not limit its rule to any particular maritime duty, 
				<em>
					Moragne
				</em>
				s
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				facts were limited to the duty of seaworthiness, and so the issue of wrongful death for negligence has remained technically open.  There is no rational basis, however, for distinguishing negligence from unseaworthiness.  Negligence is no less a maritime duty than seaworthiness, and the choice-of-law and remedial anomalies provoked by withholding a wrongful death remedy are no less severe.  Nor is a negligence action precluded by any of the three relevant federal statutes that provide remedies for injuries and death suffered in admiralty: the Jones Act, the Death on the High Seas Act, and the Longshore and Harbor Workers Compensation Act.  Because of Congresss extensive involvement in legislating causes of action for maritime personal injuries, it will be the better course, in many cases that assert new claims beyond what those statutes have seen fit to allow, to leave further development to Congress.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,

The cause of action recognized today, however, is new only in the most technical sense.  The general maritime law has recognized the tort of negligence for more than a century, and it has been clear since

				According to the complaint that respondent filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, her son, Christopher Garris, sustained injuries on April 8, 1997, that caused his death one day later.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 53.  The injuries were suffered while Garris was performing sandblasting work aboard the USNS
				<em>
					 Maj. Stephen W. Pless
				</em>
				 in the employ of Tidewater Temps, Inc., a subcontractor for Mid-Atlantic Coatings, Inc., which was in turn a subcontractor for petitioner Norfolk Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock Corporation.  And the injuries were caused, the complaint continued, by the negligence of petitioner and one of its other subcontractors, since dismissed from this case.  Because the vessel was berthed in the navigable waters of the United States when Garris was injured, respondent invoked federal admiralty jurisdiction, U. S. Const., Art. III, §2, cl. 1; 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1333.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1333</a>, and prayed for damages under general maritime law.  She also asserted claims under the Virginia wrongful death statute, Va. Code Ann. §§8.0150 to 8.0156 (2000).

				The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a federal claim, for the categorical reason that no cause of action exists, under general maritime law, for death of a nonseaman in state territorial waters resulting from negligence.  No. Civ. A. 2:98CV382, 1998 WL 1108934, *1 (ED Va., Aug. 31, 1998) (unpublished).

				Three of four issues of general maritime law are settled, and the fourth is before us.  It is settled that the general maritime law imposes duties to avoid unseaworthiness and negligence, see,

				For more than 80 years, from 1886 until 1970, all four issues were considered resolved, though the third not in the manner we have just described.  The governing rule then was the rule of 
				<em>
					The Harrisburg,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/119/199" class="subref" title="subref">119 U. S. 199</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">213</a> (1886)
: Although the general maritime law provides relief for injuries caused by the breach of maritime duties, it does not provide relief for wrongful death.  
				<em>
					The Harrisburg
				</em>
				 said that rule was compelled by existence of the same rule at common law, 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 213214although it acknowledged, 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 205212, that admiralty courts had held that damages for wrongful death were recoverable under maritime law, see also 
				<em>
					Moragne, supra,
				</em>
				 at 387388 (listing cases).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In 1969, however, we granted certiorari in 
				<em>
					Moragne 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					States Marine Lines, Inc., supra,
				</em>
				 for the express purpose of considering whether 
				<em>
					The Harrisburg 
				</em>
				… should any longer be regarded as acceptable law.  398 U. S., at 375376.  We inquired whether the rule of 
				<em>
					The Harrisburg
				</em>
				 was defensible under either the general maritime law or the policy displayed in the maritime statutes Congress had since enacted, 398 U. S.,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				at 379393, whether those statutes pre-empted judicial action overruling 
				<em>
					The Harrisburg,
				</em>
				 398 U. S.,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				at 393403, whether 
				<em>
					stare decisis
				</em>
				 required adherence to 
				<em>
					The Harrisburg,
				</em>
				 398 U. S.,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				at 403405, and whether insuperable practical difficulties would accompany 
				<em>
					The Harrisburg
				</em>
				s overruling, 398 U. S.,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				at 405408.  Answering every question no, we overruled the case and declared a new rule of maritime law: We … hold that an action does lie under general maritime law for death caused by violation of maritime duties.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 409.

				As we have noted in an earlier opinion, the wrongful-death rule of 
				<em>
					Moragne
				</em>
				 was not limited to any particular maritime duty, 
				<em>
					Yamaha Motor Corp., U. S. A.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Calhoun,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/516/199" class="subref" title="subref">516 U. S. 199</a>, n. 11 (1996) (dictum), but 
				<em>
					Moragne
				</em>
				s
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				facts were limited to the duty of seaworthiness, and so the issue of wrongful death for negligence has remained technically open.  We are able to find no rational basis, however, for distinguishing negligence from seaworthiness.  It is no less a distinctively maritime duty than seaworthiness: The common-law duties of care have not been adopted and retained unmodified by admiralty, but have been adjusted to fit their maritime context, see, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Kermarec
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Compagnie Generale Transatlantique,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">630</a>632 (1959)
, and a century ago the maritime law exchanged the common laws rule of contributory negligence for one of comparative negligence, see, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					The Max Morris,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/137/1" class="subref" title="subref">137 U. S. 1</a>,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">408</a>409 (1953)
.  Consequently the tensions and discrepancies in our precedent arising from the necessity to accommodate state remedial statutes to exclusively maritime substantive conceptswhich ultimately drove this Court in 
				<em>
					Moragne
				</em>
				 to abandon 
				<em>
					The Harrisburg, 
				</em>
				see 398 U. S., at 401were no less pronounced with maritime negligence than with unseaworthiness.  In fact, both cases cited by

				 but that does not resolve the issue here: whether 
				<em>
					requiring 
				</em>
				such an accommodation by refusing to recognize a federal remedy is preferable as a matter of maritime policy.  We think it is not.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The choice-of-law anomaly occasioned by providing a federal remedy for injury but not death is no less strange when the duty is negligence than when it is seaworthiness.  Of two victims injured at the same instant in the same location by the same negligence, only one would be covered by federal law, provided only that the other died of his injuries.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Byrd
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Napoleon Avenue Ferry Co
				</em>
				., 125 F. Supp. 573, 578 (ED La. 1954) (in case involving single car accident on ferry, applying state negligence law to claim for deceased husband's wrongful death but federal maritime negligence law to claim for surviving wife's injuries), affd, 227 F. 2d 958 (CA5 1955) 
				<em>
					(per curiam)
				</em>
				.  And cutting off the laws remedy at the death of the injured person is no less a striking departure from the result dictated by elementary principles in the law of remedies, 
				<em>
					Moragne 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					States Marine Lines, Inc.,
				</em>
				 398 U. S.,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				at 381, when the duty breached is negligence than when it is seaworthiness.  Where existing law imposes a primary duty, violations of which are compensable if they cause injury, nothing in ordinary notions of justice suggests that a violation should be nonactionable simply because it was serious enough to cause death.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  Finally, the maritime policy favoring recovery for wrongful death that 
				<em>
					Moragne
				</em>
				 found implicit in federal statutory law cannot be limited to unseaworthiness, for both of the federal acts on which 
				<em>
					Moragne
				</em>
				 relied permit recovery for negligence, see Jones Act, 46 U. S. C. App. §688(a); Death on the High Seas Act (DOHSA), 46 U. S. C. App. §761

				Weightier arguments against recognizing a wrongful-death action for negligence may be found not within general maritime law but without, in the federal statutes that provide remedies for injuries and death suffered in admiralty.  As we explained in 
				<em>
					Miles
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Apex Marine Corp.,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/498/19" class="subref" title="subref">498 U. S. 19</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">27</a> (1990)
, [w]e no longer live in an era when seamen and their loved ones must look primarily to the courts as a source of substantive legal protection from injury and death; Congress … [has] legislated extensively in these areas.  And, even in admiralty, we have no authority to substitute our views for those expressed by Congress in a duly enacted statute.  
				<em>
					Mobil Oil Corp.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Higginbotham,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/436/618" class="subref" title="subref">436 U. S. 618</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">626</a> (1978)
.  Hence, when a statute resolves a particular issue, we have held that the general maritime law must comply with that resolution.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Dooley
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">123</a>124 (1998)
.  We must therefore make careful study of the three statutes relevant here.

				The Jones Act, 46 U. S. C. App. §688(a), establishes a cause of action for negligence for injuries or death suffered in the course of employment, but only for seamen.  See generally 
				<em>
					Chandris, Inc.

 (describing test for seaman status).  Respondents son, who was not a seaman, was not covered by the Jones Act, and we have held that the Jones Act bears no implication for actions brought by nonseamen.  See, 
				<em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">282</a>283 (1980)
.  Moreover, even as to seamen, we have held that general maritime law may provide wrongful-death actions predicated on duties beyond those that the Jones Act imposes.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>

				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>

				DOHSA creates wrongful-death actions for negligence and unseaworthiness, see 
				<em>

				 at 395, but only by the personal representatives of people killed beyond a marine league from the shore of any State, 46  U. S. C. App. §761.  Respondents son was killed in state territorial waters, where DOHSA expressly provides that its provisions shall … [not] apply, §767.  In 
				<em>
					Moragne
				</em>
				, after discussing the anomalies that would result if DOHSA were interpreted to preclude federal maritime causes of action even where its terms do not apply, 398 U. S., at 395396, we held that DOHSA was not intended to preclude the availability of a remedy for wrongful death under general maritime law in situations not covered by the Act, 
				<em>
					id.,

				at 402.  Or, [t]o put it another way, … no intention appears that the Act have the effect of foreclosing any nonstatutory federal remedies that might be found appropriate to effectuate the policies of general maritime law.

            <em>

As to those two defendants, the LHWCA expressly pre-empts all other claims, §§905(a), (b); but cf.

				Petitioner argues, however, that §933s preservation-of-other-claims provisions express Congresss intent to reserve all other wrongful-death actions to the States.  That argument cannot withstand our precedent, since we have consistently interpreted §933 to preserve federal maritime claims as well as state claims, see,

				 346 U. S., at 411413 (upholding recovery for negligence under maritime law by longshoreman covered by the LHWCA).  Petitioners further contentionthat the policy implicit in the 1972 amendments to the LHWCA bars a maritime action for wrongful death though the text of those amendments (which left §933 unchanged) permits itcannot succeed.  We do not find, as petitioner does, an anti-maritime-wrongful-death policy implicit in the amendment to §905(b), see

				Even beyond the express pre-emptive reach of federal maritime statutes, however, we have acknowledged that they contain a further prudential effect.  While there is an established and continuing tradition of federal common lawmaking in admiralty, that law is to be developed, insofar as possible, to harmonize with the enactments of Congress in the field.

 (equitable lawmaking power of bankruptcy courts limited by statute).  Because of Congresss extensive involvement in legislating causes of action for maritime personal injuries, it will be the better course, in many cases that assert new claims beyond what those statutes have seen fit to allow, to leave further development to Congress.  The cause of action we recognize today, however, is new only in the most technical sense.  The general maritime law has recognized the tort of negligence for more than a century, and it has been clear since 
				<em>
					Moragne
				</em>
				 that breaches of a maritime duty are actionable when they cause death, as when they cause injury.  Congresss occupation of this field is not yet so extensive as to preclude us from recognizing what is already logically compelled by our precedents.

				According to the complaint that respondent filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, her son, Christopher Garris, sustained injuries on April 8, 1997, that caused his death one day later.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 53.  The injuries were suffered while Garris was performing sandblasting work aboard the USNS
				<em>
					 Maj. Stephen W. Pless
				</em>
				 in the employ of Tidewater Temps, Inc., a subcontractor for Mid-Atlantic Coatings, Inc., which was in turn a subcontractor for petitioner Norfolk Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock Corporation.  And the injuries were caused, the complaint continued, by the negligence of petitioner and one of its other subcontractors, since dismissed from this case.  Because the vessel was berthed in the navigable waters of the United States when Garris was injured, respondent invoked federal admiralty jurisdiction, U. S. Const., Art. III, §2, cl. 1; 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1333.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1333</a>, and prayed for damages under general maritime law.  She also asserted claims under the Virginia wrongful death statute, Va. Code Ann. §§8.0150 to 8.0156 (2000).

				The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a federal claim, for the categorical reason that no cause of action exists, under general maritime law, for death of a nonseaman in state territorial waters resulting from negligence.  No. Civ.

				For more than 80 years, from 1886 until 1970, all four issues were considered resolved, though the third not in the manner we have just described.  The governing rule then was the rule of 
				<em>
					The Harrisburg,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/119/199" class="subref" title="subref">119 U. S. 199</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">213</a> (1886)
: Although the general maritime law provides relief for injuries caused by the breach of maritime duties, it does not provide relief for wrongful death.  
				<em>
					The Harrisburg
				</em>
				 said that rule was compelled by existence of the same rule at common law, 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 213214although it acknowledged, 
				<em>
					id.,

				at 205212, that admiralty courts had held that damages for wrongful death were recoverable under maritime law, see also 
				<em>
					Moragne, supra,

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In 1969, however, we granted certiorari in 
				<em>
					Moragne 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					States Marine Lines, Inc., supra,
				</em>
				 for the express purpose of considering whether 
				<em>
					The Harrisburg

				<em>
					The Harrisburg
				</em>
				 was defensible under either the general maritime law or the policy displayed in the maritime statutes Congress had since enacted, 398 U. S.,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				at 379393, whether those statutes pre-empted judicial action overruling 
				<em>
					The Harrisburg,
				</em>
				 398 U. S.,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				at 393403, whether 
				<em>

				 required adherence to 
				<em>

				</em>
				 398 U. S.,
				<em>

				<em>
					The Harrisburg
				</em>
				s overruling, 398 U. S.,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				at 405408.  Answering every question no, we overruled the case and declared a new rule of maritime law: We … hold that an action does lie under general maritime law for death caused by violation of maritime duties.

				As we have noted in an earlier opinion, the wrongful-death rule of 
				<em>

				 was not limited to any particular maritime duty, 
				<em>
					Yamaha Motor Corp., U. S. A.

				 v. 
				<em>

				s

				facts were limited to the duty of seaworthiness, and so the issue of wrongful death for negligence has remained technically open.  We are able to find no rational basis, however, for distinguishing negligence from seaworthiness.  It is no less a distinctively maritime duty than seaworthiness: The common-law duties of care have not been adopted and retained unmodified by admiralty, but have been adjusted to fit their maritime context, see,

				such an accommodation by refusing to recognize a federal remedy is preferable as a matter of maritime policy.  We think it is not.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The choice-of-law anomaly occasioned by providing a federal remedy for injury but not death is no less strange when the duty is negligence than when it is seaworthiness.  Of two victims injured at the same instant in the same location by the same negligence, only one would be covered by federal law, provided only that the other died of his injuries.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Byrd
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Napoleon Avenue Ferry Co
				</em>
				., 125 F. Supp. 573, 578 (ED La. 1954) (in case involving single car accident on ferry, applying state negligence law to claim for deceased husband's wrongful death but federal maritime negligence law to claim for surviving wife's injuries), affd, 227 F. 2d 958 (CA5 1955) 
				<em>
					(per curiam)
				</em>
				.  And cutting off the laws remedy at the death of the injured person is no less a striking departure from the result dictated by elementary principles in the law of remedies, 
				<em>
					Moragne 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					States Marine Lines, Inc.,
				</em>
				 398 U. S.,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				at 381, when the duty breached is negligence than when it is seaworthiness.  Where existing law imposes a primary duty, violations of which are compensable if they cause injury, nothing in ordinary notions of justice suggests that a violation should be nonactionable simply because it was serious enough to cause death.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  Finally, the maritime policy favoring recovery for wrongful death that 
				<em>
					Moragne
				</em>
				 found implicit in federal statutory law cannot be limited to unseaworthiness, for both of the federal acts on which 
				<em>
					Moragne
				</em>
				 relied permit recovery for negligence, see Jones Act, 46 U. S. C. App. §688(a); Death on the High Seas Act (DOHSA), 46 U. S. C. App. §761

				Weightier arguments against recognizing a wrongful-death action for negligence may be found not within general maritime law but without, in the federal statutes that provide remedies for injuries and death suffered in admiralty.  As we explained in 
				<em>
					Miles
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Apex Marine Corp.,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/498/19" class="subref" title="subref">498 U. S. 19</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">27</a> (1990)
, [w]e no longer live in an era when seamen and their loved ones must look primarily to the courts as a source of substantive legal protection from injury and death; Congress … [has] legislated extensively in these areas.  And, even in admiralty, we have no authority to substitute our views for those expressed by Congress in a duly enacted statute.  
				<em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">626</a> (1978)
.  Hence, when a statute resolves a particular issue, we have held that the general maritime law must comply with that resolution.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Dooley
				</em>
				 v.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">123</a>124 (1998)

				The Jones Act, 46 U. S. C. App. §688(a), establishes a cause of action for negligence for injuries or death suffered in the course of employment, but only for seamen.  See generally

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">282</a>283 (1980)
.  Moreover, even as to seamen, we have held that general maritime law may provide wrongful-death actions predicated on duties beyond those that the Jones Act imposes.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,

				DOHSA creates wrongful-death actions for negligence and unseaworthiness, see

				<em>
					Moragne
				</em>
				, after discussing the anomalies that would result if DOHSA were interpreted to preclude federal maritime causes of action even where its terms do not apply, 398 U.

				<em>

As to those two defendants, the LHWCA expressly pre-empts all other claims, §§905(a), (b); but cf. 
				<em>
					Sun Ship, Inc.

				Petitioner argues, however, that §933s preservation-of-other-claims provisions express Congresss intent to reserve all other wrongful-death actions to the States.

Petitioners further contentionthat the policy implicit in the 1972 amendments to the LHWCA bars a maritime action for wrongful death though the text of those amendments (which left §933 unchanged) permits itcannot succeed.

				Even beyond the express pre-emptive reach of federal maritime statutes, however, we have acknowledged that they contain a further prudential effect.  While there is an established and continuing tradition of federal common lawmaking in admiralty, that law is to be developed, insofar as possible, to harmonize with the enactments of Congress in the field.

 (equitable lawmaking power of bankruptcy courts limited by statute).  Because of Congresss extensive involvement in legislating causes of action for maritime personal injuries, it will be the better course, in many cases that assert new claims beyond what those statutes have seen fit to allow, to leave further development to Congress.  The cause of action we recognize today, however, is new only in the most technical sense.  The general maritime law has recognized the tort of negligence for more than a century, and it has been clear since 
				<em>
					Moragne
				</em>
				 that breaches of a maritime duty are actionable when they cause death, as when they cause injury.  Congresss occupation of this field is not yet so extensive as to preclude us from recognizing what is already logically compelled by our precedents.

				According to the complaint that respondent filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, her son, Christopher Garris, sustained injuries on April 8, 1997, that caused his death one day later.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 53.  The injuries were suffered while Garris was performing sandblasting work aboard the USNS
				<em>

				 in the employ of Tidewater Temps, Inc., a subcontractor for Mid-Atlantic Coatings, Inc., which was in turn a subcontractor for petitioner Norfolk Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock Corporation.  And the injuries were caused, the complaint continued, by the negligence of petitioner and one of its other subcontractors, since dismissed from this case.  Because the vessel was berthed in the navigable waters of the United States when Garris was injured, respondent invoked federal admiralty jurisdiction, U. S. Const., Art. III, §2, cl. 1; 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1333.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1333</a>, and prayed for damages under general maritime law.  She also asserted claims under the Virginia wrongful death statute, Va. Code Ann. §§8.0150 to 8.0156 (2000).

				For more than 80 years, from 1886 until 1970, all four issues were considered resolved, though the third not in the manner we have just described.  The governing rule then was the rule of 
				<em>
					The Harrisburg,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/119/199" class="subref" title="subref">119 U. S. 199</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">213</a> (1886)
: Although the general maritime law provides relief for injuries caused by the breach of maritime duties, it does not provide relief for wrongful death.  
				<em>
					The Harrisburg
				</em>
				 said that rule was compelled by existence of the same rule at common law, 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 213214although it acknowledged, 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 205212, that admiralty courts had held that damages for wrongful death were recoverable under maritime law, see also 
				<em>
					Moragne, supra,

				 at 387388 (listing cases).

				In 1969, however, we granted certiorari in 
				<em>
					Moragne 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					States Marine Lines, Inc., supra,
				</em>
				 for the express purpose of considering whether 
				<em>
					The Harrisburg 
				</em>
				… should any longer be regarded as acceptable law.  398 U. S., at 375376.  We inquired whether the rule of 
				<em>
					The Harrisburg
				</em>
				 was defensible under either the general maritime law or the policy displayed in the maritime statutes Congress had since enacted, 398 U. S.,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				at 379393, whether those statutes pre-empted judicial action overruling 
				<em>
					The Harrisburg,
				</em>
				 398 U. S.,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				at 393403, whether 
				<em>
					stare decisis
				</em>
				 required adherence to 
				<em>
					The Harrisburg,
				</em>
				 398 U. S.,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				at 403405, and whether insuperable practical difficulties would accompany 
				<em>
					The Harrisburg
				</em>
				s overruling, 398 U. S.,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				at 405408.  Answering every question no, we overruled the case and declared a new rule of maritime law: We … hold that an action does lie under general maritime law for death caused by violation of maritime duties.

				As we have noted in an earlier opinion, the wrongful-death rule of

				<em>
					Moragne
				</em>
				s
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				facts were limited to the duty of seaworthiness, and so the issue of wrongful death for negligence has remained technically open.  We are able to find no rational basis, however, for distinguishing negligence from seaworthiness.  It is no less a distinctively maritime duty than seaworthiness: The common-law duties of care have not been adopted and retained unmodified by admiralty, but have been adjusted to fit their maritime context, see, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Kermarec
				</em>
				 v.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">630</a>632 (1959)
, and a century ago the maritime law exchanged the common laws rule of contributory negligence for one of comparative negligence, see, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					The Max Morris,

				<em>
					Moragne
				</em>
				 to abandon 
				<em>
					The Harrisburg, 
				</em>
				see 398 U. S., at 401were no less pronounced with maritime negligence than with unseaworthiness.  In fact, both cases cited by

					requiring

				such an accommodation by refusing to recognize a federal remedy is preferable as a matter of maritime policy.  We think it is not.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The choice-of-law anomaly occasioned by providing a federal remedy for injury but not death is no less strange when the duty is negligence than when it is seaworthiness.  Of two victims injured at the same instant in the same location by the same negligence, only one would be covered by federal law, provided only that the other died of his injuries.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Byrd
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Napoleon Avenue Ferry Co
				</em>
				., 125 F. Supp. 573, 578 (ED La. 1954) (in case involving single car accident on ferry, applying state negligence law to claim for deceased husband's wrongful death but federal maritime negligence law to claim for surviving wife's injuries), affd, 227 F. 2d 958 (CA5 1955) 
				<em>
					(per curiam)
				</em>
				.  And cutting off the laws remedy at the death of the injured person is no less a striking departure from the result dictated by elementary principles in the law of remedies, 
				<em>
					Moragne 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					States Marine Lines, Inc.,
				</em>
				 398 U. S.,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				at 381, when the duty breached is negligence than when it is seaworthiness.  Where existing law imposes a primary duty, violations of which are compensable if they cause injury, nothing in ordinary notions of justice suggests that a violation should be nonactionable simply because it was serious enough to cause death.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  Finally, the maritime policy favoring recovery for wrongful death that 
				<em>
					Moragne
				</em>
				 found implicit in federal statutory law cannot be limited to unseaworthiness, for both of the federal acts on which 
				<em>
					Moragne
				</em>
				 relied permit recovery for negligence, see Jones Act, 46 U. S. C. App. §688(a); Death on the High Seas Act (DOHSA), 46 U. S. C. App. §761

				Weightier arguments against recognizing a wrongful-death action for negligence may be found not within general maritime law but without, in the federal statutes that provide remedies for injuries and death suffered in admiralty.  As we explained in 
				<em>
					Miles
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Apex Marine Corp.,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/498/19" class="subref" title="subref">498 U. S. 19</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">27</a> (1990)
, [w]e no longer live in an era when seamen and their loved ones must look primarily to the courts as a source of substantive legal protection from injury and death; Congress … [has] legislated extensively in these areas.  And, even in admiralty, we have no authority to substitute our views for those expressed by Congress in a duly enacted statute.  
				<em>
					Mobil Oil Corp.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Higginbotham,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">626</a> (1978)
.  Hence, when a statute resolves a particular issue, we have held that the general maritime law must comply with that resolution.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Dooley
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">123</a>124 (1998)

				The Jones Act, 46 U. S. C. App. §688(a), establishes a cause of action for negligence for injuries or death suffered in the course of employment, but only for seamen.  See generally 
				<em>
					Chandris, Inc.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>

 (describing test for seaman status).  Respondents son, who was not a seaman, was not covered by the Jones Act, and we have held that the Jones Act bears no implication for actions brought by nonseamen.  See, 
				<em>

            <em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">282</a>283 (1980)
.  Moreover, even as to seamen, we have held that general maritime law may provide wrongful-death actions predicated on duties beyond those that the Jones Act imposes.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Miles
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>

				DOHSA creates wrongful-death actions for negligence and unseaworthiness, see

				<em>
					Moragne
				</em>
				, after discussing the anomalies that would result if DOHSA were interpreted to preclude federal maritime causes of action even where its terms do not apply, 398 U. S., at 395396, we held that DOHSA was not intended to preclude the availability of a remedy for wrongful death under general maritime law in situations not covered by the Act, 
				<em>
					id.,

As to those two defendants, the LHWCA expressly pre-empts all other claims, §§905(a), (b); but cf. 
				<em>
					Sun Ship, Inc.

Petitioners further contentionthat the policy implicit in the 1972 amendments to the LHWCA bars a maritime action for wrongful death though the text of those amendments (which left §933 unchanged) permits itcannot succeed.

				Even beyond the express pre-emptive reach of federal maritime statutes, however, we have acknowledged that they contain a further prudential effect.  While there is an established and continuing tradition of federal common lawmaking in admiralty, that law is to be developed, insofar as possible, to harmonize with the enactments of Congress in the field.

 (equitable lawmaking power of bankruptcy courts limited by statute).  Because of Congresss extensive involvement in legislating causes of action for maritime personal injuries, it will be the better course, in many cases that assert new claims beyond what those statutes have seen fit to allow, to leave further development to Congress.  The cause of action we recognize today, however, is new only in the most technical sense.  The general maritime law has recognized the tort of negligence for more than a century, and it has been clear since 
				<em>
					Moragne
				</em>
				 that breaches of a maritime duty are actionable when they cause death, as when they cause injury.  Congresss occupation of this field is not yet so extensive as to preclude us from recognizing what is already logically compelled by our precedents.

				According to the complaint that respondent filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, her son, Christopher Garris, sustained injuries on April 8, 1997, that caused his death one day later.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 53.  The injuries were suffered while Garris was performing sandblasting work aboard the USNS
				<em>
					 Maj. Stephen W. Pless
				</em>
				 in the employ of Tidewater Temps, Inc., a subcontractor for Mid-Atlantic Coatings, Inc., which was in turn a subcontractor for petitioner Norfolk Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock Corporation.  And the injuries were caused, the complaint continued, by the negligence of petitioner and one of its other subcontractors, since dismissed from this case.  Because the vessel was berthed in the navigable waters of the United States when Garris was injured, respondent invoked federal admiralty jurisdiction, U. S. Const., Art. III, §2, cl. 1; 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1333.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1333</a>, and prayed for damages under general maritime law.  She also asserted claims under the Virginia wrongful death statute, Va. Code Ann. §§8.0150 to 8.0156 (2000).

				The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a federal claim, for the categorical reason that no cause of action exists, under general maritime law, for death of a nonseaman in state territorial waters resulting from negligence.  No. Civ. A. 2:98CV382, 1998 WL 1108934, *1 (ED Va., Aug. 31, 1998) (unpublished).  The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed and remanded for further proceedings, explaining that although this Court had not yet recognized a maritime cause of action for wrongful death resulting from negligence, the principles contained in our decision in

				Three of four issues of general maritime law are settled, and the fourth is before us.  It is settled that the general maritime law imposes duties to avoid unseaworthiness and negligence, see,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">457</a> (1925)

				<em>
					Moragne 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					States Marine Lines, Inc., supra,

				 at 409.  Before us is the question whether death caused by negligence should, or must under direction of a federal statute, be treated differently.

				For more than 80 years, from 1886 until 1970, all four issues were considered resolved, though the third not in the manner we have just described.  The governing rule then was the rule of 
				<em>
					The Harrisburg,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/119/199" class="subref" title="subref">119 U. S. 199</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">213</a> (1886)
: Although the general maritime law provides relief for injuries caused by the breach of maritime duties, it does not provide relief for wrongful death.  
				<em>
					The Harrisburg
				</em>
				 said that rule was compelled by existence of the same rule at common law, 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 213214although it acknowledged, 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 205212, that admiralty courts had held that damages for wrongful death were recoverable under maritime law, see also 
				<em>
					Moragne, supra,
				</em>
				 at 387388 (listing cases).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In 1969, however, we granted certiorari in 
				<em>
					Moragne 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					States Marine Lines, Inc., supra,
				</em>
				 for the express purpose of considering whether 
				<em>
					The Harrisburg 
				</em>
				… should any longer be regarded as acceptable law.  398 U. S., at 375376.  We inquired whether the rule of 
				<em>
					The Harrisburg
				</em>
				 was defensible under either the general maritime law or the policy displayed in the maritime statutes Congress had since enacted, 398 U. S.,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				at 379393, whether those statutes pre-empted judicial action overruling 
				<em>
					The Harrisburg,
				</em>
				 398 U. S.,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				at 393403, whether 
				<em>
					stare decisis
				</em>
				 required adherence to 
				<em>
					The Harrisburg,
				</em>
				 398 U. S.,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				at 403405, and whether insuperable practical difficulties would accompany 
				<em>
					The Harrisburg
				</em>
				s overruling, 398 U. S.,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				at 405408.  Answering every question no, we overruled the case and declared a new rule of maritime law: We … hold that an action does lie under general maritime law for death caused by violation of maritime duties.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 409.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				As we have noted in an earlier opinion, the wrongful-death rule of 
				<em>
					Moragne
				</em>
				 was not limited to any particular maritime duty, 
				<em>
					Yamaha Motor Corp., U. S. A.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Calhoun,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/516/199" class="subref" title="subref">516 U. S. 199</a>, n. 11 (1996) (dictum), but 
				<em>
					Moragne
				</em>
				s
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				facts were limited to the duty of seaworthiness, and so the issue of wrongful death for negligence has remained technically open.  We are able to find no rational basis, however, for distinguishing negligence from seaworthiness.  It is no less a distinctively maritime duty than seaworthiness: The common-law duties of care have not been adopted and retained unmodified by admiralty, but have been adjusted to fit their maritime context, see, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Kermarec
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Compagnie Generale Transatlantique,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/358/625" class="subref" title="subref">358 U. S. 625</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">630</a>632 (1959)
, and a century ago the maritime law exchanged the common laws rule of contributory negligence for one of comparative negligence, see, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					The Max Morris,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/137/1" class="subref" title="subref">137 U. S. 1</a>,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">408</a>409 (1953)
.  Consequently the tensions and discrepancies in our precedent arising from the necessity to accommodate state remedial statutes to exclusively maritime substantive conceptswhich ultimately drove this Court in 
				<em>
					Moragne
				</em>
				 to abandon 
				<em>
					The Harrisburg, 
				</em>
				see 398 U. S., at 401were no less pronounced with maritime negligence than with unseaworthiness.  In fact, both cases cited by 
				<em>
					Moragne
				</em>
				 to exemplify those discrepancies involved maritime 
				<em>
					negligence

				, see

				 but that does not resolve the issue here: whether 
				<em>
					requiring 
				</em>
				such an accommodation by refusing to recognize a federal remedy is preferable as a matter of maritime policy.  We think it is not.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The choice-of-law anomaly occasioned by providing a federal remedy for injury but not death is no less strange when the duty is negligence than when it is seaworthiness.  Of two victims injured at the same instant in the same location by the same negligence, only one would be covered by federal law, provided only that the other died of his injuries.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Byrd
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Napoleon Avenue Ferry Co
				</em>
				., 125 F. Supp. 573, 578 (ED La. 1954) (in case involving single car accident on ferry, applying state negligence law to claim for deceased husband's wrongful death but federal maritime negligence law to claim for surviving wife's injuries), affd, 227 F. 2d 958 (CA5 1955) 
				<em>
					(per curiam)
				</em>
				.  And cutting off the laws remedy at the death of the injured person is no less a striking departure from the result dictated by elementary principles in the law of remedies, 
				<em>
					Moragne 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					States Marine Lines, Inc.,
				</em>
				 398 U. S.,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				at 381, when the duty breached is negligence than when it is seaworthiness.  Where existing law imposes a primary duty, violations of which are compensable if they cause injury, nothing in ordinary notions of justice suggests that a violation should be nonactionable simply because it was serious enough to cause death.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  Finally, the maritime policy favoring recovery for wrongful death that 
				<em>
					Moragne
				</em>
				 found implicit in federal statutory law cannot be limited to unseaworthiness, for both of the federal acts on which 
				<em>
					Moragne
				</em>
				 relied permit recovery for negligence, see Jones Act, 46 U. S. C. App. §688(a); Death on the High Seas Act (DOHSA), 46 U. S. C. App. §761

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">36</a>37 (1926)
 (Jones Act).  In sum, a negligent breach of a maritime duty of care being assumed by the posture of this case,

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Weightier arguments against recognizing a wrongful-death action for negligence may be found not within general maritime law but without, in the federal statutes that provide remedies for injuries and death suffered in admiralty.  As we explained in 
				<em>
					Miles
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Apex Marine Corp.,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/498/19" class="subref" title="subref">498 U. S. 19</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">27</a> (1990)
, [w]e no longer live in an era when seamen and their loved ones must look primarily to the courts as a source of substantive legal protection from injury and death; Congress … [has] legislated extensively in these areas.  And, even in admiralty, we have no authority to substitute our views for those expressed by Congress in a duly enacted statute.  
				<em>
					Mobil Oil Corp.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Higginbotham,
				</em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">626</a> (1978)
.  Hence, when a statute resolves a particular issue, we have held that the general maritime law must comply with that resolution.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Dooley
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">123</a>124 (1998)
.  We must therefore make careful study of the three statutes relevant here.

				The Jones Act, 46 U. S. C. App. §688(a), establishes a cause of action for negligence for injuries or death suffered in the course of employment, but only for seamen.  See generally 
				<em>
					Chandris, Inc.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Latsis,

 (describing test for seaman status).  Respondents son, who was not a seaman, was not covered by the Jones Act, and we have held that the Jones Act bears no implication for actions brought by nonseamen.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">282</a>283 (1980)
.  Moreover, even as to seamen, we have held that general maritime law may provide wrongful-death actions predicated on duties beyond those that the Jones Act imposes.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Miles
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Apex Marine Corp.,

				DOHSA creates wrongful-death actions for negligence and unseaworthiness, see

				<em>
					Moragne
				</em>
				, after discussing the anomalies that would result if DOHSA were interpreted to preclude federal maritime causes of action even where its terms do not apply, 398 U.

				<em>

				Petitioner argues, however, that §933s preservation-of-other-claims provisions express Congresss intent to reserve all other wrongful-death actions to the States.

				Even beyond the express pre-emptive reach of federal maritime statutes, however, we have acknowledged that they contain a further prudential effect.  While there is an established and continuing tradition of federal common lawmaking in admiralty, that law is to be developed, insofar as possible, to harmonize with the enactments of Congress in the field.

 (equitable lawmaking power of bankruptcy courts limited by statute).  Because of Congresss extensive involvement in legislating causes of action for maritime personal injuries, it will be the better course, in many cases that assert new claims beyond what those statutes have seen fit to allow, to leave further development to Congress.  The cause of action we recognize today, however, is new only in the most technical sense.  The general maritime law has recognized the tort of negligence for more than a century, and it has been clear since 
				<em>
					Moragne
				</em>
				 that breaches of a maritime duty are actionable when they cause death, as when they cause injury.  Congresss occupation of this field is not yet so extensive as to preclude us from recognizing what is already logically compelled by our precedents.

				According to the complaint that respondent filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, her son, Christopher Garris, sustained injuries on April 8, 1997, that caused his death one day later.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 53.  The injuries were suffered while Garris was performing sandblasting work aboard the USNS
				<em>

				</em>
				 in the employ of Tidewater Temps, Inc., a subcontractor for Mid-Atlantic Coatings, Inc., which was in turn a subcontractor for petitioner Norfolk Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock Corporation.  And the injuries were caused, the complaint continued, by the negligence of petitioner and one of its other subcontractors, since dismissed from this case.  Because the vessel was berthed in the navigable waters of the United States when Garris was injured, respondent invoked federal admiralty jurisdiction, U. S. Const., Art. III, §2, cl. 1; 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1333.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §1333</a>, and prayed for damages under general maritime law.  She also asserted claims under the Virginia wrongful death statute, Va. Code Ann. §§8.0150 to 8.0156 (2000).

				The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a federal claim, for the categorical reason that no cause of action exists, under general maritime law, for death of a nonseaman in state territorial waters resulting from negligence.  No. Civ. A. 2:98CV382, 1998 WL 1108934, *1 (ED Va., Aug. 31, 1998) (unpublished).

				For more than 80 years, from 1886 until 1970, all four issues were considered resolved, though the third not in the manner we have just described.  The governing rule then was the rule of 
				<em>
					The Harrisburg,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/119/199" class="subref" title="subref">119 U. S. 199</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">213</a> (1886)
: Although the general maritime law provides relief for injuries caused by the breach of maritime duties, it does not provide relief for wrongful death.  
				<em>
					The Harrisburg
				</em>
				 said that rule was compelled by existence of the same rule at common law, 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 213214although it acknowledged, 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 205212, that admiralty courts had held that damages for wrongful death were recoverable under maritime law, see also 
				<em>
					Moragne, supra,
				</em>
				 at 387388 (listing cases).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In 1969, however, we granted certiorari in 
				<em>
					Moragne 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					States Marine Lines, Inc., supra,
				</em>
				 for the express purpose of considering whether 
				<em>
					The Harrisburg 
				</em>
				… should any longer be regarded as acceptable law.  398 U. S., at 375376.  We inquired whether the rule of 
				<em>
					The Harrisburg
				</em>
				 was defensible under either the general maritime law or the policy displayed in the maritime statutes Congress had since enacted, 398 U. S.,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				at 379393, whether those statutes pre-empted judicial action overruling 
				<em>
					The Harrisburg,
				</em>
				 398 U. S.,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				at 393403, whether 
				<em>
					stare decisis
				</em>
				 required adherence to 
				<em>
					The Harrisburg,
				</em>
				 398 U. S.,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				at 403405, and whether insuperable practical difficulties would accompany 
				<em>
					The Harrisburg
				</em>
				s overruling, 398 U. S.,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				at 405408.  Answering every question no, we overruled the case and declared a new rule of maritime law: We … hold that an action does lie under general maritime law for death caused by violation of maritime duties.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 409.

				As we have noted in an earlier opinion, the wrongful-death rule of 
				<em>
					Moragne
				</em>
				 was not limited to any particular maritime duty, 
				<em>
					Yamaha Motor Corp., U. S. A.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Calhoun,

            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/516/199" class="subref" title="subref">516 U. S. 199</a>, n. 11 (1996) (dictum), but 
				<em>
					Moragne
				</em>
				s
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				facts were limited to the duty of seaworthiness, and so the issue of wrongful death for negligence has remained technically open.  We are able to find no rational basis, however, for distinguishing negligence from seaworthiness.  It is no less a distinctively maritime duty than seaworthiness: The common-law duties of care have not been adopted and retained unmodified by admiralty, but have been adjusted to fit their maritime context, see, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Kermarec
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">630</a>632 (1959)
, and a century ago the maritime law exchanged the common laws rule of contributory negligence for one of comparative negligence, see, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					The Max Morris,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/137/1" class="subref" title="subref">137 U. S. 1</a>,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">408</a>409 (1953)
.  Consequently the tensions and discrepancies in our precedent arising from the necessity to accommodate state remedial statutes to exclusively maritime substantive conceptswhich ultimately drove this Court in 
				<em>
					Moragne
				</em>
				 to abandon 
				<em>
					The Harrisburg, 
				</em>
				see 398 U. S., at 401were no less pronounced with maritime negligence than with unseaworthiness.  In fact, both cases cited by

				such an accommodation by refusing to recognize a federal remedy is preferable as a matter of maritime policy.  We think it is not.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The choice-of-law anomaly occasioned by providing a federal remedy for injury but not death is no less strange when the duty is negligence than when it is seaworthiness.  Of two victims injured at the same instant in the same location by the same negligence, only one would be covered by federal law, provided only that the other died of his injuries.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Byrd
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Napoleon Avenue Ferry Co
				</em>
				., 125 F. Supp. 573, 578 (ED La. 1954) (in case involving single car accident on ferry, applying state negligence law to claim for deceased husband's wrongful death but federal maritime negligence law to claim for surviving wife's injuries), affd, 227 F. 2d 958 (CA5 1955) 
				<em>
					(per curiam)
				</em>
				.  And cutting off the laws remedy at the death of the injured person is no less a striking departure from the result dictated by elementary principles in the law of remedies, 
				<em>
					Moragne 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					States Marine Lines, Inc.,
				</em>
				 398 U. S.,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				at 381, when the duty breached is negligence than when it is seaworthiness.  Where existing law imposes a primary duty, violations of which are compensable if they cause injury, nothing in ordinary notions of justice suggests that a violation should be nonactionable simply because it was serious enough to cause death.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  Finally, the maritime policy favoring recovery for wrongful death that 
				<em>
					Moragne
				</em>
				 found implicit in federal statutory law cannot be limited to unseaworthiness, for both of the federal acts on which 
				<em>
					Moragne
				</em>
				 relied permit recovery for negligence, see Jones Act, 46 U. S. C. App. §688(a); Death on the High Seas Act (DOHSA), 46 U. S. C. App. §761

				Weightier arguments against recognizing a wrongful-death action for negligence may be found not within general maritime law but without, in the federal statutes that provide remedies for injuries and death suffered in admiralty.  As we explained in 
				<em>
					Miles
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Apex Marine Corp.,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/498/19" class="subref" title="subref">498 U. S. 19</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">27</a> (1990)
, [w]e no longer live in an era when seamen and their loved ones must look primarily to the courts as a source of substantive legal protection from injury and death; Congress … [has] legislated extensively in these areas.  And, even in admiralty, we have no authority to substitute our views for those expressed by Congress in a duly enacted statute.  
				<em>
					Mobil Oil Corp.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Higginbotham,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/436/618" class="subref" title="subref">436 U. S. 618</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">626</a> (1978)
.  Hence, when a statute resolves a particular issue, we have held that the general maritime law must comply with that resolution.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Dooley
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Korean Air Lines Co., 
				</em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">123</a>124 (1998)
.  We must therefore make careful study of the three statutes relevant here.

				The Jones Act, 46 U. S. C. App. §688(a), establishes a cause of action for negligence for injuries or death suffered in the course of employment, but only for seamen.  See generally 
				<em>
					Chandris, Inc.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Latsis,
				</em>

 (describing test for seaman status).  Respondents son, who was not a seaman, was not covered by the Jones Act, and we have held that the Jones Act bears no implication for actions brought by nonseamen.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					American Export Lines, Inc.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Alvez,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">282</a>283 (1980)
.  Moreover, even as to seamen, we have held that general maritime law may provide wrongful-death actions predicated on duties beyond those that the Jones Act imposes.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Miles
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Apex Marine Corp.,
				</em>
            <em>

				</em>
				 at 2830 (seaworthiness).  The Jones Act does not preclude respondents negligence action.

				DOHSA creates wrongful-death actions for negligence and unseaworthiness, see 
				<em>
					Moragne, supra,
				</em>
				 at 395, but only by the personal representatives of people killed beyond a marine league from the shore of any State, 46  U. S. C. App. §761.  Respondents son was killed in state territorial waters, where DOHSA expressly provides that its provisions shall … [not] apply, §767.  In 
				<em>
					Moragne
				</em>
				, after discussing the anomalies that would result if DOHSA were interpreted to preclude federal maritime causes of action even where its terms do not apply, 398 U. S., at 395396, we held that DOHSA was not intended to preclude the availability of a remedy for wrongful death under general maritime law in situations not covered by the Act, 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 402.  Or, [t]o put it another way, … no intention appears that the Act have the effect of foreclosing any nonstatutory federal remedies that might be found appropriate to effectuate the policies of general maritime law.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/901.html" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. §901</a>
            <em>

				., provides nonseaman maritime workers such as respondents son, see §902(3) (defining covered employees), with no-fault workers compensation claims (against their employer, §904(b)) and negligence claims (against the vessel, §905(b)) for injury and death.  As to those two defendants, the LHWCA expressly pre-empts all other claims, §§905(a), (b); but cf. 
				<em>
					Sun Ship, Inc.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Pennsylvania,

            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/447/715" class="subref" title="subref">447 U. S. 715</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">723</a>726 (1980)
 (holding some state workers compensation claims against employer 
				<em>

				<em>

				Petitioner argues, however, that §933s preservation-of-other-claims provisions express Congresss intent to reserve all other wrongful-death actions to the States.  That argument cannot withstand our precedent, since we have consistently interpreted §933 to preserve federal maritime claims as well as state claims, see,

				 v. 
				<em>
					Hawn,

				 346 U. S., at 411413 (upholding recovery for negligence under maritime law by longshoreman covered by the LHWCA).  Petitioners further contentionthat the policy implicit in the 1972 amendments to the LHWCA bars a maritime action for wrongful death though the text of those amendments (which left §933 unchanged) permits itcannot succeed.  We do not find, as petitioner does, an anti-maritime-wrongful-death policy implicit in the amendment to §905(b), see 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">86</a>Stat.

				<em>

				, see 
				<em>

				at 259260.  The LHWCA therefore does not preclude this negligence action for wrongful death.

				Even beyond the express pre-emptive reach of federal maritime statutes, however, we have acknowledged that they contain a further prudential effect.  While there is an established and continuing tradition of federal common lawmaking in admiralty, that law is to be developed, insofar as possible, to harmonize with the enactments of Congress in the field.

 (equitable lawmaking power of bankruptcy courts limited by statute).  Because of Congresss extensive involvement in legislating causes of action for maritime personal injuries, it will be the better course, in many cases that assert new claims beyond what those statutes have seen fit to allow, to leave further development to Congress.  The cause of action we recognize today, however, is new only in the most technical sense.  The general maritime law has recognized the tort of negligence for more than a century, and it has been clear since 
				<em>
					Moragne
				</em>
				 that breaches of a maritime duty are actionable when they cause death, as when they cause injury.  Congresss occupation of this field is not yet so extensive as to preclude us from recognizing what is already logically compelled by our precedents.

				An attorney who successfully represents a Social Security benefits claimant in court may be awarded as part of the judgment a reasonable fee … not in excess of 25 percent of the … past-due benefits awarded to the claimant.

				Petitioners Gisbrecht, Miller, and Sandine brought separate actions in the District Court seeking Social Security disability benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act.  All three were represented by the same attorneys and prevailed on the merits of their claims.  Each petitioner then successfully sought attorneys fees under EAJA.  Pursuant to contingent-fee agreements standard for Social Security claimant representation, each petitioner had agreed to pay counsel 25 percent of all past-due benefits recovered.  Their attorneys accordingly requested $7,091.50 from Gisbrechts recovery, $7,514 from Millers, and $13,988 from Sandines.  Given the EAJA offsets, the amounts in fact payable from each clients past-due benefits recovery would have been $3,752.39 from Gisbrechts recovery, $2,349.25 from Millers, and $7,151.90 from Sandines.  Following Ninth Circuit precedent, the District Court in each case declined to give effect to the attorney-client fee agreement, instead employing a lodestar method, under which the number of hours reasonably devoted to each case was multiplied by the reasonable hourly fee.  This method yielded as §406(b) fees $3,135 from Gisbrechts recovery, $5,461.50 from Millers, and $6,550 from Sandines.  Offsetting the EAJA awards against the lodestar determinations, the court determined that no portion of Gisbrechts or Sandines past-due benefits was payable to counsel, and that only $296.75 of Millers recovery was payable to her counsel.  The Ninth Circuit consolidated the cases and affirmed.
			</p>
        <p class="SYLCTE">
            <em>
					Held:
				</em>
				 Section 406(b) does not displace contingent-fee agreements within the statutory ceiling; instead, §406(b) instructs courts to review for reasonableness fees yielded by those agreements.  Pp. 918.
			</p>
        <p class="SYLCTF">
				
				    
				(a) Section 406(b)s words, read in isolation, could be construed to allow either the Ninth Circuits lodestar approach or petitioners position that the attorney-client fee agreement should control, if not in excess of 25 percent of … the past-due benefits.  Because the statutes text is inconclusive, this Court takes into account, as interpretive guides, the origin and standard application of the proffered approaches.  Pp. 910.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				(b) The lodestar method, though rooted in accounting practices adopted in the 1940s, did not gain a firm foothold in the federal courts until the mid-1970s.  The lodestar method today holds sway in federal-court adjudication of disputes over the amount of fees properly shifted to the loser in the litigation.  Fees shifted to the losing party, however, are not at issue here.  Pp. 1012.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				(c) Section 406(b) authorizes fees payable from the successful partys recovery.  Characteristically in Social Security benefits cases, attorneys and clients enter into contingent-fee agreements specifying that the attorneys fee will be 25 percent of any past-due benefits to which the claimant becomes entitled.  Contingent-fee arrangements, though problematic, particularly when not exposed to court review, are common in the United States in many settings, and Social Security representation operates largely on a contingent-fee basis.  Before 1965, the Social Security Act imposed no limits on contingent-fee agreements drawn by counsel and signed by benefits claimants.  Arrangements yielding exorbitant fees reserved for lawyers one-third to one-half of the accrued benefits; the longer the litigation persisted, the greater the build-up of past-due benefits and, correspondingly, of legal fees awardable from those benefits if the claimant prevailed.  Attending to these realities, Congress provided for a reasonable fee, not in excess of 25 percent of accrued benefits, as part of the courts judgment, and specified that no other fee would be payable.  Violation of these limitations was made a criminal offense.  In addition to protecting claimants against inordinately large fees, Congress sought to ensure that attorneys successfully representing Social Security claimants would not risk nonpayment by their clients.  Congress therefore authorized agency payment of fees directly to counsel from funds withheld from the claimants past-due benefits.  But nothing in §406(b)s text or history reveals a design to prohibit or discourage attorneys and claimants from entering into contingent-fee agreements.  Given the prevalence of such agreements between attorneys and Social Security benefits claimants, it is unlikely that Congress, simply by prescribing reasonable fees, meant to outlaw, rather than to contain, the fee agreements.  Pp. 1215.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				(d) This conclusion is bolstered by Congress 1990 authorization of contingent-fee agreements under §406(a), which governs fees for agency-level representation.  It would be anomalous if contract-based fees expressly authorized by §406(a)(2) at the administrative level were disallowed for court representation under §406(b).  It is also unlikely that Congress, legislating in 1965, intended to install a lodestar method that courts did not develop and employ until years later.  Furthermore, the lodestar method was designed to govern imposition of fees on the losing party.  In such cases, nothing prevents the attorney for the prevailing party from gaining additional fees, pursuant to contract, from his own client.  But §406(b) governs the total fee a successful Social Security claimants attorney may receive for court representation.  Nothing more may be demanded or received from the benefits claimant.  Pp. 1517.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				(e) Most plausibly read, §406(b) does not displace contingent-fee agreements as the primary means by which fees are set for successfully representing Social Security benefits claimants in court.  Rather, §406(b) calls for court review of such arrangements to assure that they yield reasonable results in particular cases.  Within the 25 percent boundary Congress provided, the attorney for the successful claimant must show that the fee sought is reasonable for the services rendered.  Courts have reduced the attorneys recovery based on the character of the representation and the results the representative achieved.  If the attorney is responsible for delay, for example, a reduction is in order so that the attorney will not profit from the accumulation of benefits during the pendency of the case in court.  And if the benefits are large in comparison to the amount of time counsel spent on the case, a downward adjustment is similarly in order.  Pp. 1718.

				 a prevailing claimants fees are payable only out of the benefits recovered; in amount, such fees may not exceed 25 percent of past-due benefits.

				.  Is the contingent-fee agreement between claimant and counsel, if not in excess of 25 percent of past-due benefits, presumptively reasonable?

Instead, the court employed for the §406(b) fee calculation a lodestar method, under which the number of hours reasonably devoted to each case was multiplied by a reasonable hourly fee.  This method yielded as §406(b) fees $3,135 from Gisbrechts recovery, $5,461.50 from Millers, and $6,550 from Sandines.  Offsetting the EAJA awards, the court determined that no portion of Gisbrechts or Sandines past-due benefits was payable to counsel, and that only $296.75 of Millers recovery was payable to her counsel as a §406(b) fee.  The three claimants appealed.

				Beginning with the text, §406(b)s words, a reasonable fee … not in excess of 25 percent of … the past-due benefits, read in isolation, could be construed to allow either the Ninth Circuits lodestar approach or petitioners position that the attorney-client fee agreement ordinarily should control, if not in excess of 25 percent.  The provision instructs a reasonable fee, which could be measured by a lodestar calculation.  But §406(b)s language does not exclude contingent-fee contracts that produce fees no higher than the 25 percent ceiling.  Such contracts are the most common fee arrangement between attorneys and Social Security claimants.  See Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Office of Hearings and Appeals, Report to Congress: Attorney Fees Under Title II of the Social Security Act 15, 66, 70 (July 1988) (hereinafter SSA Report); Brief for National Organization of Social Security Claimants Representatives as

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The lodestar method has its roots in accounting practices adopted in the 1940s to allow attorneys and firms to determine whether fees charged were sufficient to cover overhead and generate suitable profits.  W. Ross, The Honest Hour: The Ethics of Time-Based Billing by Attorneys 16 (1996) (hereinafter Honest Hour).  An American Bar Association (ABA) report, published in 1958, observed that attorneys earnings had failed to keep pace with the rate of inflation; the report urged attorneys to record the hours spent on each case in order to ensure that fees ultimately charged afforded reasonable compensation for counsels efforts.  See Special Committee on Economics of Law Practice, The 1958 Lawyer and His 1938 Dollar 910 (reprint 1959).

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Hourly records initially provided only an internal accounting check.  See Honest Hour 19.  The fees actually charged might be determined under any number of methods: the annual retainer; the fee-for-service method; the eyeball method, under which the attorney estimated an annual fee for regular clients; or the contingent-fee method, recognized by this Court in

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">556</a> (1877)
, and formally approved by the ABA in 1908.  See Honest Hour 1319.  As it became standard accounting practice to record hours spent on a clients matter, attorneys increasingly realized that billing by hours devoted to a case was administratively convenient; moreover, as an objective measure of a lawyers labor, hourly billing was readily impartable to the client.  
				<em>

				The federal courts did not swiftly settle on hourly rates as the overriding criterion for attorneys fee awards.  In 1974, for example, the Fifth Circuit issued an influential opinion holding that, in setting fees under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,

				Before 1965, the Social Security Act imposed no limits on contingent-fee agreements drawn by counsel and signed by benefits claimants.  In formulating the 1965 Social Security Act amendments that included §406(b), Congress recognized that attorneys have upon occasion charged … inordinately large fees for representing claimants [in court].  S. Rep. No. 404, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 1, p. 122 (1965).  Arrangements yielding exorbitant fees, the Senate Report observed, reserved for the lawyer one-third to one-half of the accrued benefits.  
				<em>

				Attending to these realities, Congress provided for a reasonable fee, not in excess of 25 percent of accrued benefits as part of the courts judgment, and further specified that no other fee would be payable.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  Violation of the reasonable fee or 25 percent of accrued benefits limitation was made subject to the same penalties as those applicable for charging a fee larger than the amount approved by the Commissioner for services at the administrative levela fine of up to $500, one years imprisonment, or both.

				Congress thus sought to protect claimants against inordinately large fees and also to ensure that attorneys representing successful claimants would not risk nonpayment of [appropriate] fees.  SSA Report 66 (internal quotation marks omitted).  But nothing in the text or history of §406(b) reveals a desig[n] to prohibit or discourage attorneys and claimants from entering into contingent fee agreements.

				This conclusion is bolstered by Congress 1990 authorization of contingent-fee agreements under §406(a), the provision governing fees for agency-level representation.  Before enacting this express authorization, Congress instructed the Social Security Administration to prepare a report on attorneys fees under Title II of the Social Security Act.  Pub.

<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">101</a>Stat.
1330295.  The report, presented to Congress in 1988, reviewed several methods of determining attorneys fees, including the lodestar method.  See SSA Report 1011.  This review led the agency to inform Congress that, although the contingency method was hardly flawless, the agency could identify no more effective means of ensuring claimant access to attorney representation.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 25.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Congress subsequently altered §406(a) to validate contingent-fee agreements filed with the agency prior to disposition of the claim for benefits.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/406.html#a_2" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §406(a)(2)</a> (1994 ed.);

				It is also unlikely that Congress, legislating in 1965, and providing for a contingent fee tied to a 25 percent of past-due benefits boundary, intended to install a lodestar method courts did not develop until some years later.  See 
				<em>
					supra,
				</em>
				 at 1011.  Furthermore, we again emphasize, the lodestar method was designed to govern imposition of fees on the losing party.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Dague,
				</em>
				 505 U. S., at 562.  In such cases, nothing prevents the attorney for the prevailing party from gaining additional fees, pursuant to contract, from his own client.  See

Indeed, depriving plaintiffs of the option of promising to pay more than the statutory fee if that is necessary to secure counsel of their choice would not further §1988s general purpose of enabling such plaintiffs … to secure competent counsel.).  By contrast, §406(b) governs the total fee a claimants attorney may receive for court representation; any endeavor by the claimants attorney to gain more than that fee, or to charge the claimant a noncontingent fee, is a criminal offense.

				Most plausibly read, we conclude, §406(b) does not displace contingent-fee agreements as the primary means by which fees are set for successfully representing Social Security benefits claimants in court.  Rather, §406(b) calls for court review of such arrangements as an independent check, to assure that they yield reasonable results in particular cases.

				Courts that approach fee determinations by looking first to the contingent-fee agreement, then testing it for reasonableness, have appropriately reduced the attorneys recovery based on the character of the representation and the results the representative achieved.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g., McGuire,
				</em>
				 873 F. 2d, at 983 (Although the contingency agreement should be given significant weight in fixing a fee, a district judge must independently assess the reasonableness of its terms.); 
				<em>

				v. 
				<em>
					Secretary of Health and Human Servs.,
				</em>
				 707 F. 2d 246, 249250 (CA6 1983) (instructing reduced fee when representation is substandard).  If the attorney is responsible for delay, for example, a reduction is in order so that the attorney will not profit from the accumulation of benefits during the pendency of the case in court.  See 
				<em>
					Rodriquez,
				</em>
				 865 F. 2d, at 746747.  If the benefits are large in comparison to the amount of time counsel spent on the case, a downward adjustment is similarly in order.  See 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 747 (reviewing court should disallow windfalls for lawyers); 
				<em>
					Wells,
				</em>
				 907 F. 2d, at 372 (same).  In this regard, the court may require the claimants attorney to submit, not as a basis for satellite litigation, but as an aid to the courts assessment of the reasonableness of the fee yielded by the fee agreement, a record of the hours spent representing the claimant and a statement of the lawyers normal hourly billing charge for noncontingent-fee cases.  See 
				<em>
					Rodriquez,
				</em>
				 865 F. 2d, at 741.  Judges of our district courts are accustomed to making reasonableness determinations in a wide variety of contexts, and their assessments in such matters, in the

				The courts below erroneously read §406(b) to override  customary attorney-client contingent-fee agreements.  We hold that §406(b) does not displace contingent-fee agreements within the statutory ceiling; instead, §406(b) instructs courts to review for reasonableness fees yielded by those agreements.  Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

						 Before 1965, Congress did not explicitly authorize attorneys fees for in-court representation of Social Security benefits claimants.  At least two Courts of Appeals, however, concluded that 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/405.html#g" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §405(g)</a> implicitly authorized such fees.  See Bowen v. Galbreath,

McDonald, 237 F. 2d 380, 382383 (CA4 1956)].).


As to administrative proceedings, the Social Security Act originally made no provision for attorneys fees.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/20/403" class="subref" title="subref">20 CFR §403.713</a>(d) (1949).  The agency later prescribed separate fees for representation at the initial and appellate levels of the administrative process.

Evaluating a request for approval of a fee.

(i) The extent and type of services the representative performed;

(iii) The level of skill and competence required of the representative in giving the services;

(vi) The level of review to which the claim was taken and the level of the review at which the representative became your representative; and


(vii) The amount of fee the representative requests for his or her services, including any amount authorized or requested before, but not including the amount of any expenses he or she incurred.


(2) Although we consider the amount of benefits, if any, that are payable, we do not base the amount of fee we authorize on the amount of the benefit alone, but on a consideration of all the factors listed in this section.  The benefits payable in any claim are determined by specific provisions of law and are unrelated to the efforts of the representative.  We may authorize a fee even if no benefits are payable.

				Beginning with the text, §406(b)s words, a reasonable fee … not in excess of 25 percent of … the past-due benefits, read in isolation, could be construed to allow either the Ninth Circuits lodestar approach or petitioners position that the attorney-client fee agreement ordinarily should control, if not in excess of 25 percent.  The provision instructs a reasonable fee, which could be measured by a lodestar calculation.  But §406(b)s language does not exclude contingent-fee contracts that produce fees no higher than the 25 percent ceiling.  Such contracts are the most common fee arrangement between attorneys and Social Security claimants.  See Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Office of Hearings and Appeals, Report to Congress: Attorney Fees Under Title II of the Social Security Act 15, 66, 70 (July 1988) (hereinafter SSA Report); Brief for National Organization of Social Security Claimants Representatives as 
				<em>
					Amicus Curiae
				</em>
				 12.   Looking outside the statutes inconclusive text, we next take into account, as interpretive guides, the origin and standard application of the proffered approaches.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The lodestar method has its roots in accounting practices adopted in the 1940s to allow attorneys and firms to determine whether fees charged were sufficient to cover overhead and generate suitable profits.  W. Ross, The Honest Hour: The Ethics of Time-Based Billing by Attorneys 16 (1996) (hereinafter Honest Hour).  An American Bar Association (ABA) report, published in 1958, observed that attorneys earnings had failed to keep pace with the rate of inflation; the report urged attorneys to record the hours spent on each case in order to ensure that fees ultimately charged afforded reasonable compensation for counsels efforts.  See Special Committee on Economics of Law Practice, The 1958 Lawyer and His 1938 Dollar 910 (reprint 1959).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Hourly records initially provided only an internal accounting check.  See Honest Hour 19.  The fees actually charged might be determined under any number of methods: the annual retainer; the fee-for-service method; the eyeball method, under which the attorney estimated an annual fee for regular clients; or the contingent-fee method, recognized by this Court in 
				<em>
					Stanton

					Embrey,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">556</a> (1877)
, and formally approved by the ABA in 1908.  See Honest Hour 1319.  As it became standard accounting practice to record hours spent on a clients matter, attorneys increasingly realized that billing by hours devoted to a case was administratively convenient; moreover, as an objective measure of a lawyers labor, hourly billing was readily impartable to the client.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 18.  By the early 1970s, the practice of hourly billing had become widespread.  See 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 19, 21.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The federal courts did not swiftly settle on hourly rates as the overriding criterion for attorneys fee awards.  In 1974, for example, the Fifth Circuit issued an influential opinion holding that, in setting fees under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/2000e-5.html#k" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §2000e5(k)</a> (1970 ed.), courts should consider not only the number of hours devoted to a case but also 11 other factors.

				Contingent fees, though problematic, particularly when not exposed to court review, are common in the United States in many settings.  Such fees, perhaps most visible in tort litigation, are also used in,

				Before 1965, the Social Security Act imposed no limits on contingent-fee agreements drawn by counsel and signed by benefits claimants.  In formulating the 1965 Social Security Act amendments that included §406(b), Congress recognized that attorneys have upon occasion charged … inordinately large fees for representing claimants [in court].  S. Rep. No. 404, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 1, p. 122 (1965).  Arrangements yielding exorbitant fees, the Senate Report observed, reserved for the lawyer one-third to one-half of the accrued benefits.  
				<em>

				  Congress was mindful, too, that the longer the litigation persisted, the greater the build-up of past-due benefits and, correspondingly, of legal fees awardable from those benefits if the claimant prevailed.

				Attending to these realities, Congress provided for a reasonable fee, not in excess of 25 percent of accrued benefits as part of the courts judgment, and further specified that no other fee would be payable.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  Violation of the reasonable fee or 25 percent of accrued benefits limitation was made subject to the same penalties as those applicable for charging a fee larger than the amount approved by the Commissioner for services at the administrative levela fine of up to $500, one years imprisonment, or both.

				Congress thus sought to protect claimants against inordinately large fees and also to ensure that attorneys representing successful claimants would not risk nonpayment of [appropriate] fees.  SSA Report 66 (internal quotation marks omitted).  But nothing in the text or history of §406(b) reveals a desig[n] to prohibit or discourage attorneys and claimants from entering into contingent fee agreements.  
				<em>
					Ibid

				.  Given the prevalence of contingent-fee agreements between attorneys and Social Security claimants, it is unlikely that Congress, simply by prescribing reasonable fees, meant to outlaw, rather than to contain, such agreements.

				This conclusion is bolstered by Congress 1990 authorization of contingent-fee agreements under §406(a), the provision governing fees for agency-level representation.  Before enacting this express authorization, Congress instructed the Social Security Administration to prepare a report on attorneys fees under Title II of the Social Security Act.  Pub. L. 100203, §9021(b), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">101</a>Stat.
1330295.  The report, presented to Congress in 1988, reviewed several methods of determining attorneys fees, including the lodestar method.  See SSA Report 1011.  This review led the agency to inform Congress that, although the contingency method was hardly flawless, the agency could identify no more effective means of ensuring claimant access to attorney representation.

				</em>
				 at 25.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Congress subsequently altered §406(a) to validate contingent-fee agreements filed with the agency prior to disposition of the claim for benefits.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/406.html#a_2" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §406(a)(2)</a> (1994 ed.); 
				<em>
					supra,
				</em>

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It is also unlikely that Congress, legislating in 1965, and providing for a contingent fee tied to a 25 percent of past-due benefits boundary, intended to install a lodestar method courts did not develop until some years later.  See 
				<em>
					supra,
				</em>
				 at 1011.  Furthermore, we again emphasize, the lodestar method was designed to govern imposition of fees on the losing party.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Dague,
				</em>
				 505 U. S., at 562.  In such cases, nothing prevents the attorney for the prevailing party from gaining additional fees, pursuant to contract, from his own client.  See 
				<em>
					Venegas
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Mitchell,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/495/82" class="subref" title="subref">495 U. S. 82</a>, 8990 (1990) ([None] of our cases has indicated that [42 U. S.

Indeed, depriving plaintiffs of the option of promising to pay more than the statutory fee if that is necessary to secure counsel of their choice would not further §1988s general purpose of enabling such plaintiffs … to secure competent counsel.).  By contrast, §406(b) governs the total fee a claimants attorney may receive for court representation; any endeavor by the claimants attorney to gain more than that fee, or to charge the claimant a noncontingent fee, is a criminal offense.

				Most plausibly read, we conclude, §406(b) does not displace contingent-fee agreements as the primary means by which fees are set for successfully representing Social Security benefits claimants in court.  Rather, §406(b) calls for court review of such arrangements as an independent check, to assure that they yield reasonable results in particular cases.

				Courts that approach fee determinations by looking first to the contingent-fee agreement, then testing it for reasonableness, have appropriately reduced the attorneys recovery based on the character of the representation and the results the representative achieved.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g., McGuire,
				</em>
				 873 F. 2d, at 983 (Although the contingency agreement should be given significant weight in fixing a fee, a district judge must independently assess the reasonableness of its terms.);

				<em>
					Secretary of Health and Human Servs.,
				</em>
				 707 F. 2d 246, 249250 (CA6 1983) (instructing reduced fee when representation is substandard).  If the attorney is responsible for delay, for example, a reduction is in order so that the attorney will not profit from the accumulation of benefits during the pendency of the case in court.  See 
				<em>
					Rodriquez,
				</em>
				 865 F. 2d, at 746747.  If the benefits are large in comparison to the amount of time counsel spent on the case, a downward adjustment is similarly in order.  See 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 747 (reviewing court should disallow windfalls for lawyers); 
				<em>
					Wells,
				</em>
				 907 F. 2d, at 372 (same).  In this regard, the court may require the claimants attorney to submit, not as a basis for satellite litigation, but as an aid to the courts assessment of the reasonableness of the fee yielded by the fee agreement, a record of the hours spent representing the claimant and a statement of the lawyers normal hourly billing charge for noncontingent-fee cases.  See 
				<em>
					Rodriquez,
				</em>
				 865 F. 2d, at 741.  Judges of our district courts are accustomed to making reasonableness determinations in a wide variety of contexts, and their assessments in such matters, in the

				The courts below erroneously read §406(b) to override  customary attorney-client contingent-fee agreements.  We hold that §406(b) does not displace contingent-fee agreements within the statutory ceiling; instead, §406(b) instructs courts to review for reasonableness fees yielded by those agreements.  Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

						 Before 1965, Congress did not explicitly authorize attorneys fees for in-court representation of Social Security benefits claimants.  At least two Courts of Appeals, however, concluded that 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/405.html#g" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §405(g)</a> implicitly authorized such fees.  See Bowen v. Galbreath,

Their attorneys accordingly requested §406(b) fees of $7,091.50 from Gisbrechts recovery, $7,514 from Millers, and $13,988 from Sandines.

Instead, the court employed for the §406(b) fee calculation a lodestar method, under which the number of hours reasonably devoted to each case was multiplied by a reasonable hourly fee.  This method yielded as §406(b) fees $3,135 from Gisbrechts recovery, $5,461.50 from Millers, and $6,550 from Sandines.  Offsetting the EAJA awards, the court determined that no portion of Gisbrechts or Sandines past-due benefits was payable to counsel, and that only $296.75 of Millers recovery was payable to her counsel as a §406(b) fee.

				Beginning with the text, §406(b)s words, a reasonable fee … not in excess of 25 percent of … the past-due benefits, read in isolation, could be construed to allow either the Ninth Circuits lodestar approach or petitioners position that the attorney-client fee agreement ordinarily should control, if not in excess of 25 percent.  The provision instructs a reasonable fee, which could be measured by a lodestar calculation.  But §406(b)s language does not exclude contingent-fee contracts that produce fees no higher than the 25 percent ceiling.  Such contracts are the most common fee arrangement between attorneys and Social Security claimants.  See Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Office of Hearings and Appeals, Report to Congress: Attorney Fees Under Title II of the Social Security Act 15, 66, 70 (July 1988) (hereinafter SSA Report); Brief for National Organization of Social Security Claimants Representatives as

				 12.   Looking outside the statutes inconclusive text, we next take into account, as interpretive guides, the origin and standard application of the proffered approaches.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The lodestar method has its roots in accounting practices adopted in the 1940s to allow attorneys and firms to determine whether fees charged were sufficient to cover overhead and generate suitable profits.  W. Ross, The Honest Hour: The Ethics of Time-Based Billing by Attorneys 16 (1996) (hereinafter Honest Hour).  An American Bar Association (ABA) report, published in 1958, observed that attorneys earnings had failed to keep pace with the rate of inflation; the report urged attorneys to record the hours spent on each case in order to ensure that fees ultimately charged afforded reasonable compensation for counsels efforts.  See Special Committee on Economics of Law Practice, The 1958 Lawyer and His 1938 Dollar 910 (reprint 1959).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Hourly records initially provided only an internal accounting check.  See Honest Hour 19.  The fees actually charged might be determined under any number of methods: the annual retainer; the fee-for-service method; the eyeball method, under which the attorney estimated an annual fee for regular clients; or the contingent-fee method, recognized by this Court in

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">556</a> (1877)
, and formally approved by the ABA in 1908.  See Honest Hour 1319.  As it became standard accounting practice to record hours spent on a clients matter, attorneys increasingly realized that billing by hours devoted to a case was administratively convenient; moreover, as an objective measure of a lawyers labor, hourly billing was readily impartable to the client.

				Before 1965, the Social Security Act imposed no limits on contingent-fee agreements drawn by counsel and signed by benefits claimants.  In formulating the 1965 Social Security Act amendments that included §406(b), Congress recognized that attorneys have upon occasion charged … inordinately large fees for representing claimants [in court].  S. Rep. No. 404, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 1, p. 122 (1965).  Arrangements yielding exorbitant fees, the Senate Report observed, reserved for the lawyer one-third to one-half of the accrued benefits.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  Congress was mindful, too, that the longer the litigation persisted, the greater the build-up of past-due benefits and, correspondingly, of legal fees awardable from those benefits if the claimant prevailed.

				Attending to these realities, Congress provided for a reasonable fee, not in excess of 25 percent of accrued benefits as part of the courts judgment, and further specified that no other fee would be payable.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  Violation of the reasonable fee or 25 percent of accrued benefits limitation was made subject to the same penalties as those applicable for charging a fee larger than the amount approved by the Commissioner for services at the administrative levela fine of up to $500, one years imprisonment, or both.

				Congress thus sought to protect claimants against inordinately large fees and also to ensure that attorneys representing successful claimants would not risk nonpayment of [appropriate] fees.  SSA Report 66 (internal quotation marks omitted).  But nothing in the text or history of §406(b) reveals a desig[n] to prohibit or discourage attorneys and claimants from entering into contingent fee agreements.

				This conclusion is bolstered by Congress 1990 authorization of contingent-fee agreements under §406(a), the provision governing fees for agency-level representation.  Before enacting this express authorization, Congress instructed the Social Security Administration to prepare a report on attorneys fees under Title II of the Social Security Act.  Pub. L. 100203, §9021(b), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">101</a>Stat.
1330295.  The report, presented to Congress in 1988, reviewed several methods of determining attorneys fees, including the lodestar method.  See SSA Report 1011.  This review led the agency to inform Congress that, although the contingency method was hardly flawless, the agency could identify no more effective means of ensuring claimant access to attorney representation.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 25.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Congress subsequently altered §406(a) to validate contingent-fee agreements filed with the agency prior to disposition of the claim for benefits.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/406.html#a_2" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §406(a)(2)</a> (1994 ed.);

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It is also unlikely that Congress, legislating in 1965, and providing for a contingent fee tied to a 25 percent of past-due benefits boundary, intended to install a lodestar method courts did not develop until some years later.  See 
				<em>
					supra,
				</em>
				 at 1011.  Furthermore, we again emphasize, the lodestar method was designed to govern imposition of fees on the losing party.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Dague,
				</em>
				 505 U. S., at 562.  In such cases, nothing prevents the attorney for the prevailing party from gaining additional fees, pursuant to contract, from his own client.  See 
				<em>
					Venegas
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Mitchell,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/495/82" class="subref" title="subref">495 U. S. 82</a>, 8990 (1990) ([None] of our cases has indicated that [42 U. S.

Indeed, depriving plaintiffs of the option of promising to pay more than the statutory fee if that is necessary to secure counsel of their choice would not further §1988s general purpose of enabling such plaintiffs … to secure competent counsel.).  By contrast, §406(b) governs the total fee a claimants attorney may receive for court representation; any endeavor by the claimants attorney to gain more than that fee, or to charge the claimant a noncontingent fee, is a criminal offense.

				Most plausibly read, we conclude, §406(b) does not displace contingent-fee agreements as the primary means by which fees are set for successfully representing Social Security benefits claimants in court.  Rather, §406(b) calls for court review of such arrangements as an independent check, to assure that they yield reasonable results in particular cases.

				Courts that approach fee determinations by looking first to the contingent-fee agreement, then testing it for reasonableness, have appropriately reduced the attorneys recovery based on the character of the representation and the results the representative achieved.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g., McGuire,
				</em>

				<em>
					Secretary of Health and Human Servs.,
				</em>
				 707 F. 2d 246, 249250 (CA6 1983) (instructing reduced fee when representation is substandard).  If the attorney is responsible for delay, for example, a reduction is in order so that the attorney will not profit from the accumulation of benefits during the pendency of the case in court.  See 
				<em>
					Rodriquez,
				</em>
				 865 F. 2d, at 746747.  If the benefits are large in comparison to the amount of time counsel spent on the case, a downward adjustment is similarly in order.  See 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 747 (reviewing court should disallow windfalls for lawyers); 
				<em>
					Wells,
				</em>
				 907 F. 2d, at 372 (same).  In this regard, the court may require the claimants attorney to submit, not as a basis for satellite litigation, but as an aid to the courts assessment of the reasonableness of the fee yielded by the fee agreement, a record of the hours spent representing the claimant and a statement of the lawyers normal hourly billing charge for noncontingent-fee cases.  See

						 Although the claimants were named as the appellants below, and are named as petitioners here, the real parties in interest are their attorneys, who seek to obtain higher fee awards under §406(b).  For convenience, we nonetheless refer to claimants as petitioners.  See Hopkins v. Cohen,

We also note that the Commissioner of Social Security here, as in the Ninth Circuit, has no direct financial stake in the answer to the §406(b) question; instead, she plays a part in the fee determination resembling that of a trustee for the claimants.  See, e.g., Lewis v. Secretary of Health and Human Servs., 707 F. 2d 246, 248 (CA6 1983).

				.  Is the contingent-fee agreement between claimant and counsel, if not in excess of 25 percent of past-due benefits, presumptively reasonable?

Their attorneys accordingly requested §406(b) fees of $7,091.50 from Gisbrechts recovery, $7,514 from Millers, and $13,988 from Sandines.  Given the EAJA offsets, the amounts in fact payable from each clients past-due benefits recovery would have been $3,752.39 from Gisbrechts recovery, $2,349.25 from Millers, and $7,151.90 from Sandines.

Instead, the court employed for the §406(b) fee calculation a lodestar method, under which the number of hours reasonably devoted to each case was multiplied by a reasonable hourly fee.  This method yielded as §406(b) fees $3,135 from Gisbrechts recovery, $5,461.50 from Millers, and $6,550 from Sandines.  Offsetting the EAJA awards, the court determined that no portion of Gisbrechts or Sandines past-due benefits was payable to counsel, and that only $296.75 of Millers recovery was payable to her counsel as a §406(b) fee.

				Beginning with the text, §406(b)s words, a reasonable fee … not in excess of 25 percent of … the past-due benefits, read in isolation, could be construed to allow either the Ninth Circuits lodestar approach or petitioners position that the attorney-client fee agreement ordinarily should control, if not in excess of 25 percent.  The provision instructs a reasonable fee, which could be measured by a lodestar calculation.  But §406(b)s language does not exclude contingent-fee contracts that produce fees no higher than the 25 percent ceiling.  Such contracts are the most common fee arrangement between attorneys and Social Security claimants.  See Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Office of Hearings and Appeals, Report to Congress: Attorney Fees Under Title II of the Social Security Act 15, 66, 70 (July 1988) (hereinafter SSA Report); Brief for National Organization of Social Security Claimants Representatives as

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The lodestar method has its roots in accounting practices adopted in the 1940s to allow attorneys and firms to determine whether fees charged were sufficient to cover overhead and generate suitable profits.  W. Ross, The Honest Hour: The Ethics of Time-Based Billing by Attorneys 16 (1996) (hereinafter Honest Hour).  An American Bar Association (ABA) report, published in 1958, observed that attorneys earnings had failed to keep pace with the rate of inflation; the report urged attorneys to record the hours spent on each case in order to ensure that fees ultimately charged afforded reasonable compensation for counsels efforts.  See Special Committee on Economics of Law Practice, The 1958 Lawyer and His 1938 Dollar 910 (reprint 1959).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Hourly records initially provided only an internal accounting check.  See Honest Hour 19.  The fees actually charged might be determined under any number of methods: the annual retainer; the fee-for-service method; the eyeball method, under which the attorney estimated an annual fee for regular clients; or the contingent-fee method, recognized by this Court in

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">556</a> (1877)
, and formally approved by the ABA in 1908.  See Honest Hour 1319.  As it became standard accounting practice to record hours spent on a clients matter, attorneys increasingly realized that billing by hours devoted to a case was administratively convenient; moreover, as an objective measure of a lawyers labor, hourly billing was readily impartable to the client.  
				<em>

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The federal courts did not swiftly settle on hourly rates as the overriding criterion for attorneys fee awards.  In 1974, for example, the Fifth Circuit issued an influential opinion holding that, in setting fees under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,

				Contingent fees, though problematic, particularly when not exposed to court review, are common in the United States in many settings.  Such fees, perhaps most visible in tort litigation, are also used in,

				Before 1965, the Social Security Act imposed no limits on contingent-fee agreements drawn by counsel and signed by benefits claimants.  In formulating the 1965 Social Security Act amendments that included §406(b), Congress recognized that attorneys have upon occasion charged … inordinately large fees for representing claimants [in court].  S. Rep. No. 404, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 1, p. 122 (1965).  Arrangements yielding exorbitant fees, the Senate Report observed, reserved for the lawyer one-third to one-half of the accrued benefits.

				Attending to these realities, Congress provided for a reasonable fee, not in excess of 25 percent of accrued benefits as part of the courts judgment, and further specified that no other fee would be payable.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  Violation of the reasonable fee or 25 percent of accrued benefits limitation was made subject to the same penalties as those applicable for charging a fee larger than the amount approved by the Commissioner for services at the administrative levela fine of up to $500, one years imprisonment, or both.

				Congress thus sought to protect claimants against inordinately large fees and also to ensure that attorneys representing successful claimants would not risk nonpayment of [appropriate] fees.  SSA Report 66 (internal quotation marks omitted).  But nothing in the text or history of §406(b) reveals a desig[n] to prohibit or discourage attorneys and claimants from entering into contingent fee agreements.

				This conclusion is bolstered by Congress 1990 authorization of contingent-fee agreements under §406(a), the provision governing fees for agency-level representation.  Before enacting this express authorization, Congress instructed the Social Security Administration to prepare a report on attorneys fees under Title II of the Social Security Act.  Pub.

<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">101</a>Stat.
1330295.  The report, presented to Congress in 1988, reviewed several methods of determining attorneys fees, including the lodestar method.  See SSA Report 1011.  This review led the agency to inform Congress that, although the contingency method was hardly flawless, the agency could identify no more effective means of ensuring claimant access to attorney representation.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 25.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Congress subsequently altered §406(a) to validate contingent-fee agreements filed with the agency prior to disposition of the claim for benefits.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/406.html#a_2" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §406(a)(2)</a> (1994 ed.);

				It is also unlikely that Congress, legislating in 1965, and providing for a contingent fee tied to a 25 percent of past-due benefits boundary, intended to install a lodestar method courts did not develop until some years later.  See 
				<em>
					supra,
				</em>
				 at 1011.  Furthermore, we again emphasize, the lodestar method was designed to govern imposition of fees on the losing party.  See, 
				<em>

            <em>
					Dague,

By contrast, §406(b) governs the total fee a claimants attorney may receive for court representation; any endeavor by the claimants attorney to gain more than that fee, or to charge the claimant a noncontingent fee, is a criminal offense.

				Most plausibly read, we conclude, §406(b) does not displace contingent-fee agreements as the primary means by which fees are set for successfully representing Social Security benefits claimants in court.  Rather, §406(b) calls for court review of such arrangements as an independent check, to assure that they yield reasonable results in particular cases.

				Courts that approach fee determinations by looking first to the contingent-fee agreement, then testing it for reasonableness, have appropriately reduced the attorneys recovery based on the character of the representation and the results the representative achieved.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g., McGuire,
				</em>
				 873 F. 2d, at 983 (Although the contingency agreement should be given significant weight in fixing a fee, a district judge must independently assess the reasonableness of its terms.); 
				<em>
					Lewis 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					Secretary of Health and Human Servs.,
				</em>
				 707 F. 2d 246, 249250 (CA6 1983) (instructing reduced fee when representation is substandard).  If the attorney is responsible for delay, for example, a reduction is in order so that the attorney will not profit from the accumulation of benefits during the pendency of the case in court.  See 
				<em>
					Rodriquez,
				</em>
				 865 F. 2d, at 746747.  If the benefits are large in comparison to the amount of time counsel spent on the case, a downward adjustment is similarly in order.  See 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 747 (reviewing court should disallow windfalls for lawyers); 
				<em>
					Wells,
				</em>
				 907 F. 2d, at 372 (same).  In this regard, the court may require the claimants attorney to submit, not as a basis for satellite litigation, but as an aid to the courts assessment of the reasonableness of the fee yielded by the fee agreement, a record of the hours spent representing the claimant and a statement of the lawyers normal hourly billing charge for noncontingent-fee cases.  See 
				<em>
					Rodriquez,
				</em>
				 865 F. 2d, at 741.  Judges of our district courts are accustomed to making reasonableness determinations in a wide variety of contexts, and their assessments in such matters, in the
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				event of an appeal, ordinarily qualify for highly re-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>

				The courts below erroneously read §406(b) to override  customary attorney-client contingent-fee agreements.  We hold that §406(b) does not displace contingent-fee agreements within the statutory ceiling; instead, §406(b) instructs courts to review for reasonableness fees yielded by those agreements.  Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

						 Before 1965, Congress did not explicitly authorize attorneys fees for in-court representation of Social Security benefits claimants.  At least two Courts of Appeals, however, concluded that 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/405.html#g" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §405(g)</a> implicitly authorized such fees.  See Bowen v. Galbreath,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">75</a>76 (1988)
 (citing Celebrezze v. Sparks, 342 F. 2d 286 (CA5 1965)) (Under 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/405.html#g" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §405(g)</a>, a court reviewing [a Social Security benefits decision] has the power to enter a judgment affirming, modifying, or reversing the decision … .  The court in Sparks reasoned that where a statute gives a court jurisdiction, it must be presumed, absent any indication to the contrary, that the court was intended to exercise all the powers of a court, including the power to provide for payment of attorneys fees out of any recovery.  342 F. 2d, at 288289 [citing Folsom v. McDonald, 237 F. 2d 380, 382383 (CA4 1956)].).


As to administrative proceedings, the Social Security Act originally made no provision for attorneys fees.  
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">49</a>Stat.
620 (1935).  Four years later, Congress amended the Act to permit the Social Security Board to prescribe maximum fees attorneys could charge for representation of claimants before the agency.  Social Security Act Amendments of 1939,

The Board subsequently established a maximum fee of $10, permitting a higher fee only by petition to the agency.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/20/403" class="subref" title="subref">20 CFR §403.713</a>(d) (1949).  The agency later prescribed separate fees for representation at the initial and appellate levels of the administrative process.

Evaluating a request for approval of a fee.


(1) When we evaluate a representatives request for approval of a fee, we consider the purpose of the social security program, which is to provide a measure of economic security for the beneficiaries of the program, together with


(i) The extent and type of services the representative performed;


(ii) The complexity of the case;


(iii) The level of skill and competence required of the representative in giving the services;


(iv) The amount of time the representative spent on the case;


(v) The results the representative achieved;


(vi) The level of review to which the claim was taken and the level of the review at which the representative became your representative; and


(vii) The amount of fee the representative requests for his or her services, including any amount authorized or requested before, but not including the amount of any expenses he or she incurred.


(2) Although we consider the amount of benefits, if any, that are payable, we do not base the amount of fee we authorize on the amount of the benefit alone, but on a consideration of all the factors listed in this section.  The benefits payable in any claim are determined by specific provisions of law and are unrelated to the efforts of the representative.  We may authorize a fee even if no benefits are payable.

				Beginning with the text, §406(b)s words, a reasonable fee … not in excess of 25 percent of … the past-due benefits, read in isolation, could be construed to allow either the Ninth Circuits lodestar approach or petitioners position that the attorney-client fee agreement ordinarily should control, if not in excess of 25 percent.  The provision instructs a reasonable fee, which could be measured by a lodestar calculation.  But §406(b)s language does not exclude contingent-fee contracts that produce fees no higher than the 25 percent ceiling.  Such contracts are the most common fee arrangement between attorneys and Social Security claimants.  See Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Office of Hearings and Appeals, Report to Congress: Attorney Fees Under Title II of the Social Security Act 15, 66, 70 (July 1988) (hereinafter SSA Report); Brief for National Organization of Social Security Claimants Representatives as

					Amicus Curiae
				</em>
				 12.   Looking outside the statutes inconclusive text, we next take into account, as interpretive guides, the origin and standard application of the proffered approaches.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The lodestar method has its roots in accounting practices adopted in the 1940s to allow attorneys and firms to determine whether fees charged were sufficient to cover overhead and generate suitable profits.  W. Ross, The Honest Hour: The Ethics of Time-Based Billing by Attorneys 16 (1996) (hereinafter Honest Hour).  An American Bar Association (ABA) report, published in 1958, observed that attorneys earnings had failed to keep pace with the rate of inflation; the report urged attorneys to record the hours spent on each case in order to ensure that fees ultimately charged afforded reasonable compensation for counsels efforts.  See Special Committee on Economics of Law Practice, The 1958 Lawyer and His 1938 Dollar 910 (reprint 1959).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Hourly records initially provided only an internal accounting check.  See Honest Hour 19.  The fees actually charged might be determined under any number of methods: the annual retainer; the fee-for-service method; the eyeball method, under which the attorney estimated an annual fee for regular clients; or the contingent-fee method, recognized by this Court in 
				<em>
					Stanton

					Embrey,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">556</a> (1877)
, and formally approved by the ABA in 1908.  See Honest Hour 1319.  As it became standard accounting practice to record hours spent on a clients matter, attorneys increasingly realized that billing by hours devoted to a case was administratively convenient; moreover, as an objective measure of a lawyers labor, hourly billing was readily impartable to the client.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 18.  By the early 1970s, the practice of hourly billing had become widespread.  See 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 19, 21.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The federal courts did not swiftly settle on hourly rates as the overriding criterion for attorneys fee awards.  In 1974, for example, the Fifth Circuit issued an influential opinion holding that, in setting fees under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/2000e-5.html#k" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §2000e5(k)</a> (1970 ed.), courts should consider not only the number of hours devoted to a case but also 11 other factors.

				Before 1965, the Social Security Act imposed no limits on contingent-fee agreements drawn by counsel and signed by benefits claimants.  In formulating the 1965 Social Security Act amendments that included §406(b), Congress recognized that attorneys have upon occasion charged … inordinately large fees for representing claimants [in court].  S. Rep. No. 404, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 1, p. 122 (1965).  Arrangements yielding exorbitant fees, the Senate Report observed, reserved for the lawyer one-third to one-half of the accrued benefits.

				</em>
				  Congress was mindful, too, that the longer the litigation persisted, the greater the build-up of past-due benefits and, correspondingly, of legal fees awardable from those benefits if the claimant prevailed.

				Attending to these realities, Congress provided for a reasonable fee, not in excess of 25 percent of accrued benefits as part of the courts judgment, and further specified that no other fee would be payable.  
				<em>

				  Violation of the reasonable fee or 25 percent of accrued benefits limitation was made subject to the same penalties as those applicable for charging a fee larger than the amount approved by the Commissioner for services at the administrative levela fine of up to $500, one years imprisonment, or both.

				Congress thus sought to protect claimants against inordinately large fees and also to ensure that attorneys representing successful claimants would not risk nonpayment of [appropriate] fees.  SSA Report 66 (internal quotation marks omitted).  But nothing in the text or history of §406(b) reveals a desig[n] to prohibit or discourage attorneys and claimants from entering into contingent fee agreements.

				.  Given the prevalence of contingent-fee agreements between attorneys and Social Security claimants, it is unlikely that Congress, simply by prescribing reasonable fees, meant to outlaw, rather than to contain, such agreements.

				This conclusion is bolstered by Congress 1990 authorization of contingent-fee agreements under §406(a), the provision governing fees for agency-level representation.  Before enacting this express authorization, Congress instructed the Social Security Administration to prepare a report on attorneys fees under Title II of the Social Security Act.  Pub. L. 100203, §9021(b), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">101</a>Stat.
1330295.  The report, presented to Congress in 1988, reviewed several methods of determining attorneys fees, including the lodestar method.  See SSA Report 1011.  This review led the agency to inform Congress that, although the contingency method was hardly flawless, the agency could identify no more effective means of ensuring claimant access to attorney representation.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Congress subsequently altered §406(a) to validate contingent-fee agreements filed with the agency prior to disposition of the claim for benefits.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/406.html#a_2" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §406(a)(2)</a> (1994 ed.); 
				<em>
					supra,

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It is also unlikely that Congress, legislating in 1965, and providing for a contingent fee tied to a 25 percent of past-due benefits boundary, intended to install a lodestar method courts did not develop until some years later.  See 
				<em>
					supra,
				</em>
				 at 1011.  Furthermore, we again emphasize, the lodestar method was designed to govern imposition of fees on the losing party.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Dague,
				</em>
				 505 U. S., at 562.  In such cases, nothing prevents the attorney for the prevailing party from gaining additional fees, pursuant to contract, from his own client.  See 
				<em>
					Venegas
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Mitchell,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/495/82" class="subref" title="subref">495 U. S. 82</a>, 8990 (1990) ([None] of our cases has indicated that [42 U. S.

Indeed, depriving plaintiffs of the option of promising to pay more than the statutory fee if that is necessary to secure counsel of their choice would not further §1988s general purpose of enabling such plaintiffs … to secure competent counsel.).  By contrast, §406(b) governs the total fee a claimants attorney may receive for court representation; any endeavor by the claimants attorney to gain more than that fee, or to charge the claimant a noncontingent fee, is a criminal offense.

				Most plausibly read, we conclude, §406(b) does not displace contingent-fee agreements as the primary means by which fees are set for successfully representing Social Security benefits claimants in court.  Rather, §406(b) calls for court review of such arrangements as an independent check, to assure that they yield reasonable results in particular cases.

				Courts that approach fee determinations by looking first to the contingent-fee agreement, then testing it for reasonableness, have appropriately reduced the attorneys recovery based on the character of the representation and the results the representative achieved.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g., McGuire,
				</em>
				 873 F. 2d, at 983 (Although the contingency agreement should be given significant weight in fixing a fee, a district judge must independently assess the reasonableness of its terms.);

				<em>
					Secretary of Health and Human Servs.,
				</em>
				 707 F. 2d 246, 249250 (CA6 1983) (instructing reduced fee when representation is substandard).  If the attorney is responsible for delay, for example, a reduction is in order so that the attorney will not profit from the accumulation of benefits during the pendency of the case in court.  See 
				<em>
					Rodriquez,
				</em>
				 865 F. 2d, at 746747.  If the benefits are large in comparison to the amount of time counsel spent on the case, a downward adjustment is similarly in order.  See 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 747 (reviewing court should disallow windfalls for lawyers); 
				<em>
					Wells,
				</em>
				 907 F. 2d, at 372 (same).  In this regard, the court may require the claimants attorney to submit, not as a basis for satellite litigation, but as an aid to the courts assessment of the reasonableness of the fee yielded by the fee agreement, a record of the hours spent representing the claimant and a statement of the lawyers normal hourly billing charge for noncontingent-fee cases.  See 
				<em>
					Rodriquez,
				</em>
				 865 F. 2d, at 741.  Judges of our district courts are accustomed to making reasonableness determinations in a wide variety of contexts, and their assessments in such matters, in the

				The courts below erroneously read §406(b) to override  customary attorney-client contingent-fee agreements.  We hold that §406(b) does not displace contingent-fee agreements within the statutory ceiling; instead, §406(b) instructs courts to review for reasonableness fees yielded by those agreements.  Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

						 Before 1965, Congress did not explicitly authorize attorneys fees for in-court representation of Social Security benefits claimants.  At least two Courts of Appeals, however, concluded that 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/405.html#g" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §405(g)</a> implicitly authorized such fees.  See Bowen v. Galbreath,

						 Specifically, petitioners maintain that [a]lthough section 406(b) permits an attorney to base a fee application on a contingent fee agreement with the claimant, the statute does not create any presumption in favor of the agreed upon amount.  To the contrary, because section 406(b) requires an affirmative judicial finding that the fee allowed is reasonable, the attorney bears the burden of persuasion that the statutory requirement has been satisfied.  Brief for Petitioners 40.

				I do not know what the judges of our district courts and courts of appeals are to make of todays opinion.  I have no idea what the trial judge is to do if he finds the fee produced by the (presumptively reasonable, 
				<em>

Or what the appellate court is to do in an appeal from a district judges reduction of the contingent fee to 300% of the lodestar amount; or 200%; or to the lodestar amount itself.  While todays opinion gets this case out of our in box, it does nothing whatever to subject these fees to anything approximating a uniform rule of law.  That is, I think, the inevitable consequence of trying to combine the incompatible.  The Court tells the judge to commence his analysis with the contingent-fee agreement, but then to adjust the figure that agreement produces on the basis of factors (most notably, the actual time spent multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate, 
				<em>
					ante, 
				</em>
				at 18) that are, in a sense, the precise antithesis of the contingent-fee agreement, since it was the very 
				<em>
					purpose

				 of that agreement to eliminate them from the fee calculation.  In my view, the only possible way to give uniform meaning to the statutes reasonable fee provision is to understand it as referring to the fair value of the work actually performed, which we have held is best reflected by the lodestar.

				This is less of a departure than the Court suggests from the normal practice of enforcing privately negotiated fee agreements.  The fee agreements in these Social-Security cases are hardly negotiated; they are akin to adherence contracts.  It is uncontested that the specialized Social-Security bar charges uniform contingent fees (the statutory maximum of 25%), which are presumably presented to the typically unsophisticated client on a take-it-or-leave-it basis.  Nor does the statutes explicit approval of contingency-fee agreements at the agency stage, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/406.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S.

The agreements approved at the agency stage are limited not merely by a 25% maximum percentage of recovery, but also by a firm $5,300 maximum.  With the latter limitation, there is no need to impose a reasonableness requirement.  Once
				<span class="softbreak"></span>

						 There is one ex post element prominent in Social-Security-benefit cases that assuredly should reduce the amount of an otherwise reasonable (that is to say, an ex ante reasonable) contingent-fee award: Since the award is based upon past-due benefits, and since the amount of those benefits increases with the duration of the litigation, a lawyer can increase his contingent-fee award by dragging his feet.  It is unreasonable to be rewarded for dilatoriness.  But that element need not be made part of an overall ex post reasonableness assessment, as the Court would do, see ante, at 18.  For it is not only unreasonable; it is a breach of contract.  Surely the representation agreement contains as an implicit term that the lawyer will bring the matter to a conclusion as quickly as practicableor at least will not intentionally delay its conclusion.  Any breach of that condition justifies a reduction of the contracted contingent-fee award.

				This is less of a departure than the Court suggests from the normal practice of enforcing privately negotiated fee agreements.  The fee agreements in these Social-Security cases are hardly negotiated; they are akin to adherence contracts.  It is uncontested that the specialized Social-Security bar charges uniform contingent fees (the statutory maximum of 25%), which are presumably presented to the typically unsophisticated client on a take-it-or-leave-it basis.  Nor does the statutes explicit approval of contingency-fee agreements at the agency stage, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/406.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S.

The agreements approved at the agency stage are limited not merely by a 25% maximum percentage of recovery, but also by a firm $5,300 maximum.  With the latter limitation, there is no need to impose a reasonableness requirement.  Once
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				a reasonableness requirement is imposed, however, I think it can only refer to the reasonableness of the actual compensation.

						 There is one ex post element prominent in Social-Security-benefit cases that assuredly should reduce the amount of an otherwise reasonable (that is to say, an ex ante reasonable) contingent-fee award: Since the award is based upon past-due benefits, and since the amount of those benefits increases with the duration of the litigation, a lawyer can increase his contingent-fee award by dragging his feet.  It is unreasonable to be rewarded for dilatoriness.  But that element need not be made part of an overall ex post reasonableness assessment, as the Court would do, see ante, at 18.  For it is not only unreasonable; it is a breach of contract.  Surely the representation agreement contains as an implicit term that the lawyer will bring the matter to a conclusion as quickly as practicableor at least will not intentionally delay its conclusion.  Any breach of that condition justifies a reduction of the contracted contingent-fee award.

				I do not know what the judges of our district courts and courts of appeals are to make of todays opinion.  I have no idea what the trial judge is to do if he finds the fee produced by the (presumptively reasonable,

Or what the appellate court is to do in an appeal from a district judges reduction of the contingent fee to 300% of the lodestar amount; or 200%; or to the lodestar amount itself.  While todays opinion gets this case out of our in box, it does nothing whatever to subject these fees to anything approximating a uniform rule of law.  That is, I think, the inevitable consequence of trying to combine the incompatible.  The Court tells the judge to commence his analysis with the contingent-fee agreement, but then to adjust the figure that agreement produces on the basis of factors (most notably, the actual time spent multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate,

						 There is one ex post element prominent in Social-Security-benefit cases that assuredly should reduce the amount of an otherwise reasonable (that is to say, an ex ante reasonable) contingent-fee award: Since the award is based upon past-due benefits, and since the amount of those benefits increases with the duration of the litigation, a lawyer can increase his contingent-fee award by dragging his feet.  It is unreasonable to be rewarded for dilatoriness.  But that element need not be made part of an overall ex post reasonableness assessment, as the Court would do, see ante, at 18.  For it is not only unreasonable; it is a breach of contract.  Surely the representation agreement contains as an implicit term that the lawyer will bring the matter to a conclusion as quickly as practicableor at least will not intentionally delay its conclusion.  Any breach of that condition justifies a reduction of the contracted contingent-fee award.

				I do not know what the judges of our district courts and courts of appeals are to make of todays opinion.  I have no idea what the trial judge is to do if he finds the fee produced by the (presumptively reasonable, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1) contingent-fee agreement to be 25% above the lodestar amount; or 40%; or 65%.  Or what the appellate court is to do in an appeal from a district judges reduction of the contingent fee to 300% of the lodestar amount; or 200%; or to the lodestar amount itself.  While todays opinion gets this case out of our in box, it does nothing whatever to subject these fees to anything approximating a uniform rule of law.  That is, I think, the inevitable consequence of trying to combine the incompatible.  The Court tells the judge to commence his analysis with the contingent-fee agreement, but then to adjust the figure that agreement produces on the basis of factors (most notably, the actual time spent multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate, 
				<em>
					ante, 
				</em>
				at 18) that are, in a sense, the precise antithesis of the contingent-fee agreement, since it was the very 
				<em>
					purpose
				</em>
				 of that agreement to eliminate them from the fee calculation.  In my view, the only possible way to give uniform meaning to the statutes reasonable fee provision is to understand it as referring to the fair value of the work actually performed, which we have held is best reflected by the lodestar.

						 There is one ex post element prominent in Social-Security-benefit cases that assuredly should reduce the amount of an otherwise reasonable (that is to say, an ex ante reasonable) contingent-fee award: Since the award is based upon past-due benefits, and since the amount of those benefits increases with the duration of the litigation, a lawyer can increase his contingent-fee award by dragging his feet.  It is unreasonable to be rewarded for dilatoriness.  But that element need not be made part of an overall ex post reasonableness assessment, as the Court would do, see ante, at 18.  For it is not only unreasonable; it is a breach of contract.  Surely the representation agreement contains as an implicit term that the lawyer will bring the matter to a conclusion as quickly as practicableor at least will not intentionally delay its conclusion.  Any breach of that condition justifies a reduction of the contracted contingent-fee award.

				I do not know what the judges of our district courts and courts of appeals are to make of todays opinion.  I have no idea what the trial judge is to do if he finds the fee produced by the (presumptively reasonable, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1) contingent-fee agreement to be 25% above the lodestar amount; or 40%; or 65%.  Or what the appellate court is to do in an appeal from a district judges reduction of the contingent fee to 300% of the lodestar amount; or 200%; or to the lodestar amount itself.  While todays opinion gets this case out of our in box, it does nothing whatever to subject these fees to anything approximating a uniform rule of law.  That is, I think, the inevitable consequence of trying to combine the incompatible.  The Court tells the judge to commence his analysis with the contingent-fee agreement, but then to adjust the figure that agreement produces on the basis of factors (most notably, the actual time spent multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate, 
				<em>
					ante, 
				</em>
				at 18) that are, in a sense, the precise antithesis of the contingent-fee agreement, since it was the very 
				<em>
					purpose
				</em>
				 of that agreement to eliminate them from the fee calculation.  In my view, the only possible way to give uniform meaning to the statutes reasonable fee provision is to understand it as referring to the fair value of the work actually performed, which we have held is best reflected by the lodestar.

				This is less of a departure than the Court suggests from the normal practice of enforcing privately negotiated fee agreements.  The fee agreements in these Social-Security cases are hardly negotiated; they are akin to adherence contracts.  It is uncontested that the specialized Social-Security bar charges uniform contingent fees (the statutory maximum of 25%), which are presumably presented to the typically unsophisticated client on a take-it-or-leave-it basis.  Nor does the statutes explicit approval of contingency-fee agreements at the agency stage, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/406.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S.

The agreements approved at the agency stage are limited not merely by a 25% maximum percentage of recovery, but also by a firm $5,300 maximum.  With the latter limitation, there is no need to impose a reasonableness requirement.  Once

				I do not know what the judges of our district courts and courts of appeals are to make of todays opinion.  I have no idea what the trial judge is to do if he finds the fee produced by the (presumptively reasonable, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1) contingent-fee agreement to be 25% above the lodestar amount; or 40%; or 65%.  Or what the appellate court is to do in an appeal from a district judges reduction of the contingent fee to 300% of the lodestar amount; or 200%; or to the lodestar amount itself.  While todays opinion gets this case out of our in box, it does nothing whatever to subject these fees to anything approximating a uniform rule of law.  That is, I think, the inevitable consequence of trying to combine the incompatible.  The Court tells the judge to commence his analysis with the contingent-fee agreement, but then to adjust the figure that agreement produces on the basis of factors (most notably, the actual time spent multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate, 
				<em>
					ante, 
				</em>
				at 18) that are, in a sense, the precise antithesis of the contingent-fee agreement, since it was the very 
				<em>
					purpose
				</em>
				 of that agreement to eliminate them from the fee calculation.  In my view, the only possible way to give uniform meaning to the statutes reasonable fee provision is to understand it as referring to the fair value of the work actually performed, which we have held is best reflected by the lodestar.

				I think it obvious that the reasonableness of a contingent-fee arrangement 
				<em>
					has to be
				</em>
				 determined by viewing the matter 
				<em>
					ex ante
				</em>
				, before the outcome of the lawsuit and the hours of work expended on the outcome are definitively known.  For it is in the nature of a contingent-fee agreement to 
				<em>
					gamble 
				</em>
				on outcome and hours of workassigning the risk of an unsuccessful outcome to the attorney, in exchange for a percentage of the recovery from a successful outcome that will (because of the risk of loss the attorney has borne) be higher, and perhaps much higher, than what the attorney would receive in hourly billing for the same case.  That is why, in days when obtaining justice in the law courts was thought to be less of a sporting enterprise, contingent fees were unlawful.  See,

				It is one thing to say that a contingent-fee arrangement is, 
				<em>
					ex ante
				</em>
				, unreasonable because it gives the attorney a percentage of the recovery so high that no self-respecting legal system can tolerate it; the statute itself has made this determination for Social-Security-benefit cases, prescribing a maximum contingent fee of 25%.  And one can also say that a contingent-fee arrangement is, 
				<em>
					ex ante
				</em>
				, unreasonable because the chances of success in the particular case are so high, and the anticipated legal work so negligible, that the percentage of the recovery assured to the lawyer is exorbitant; but neither I nor the Court thinks that the reasonable fee provision of the statute anticipates such a case-by-case 
				<em>
					ex post
				</em>
				 assessment of 
				<em>
					ex ante
				</em>
				 predictions in the thousands of (mostly small recovery) Social-Security-benefit cases.  It is something quite different, howeverand something quite irrationalto look at the 
				<em>
					consequences 
				</em>
				of a contingent-fee agreement 
				<em>
					after the contingencies have been resolved
				</em>
				, and proclaim those consequences unreasonable because the attorney has received too much money for too little work.  That is rather like declaring the purchase of the winning lottery ticket void because of the gross disparity between the $2 ticket price and the million-dollar payout.

				 an assessment of the reasonableness of the fee charged after the outcome and work committed to it are known; it cannot combine the two.  And since an

				 assessment of the

				</em>
				reasonableness of the contingent-fee agreement (already limited by statute to a maximum 25% of the recovery) is not what the statute could conceivably have contemplated, I conclude that a reasonable fee means not the reasonableness of the agreed-upon contingent fee, but a reasonable recompense for the work actually done.  We have held that this is best calculated by applying the lodestar, which focuses on the quality and amount of the legal work performed, and provides an objective basis on which to … estimate … the value of a lawyers services.

				This is less of a departure than the Court suggests from the normal practice of enforcing privately negotiated fee agreements.  The fee agreements in these Social-Security cases are hardly negotiated; they are akin to adherence contracts.  It is uncontested that the specialized Social-Security bar charges uniform contingent fees (the statutory maximum of 25%), which are presumably presented to the typically unsophisticated client on a take-it-or-leave-it basis.  Nor does the statutes explicit approval of contingency-fee agreements at the agency stage, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/406.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §406(a)</a> (1994 ed. and Supp. V), imply that contingency-fee agreements at the judicial-review stage should be regarded as presumptively reasonable.  The agreements approved at the agency stage are limited not merely by a 25% maximum percentage of recovery, but also by a firm $5,300 maximum.  With the latter limitation, there is no need to impose a reasonableness requirement.  Once
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				a reasonableness requirement is imposed, however, I think it can only refer to the reasonableness of the actual compensation.

				Because I think there is no middle course between, on the one hand, determining the reasonableness of a contingent-fee agreement and, on the other hand, determining the reasonableness of the actual fee; because I think the statutes reference to a reasonable fee must connote the latter; and because I think the Courts hybrid approach establishes no clear criteria and hence will generate needless satellite litigation; I respectfully dissent.

We have not hesitated to apply the lodestar method to other fee statutes enacted before the method was developed.  See, e.g., Burlington v. Dague,

						 There is one ex post element prominent in Social-Security-benefit cases that assuredly should reduce the amount of an otherwise reasonable (that is to say, an ex ante reasonable) contingent-fee award: Since the award is based upon past-due benefits, and since the amount of those benefits increases with the duration of the litigation, a lawyer can increase his contingent-fee award by dragging his feet.  It is unreasonable to be rewarded for dilatoriness.  But that element need not be made part of an overall ex post reasonableness assessment, as the Court would do, see ante, at 18.  For it is not only unreasonable; it is a breach of contract.  Surely the representation agreement contains as an implicit term that the lawyer will bring the matter to a conclusion as quickly as practicableor at least will not intentionally delay its conclusion.  Any breach of that condition justifies a reduction of the contracted contingent-fee award.

				It is one thing to say that a contingent-fee arrangement is, 
				<em>
					ex ante
				</em>
				, unreasonable because it gives the attorney a percentage of the recovery so high that no self-respecting legal system can tolerate it; the statute itself has made this determination for Social-Security-benefit cases, prescribing a maximum contingent fee of 25%.  And one can also say that a contingent-fee arrangement is, 
				<em>
					ex ante
				</em>
				, unreasonable because the chances of success in the particular case are so high, and the anticipated legal work so negligible, that the percentage of the recovery assured to the lawyer is exorbitant; but neither I nor the Court thinks that the reasonable fee provision of the statute anticipates such a case-by-case 
				<em>
					ex post
				</em>
				 assessment of 
				<em>
					ex ante
				</em>
				 predictions in the thousands of (mostly small recovery) Social-Security-benefit cases.  It is something quite different, howeverand something quite irrationalto look at the 
				<em>
					consequences 
				</em>
				of a contingent-fee agreement 
				<em>
					after the contingencies have been resolved
				</em>
				, and proclaim those consequences unreasonable because the attorney has received too much money for too little work.  That is rather like declaring the purchase of the winning lottery ticket void because of the gross disparity between the $2 ticket price and the million-dollar payout.

				I think, in other words, that the reasonable fee provision must require 
				<em>
					either
				</em>
				 an assessment of the reasonableness of the contingent-fee agreement when it was concluded, 
				<em>
					or
				</em>
				 an assessment of the reasonableness of the fee charged after the outcome and work committed to it are known; it cannot combine the two.  And since an 
				<em>
					ex post
				</em>
				 assessment of the 
				<em>
					ex ante 
				</em>
				reasonableness of the contingent-fee agreement (already limited by statute to a maximum 25% of the recovery) is not what the statute could conceivably have contemplated, I conclude that a reasonable fee means not the reasonableness of the agreed-upon contingent fee, but a reasonable recompense for the work actually done.  We have held that this is best calculated by applying the lodestar, which focuses on the quality and amount of the legal work performed, and provides an objective basis on which to … estimate … the value of a lawyers services.

				This is less of a departure than the Court suggests from the normal practice of enforcing privately negotiated fee agreements.  The fee agreements in these Social-Security cases are hardly negotiated; they are akin to adherence contracts.  It is uncontested that the specialized Social-Security bar charges uniform contingent fees (the statutory maximum of 25%), which are presumably presented to the typically unsophisticated client on a take-it-or-leave-it basis.  Nor does the statutes explicit approval of contingency-fee agreements at the agency stage, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/406.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §406(a)</a> (1994 ed. and Supp. V), imply that contingency-fee agreements at the judicial-review stage should be regarded as presumptively reasonable.  The agreements approved at the agency stage are limited not merely by a 25% maximum percentage of recovery, but also by a firm $5,300 maximum.  With the latter limitation, there is no need to impose a reasonableness requirement.  Once
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				a reasonableness requirement is imposed, however, I think it can only refer to the reasonableness of the actual compensation.

				Because I think there is no middle course between, on the one hand, determining the reasonableness of a contingent-fee agreement and, on the other hand, determining the reasonableness of the actual fee; because I think the statutes reference to a reasonable fee must connote the latter; and because I think the Courts hybrid approach establishes no clear criteria and hence will generate needless satellite litigation; I respectfully dissent.

						 The Court finds it unlikely, ante, at 16, that 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/406.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §406(b)</a> (1994 ed. and Supp. V), enacted in 1965, contemplated application of the lodestar method that the courts had not yet even developed.  Of course it did not.  But it did contemplate an ex post determination of a reasonable fee for an attorneys workwhich our post-1965 cases have held is best achieved by using the lodestar.  We have not hesitated to apply the lodestar method to other fee statutes enacted before the method was developed.  See, e.g., Burlington v. Dague, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/505/557" class="subref" title="subref">505 U. S. 557</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">561</a>562 (1992)
 (explaining that our case law construing what is a reasonable fee applies uniformly to fee-shifting statutes that use similar language, including, inter alia, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/1988.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §1988</a> and

						 There is one ex post element prominent in Social-Security-benefit cases that assuredly should reduce the amount of an otherwise reasonable (that is to say, an ex ante reasonable) contingent-fee award: Since the award is based upon past-due benefits, and since the amount of those benefits increases with the duration of the litigation, a lawyer can increase his contingent-fee award by dragging his feet.  It is unreasonable to be rewarded for dilatoriness.  But that element need not be made part of an overall ex post reasonableness assessment, as the Court would do, see ante, at 18.  For it is not only unreasonable; it is a breach of contract.  Surely the representation agreement contains as an implicit term that the lawyer will bring the matter to a conclusion as quickly as practicableor at least will not intentionally delay its conclusion.  Any breach of that condition justifies a reduction of the contracted contingent-fee award.

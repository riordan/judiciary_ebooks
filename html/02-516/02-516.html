				No. 02516. Argued April 1, 2003Decided June 23, 2003

        <hr>
        <p class="bodytext">
				Petitioners Gratz and Hamacher, both of whom are Michigan residents and Caucasian, applied for admission to the University of Michigans (University) College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (LSA) in 1995 and 1997, respectively.  Although the LSA considered Gratz to be well qualified and Hamacher to be within the qualified range, both were denied early admission and were ultimately denied admission.  In order to promote consistency in the review of the many applications received, the Universitys Office of Undergraduate Admissions (OUA) uses written guidelines for each academic year.  The guidelines have changed a number of times during the period relevant to this litigation.  The OUA considers a number of factors in making admissions decisions, including high school grades, standardized test scores, high school quality, curriculum strength, geography, alumni relationships, leadership, and race.  During all relevant periods, the University has considered African-Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans to be underrepresented minorities, and it is undisputed that the University admits virtually every qualified applicant from these groups.  The current guidelines use a selection method under which every applicant from an underrepresented racial or ethnic minority group is automatically awarded 20 points of the 100 needed to guarantee admission.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				
				    
				Petitioners filed this class action alleging that the Universitys use of racial preferences in undergraduate admissions violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/1981.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §1981</a>.  They sought compensatory and punitive damages for past violations, declaratory relief finding that respondents violated their rights to nondiscriminatory treatment, an injunction prohibiting respondents from continuing to discriminate on the basis of race, and an order requiring the LSA to offer Hamacher admission as a transfer student.  The District Court granted petitioners motion to certify a class consisting of individuals who applied for and were denied admission to the LSA for academic year 1995 and forward and who are members of racial or ethnic groups that respondents treated less favorably on the basis of race.  Hamacher, whose claim was found to challenge racial discrimination on a classwide basis, was designated as the class representative.  On cross-motions for summary judgment, respondents relied on Justice Powells principal opinion in 
				<em>
					Regents of Univ. of Cal. 
				</em>
				v.
				<em>
					 Bakke
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/438/265" class="subref" title="subref">438 U. S. 265</a>, which expressed the view that the consideration of race as a factor in admissions might in some cases serve a compelling government interest.  Respondents contended that the LSA has just such an interest in the educational benefits that result from having a racially and ethnically diverse student body and that its program is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.  The court agreed with respondents as to the LSAs current admissions guidelines and granted them summary judgment in that respect.  However, the court also found that the LSAs admissions guidelines for 1995 through 1998 operated as the functional equivalent of a quota running afoul of Justice Powells 
				<em>
					Bakke
				</em>
				 opinion, and thus granted petitioners summary judgment with respect to respondents admissions programs for those years.  While interlocutory appeals were pending in the Sixth Circuit, that court issued an opinion in 
				<em>
					Grutter 
				</em>
				v
				<em>
					. Bollinger, post, 
				</em>
				p. ___, upholding the admissions program used by the Universitys Law School.  This Court granted certiorari in both cases, even though the Sixth Circuit had not yet rendered judgment in this one.

				1. Petitioners have standing to seek declaratory and injunctive relief.  The Court rejects 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Stevens
				</span>
				 contention that, because Hamacher did not actually apply for admission as a transfer student, his future injury claim is at best conjectural or hypothetical rather than real and immediate.  The injury in fact necessary to establish standing in this type of case is the denial of equal treatment resulting from the imposition of the barrier, not the ultimate inability to obtain the benefit.  
				<em>
					Northeastern Fla. Chapter, Associated Gen. Contractors of America 
				</em>
				v.
				<em>
					 Jacksonville
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/508/656" class="subref" title="subref">508 U. S. 656</a>.  In the face of such a barrier, to establish standing, a party need only demonstrate that it is able and ready to perform and that a discriminatory policy prevents it from doing so on an equal basis.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  In bringing his equal protection challenge against the Universitys use of race in undergraduate admissions, Hamacher alleged that the University had denied him the opportunity to compete for admission on an equal basis.  Hamacher was denied admission to the University as a freshman applicant even though an underrepresented minority applicant with his qualifications would have been admitted.  After being denied admission, Hamacher demonstrated that he was able and ready to apply as a transfer student should the University cease to use race in undergraduate admissions.  He therefore has standing to seek prospective relief with respect to the Universitys continued use of race.  Also rejected is 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Stevens
				</span>
				 contention that such use in undergraduate transfer admissions differs from the Universitys use of race in undergraduate freshman admissions, so that Hamacher lacks standing to represent absent class members challenging the latter.  Each year the OUA produces a document setting forth guidelines for those seeking admission to the LSA, including freshman and transfer applicants.  The transfer applicant guidelines specifically cross-reference factors and qualifications considered in assessing freshman applicants.  In fact, the criteria used to determine whether a transfer applicant will contribute to diversity are 
				<em>
					identical
				</em>
				 to those used to evaluate freshman applicants.  The 
				<em>
					only 
				</em>
				difference is that all underrepresented minority freshman applicants receive 20 points and virtually all who are minimally qualified are admitted, while generally all minimally qualified minority transfer applicants are admitted outright.  While this difference might be relevant to a narrow tailoring analysis, it clearly has no effect on petitioners standing to challenge the Universitys use of race in undergraduate admissions and its assertion that diversity is a compelling state interest justifying its consideration of the race of its undergraduate applicants.

				<em>
					General Telephone Co. of Southwest 
				</em>

Hamachers personal stake, in view of both his past injury and the potential injury he faced at the time of certification, demonstrates that he may maintain the action.  Pp. 1120.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				2. Because the Universitys use of race in its current freshman admissions policy is not narrowly tailored to achieve respondents asserted interest in diversity, the policy violates the Equal Protection Clause.  For the reasons set forth in 
				<em>
					Grutter 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					Bollinger
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, at 1521, the Court has today rejected petitioners argument that diversity cannot constitute a compelling state interest.  However, the Court finds that the Universitys current policy, which automatically distributes 20 points, or one-fifth of the points needed to guarantee admission, to every single underrepresented minority applicant solely because of race, is not narrowly tailored to achieve educational diversity.  In 
				<em>
					Bakke
				</em>
				, Justice
				 
				Powell explained his view that it would be permissible for a university to employ an admissions program in which race or ethnic background may be deemed a plus in a particular applicants file. 438 U. S., at 317.  He emphasized, however, the importance of considering each particular applicant as an individual, assessing all of the qualities that individual possesses, and in turn, evaluating that individuals ability to contribute to the unique setting of higher education.  The admissions program Justice Powell described did not contemplate that any single characteristic automatically ensured a specific and identifiable contribution to a universitys diversity.  See 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 315.  The current LSA policy does not provide the individualized consideration Justice Powell contemplated.  The only consideration that accompanies the 20-point automatic distribution to all applicants from underrepresented minorities is a factual review to determine whether an individual is a member of one of these minority groups.  Moreover, unlike Justice Powells example, where the race of a particular black applicant could be considered without being decisive, see 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 317, the LSAs 20-point distribution has the effect of making the factor of race … decisive for virtually every minimally qualified underrepresented minority applicant, 
				<em>
					ibid
				</em>
				.  The fact that the LSA has created the possibility of an applicants file being flagged for individualized consideration only emphasizes the flaws of the Universitys system as a whole when compared to that described by Justice Powell. The record does not reveal precisely how many applications are flagged, but it is undisputed that such consideration is the exception and not the rule in the LSAs program.  Also, this individualized review is only provided 
				<em>
					after
				</em>
				 admissions counselors automatically distribute the Universitys version of a plus that makes race a decisive factor for virtually every minimally qualified underrepresented minority applicant.  The Court rejects respondents contention that the volume of applications and the presentation of applicant information make it impractical for the LSA to use the admissions system upheld today in 
				<em>
					Grutter
				</em>
				.  The fact that the implementation of a program capable of providing individualized consideration might present administrative challenges does not render constitutional an otherwise problematic system.  See,
				<em>
					 e.g., Richmond
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					J. A. Croson Co.,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/488/469" class="subref" title="subref">488 U. S. 469</a>.  Nothing in Justice Powells 
				<em>
					Bakke
				</em>
				 opinion signaled that a university may employ whatever means it desires to achieve diversity without regard to the limits imposed by strict scrutiny.  Pp. 2027.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				3. Because the Universitys use of race in its current freshman admissions policy violates the Equal Protection Clause, it also violates Title VI and §1981.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Alexander 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					Sandoval

				Petitioners Jennifer Gratz and Patrick Hamacher both applied for admission to the University of Michigans (University) College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (LSA) as residents of the State of Michigan.  Both petitioners are Caucasian.  Gratz, who applied for admission for the fall of 1995, was notified in January of that year that a final decision regarding her admission had been delayed until April.  This delay was based upon the Universitys determination that, although Gratz was  well qualified,  she was  less competitive than the students who ha[d] been admitted on first review.   App. to Pet. for Cert. 109a.  Gratz was notified in April that the LSA was unable to offer her admission.  She enrolled in the University of Michigan at Dearborn, from which she graduated in the spring of 1999.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Hamacher applied for admission to the LSA for the fall of 1997.  A final decision as to his application was also postponed because, though his  academic credentials [were] in the qualified range, they [were] not at the level needed for first review admission. 

				The University has changed its admissions guidelines a number of times during the period relevant to this litigation, and we summarize the most significant of these changes briefly.  The Universitys Office of Undergraduate Admissions (OUA) oversees the LSA admissions process.
				<a name="ZO-6ref" href="#ZO-6" class="">

                </sup>
            </a>
				  In order to promote consistency in the review of the large number of applications received, the OUA uses written guidelines for each academic year.  Admissions counselors make admissions decisions in accordance with these guidelines.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				OUA considers a number of factors in making admissions decisions, including high school grades, standardized test scores, high school quality, curriculum strength, geography, alumni relationships, and leadership.  OUA also considers race.  During all periods relevant to this litigation, the University has considered African-Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans to be underrepresented minorities, and it is undisputed that the University admits virtually every qualified … applicant from these groups.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 111a.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				During 1995 and 1996, OUA counselors evaluated applications according to grade point average combined with what were referred to as the SCUGA factors.  These factors included the quality of an applicants high school (S), the strength of an applicants high school curriculum (C), an applicants unusual circumstances (U), an applicants geographical residence (G), and an applicants alumni relationships (A).  After these scores were combined to produce an applicants GPA 2 score, the reviewing admissions counselors referenced a set of Guidelines tables, which listed GPA 2 ranges on the vertical axis, and American College Test/Scholastic Aptitude Test (ACT/SAT) scores on the horizontal axis.  Each table was divided into cells that included one or more courses of action to be taken, including admit, reject, delay for additional information, or postpone for reconsideration.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In both years, applicants with the same GPA 2 score and ACT/SAT score were subject to different admissions outcomes based upon their racial or ethnic status.
				<a name="ZO-7ref" href="#ZO-7" class="">

                </sup>
            </a>
				  For example, as a Caucasian in-state applicant, Gratzs GPA 2 score and ACT score placed her within a cell calling for a postponed decision on her application.  An in-state or out-of-state minority applicant with Gratzs scores would have fallen within a cell calling for admission.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In 1997, the University modified its admissions procedure.  Specifically, the formula for calculating an applicants GPA 2 score was restructured to include additional point values under the U category in the SCUGA factors.  Under this new system, applicants could receive points for underrepresented minority status, socioeconomic disadvantage, or attendance at a high school with a predominantly underrepresented minority population, or underrepresentation in the unit to which the student was applying (for example, men who sought to pursue a career in nursing).  Under the 1997 procedures, Hamachers
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				GPA 2 score and ACT score placed him in a cell on the in-state applicant table calling for postponement of a final admissions decision.  An underrepresented minority applicant placed in the same cell would generally have been admitted.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Beginning with the 1998 academic year, the OUA dispensed with the Guidelines tables and the SCUGA point system in favor of a selection index, on which an applicant could score a maximum of 150 points.  This index was divided linearly into ranges generally calling for admissions dispositions as follows: 100150 (admit); 9599 (admit or postpone); 9094 (postpone or admit); 7589 (delay or postpone); 74 and below (delay or reject).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Each application received points based on high school grade point average, standardized test scores, academic quality of an applicants high school, strength or weakness of high school curriculum, in-state residency, alumni relationship, personal essay, and personal achievement or leadership.  Of particular significance here, under a miscellaneous category, an applicant was entitled to 20 points based upon his or her membership in an underrepresented racial or ethnic minority group.  The University explained that the  development of the selection index for admissions in 1998 changed only the mechanics, not the substance of how race and ethnicity were considered in admissions.   App. to Pet. for Cert. 116a.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In all application years from 1995 to 1998, the guidelines provided that qualified applicants from underrepresented minority groups be admitted as soon as possible in light of the Universitys belief that such applicants were more likely to enroll if promptly notified of their admission.  Also from 1995 through 1998, the University carefully managed its rolling admissions system to permit consideration of certain applications submitted later in the academic year through the use of protected seats.  Specific groupsincluding athletes, foreign students, ROTC candidates, and underrepresented minoritieswere protected categories eligible for these seats.  A committee called the Enrollment Working Group (EWG) projected how many applicants from each of these protected categories the University was likely to receive after a given date and then paced admissions decisions to permit full consideration of expected applications from these groups.  If this space was not filled by qualified candidates from the designated groups toward the end of the admissions season, it was then used to admit qualified candidates remaining in the applicant pool, including those on the waiting list.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				During 1999 and 2000, the OUA used the selection index, under which every applicant from an underrepresented racial or ethnic minority group was awarded 20 points.  Starting in 1999, however, the University established an Admissions Review Committee (ARC), to provide an additional level of consideration for some applications.  Under the new system, counselors may, in their discretion, flag an application for the ARC to review after determining that the applicant (1) is academically prepared to succeed at the University,

				 (2) has achieved a minimum selection index score, and (3) possesses a quality or characteristic important to the Universitys composition of its freshman class, such as high class rank, unique life experiences, challenges, circumstances, interests or talents, socioeconomic disadvantage, and underrepresented race, ethnicity, or geography.  After reviewing flagged applications, the ARC determines whether to admit, defer, or deny each applicant.

Respondents contended that the LSA has just such an interest in the educational benefits that result from having a racially and ethnically diverse student body and that its program is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.  Respondent-intervenors asserted that the LSA had a compelling interest in remedying the Universitys past and current discrimination against minorities.

				The District Court began its analysis by reviewing this Courts decision in 
				<em>
					Bakke.  
				</em>
				See 122 F. Supp. 2d 811, 817 (ED Mich. 2001).  Although the court acknowledged that no decision from this Court since 
				<em>
					Bakke
				</em>
				 has explicitly accepted the diversity rationale discussed by Justice Powell, see 122 F. Supp. 2d, at 820821, it also concluded that this Court had not, in the years since 
				<em>
					Bakke
				</em>
				, ruled out such a justification for the use of race.  122 F. Supp. 2d, at 820821.  The District Court concluded that respondents and their 
				<em>
					amici curiae 
				</em>
				had presented solid evidence that a racially and ethnically diverse student body produces significant educational benefits such that achieving such a student body constitutes a compelling governmental interest.  See 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 822824.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The court next considered whether the LSAs admissions guidelines were narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.  See 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 824.  Again relying on Justice Powells opinion in 
				<em>
					Bakke
				</em>
				, the District Court determined that the admissions program the LSA began using in 1999 is a narrowly tailored means of achieving the Universitys interest in the educational benefits that flow from a racially and ethnically diverse student body.  See 122 F. Supp. 2d, at 827.  The court emphasized that the LSAs current program does not utilize rigid quotas or seek to admit a predetermined number of minority students.  See 
				<em>
					ibid
				</em>
				.  The award of 20 points for membership in an underrepresented minority group, in the District Courts view, was not the functional equivalent of a quota because minority candidates were not insulated from review by virtue of those points.  See 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 828.  Likewise, the court rejected the assertion that the LSAs program operates like the two-track system Justice Powell found objectionable in 
				<em>
					Bakke 
				</em>
				on the grounds that
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				LSA applicants are not competing for different groups of seats.  See 122 F. Supp. 2d, at 828829.  The court also dismissed petitioners assertion that the LSAs current system is nothing more than a means by which to achieve racial balancing.  See 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 831.  The court explained that the LSA does not seek to achieve a certain proportion of minority students, let alone a proportion that represents the community.  See 
				<em>
					ibid
				</em>
				.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The District Court found the admissions guidelines the LSA used from 1995 through 1998 to be more problematic.  In the courts view, the Universitys prior practice of protecting or reserving seats for underrepresented minority applicants effectively kept nonprotected applicants from competing for those slots.  See 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 832.  This system, the court concluded, operated as the functional equivalent of a quota and ran afoul of Justice Powells opinion in

				In the present case, the Universitys use of race in undergraduate transfer admissions does not implicate a significantly different set of concerns than does its use of race in undergraduate freshman admissions.  Respondents challenged Hamachers standing at the certification stage, but 
				<em>
					never
				</em>
				 did so on the grounds that the Universitys use of race in undergraduate transfer admissions involves a different set of concerns than does its use of race in freshman admissions.  Respondents failure to allege any such difference is simply consistent with the fact that no such difference exists.  Each year the OUA produces a document entitled COLLEGE OF LITERATURE SCIENCE AND THE ARTS GUIDELINES FOR ALL TERMS, which sets forth guidelines for all individuals seeking admission to the LSA, including freshman applicants, transfer applicants, international student applicants, and the like.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 2 App. in No. 011333 etc. (CA6), pp. 507542.  The guidelines used to evaluate transfer applicants specifically cross-reference factors and qualifications considered in assessing freshman applicants.  In fact, the criteria used to determine whether a transfer applicant will contribute to the Universitys stated goal of diversity are 
				<em>
					identical
				</em>
				 to that used to evaluate freshman applicants.  For example, in 1997, when the class was certified and the District Court found that Hamacher had standing to represent the class, the transfer guidelines contained a separate section entitled CONTRIBUTION TO A DIVERSE STUDENT BODY.  2 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 531.  This section explained that any transfer applicant who could 
				<em>
					contribut[e] to a diverse student body
				</em>
				 should generally be admitted even with substantially lower qualifications than those required of other transfer applicants.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				. (emphasis added).  To determine whether a transfer applicant was capable of contribut[ing] to a diverse student body, admissions counselors were instructed to determine whether that transfer applicant met the criteria as defined in Section IV of the U category of [the] SCUGA factors used to assess freshman applicants.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  Section IV of the U category, entitled Contribution to a Diverse Class, explained that [t]he University is committed to a rich educational experience for its students.  A diverse, as opposed to a homogenous, student population enhances the educational experience for all students.  To insure a diverse class, significant weight will be given in the admissions process to indicators of students contribution to a diverse class.  1 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 432.  These indicators, used in evaluating freshman and transfer applicants alike, list being a member of an underrepresented minority group as establishing an applicants contribution to diversity.  See 3 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 11331134, 11531154.  Indeed, the 
				<em>
					only 
				</em>
				difference between the Universitys use of race in considering freshman and transfer applicants is that all underrepresented minority freshman applicants receive 20 points and virtually all who are minimally qualified are admitted, while generally all minimally qualified minority transfer applicants are admitted outright.  While this difference might be relevant to a narrow tailoring analysis, it clearly has no effect on petitioners standing to challenge the Universitys use of race in undergraduate admissions and its assertion that diversity is a compelling state interest that justifies its consideration of the race of its undergraduate applicants.

				<em>

				 Thus, we think it clear that Hamachers personal stake, in view of both his past injury and the potential injury he faced at the time of certification, demonstrates that he may maintain this class-action challenge to the Universitys use of race in undergraduate

				The current LSA policy does not provide such individualized consideration.  The LSAs policy automatically distributes 20 points to every single applicant from an underrepresented minority group, as defined by the University.  The only consideration that accompanies this distribution of points is a factual review of an application to determine whether an individual is a member of one of these minority groups.  Moreover, unlike Justice Powells example, where the race of a particular black applicant could be considered without being decisive, see

				Also instructive in our consideration of the LSAs system is the example provided in the description of the Harvard College Admissions Program, which Justice Powell both discussed in, and attached to, his opinion in

        <p class="bodytext">
				The Admissions Committee, with only a few places left to fill, might find itself forced to choose between A, the child of a successful black physician in an academic community with promise of superior academic performance, and B, a black who grew up in an inner-city ghetto of semi-literate parents whose academic achievement was lower but who had demonstrated energy and leadership as well as an apparently abiding interest in black power.  If a good number of black students much like A but few like B had already been admitted, the Committee might prefer B; and vice versa.  If C, a white student with extraordinary artistic talent, were also seeking one of the remaining places, his unique quality might give him an edge over both A and B.  Thus, the critical criteria are often individual qualities or experience

        <p class="bodytext">
				
This example further demonstrates the problematic nature of the LSAs admissions system.  Even if student Cs extraordinary artistic talent rivaled that of Monet or Picasso, the applicant would receive, at most, five points under the LSAs system.  See App. 234235.  At the same time, every single underrepresented minority applicant, including students A and B, would automatically receive 20 points for submitting an application.  Clearly, the LSAs system does not offer applicants the individualized selection process described in Harvards example.  Instead of considering how the differing backgrounds, experiences, and characteristics of students A, B, and C might benefit the University, admissions counselors reviewing LSA applications would simply award both A and B 20 points because their applications indicate that they are African-American, and student C would receive up to 5 points for his extraordinary talent.

				Respondents emphasize the fact that the LSA has created the possibility of an applicants file being flagged for individualized consideration by the ARC.  We think that the flagging program only emphasizes the flaws of the Universitys system as a whole when compared to that described by Justice Powell.  Again, students A, B, and C illustrate the point.  First, student A would never be flagged.  This is because, as the University has conceded, the effect of automatically awarding 20 points is that virtually every qualified underrepresented minority applicant is admitted.  Student A, an applicant with promise of superior academic performance, would certainly fit this description.  Thus, the result of the automatic distribution of 20 points is that the University would never consider student As individual background, experiences, and characteristics to assess his individual potential contribution to diversity, 
				<em>
					Bakke, supra, 
				</em>
				at 317.  Instead, every applicant like student A would simply be admitted.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It is possible that students B and C would be flagged and considered as individuals.  This assumes that student B was not already admitted because of the automatic 20-point distribution, and that student C could muster at least 70 additional points.  But the fact that the review committee can look at the applications individually and ignore the points, once an application is flagged, Tr. of Oral Arg. 42, is of little comfort under our strict scrutiny analysis.  The record does not reveal precisely how many applications are flagged for this individualized consideration, but it is undisputed that such consideration is the exception and not the rule in the operation of the LSAs admissions program.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 117a (The ARC reviews only a portion of all of the applications.  The bulk of admissions decisions are executed based on selection index score parameters set by the EWG).

						 In 1995, counselors used four such tables for different groups of applicants: (1) in-state, nonminority applicants; (2) out-of-state, non-minority applicants; (3) in-state, minority applicants; and (4) out-of-state, minority applicants.  In 1996, only two tables were used, one for in-state applicants and one for out-of-state applicants.  But each cell on these two tables contained separate courses of action for minority applicants and nonminority applicants whose GPA 2 scores and ACT/SAT scores placed them in that cell.

						 The District Court considered and rejected respondent-intervenors arguments in a supplemental opinion and order.  See 135 F. Supp. 2d 790 (ED Mich. 2001).  The court explained that respondent-intervenors failed to present any evidence that the discrimination alleged by them, or the continuing effects of such discrimination, was the real justification for the LSAs race-conscious admissions programs.  Id., at 795.  We agree, and to the extent respondent-intervenors reassert this justification, a justification the University has never asserted throughout the course of this litigation, we affirm the District Courts disposition of the issue.

						 Because the Universitys guidelines concededly use race in evaluating both freshman and transfer applications, and because petitioners have challenged any use of race by the University in undergraduate admissions, the transfer admissions policy is very much before this Court.  Although petitioners did not raise a narrow tailoring challenge to the transfer policy, as counsel for petitioners repeatedly explained, the transfer policy is before this Court in that petitioners challenged any use of race by the University to promote diversity, including through the transfer policy.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 4 ([T]he [transfer] policy is essentially the same with respect to the consideration of race); id., at 5 (The transfer policy considers race); id., at 6 (same); id., at 7 ([T]he transfer policy and the [freshman] admissions policy are fundamentally the same in the respect that they both consider race in the admissions process in a way that is discriminatory); id., at 78 ([T]he University considers race for a purpose to achieve a diversity that we believe is not compelling, and if that is struck down as a rationale, then the [result] would be [the] same with respect to the transfer policy as with respect to the [freshman] admissions policy, Your Honor).

As we explained, the plaintiffs evidentiary approaches to the individual and class claims were entirely different.  He attempted to sustain his individual claim by proving intentional discrimination.  He tried to prove the class claims through statistical evidence of disparate impact… . It is clear that the maintenance of respondents action as a class action did not advance the efficiency and economy of litigation which is a principal purpose of the procedure.   Id., at 159 (quoting American Pipe &amp; Constr.

As explained above, respondents concede that only a portion of the applications are reviewed by the ARC and that the bulk of admissions decisions are based on the point system.  It should be readily apparent that the availability of this review, which comes after the automatic distribution of points, is far more limited than the individualized review given to the large middle group of applicants discussed by Justice Powell and described by the Harvard plan in Bakke.  438 U.

She goes on to say that [i]f honesty is the best policy, surely Michigans accurately described, fully disclosed College affirmative action program is preferable to achieving similar numbers through winks, nods, and disguises.  Post, at 8.  These observations are remarkable for two reasons.  First, they suggest that universitiesto whose academic judgment we are told in Grutter v. Bollinger, post, at 16, we should deferwill pursue their affirmative-action programs whether or not they violate the United States Constitution.  Second, they recommend that these violations should be dealt with, not by requiring the universities to obey the Constitution, but by changing the Constitution so that it conforms to the conduct of the universities.

				Petitioners Jennifer Gratz and Patrick Hamacher both applied for admission to the University of Michigans (University) College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (LSA) as residents of the State of Michigan.  Both petitioners are Caucasian.  Gratz, who applied for admission for the fall of 1995, was notified in January of that year that a final decision regarding her admission had been delayed until April.  This delay was based upon the Universitys determination that, although Gratz was  well qualified,  she was  less competitive than the students who ha[d] been admitted on first review.   App. to Pet. for Cert. 109a.

				  In order to promote consistency in the review of the large number of applications received, the OUA uses written guidelines for each academic year.  Admissions counselors make admissions decisions in accordance with these guidelines.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				OUA considers a number of factors in making admissions decisions, including high school grades, standardized test scores, high school quality, curriculum strength, geography, alumni relationships, and leadership.  OUA also considers race.  During all periods relevant to this litigation, the University has considered African-Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans to be underrepresented minorities, and it is undisputed that the University admits virtually every qualified … applicant from these groups.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 111a.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				During 1995 and 1996, OUA counselors evaluated applications according to grade point average combined with what were referred to as the SCUGA factors.  These factors included the quality of an applicants high school (S), the strength of an applicants high school curriculum (C), an applicants unusual circumstances (U), an applicants geographical residence (G), and an applicants alumni relationships (A).  After these scores were combined to produce an applicants GPA 2 score, the reviewing admissions counselors referenced a set of Guidelines tables, which listed GPA 2 ranges on the vertical axis, and American College Test/Scholastic Aptitude Test (ACT/SAT) scores on the horizontal axis.  Each table was divided into cells that included one or more courses of action to be taken, including admit, reject, delay for additional information, or postpone for reconsideration.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In both years, applicants with the same GPA 2 score and ACT/SAT score were subject to different admissions outcomes based upon their racial or ethnic status.

            </a>
				  For example, as a Caucasian in-state applicant, Gratzs GPA 2 score and ACT score placed her within a cell calling for a postponed decision on her application.  An in-state or out-of-state minority applicant with Gratzs scores would have fallen within a cell calling for admission.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In 1997, the University modified its admissions procedure.  Specifically, the formula for calculating an applicants GPA 2 score was restructured to include additional point values under the U category in the SCUGA factors.  Under this new system, applicants could receive points for underrepresented minority status, socioeconomic disadvantage, or attendance at a high school with a predominantly underrepresented minority population, or underrepresentation in the unit to which the student was applying (for example, men who sought to pursue a career in nursing).  Under the 1997 procedures, Hamachers
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				GPA 2 score and ACT score placed him in a cell on the in-state applicant table calling for postponement of a final admissions decision.  An underrepresented minority applicant placed in the same cell would generally have been admitted.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Beginning with the 1998 academic year, the OUA dispensed with the Guidelines tables and the SCUGA point system in favor of a selection index, on which an applicant could score a maximum of 150 points.  This index was divided linearly into ranges generally calling for admissions dispositions as follows: 100150 (admit); 9599 (admit or postpone); 9094 (postpone or admit); 7589 (delay or postpone); 74 and below (delay or reject).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Each application received points based on high school grade point average, standardized test scores, academic quality of an applicants high school, strength or weakness of high school curriculum, in-state residency, alumni relationship, personal essay, and personal achievement or leadership.  Of particular significance here, under a miscellaneous category, an applicant was entitled to 20 points based upon his or her membership in an underrepresented racial or ethnic minority group.  The University explained that the  development of the selection index for admissions in 1998 changed only the mechanics, not the substance of how race and ethnicity were considered in admissions.   App. to Pet. for Cert. 116a.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In all application years from 1995 to 1998, the guidelines provided that qualified applicants from underrepresented minority groups be admitted as soon as possible in light of the Universitys belief that such applicants were more likely to enroll if promptly notified of their admission.  Also from 1995 through 1998, the University carefully managed its rolling admissions system to permit consideration of certain applications submitted later in the academic year through the use of protected seats.  Specific groupsincluding athletes, foreign students, ROTC candidates, and underrepresented minoritieswere protected categories eligible for these seats.  A committee called the Enrollment Working Group (EWG) projected how many applicants from each of these protected categories the University was likely to receive after a given date and then paced admissions decisions to permit full consideration of expected applications from these groups.  If this space was not filled by qualified candidates from the designated groups toward the end of the admissions season, it was then used to admit qualified candidates remaining in the applicant pool, including those on the waiting list.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				During 1999 and 2000, the OUA used the selection index, under which every applicant from an underrepresented racial or ethnic minority group was awarded 20 points.  Starting in 1999, however, the University established an Admissions Review Committee (ARC), to provide an additional level of consideration for some applications.  Under the new system, counselors may, in their discretion, flag an application for the ARC to review after determining that the applicant (1) is academically prepared to succeed at the University,

				 (2) has achieved a minimum selection index score, and (3) possesses a quality or characteristic important to the Universitys composition of its freshman class, such as high class rank, unique life experiences, challenges, circumstances, interests or talents, socioeconomic disadvantage, and underrepresented race, ethnicity, or geography.  After reviewing flagged applications, the ARC determines whether to admit, defer, or deny each applicant.

Respondents contended that the LSA has just such an interest in the educational benefits that result from having a racially and ethnically diverse student body and that its program is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.  Respondent-intervenors asserted that the LSA had a compelling interest in remedying the Universitys past and current discrimination against minorities.

				The District Court began its analysis by reviewing this Courts decision in 
				<em>
					Bakke.  
				</em>
				See 122 F. Supp. 2d 811, 817 (ED Mich. 2001).  Although the court acknowledged that no decision from this Court since 
				<em>
					Bakke
				</em>
				 has explicitly accepted the diversity rationale discussed by Justice Powell, see 122 F. Supp. 2d, at 820821, it also concluded that this Court had not, in the years since 
				<em>
					Bakke
				</em>
				, ruled out such a justification for the use of race.  122 F. Supp. 2d, at 820821.  The District Court concluded that respondents and their 
				<em>
					amici curiae 
				</em>
				had presented solid evidence that a racially and ethnically diverse student body produces significant educational benefits such that achieving such a student body constitutes a compelling governmental interest.  See 
				<em>
					id

				., at 822824.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The court next considered whether the LSAs admissions guidelines were narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.  See 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 824.  Again relying on Justice Powells opinion in 
				<em>
					Bakke
				</em>
				, the District Court determined that the admissions program the LSA began using in 1999 is a narrowly tailored means of achieving the Universitys interest in the educational benefits that flow from a racially and ethnically diverse student body.  See 122 F. Supp. 2d, at 827.  The court emphasized that the LSAs current program does not utilize rigid quotas or seek to admit a predetermined number of minority students.  See 
				<em>
					ibid
				</em>
				.  The award of 20 points for membership in an underrepresented minority group, in the District Courts view, was not the functional equivalent of a quota because minority candidates were not insulated from review by virtue of those points.  See 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 828.  Likewise, the court rejected the assertion that the LSAs program operates like the two-track system Justice Powell found objectionable in 
				<em>
					Bakke 
				</em>
				on the grounds that
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				LSA applicants are not competing for different groups of seats.  See 122 F. Supp. 2d, at 828829.  The court also dismissed petitioners assertion that the LSAs current system is nothing more than a means by which to achieve racial balancing.  See 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 831.  The court explained that the LSA does not seek to achieve a certain proportion of minority students, let alone a proportion that represents the community.  See

				The District Court found the admissions guidelines the LSA used from 1995 through 1998 to be more problematic.  In the courts view, the Universitys prior practice of protecting or reserving seats for underrepresented minority applicants effectively kept nonprotected applicants from competing for those slots.  See 
				<em>

				., at 832.  This system, the court concluded, operated as the functional equivalent of a quota and ran afoul of Justice Powells opinion in

The defendants argued that the named representatives could not represent absent class members challenging transfers to higher levels of care because they had not been threatened with such transfers.  We agreed.  We noted that [n]othing in the record … suggests that any of the individual respondents have been either transferred to more intensive care or threatened with such transfers.  457 U. S., at 1001.  And we found that transfers to lower levels of care involved a number of fundamentally different concerns than did transfers to higher ones.  
				<em>

				In the present case, the Universitys use of race in undergraduate transfer admissions does not implicate a significantly different set of concerns than does its use of race in undergraduate freshman admissions.  Respondents challenged Hamachers standing at the certification stage, but 
				<em>
					never
				</em>
				 did so on the grounds that the Universitys use of race in undergraduate transfer admissions involves a different set of concerns than does its use of race in freshman admissions.  Respondents failure to allege any such difference is simply consistent with the fact that no such difference exists.  Each year the OUA produces a document entitled COLLEGE OF LITERATURE SCIENCE AND THE ARTS GUIDELINES FOR ALL TERMS, which sets forth guidelines for all individuals seeking admission to the LSA, including freshman applicants, transfer applicants, international student applicants, and the like.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 2 App. in No. 011333 etc. (CA6), pp. 507542.

In fact, the criteria used to determine whether a transfer applicant will contribute to the Universitys stated goal of diversity are 
				<em>
					identical

				 to that used to evaluate freshman applicants.  For example, in 1997, when the class was certified and the District Court found that Hamacher had standing to represent the class, the transfer guidelines contained a separate section entitled CONTRIBUTION TO A DIVERSE STUDENT BODY.  2 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 531.  This section explained that any transfer applicant who could 
				<em>
					contribut[e] to a diverse student body
				</em>
				 should generally be admitted even with substantially lower qualifications than those required of other transfer applicants.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				. (emphasis added).  To determine whether a transfer applicant was capable of contribut[ing] to a diverse student body, admissions counselors were instructed to determine whether that transfer applicant met the criteria as defined in Section IV of the U category of [the] SCUGA factors used to assess freshman applicants.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  Section IV of the U category, entitled Contribution to a Diverse Class, explained that [t]he University is committed to a rich educational experience for its students.  A diverse, as opposed to a homogenous, student population enhances the educational experience for all students.  To insure a diverse class, significant weight will be given in the admissions process to indicators of students contribution to a diverse class.  1 
				<em>

				at 11331134, 11531154.  Indeed, the 
				<em>

				</em>
				difference between the Universitys use of race in considering freshman and transfer applicants is that all underrepresented minority freshman applicants receive 20 points and virtually all who are minimally qualified are admitted, while generally all minimally qualified minority transfer applicants are admitted outright.  While this difference might be relevant to a narrow tailoring analysis, it clearly has no effect on petitioners standing to challenge the Universitys use of race in undergraduate admissions and its assertion that diversity is a compelling state interest that justifies its consideration of the race of its undergraduate applicants.

				The current LSA policy does not provide such individualized consideration.  The LSAs policy automatically distributes 20 points to every single applicant from an underrepresented minority group, as defined by the University.  The only consideration that accompanies this distribution of points is a factual review of an application to determine whether an individual is a member of one of these minority groups.  Moreover, unlike Justice Powells example, where the race of a particular black applicant could be considered without being decisive, see 
				<em>

				Also instructive in our consideration of the LSAs system is the example provided in the description of the Harvard College Admissions Program, which Justice Powell both discussed in, and attached to, his opinion in

        <p class="bodytext">
				The Admissions Committee, with only a few places left to fill, might find itself forced to choose between A, the child of a successful black physician in an academic community with promise of superior academic performance, and B, a black who grew up in an inner-city ghetto of semi-literate parents whose academic achievement was lower but who had demonstrated energy and leadership as well as an apparently abiding interest in black power.  If a good number of black students much like A but few like B had already been admitted, the Committee might prefer B; and vice versa.  If C, a white student with extraordinary artistic talent, were also seeking one of the remaining places, his unique quality might give him an edge over both A and B.  Thus, the critical criteria are often individual qualities or experience

				.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				. (emphasis added).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
This example further demonstrates the problematic nature of the LSAs admissions system.  Even if student Cs extraordinary artistic talent rivaled that of Monet or Picasso, the applicant would receive, at most, five points under the LSAs system.  See App. 234235.  At the same time, every single underrepresented minority applicant, including students A and B, would automatically receive 20 points for submitting an application.  Clearly, the LSAs system does not offer applicants the individualized selection process described in Harvards example.  Instead of considering how the differing backgrounds, experiences, and characteristics of students A, B, and C might benefit the University, admissions counselors reviewing LSA applications would simply award both A and B 20 points because their applications indicate that they are African-American, and student C would receive up to 5 points for his extraordinary talent.

				Respondents emphasize the fact that the LSA has created the possibility of an applicants file being flagged for individualized consideration by the ARC.  We think that the flagging program only emphasizes the flaws of the Universitys system as a whole when compared to that described by Justice Powell.  Again, students A, B, and C illustrate the point.  First, student A would never be flagged.  This is because, as the University has conceded, the effect of automatically awarding 20 points is that virtually every qualified underrepresented minority applicant is admitted.  Student A, an applicant with promise of superior academic performance, would certainly fit this description.  Thus, the result of the automatic distribution of 20 points is that the University would never consider student As individual background, experiences, and characteristics to assess his individual potential contribution to diversity, 
				<em>
					Bakke, supra, 
				</em>
				at 317.  Instead, every applicant like student A would simply be admitted.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It is possible that students B and C would be flagged and considered as individuals.  This assumes that student B was not already admitted because of the automatic 20-point distribution, and that student C could muster at least 70 additional points.  But the fact that the review committee can look at the applications individually and ignore the points, once an application is flagged, Tr. of Oral Arg. 42, is of little comfort under our strict scrutiny analysis.  The record does not reveal precisely how many applications are flagged for this individualized consideration, but it is undisputed that such consideration is the exception and not the rule in the operation of the LSAs admissions program.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 117a (The ARC reviews only a portion of all of the applications.  The bulk of admissions decisions are executed based on selection index score parameters set by the EWG).

						 Because the Universitys guidelines concededly use race in evaluating both freshman and transfer applications, and because petitioners have challenged any use of race by the University in undergraduate admissions, the transfer admissions policy is very much before this Court.  Although petitioners did not raise a narrow tailoring challenge to the transfer policy, as counsel for petitioners repeatedly explained, the transfer policy is before this Court in that petitioners challenged any use of race by the University to promote diversity, including through the transfer policy.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 4 ([T]he [transfer] policy is essentially the same with respect to the consideration of race); id., at 5 (The transfer policy considers race); id., at 6 (same); id., at 7 ([T]he transfer policy and the [freshman] admissions policy are fundamentally the same in the respect that they both consider race in the admissions process in a way that is discriminatory); id., at 78 ([T]he University considers race for a purpose to achieve a diversity that we believe is not compelling, and if that is struck down as a rationale, then the [result] would be [the] same with respect to the transfer policy as with respect to the [freshman] admissions policy, Your Honor).

She goes on to say that [i]f honesty is the best policy, surely Michigans accurately described, fully disclosed College affirmative action program is preferable to achieving similar numbers through winks, nods, and disguises.  Post, at 8.  These observations are remarkable for two reasons.  First, they suggest that universitiesto whose academic judgment we are told in Grutter v. Bollinger, post, at 16, we should deferwill pursue their affirmative-action programs whether or not they violate the United States Constitution.  Second, they recommend that these violations should be dealt with, not by requiring the universities to obey the Constitution, but by changing the Constitution so that it conforms to the conduct of the universities.

				Petitioners Jennifer Gratz and Patrick Hamacher both applied for admission to the University of Michigans (University) College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (LSA) as residents of the State of Michigan.  Both petitioners are Caucasian.  Gratz, who applied for admission for the fall of 1995, was notified in January of that year that a final decision regarding her admission had been delayed until April.  This delay was based upon the Universitys determination that, although Gratz was  well qualified,  she was  less competitive than the students who ha[d] been admitted on first review.   App. to Pet. for Cert. 109a.

				The University has changed its admissions guidelines a number of times during the period relevant to this litigation, and we summarize the most significant of these changes briefly.  The Universitys Office of Undergraduate Admissions (OUA) oversees the LSA admissions process.
				<a name="ZO-6ref" href="#ZO-6" class="">

            </a>
				  In order to promote consistency in the review of the large number of applications received, the OUA uses written guidelines for each academic year.  Admissions counselors make admissions decisions in accordance with these guidelines.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				OUA considers a number of factors in making admissions decisions, including high school grades, standardized test scores, high school quality, curriculum strength, geography, alumni relationships, and leadership.  OUA also considers race.  During all periods relevant to this litigation, the University has considered African-Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans to be underrepresented minorities, and it is undisputed that the University admits virtually every qualified … applicant from these groups.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 111a.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				During 1995 and 1996, OUA counselors evaluated applications according to grade point average combined with what were referred to as the SCUGA factors.  These factors included the quality of an applicants high school (S), the strength of an applicants high school curriculum (C), an applicants unusual circumstances (U), an applicants geographical residence (G), and an applicants alumni relationships (A).  After these scores were combined to produce an applicants GPA 2 score, the reviewing admissions counselors referenced a set of Guidelines tables, which listed GPA 2 ranges on the vertical axis, and American College Test/Scholastic Aptitude Test (ACT/SAT) scores on the horizontal axis.  Each table was divided into cells that included one or more courses of action to be taken, including admit, reject, delay for additional information, or postpone for reconsideration.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In both years, applicants with the same GPA 2 score and ACT/SAT score were subject to different admissions outcomes based upon their racial or ethnic status.
				<a name="ZO-7ref" href="#ZO-7" class="">

                </sup>
            </a>
				  For example, as a Caucasian in-state applicant, Gratzs GPA 2 score and ACT score placed her within a cell calling for a postponed decision on her application.  An in-state or out-of-state minority applicant with Gratzs scores would have fallen within a cell calling for admission.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In 1997, the University modified its admissions procedure.  Specifically, the formula for calculating an applicants GPA 2 score was restructured to include additional point values under the U category in the SCUGA factors.  Under this new system, applicants could receive points for underrepresented minority status, socioeconomic disadvantage, or attendance at a high school with a predominantly underrepresented minority population, or underrepresentation in the unit to which the student was applying (for example, men who sought to pursue a career in nursing).  Under the 1997 procedures, Hamachers
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				GPA 2 score and ACT score placed him in a cell on the in-state applicant table calling for postponement of a final admissions decision.  An underrepresented minority applicant placed in the same cell would generally have been admitted.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Beginning with the 1998 academic year, the OUA dispensed with the Guidelines tables and the SCUGA point system in favor of a selection index, on which an applicant could score a maximum of 150 points.  This index was divided linearly into ranges generally calling for admissions dispositions as follows: 100150 (admit); 9599 (admit or postpone); 9094 (postpone or admit); 7589 (delay or postpone); 74 and below (delay or reject).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Each application received points based on high school grade point average, standardized test scores, academic quality of an applicants high school, strength or weakness of high school curriculum, in-state residency, alumni relationship, personal essay, and personal achievement or leadership.  Of particular significance here, under a miscellaneous category, an applicant was entitled to 20 points based upon his or her membership in an underrepresented racial or ethnic minority group.  The University explained that the  development of the selection index for admissions in 1998 changed only the mechanics, not the substance of how race and ethnicity were considered in admissions.   App. to Pet. for Cert. 116a.

				In all application years from 1995 to 1998, the guidelines provided that qualified applicants from underrepresented minority groups be admitted as soon as possible in light of the Universitys belief that such applicants were more likely to enroll if promptly notified of their admission.  Also from 1995 through 1998, the University carefully managed its rolling admissions system to permit consideration of certain applications submitted later in the academic year through the use of protected seats.  Specific groupsincluding athletes, foreign students, ROTC candidates, and underrepresented minoritieswere protected categories eligible for these seats.  A committee called the Enrollment Working Group (EWG) projected how many applicants from each of these protected categories the University was likely to receive after a given date and then paced admissions decisions to permit full consideration of expected applications from these groups.  If this space was not filled by qualified candidates from the designated groups toward the end of the admissions season, it was then used to admit qualified candidates remaining in the applicant pool, including those on the waiting list.

				During 1999 and 2000, the OUA used the selection index, under which every applicant from an underrepresented racial or ethnic minority group was awarded 20 points.  Starting in 1999, however, the University established an Admissions Review Committee (ARC), to provide an additional level of consideration for some applications.  Under the new system, counselors may, in their discretion, flag an application for the ARC to review after determining that the applicant (1) is academically prepared to succeed at the University,

				 (2) has achieved a minimum selection index score, and (3) possesses a quality or characteristic important to the Universitys composition of its freshman class, such as high class rank, unique life experiences, challenges, circumstances, interests or talents, socioeconomic disadvantage, and underrepresented race, ethnicity, or geography.  After reviewing flagged applications, the ARC determines whether to admit, defer, or deny each applicant.

Respondents contended that the LSA has just such an interest in the educational benefits that result from having a racially and ethnically diverse student body and that its program is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.  Respondent-intervenors asserted that the LSA had a compelling interest in remedying the Universitys past and current discrimination against minorities.

				The District Court began its analysis by reviewing this Courts decision in 
				<em>
					Bakke.  
				</em>
				See 122 F. Supp. 2d 811, 817 (ED Mich. 2001).  Although the court acknowledged that no decision from this Court since

				<em>
					Bakke
				</em>
				, ruled out such a justification for the use of race.  122 F. Supp. 2d, at 820821.  The District Court concluded that respondents and their 
				<em>

				had presented solid evidence that a racially and ethnically diverse student body produces significant educational benefits such that achieving such a student body constitutes a compelling governmental interest.  See

				The court next considered whether the LSAs admissions guidelines were narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.  See 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 824.  Again relying on Justice Powells opinion in 
				<em>
					Bakke
				</em>
				, the District Court determined that the admissions program the LSA began using in 1999 is a narrowly tailored means of achieving the Universitys interest in the educational benefits that flow from a racially and ethnically diverse student body.  See 122 F. Supp. 2d, at 827.  The court emphasized that the LSAs current program does not utilize rigid quotas or seek to admit a predetermined number of minority students.  See 
				<em>
					ibid
				</em>
				.  The award of 20 points for membership in an underrepresented minority group, in the District Courts view, was not the functional equivalent of a quota because minority candidates were not insulated from review by virtue of those points.  See 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 828.  Likewise, the court rejected the assertion that the LSAs program operates like the two-track system Justice Powell found objectionable in 
				<em>
					Bakke 
				</em>
				on the grounds that
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				LSA applicants are not competing for different groups of seats.  See 122 F. Supp. 2d, at 828829.  The court also dismissed petitioners assertion that the LSAs current system is nothing more than a means by which to achieve racial balancing.  See 
				<em>
					id

				., at 831.  The court explained that the LSA does not seek to achieve a certain proportion of minority students, let alone a proportion that represents the community.  See

				The District Court found the admissions guidelines the LSA used from 1995 through 1998 to be more problematic.  In the courts view, the Universitys prior practice of protecting or reserving seats for underrepresented minority applicants effectively kept nonprotected applicants from competing for those slots.  See 
				<em>

The defendants argued that the named representatives could not represent absent class members challenging transfers to higher levels of care because they had not been threatened with such transfers.  We agreed.  We noted that [n]othing in the record … suggests that any of the individual respondents have been either transferred to more intensive care or threatened with such transfers.  457 U.

				<em>

				In the present case, the Universitys use of race in undergraduate transfer admissions does not implicate a significantly different set of concerns than does its use of race in undergraduate freshman admissions.  Respondents challenged Hamachers standing at the certification stage, but 
				<em>
					never
				</em>
				 did so on the grounds that the Universitys use of race in undergraduate transfer admissions involves a different set of concerns than does its use of race in freshman admissions.  Respondents failure to allege any such difference is simply consistent with the fact that no such difference exists.  Each year the OUA produces a document entitled COLLEGE OF LITERATURE SCIENCE AND THE ARTS GUIDELINES FOR ALL TERMS, which sets forth guidelines for all individuals seeking admission to the LSA, including freshman applicants, transfer applicants, international student applicants, and the like.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 2 App. in No. 011333 etc. (CA6), pp. 507542.  The guidelines used to evaluate transfer applicants specifically cross-reference factors and qualifications considered in assessing freshman applicants.  In fact, the criteria used to determine whether a transfer applicant will contribute to the Universitys stated goal of diversity are 
				<em>
					identical
				</em>
				 to that used to evaluate freshman applicants.  For example, in 1997, when the class was certified and the District Court found that Hamacher had standing to represent the class, the transfer guidelines contained a separate section entitled CONTRIBUTION TO A DIVERSE STUDENT BODY.  2 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 531.  This section explained that any transfer applicant who could 
				<em>
					contribut[e] to a diverse student body
				</em>
				 should generally be admitted even with substantially lower qualifications than those required of other transfer applicants.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				. (emphasis added).  To determine whether a transfer applicant was capable of contribut[ing] to a diverse student body, admissions counselors were instructed to determine whether that transfer applicant met the criteria as defined in Section IV of the U category of [the] SCUGA factors used to assess freshman applicants.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  Section IV of the U category, entitled Contribution to a Diverse Class, explained that [t]he University is committed to a rich educational experience for its students.  A diverse, as opposed to a homogenous, student population enhances the educational experience for all students.  To insure a diverse class, significant weight will be given in the admissions process to indicators of students contribution to a diverse class.  1 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 432.  These indicators, used in evaluating freshman and transfer applicants alike, list being a member of an underrepresented minority group as establishing an applicants contribution to diversity.  See 3 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 11331134, 11531154.  Indeed, the 
				<em>
					only 
				</em>
				difference between the Universitys use of race in considering freshman and transfer applicants is that all underrepresented minority freshman applicants receive 20 points and virtually all who are minimally qualified are admitted, while generally all minimally qualified minority transfer applicants are admitted outright.  While this difference might be relevant to a narrow tailoring analysis, it clearly has no effect on petitioners standing to challenge the Universitys use of race in undergraduate admissions and its assertion that diversity is a compelling state interest that justifies its consideration of the race of its undergraduate applicants.

				The current LSA policy does not provide such individualized consideration.  The LSAs policy automatically distributes 20 points to every single applicant from an underrepresented minority group, as defined by the University.  The only consideration that accompanies this distribution of points is a factual review of an application to determine whether an individual is a member of one of these minority groups.  Moreover, unlike Justice Powells example, where the race of a particular black applicant could be considered without being decisive, see 
				<em>
					Bakke
				</em>
				, 438 U. S., at 317, the LSAs automatic distribution of 20 points has the effect of making the factor of race … decisive for virtually every minimally qualified underrepresented minority applicant.

				Also instructive in our consideration of the LSAs system is the example provided in the description of the Harvard College Admissions Program, which Justice Powell both discussed in, and attached to, his opinion in

				The Admissions Committee, with only a few places left to fill, might find itself forced to choose between A, the child of a successful black physician in an academic community with promise of superior academic performance, and B, a black who grew up in an inner-city ghetto of semi-literate parents whose academic achievement was lower but who had demonstrated energy and leadership as well as an apparently abiding interest in black power.  If a good number of black students much like A but few like B had already been admitted, the Committee might prefer B; and vice versa.  If C, a white student with extraordinary artistic talent, were also seeking one of the remaining places, his unique quality might give him an edge over both A and B.  Thus, the critical criteria are often individual qualities or experience

				.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				. (emphasis added).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
This example further demonstrates the problematic nature of the LSAs admissions system.  Even if student Cs extraordinary artistic talent rivaled that of Monet or Picasso, the applicant would receive, at most, five points under the LSAs system.  See App. 234235.  At the same time, every single underrepresented minority applicant, including students A and B, would automatically receive 20 points for submitting an application.  Clearly, the LSAs system does not offer applicants the individualized selection process described in Harvards example.  Instead of considering how the differing backgrounds, experiences, and characteristics of students A, B, and C might benefit the University, admissions counselors reviewing LSA applications would simply award both A and B 20 points because their applications indicate that they are African-American, and student C would receive up to 5 points for his extraordinary talent.

				Respondents emphasize the fact that the LSA has created the possibility of an applicants file being flagged for individualized consideration by the ARC.  We think that the flagging program only emphasizes the flaws of the Universitys system as a whole when compared to that described by Justice Powell.  Again, students A, B, and C illustrate the point.  First, student A would never be flagged.  This is because, as the University has conceded, the effect of automatically awarding 20 points is that virtually every qualified underrepresented minority applicant is admitted.  Student A, an applicant with promise of superior academic performance, would certainly fit this description.  Thus, the result of the automatic distribution of 20 points is that the University would never consider student As individual background, experiences, and characteristics to assess his individual potential contribution to diversity, 
				<em>
					Bakke, supra, 
				</em>
				at 317.  Instead, every applicant like student A would simply be admitted.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It is possible that students B and C would be flagged and considered as individuals.  This assumes that student B was not already admitted because of the automatic 20-point distribution, and that student C could muster at least 70 additional points.  But the fact that the review committee can look at the applications individually and ignore the points, once an application is flagged, Tr. of Oral Arg. 42, is of little comfort under our strict scrutiny analysis.  The record does not reveal precisely how many applications are flagged for this individualized consideration, but it is undisputed that such consideration is the exception and not the rule in the operation of the LSAs admissions program.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 117a (The ARC reviews only a portion of all of the applications.  The bulk of admissions decisions are executed based on selection index score parameters set by the EWG).

						 Because the Universitys guidelines concededly use race in evaluating both freshman and transfer applications, and because petitioners have challenged any use of race by the University in undergraduate admissions, the transfer admissions policy is very much before this Court.  Although petitioners did not raise a narrow tailoring challenge to the transfer policy, as counsel for petitioners repeatedly explained, the transfer policy is before this Court in that petitioners challenged any use of race by the University to promote diversity, including through the transfer policy.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 4 ([T]he [transfer] policy is essentially the same with respect to the consideration of race); id., at 5 (The transfer policy considers race); id., at 6 (same); id., at 7 ([T]he transfer policy and the [freshman] admissions policy are fundamentally the same in the respect that they both consider race in the admissions process in a way that is discriminatory); id., at 78 ([T]he University considers race for a purpose to achieve a diversity that we believe is not compelling, and if that is struck down as a rationale, then the [result] would be [the] same with respect to the transfer policy as with respect to the [freshman] admissions policy, Your Honor).

These observations are remarkable for two reasons.  First, they suggest that universitiesto whose academic judgment we are told in Grutter v. Bollinger, post, at 16, we should deferwill pursue their affirmative-action programs whether or not they violate the United States Constitution.  Second, they recommend that these violations should be dealt with, not by requiring the universities to obey the Constitution, but by changing the Constitution so that it conforms to the conduct of the universities.

				Petitioners Jennifer Gratz and Patrick Hamacher both applied for admission to the University of Michigans (University) College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (LSA) as residents of the State of Michigan.  Both petitioners are Caucasian.  Gratz, who applied for admission for the fall of 1995, was notified in January of that year that a final decision regarding her admission had been delayed until April.  This delay was based upon the Universitys determination that, although Gratz was  well qualified,  she was  less competitive than the students who ha[d] been admitted on first review.   App. to Pet. for Cert. 109a.

				The University has changed its admissions guidelines a number of times during the period relevant to this litigation, and we summarize the most significant of these changes briefly.  The Universitys Office of Undergraduate Admissions (OUA) oversees the LSA admissions process.

            </a>
				  In order to promote consistency in the review of the large number of applications received, the OUA uses written guidelines for each academic year.  Admissions counselors make admissions decisions in accordance with these guidelines.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				OUA considers a number of factors in making admissions decisions, including high school grades, standardized test scores, high school quality, curriculum strength, geography, alumni relationships, and leadership.  OUA also considers race.  During all periods relevant to this litigation, the University has considered African-Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans to be underrepresented minorities, and it is undisputed that the University admits virtually every qualified … applicant from these groups.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 111a.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				During 1995 and 1996, OUA counselors evaluated applications according to grade point average combined with what were referred to as the SCUGA factors.  These factors included the quality of an applicants high school (S), the strength of an applicants high school curriculum (C), an applicants unusual circumstances (U), an applicants geographical residence (G), and an applicants alumni relationships (A).  After these scores were combined to produce an applicants GPA 2 score, the reviewing admissions counselors referenced a set of Guidelines tables, which listed GPA 2 ranges on the vertical axis, and American College Test/Scholastic Aptitude Test (ACT/SAT) scores on the horizontal axis.  Each table was divided into cells that included one or more courses of action to be taken, including admit, reject, delay for additional information, or postpone for reconsideration.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In both years, applicants with the same GPA 2 score and ACT/SAT score were subject to different admissions outcomes based upon their racial or ethnic status.
				<a name="ZO-7ref" href="#ZO-7" class="">
                <sup>

				</b>
                </sup>
            </a>
				  For example, as a Caucasian in-state applicant, Gratzs GPA 2 score and ACT score placed her within a cell calling for a postponed decision on her application.  An in-state or out-of-state minority applicant with Gratzs scores would have fallen within a cell calling for admission.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In 1997, the University modified its admissions procedure.  Specifically, the formula for calculating an applicants GPA 2 score was restructured to include additional point values under the U category in the SCUGA factors.  Under this new system, applicants could receive points for underrepresented minority status, socioeconomic disadvantage, or attendance at a high school with a predominantly underrepresented minority population, or underrepresentation in the unit to which the student was applying (for example, men who sought to pursue a career in nursing).  Under the 1997 procedures, Hamachers
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				GPA 2 score and ACT score placed him in a cell on the in-state applicant table calling for postponement of a final admissions decision.  An underrepresented minority applicant placed in the same cell would generally have been admitted.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Beginning with the 1998 academic year, the OUA dispensed with the Guidelines tables and the SCUGA point system in favor of a selection index, on which an applicant could score a maximum of 150 points.  This index was divided linearly into ranges generally calling for admissions dispositions as follows: 100150 (admit); 9599 (admit or postpone); 9094 (postpone or admit); 7589 (delay or postpone); 74 and below (delay or reject).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Each application received points based on high school grade point average, standardized test scores, academic quality of an applicants high school, strength or weakness of high school curriculum, in-state residency, alumni relationship, personal essay, and personal achievement or leadership.  Of particular significance here, under a miscellaneous category, an applicant was entitled to 20 points based upon his or her membership in an underrepresented racial or ethnic minority group.  The University explained that the  development of the selection index for admissions in 1998 changed only the mechanics, not the substance of how race and ethnicity were considered in admissions.   App. to Pet. for Cert. 116a.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In all application years from 1995 to 1998, the guidelines provided that qualified applicants from underrepresented minority groups be admitted as soon as possible in light of the Universitys belief that such applicants were more likely to enroll if promptly notified of their admission.  Also from 1995 through 1998, the University carefully managed its rolling admissions system to permit consideration of certain applications submitted later in the academic year through the use of protected seats.  Specific groupsincluding athletes, foreign students, ROTC candidates, and underrepresented minoritieswere protected categories eligible for these seats.  A committee called the Enrollment Working Group (EWG) projected how many applicants from each of these protected categories the University was likely to receive after a given date and then paced admissions decisions to permit full consideration of expected applications from these groups.  If this space was not filled by qualified candidates from the designated groups toward the end of the admissions season, it was then used to admit qualified candidates remaining in the applicant pool, including those on the waiting list.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				During 1999 and 2000, the OUA used the selection index, under which every applicant from an underrepresented racial or ethnic minority group was awarded 20 points.  Starting in 1999, however, the University established an Admissions Review Committee (ARC), to provide an additional level of consideration for some applications.  Under the new system, counselors may, in their discretion, flag an application for the ARC to review after determining that the applicant (1) is academically prepared to succeed at the University,

				 (2) has achieved a minimum selection index score, and (3) possesses a quality or characteristic important to the Universitys composition of its freshman class, such as high class rank, unique life experiences, challenges, circumstances, interests or talents, socioeconomic disadvantage, and underrepresented race, ethnicity, or geography.  After reviewing flagged applications, the ARC determines whether to admit, defer, or deny each applicant.

				, expressed the view that the consideration of race as a factor in admissions might in some cases serve a compelling government interest.  See 438 U. S., at 317.  Respondents contended that the LSA has just such an interest in the educational benefits that result from having a racially and ethnically diverse student body and that its program is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.  Respondent-intervenors asserted that the LSA had a compelling interest in remedying the Universitys past and current discrimination against minorities.

				The District Court began its analysis by reviewing this Courts decision in 
				<em>
					Bakke.  
				</em>
				See 122 F. Supp. 2d 811, 817 (ED Mich. 2001).  Although the court acknowledged that no decision from this Court since

				<em>
					Bakke
				</em>
				, ruled out such a justification for the use of race.  122 F. Supp. 2d, at 820821.  The District Court concluded that respondents and their 
				<em>

				had presented solid evidence that a racially and ethnically diverse student body produces significant educational benefits such that achieving such a student body constitutes a compelling governmental interest.  See

				The court next considered whether the LSAs admissions guidelines were narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.  See 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 824.  Again relying on Justice Powells opinion in 
				<em>
					Bakke
				</em>
				, the District Court determined that the admissions program the LSA began using in 1999 is a narrowly tailored means of achieving the Universitys interest in the educational benefits that flow from a racially and ethnically diverse student body.  See 122 F. Supp. 2d, at 827.  The court emphasized that the LSAs current program does not utilize rigid quotas or seek to admit a predetermined number of minority students.  See 
				<em>
					ibid
				</em>
				.  The award of 20 points for membership in an underrepresented minority group, in the District Courts view, was not the functional equivalent of a quota because minority candidates were not insulated from review by virtue of those points.  See 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 828.  Likewise, the court rejected the assertion that the LSAs program operates like the two-track system Justice Powell found objectionable in 
				<em>
					Bakke 
				</em>
				on the grounds that
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				LSA applicants are not competing for different groups of seats.  See 122 F. Supp. 2d, at 828829.  The court also dismissed petitioners assertion that the LSAs current system is nothing more than a means by which to achieve racial balancing.  See 
				<em>
					id

				The District Court found the admissions guidelines the LSA used from 1995 through 1998 to be more problematic.  In the courts view, the Universitys prior practice of protecting or reserving seats for underrepresented minority applicants effectively kept nonprotected applicants from competing for those slots.  See 
				<em>

				<em>

				 at 8.  In

After a class was certified, the plaintiffs obtained an order expanding class certification to include challenges to URC decisions to transfer patients to 
				<em>
					higher
				</em>
				 levels of care as well.  The defendants argued that the named representatives could not represent absent class members challenging transfers to higher levels of care because they had not been threatened with such transfers.  We agreed.  We noted that [n]othing in the record … suggests that any of the individual respondents have been either transferred to more intensive care or threatened with such transfers.  457 U.

				<em>

				at 10011002 (noting, for example, that transfers to lower levels of care implicated beneficiaries property interests given the concomitant decrease in Medicaid benefits, while transfers to higher levels of care did not).

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In the present case, the Universitys use of race in undergraduate transfer admissions does not implicate a significantly different set of concerns than does its use of race in undergraduate freshman admissions.  Respondents challenged Hamachers standing at the certification stage, but 
				<em>
					never
				</em>
				 did so on the grounds that the Universitys use of race in undergraduate transfer admissions involves a different set of concerns than does its use of race in freshman admissions.  Respondents failure to allege any such difference is simply consistent with the fact that no such difference exists.  Each year the OUA produces a document entitled COLLEGE OF LITERATURE SCIENCE AND THE ARTS GUIDELINES FOR ALL TERMS, which sets forth guidelines for all individuals seeking admission to the LSA, including freshman applicants, transfer applicants, international student applicants, and the like.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 2 App. in No. 011333 etc. (CA6), pp. 507542.  The guidelines used to evaluate transfer applicants specifically cross-reference factors and qualifications considered in assessing freshman applicants.  In fact, the criteria used to determine whether a transfer applicant will contribute to the Universitys stated goal of diversity are 
				<em>
					identical
				</em>
				 to that used to evaluate freshman applicants.  For example, in 1997, when the class was certified and the District Court found that Hamacher had standing to represent the class, the transfer guidelines contained a separate section entitled CONTRIBUTION TO A DIVERSE STUDENT BODY.  2 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 531.  This section explained that any transfer applicant who could 
				<em>
					contribut[e] to a diverse student body
				</em>
				 should generally be admitted even with substantially lower qualifications than those required of other transfer applicants.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				. (emphasis added).  To determine whether a transfer applicant was capable of contribut[ing] to a diverse student body, admissions counselors were instructed to determine whether that transfer applicant met the criteria as defined in Section IV of the U category of [the] SCUGA factors used to assess freshman applicants.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  Section IV of the U category, entitled Contribution to a Diverse Class, explained that [t]he University is committed to a rich educational experience for its students.  A diverse, as opposed to a homogenous, student population enhances the educational experience for all students.  To insure a diverse class, significant weight will be given in the admissions process to indicators of students contribution to a diverse class.  1 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 432.  These indicators, used in evaluating freshman and transfer applicants alike, list being a member of an underrepresented minority group as establishing an applicants contribution to diversity.  See 3 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 11331134, 11531154.  Indeed, the 
				<em>
					only 
				</em>
				difference between the Universitys use of race in considering freshman and transfer applicants is that all underrepresented minority freshman applicants receive 20 points and virtually all who are minimally qualified are admitted, while generally all minimally qualified minority transfer applicants are admitted outright.  While this difference might be relevant to a narrow tailoring analysis, it clearly has no effect on petitioners standing to challenge the Universitys use of race in undergraduate admissions and its assertion that diversity is a compelling state interest that justifies its consideration of the race of its undergraduate applicants.

 ([T]he class determination generally involves considerations that are enmeshed in the factual and legal issues comprising the plaintiffs cause of action (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Indeed, class action treatment was particularly important in this case because the claims of the individual students run the risk of becoming moot and the [t]he class action vehicle … provides a mechanism for ensuring that a justiciable claim is before the Court.  App. 69.
				<em>

 (plurality opinion of Powell, J.)).  We find that the Universitys policy, which automatically distributes 20 points, or one-fifth of the points needed to guarantee admission, to every single underrepresented minority applicant solely because of race, is not narrowly tailored to achieve the interest in educational diversity that respondents claim justifies their program.

				The current LSA policy does not provide such individualized consideration.  The LSAs policy automatically distributes 20 points to every single applicant from an underrepresented minority group, as defined by the University.  The only consideration that accompanies this distribution of points is a factual review of an application to determine whether an individual is a member of one of these minority groups.  Moreover, unlike Justice Powells example, where the race of a particular black applicant could be considered without being decisive, see 
				<em>
					Bakke
				</em>
				, 438 U. S., at 317, the LSAs automatic distribution of 20 points has the effect of making the factor of race … decisive for virtually every minimally qualified underrepresented minority applicant.

				Also instructive in our consideration of the LSAs system is the example provided in the description of the Harvard College Admissions Program, which Justice Powell both discussed in, and attached to, his opinion in

				The Admissions Committee, with only a few places left to fill, might find itself forced to choose between A, the child of a successful black physician in an academic community with promise of superior academic performance, and B, a black who grew up in an inner-city ghetto of semi-literate parents whose academic achievement was lower but who had demonstrated energy and leadership as well as an apparently abiding interest in black power.  If a good number of black students much like A but few like B had already been admitted, the Committee might prefer B; and vice versa.  If C, a white student with extraordinary artistic talent, were also seeking one of the remaining places, his unique quality might give him an edge over both A and B.  Thus, the critical criteria are often individual qualities or experience

				<em>

				. (emphasis added).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
This example further demonstrates the problematic nature of the LSAs admissions system.  Even if student Cs extraordinary artistic talent rivaled that of Monet or Picasso, the applicant would receive, at most, five points under the LSAs system.  See App. 234235.  At the same time, every single underrepresented minority applicant, including students A and B, would automatically receive 20 points for submitting an application.  Clearly, the LSAs system does not offer applicants the individualized selection process described in Harvards example.  Instead of considering how the differing backgrounds, experiences, and characteristics of students A, B, and C might benefit the University, admissions counselors reviewing LSA applications would simply award both A and B 20 points because their applications indicate that they are African-American, and student C would receive up to 5 points for his extraordinary talent.

				Respondents emphasize the fact that the LSA has created the possibility of an applicants file being flagged for individualized consideration by the ARC.  We think that the flagging program only emphasizes the flaws of the Universitys system as a whole when compared to that described by Justice Powell.  Again, students A, B, and C illustrate the point.  First, student A would never be flagged.  This is because, as the University has conceded, the effect of automatically awarding 20 points is that virtually every qualified underrepresented minority applicant is admitted.  Student A, an applicant with promise of superior academic performance, would certainly fit this description.  Thus, the result of the automatic distribution of 20 points is that the University would never consider student As individual background, experiences, and characteristics to assess his individual potential contribution to diversity, 
				<em>
					Bakke, supra, 
				</em>
				at 317.  Instead, every applicant like student A would simply be admitted.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It is possible that students B and C would be flagged and considered as individuals.  This assumes that student B was not already admitted because of the automatic 20-point distribution, and that student C could muster at least 70 additional points.  But the fact that the review committee can look at the applications individually and ignore the points, once an application is flagged, Tr. of Oral Arg. 42, is of little comfort under our strict scrutiny analysis.  The record does not reveal precisely how many applications are flagged for this individualized consideration, but it is undisputed that such consideration is the exception and not the rule in the operation of the LSAs admissions program.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 117a (The ARC reviews only a portion of all of the applications.  The bulk of admissions decisions are executed based on selection index score parameters set by the EWG).

						 Because the Universitys guidelines concededly use race in evaluating both freshman and transfer applications, and because petitioners have challenged any use of race by the University in undergraduate admissions, the transfer admissions policy is very much before this Court.  Although petitioners did not raise a narrow tailoring challenge to the transfer policy, as counsel for petitioners repeatedly explained, the transfer policy is before this Court in that petitioners challenged any use of race by the University to promote diversity, including through the transfer policy.

 (principal opinion).  Justice Powell found that the program employed an impermissible two-track system that disregard[ed] . . . individual rights as guaranteed by the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>.  Id., at 315.  He reached this conclusion even though the university argued that the reservation of a specified number of seats in each class for individuals from the preferred ethnic groups was the only effective means of serving the interest of diversity.  Ibid.  Justice Powell concluded that such arguments misunderstood the very nature of the diversity he found to be compelling.  See ibid.

						Justice Souter recognizes that the LSAs use of race is decisive in practice, but he attempts to avoid that fact through unsupported speculation about the self-selection of minorities in the applicant pool.  See Post, at 6 (dissenting opinion).

						 Justice Souter is therefore wrong when he contends that applicants to the undergraduate college are [not] denied individualized consideration.  Post, at 6.

						 Justice Souter is mistaken in his assertion that the Court take[s] it upon itself to apply a newly formulated legal standard to an undeveloped record.  Post, at 7, n. 3.  He ignores the fact that the respondents have told us all that is necessary to decide this case.  As explained above, respondents concede that only a portion of the applications are reviewed by the ARC and that the bulk of admissions decisions are based on the point system.  It should be readily apparent that the availability of this review, which comes after the automatic distribution of points, is far more limited than the individualized review given to the large middle group of applicants discussed by Justice Powell and described by the Harvard plan in Bakke.  438 U. S., at 316 (internal quotation marks omitted).

						 Justice Ginsburg in her dissent observes that [o]ne can reasonably anticipate . . . that colleges and universities will seek to maintain their minority enrollment . . . whether or not they can do so in full candor through adoption of affirmative action plans of the kind here at issue.  Post, at 7-8.  She goes on to say that [i]f honesty is the best policy, surely Michigans accurately described, fully disclosed College affirmative action program is preferable to achieving similar numbers through winks, nods, and disguises.  Post, at 8.  These observations are remarkable for two reasons.  First, they suggest that universitiesto whose academic judgment we are told in Grutter v. Bollinger, post, at 16, we should deferwill pursue their affirmative-action programs whether or not they violate the United States Constitution.  Second, they recommend that these violations should be dealt with, not by requiring the universities to obey the Constitution, but by changing the Constitution so that it conforms to the conduct of the universities.

				Petitioners Jennifer Gratz and Patrick Hamacher both applied for admission to the University of Michigans (University) College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (LSA) as residents of the State of Michigan.  Both petitioners are Caucasian.  Gratz, who applied for admission for the fall of 1995, was notified in January of that year that a final decision regarding her admission had been delayed until April.  This delay was based upon the Universitys determination that, although Gratz was  well qualified,  she was  less competitive than the students who ha[d] been admitted on first review.   App. to Pet. for Cert. 109a.  Gratz was notified in April that the LSA was unable to offer her admission.  She enrolled in the University of Michigan at Dearborn, from which she graduated in the spring of 1999.

				The University has changed its admissions guidelines a number of times during the period relevant to this litigation, and we summarize the most significant of these changes briefly.  The Universitys Office of Undergraduate Admissions (OUA) oversees the LSA admissions process.
				<a name="ZO-6ref" href="#ZO-6" class="">

                </sup>
            </a>
				  In order to promote consistency in the review of the large number of applications received, the OUA uses written guidelines for each academic year.  Admissions counselors make admissions decisions in accordance with these guidelines.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				OUA considers a number of factors in making admissions decisions, including high school grades, standardized test scores, high school quality, curriculum strength, geography, alumni relationships, and leadership.  OUA also considers race.  During all periods relevant to this litigation, the University has considered African-Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans to be underrepresented minorities, and it is undisputed that the University admits virtually every qualified … applicant from these groups.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 111a.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				During 1995 and 1996, OUA counselors evaluated applications according to grade point average combined with what were referred to as the SCUGA factors.  These factors included the quality of an applicants high school (S), the strength of an applicants high school curriculum (C), an applicants unusual circumstances (U), an applicants geographical residence (G), and an applicants alumni relationships (A).  After these scores were combined to produce an applicants GPA 2 score, the reviewing admissions counselors referenced a set of Guidelines tables, which listed GPA 2 ranges on the vertical axis, and American College Test/Scholastic Aptitude Test (ACT/SAT) scores on the horizontal axis.  Each table was divided into cells that included one or more courses of action to be taken, including admit, reject, delay for additional information, or postpone for reconsideration.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In both years, applicants with the same GPA 2 score and ACT/SAT score were subject to different admissions outcomes based upon their racial or ethnic status.
				<a name="ZO-7ref" href="#ZO-7" class="">
                <sup>

				</b>
                </sup>
            </a>
				  For example, as a Caucasian in-state applicant, Gratzs GPA 2 score and ACT score placed her within a cell calling for a postponed decision on her application.  An in-state or out-of-state minority applicant with Gratzs scores would have fallen within a cell calling for admission.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In 1997, the University modified its admissions procedure.  Specifically, the formula for calculating an applicants GPA 2 score was restructured to include additional point values under the U category in the SCUGA factors.  Under this new system, applicants could receive points for underrepresented minority status, socioeconomic disadvantage, or attendance at a high school with a predominantly underrepresented minority population, or underrepresentation in the unit to which the student was applying (for example, men who sought to pursue a career in nursing).  Under the 1997 procedures, Hamachers
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				GPA 2 score and ACT score placed him in a cell on the in-state applicant table calling for postponement of a final admissions decision.  An underrepresented minority applicant placed in the same cell would generally have been admitted.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Beginning with the 1998 academic year, the OUA dispensed with the Guidelines tables and the SCUGA point system in favor of a selection index, on which an applicant could score a maximum of 150 points.  This index was divided linearly into ranges generally calling for admissions dispositions as follows: 100150 (admit); 9599 (admit or postpone); 9094 (postpone or admit); 7589 (delay or postpone); 74 and below (delay or reject).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Each application received points based on high school grade point average, standardized test scores, academic quality of an applicants high school, strength or weakness of high school curriculum, in-state residency, alumni relationship, personal essay, and personal achievement or leadership.  Of particular significance here, under a miscellaneous category, an applicant was entitled to 20 points based upon his or her membership in an underrepresented racial or ethnic minority group.  The University explained that the  development of the selection index for admissions in 1998 changed only the mechanics, not the substance of how race and ethnicity were considered in admissions.   App. to Pet. for Cert. 116a.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In all application years from 1995 to 1998, the guidelines provided that qualified applicants from underrepresented minority groups be admitted as soon as possible in light of the Universitys belief that such applicants were more likely to enroll if promptly notified of their admission.  Also from 1995 through 1998, the University carefully managed its rolling admissions system to permit consideration of certain applications submitted later in the academic year through the use of protected seats.  Specific groupsincluding athletes, foreign students, ROTC candidates, and underrepresented minoritieswere protected categories eligible for these seats.  A committee called the Enrollment Working Group (EWG) projected how many applicants from each of these protected categories the University was likely to receive after a given date and then paced admissions decisions to permit full consideration of expected applications from these groups.  If this space was not filled by qualified candidates from the designated groups toward the end of the admissions season, it was then used to admit qualified candidates remaining in the applicant pool, including those on the waiting list.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				During 1999 and 2000, the OUA used the selection index, under which every applicant from an underrepresented racial or ethnic minority group was awarded 20 points.  Starting in 1999, however, the University established an Admissions Review Committee (ARC), to provide an additional level of consideration for some applications.  Under the new system, counselors may, in their discretion, flag an application for the ARC to review after determining that the applicant (1) is academically prepared to succeed at the University,

				 (2) has achieved a minimum selection index score, and (3) possesses a quality or characteristic important to the Universitys composition of its freshman class, such as high class rank, unique life experiences, challenges, circumstances, interests or talents, socioeconomic disadvantage, and underrepresented race, ethnicity, or geography.  After reviewing flagged applications, the ARC determines whether to admit, defer, or deny each applicant.

				<em>

				</em>
				 at 1013, Justice Powell, in 
				<em>
					Bakke

				, expressed the view that the consideration of race as a factor in admissions might in some cases serve a compelling government interest.  See 438 U. S., at 317.  Respondents contended that the LSA has just such an interest in the educational benefits that result from having a racially and ethnically diverse student body and that its program is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.  Respondent-intervenors asserted that the LSA had a compelling interest in remedying the Universitys past and current discrimination against minorities.

				The District Court began its analysis by reviewing this Courts decision in 
				<em>
					Bakke.  
				</em>
				See 122 F. Supp. 2d 811, 817 (ED Mich. 2001).  Although the court acknowledged that no decision from this Court since 
				<em>
					Bakke
				</em>
				 has explicitly accepted the diversity rationale discussed by Justice Powell, see 122 F. Supp. 2d, at 820821, it also concluded that this Court had not, in the years since 
				<em>
					Bakke
				</em>
				, ruled out such a justification for the use of race.  122 F. Supp. 2d, at 820821.  The District Court concluded that respondents and their 
				<em>
					amici curiae 
				</em>
				had presented solid evidence that a racially and ethnically diverse student body produces significant educational benefits such that achieving such a student body constitutes a compelling governmental interest.  See 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 822824.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The court next considered whether the LSAs admissions guidelines were narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.  See 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 824.  Again relying on Justice Powells opinion in 
				<em>
					Bakke
				</em>
				, the District Court determined that the admissions program the LSA began using in 1999 is a narrowly tailored means of achieving the Universitys interest in the educational benefits that flow from a racially and ethnically diverse student body.  See 122 F. Supp. 2d, at 827.  The court emphasized that the LSAs current program does not utilize rigid quotas or seek to admit a predetermined number of minority students.  See 
				<em>
					ibid
				</em>
				.  The award of 20 points for membership in an underrepresented minority group, in the District Courts view, was not the functional equivalent of a quota because minority candidates were not insulated from review by virtue of those points.  See 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 828.  Likewise, the court rejected the assertion that the LSAs program operates like the two-track system Justice Powell found objectionable in 
				<em>
					Bakke 
				</em>
				on the grounds that
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				LSA applicants are not competing for different groups of seats.  See 122 F. Supp. 2d, at 828829.  The court also dismissed petitioners assertion that the LSAs current system is nothing more than a means by which to achieve racial balancing.  See 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 831.  The court explained that the LSA does not seek to achieve a certain proportion of minority students, let alone a proportion that represents the community.  See 
				<em>
					ibid
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The District Court found the admissions guidelines the LSA used from 1995 through 1998 to be more problematic.  In the courts view, the Universitys prior practice of protecting or reserving seats for underrepresented minority applicants effectively kept nonprotected applicants from competing for those slots.  See 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 832.  This system, the court concluded, operated as the functional equivalent of a quota and ran afoul of Justice Powells opinion in

				<em>

				<em>
					Post,
				</em>
				 at 8.  In 
				<em>

				</em>

				<em>

After a class was certified, the plaintiffs obtained an order expanding class certification to include challenges to URC decisions to transfer patients to 
				<em>
					higher
				</em>
				 levels of care as well.  The defendants argued that the named representatives could not represent absent class members challenging transfers to higher levels of care because they had not been threatened with such transfers.  We agreed.  We noted that [n]othing in the record … suggests that any of the individual respondents have been either transferred to more intensive care or threatened with such transfers.  457 U. S., at 1001.  And we found that transfers to lower levels of care involved a number of fundamentally different concerns than did transfers to higher ones.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 10011002 (noting, for example, that transfers to lower levels of care implicated beneficiaries property interests given the concomitant decrease in Medicaid benefits, while transfers to higher levels of care did not).

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In the present case, the Universitys use of race in undergraduate transfer admissions does not implicate a significantly different set of concerns than does its use of race in undergraduate freshman admissions.  Respondents challenged Hamachers standing at the certification stage, but 
				<em>
					never
				</em>
				 did so on the grounds that the Universitys use of race in undergraduate transfer admissions involves a different set of concerns than does its use of race in freshman admissions.  Respondents failure to allege any such difference is simply consistent with the fact that no such difference exists.  Each year the OUA produces a document entitled COLLEGE OF LITERATURE SCIENCE AND THE ARTS GUIDELINES FOR ALL TERMS, which sets forth guidelines for all individuals seeking admission to the LSA, including freshman applicants, transfer applicants, international student applicants, and the like.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 2 App. in No. 011333 etc. (CA6), pp. 507542.  The guidelines used to evaluate transfer applicants specifically cross-reference factors and qualifications considered in assessing freshman applicants.  In fact, the criteria used to determine whether a transfer applicant will contribute to the Universitys stated goal of diversity are 
				<em>
					identical
				</em>
				 to that used to evaluate freshman applicants.  For example, in 1997, when the class was certified and the District Court found that Hamacher had standing to represent the class, the transfer guidelines contained a separate section entitled CONTRIBUTION TO A DIVERSE STUDENT BODY.  2 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 531.  This section explained that any transfer applicant who could 
				<em>
					contribut[e] to a diverse student body
				</em>
				 should generally be admitted even with substantially lower qualifications than those required of other transfer applicants.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				. (emphasis added).  To determine whether a transfer applicant was capable of contribut[ing] to a diverse student body, admissions counselors were instructed to determine whether that transfer applicant met the criteria as defined in Section IV of the U category of [the] SCUGA factors used to assess freshman applicants.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  Section IV of the U category, entitled Contribution to a Diverse Class, explained that [t]he University is committed to a rich educational experience for its students.  A diverse, as opposed to a homogenous, student population enhances the educational experience for all students.  To insure a diverse class, significant weight will be given in the admissions process to indicators of students contribution to a diverse class.  1 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 432.  These indicators, used in evaluating freshman and transfer applicants alike, list being a member of an underrepresented minority group as establishing an applicants contribution to diversity.  See 3 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 11331134, 11531154.  Indeed, the 
				<em>
					only 
				</em>
				difference between the Universitys use of race in considering freshman and transfer applicants is that all underrepresented minority freshman applicants receive 20 points and virtually all who are minimally qualified are admitted, while generally all minimally qualified minority transfer applicants are admitted outright.  While this difference might be relevant to a narrow tailoring analysis, it clearly has no effect on petitioners standing to challenge the Universitys use of race in undergraduate admissions and its assertion that diversity is a compelling state interest that justifies its consideration of the race of its undergraduate applicants.

Here, the District Court found that the sole rationale the University had provided for any of its race-based preferences in undergraduate admissions was the interest in the educational benefits that result from having a diverse student body.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 8a.  And petitioners argue that an interest in diversity is not a compelling state interest that is 
				<em>

				</em>
				 capable of justifying the use of race in undergraduate admissions.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g

				  We therefore agree with the District Courts carefully considered decision to certify this class-action challenge to the Universitys consideration of race in undergraduate admissions.
				  
				See App. 67 ( It is a singular policy … applied on a classwide basis ); cf.

 ([T]he class determination generally involves considerations that are enmeshed in the factual and legal issues comprising the plaintiffs cause of action (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Indeed, class action treatment was particularly important in this case because the claims of the individual students run the risk of becoming moot and the [t]he class action vehicle … provides a mechanism for ensuring that a justiciable claim is before the Court.  App. 69.
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				 Thus, we think it clear that Hamachers personal stake, in view of both his past injury and the potential injury he faced at the time of certification, demonstrates that he may maintain this class-action challenge to the Universitys use of race in undergraduate

				The current LSA policy does not provide such individualized consideration.  The LSAs policy automatically distributes 20 points to every single applicant from an underrepresented minority group, as defined by the University.  The only consideration that accompanies this distribution of points is a factual review of an application to determine whether an individual is a member of one of these minority groups.  Moreover, unlike Justice Powells example, where the race of a particular black applicant could be considered without being decisive, see 
				<em>
					Bakke
				</em>
				, 438 U. S., at 317, the LSAs automatic distribution of 20 points has the effect of making the factor of race … decisive for virtually every minimally qualified underrepresented minority applicant.

				Also instructive in our consideration of the LSAs system is the example provided in the description of the Harvard College Admissions Program, which Justice Powell both discussed in, and attached to, his opinion in

				The Admissions Committee, with only a few places left to fill, might find itself forced to choose between A, the child of a successful black physician in an academic community with promise of superior academic performance, and B, a black who grew up in an inner-city ghetto of semi-literate parents whose academic achievement was lower but who had demonstrated energy and leadership as well as an apparently abiding interest in black power.  If a good number of black students much like A but few like B had already been admitted, the Committee might prefer B; and vice versa.  If C, a white student with extraordinary artistic talent, were also seeking one of the remaining places, his unique quality might give him an edge over both A and B.  Thus, the critical criteria are often individual qualities or experience

        <p class="bodytext">
				
This example further demonstrates the problematic nature of the LSAs admissions system.  Even if student Cs extraordinary artistic talent rivaled that of Monet or Picasso, the applicant would receive, at most, five points under the LSAs system.  See App. 234235.  At the same time, every single underrepresented minority applicant, including students A and B, would automatically receive 20 points for submitting an application.  Clearly, the LSAs system does not offer applicants the individualized selection process described in Harvards example.  Instead of considering how the differing backgrounds, experiences, and characteristics of students A, B, and C might benefit the University, admissions counselors reviewing LSA applications would simply award both A and B 20 points because their applications indicate that they are African-American, and student C would receive up to 5 points for his extraordinary talent.

				Respondents emphasize the fact that the LSA has created the possibility of an applicants file being flagged for individualized consideration by the ARC.  We think that the flagging program only emphasizes the flaws of the Universitys system as a whole when compared to that described by Justice Powell.  Again, students A, B, and C illustrate the point.  First, student A would never be flagged.  This is because, as the University has conceded, the effect of automatically awarding 20 points is that virtually every qualified underrepresented minority applicant is admitted.  Student A, an applicant with promise of superior academic performance, would certainly fit this description.  Thus, the result of the automatic distribution of 20 points is that the University would never consider student As individual background, experiences, and characteristics to assess his individual potential contribution to diversity, 
				<em>
					Bakke, supra, 
				</em>
				at 317.  Instead, every applicant like student A would simply be admitted.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It is possible that students B and C would be flagged and considered as individuals.  This assumes that student B was not already admitted because of the automatic 20-point distribution, and that student C could muster at least 70 additional points.  But the fact that the review committee can look at the applications individually and ignore the points, once an application is flagged, Tr. of Oral Arg. 42, is of little comfort under our strict scrutiny analysis.  The record does not reveal precisely how many applications are flagged for this individualized consideration, but it is undisputed that such consideration is the exception and not the rule in the operation of the LSAs admissions program.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 117a (The ARC reviews only a portion of all of the applications.  The bulk of admissions decisions are executed based on selection index score parameters set by the EWG).

In 1996, only two tables were used, one for in-state applicants and one for out-of-state applicants.

						 Because the Universitys guidelines concededly use race in evaluating both freshman and transfer applications, and because petitioners have challenged any use of race by the University in undergraduate admissions, the transfer admissions policy is very much before this Court.  Although petitioners did not raise a narrow tailoring challenge to the transfer policy, as counsel for petitioners repeatedly explained, the transfer policy is before this Court in that petitioners challenged any use of race by the University to promote diversity, including through the transfer policy.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 4 ([T]he [transfer] policy is essentially the same with respect to the consideration of race); id., at 5 (The transfer policy considers race); id., at 6 (same); id., at 7 ([T]he transfer policy and the [freshman] admissions policy are fundamentally the same in the respect that they both consider race in the admissions process in a way that is discriminatory); id., at 78 ([T]he University considers race for a purpose to achieve a diversity that we believe is not compelling, and if that is struck down as a rationale, then the [result] would be [the] same with respect to the transfer policy as with respect to the [freshman] admissions policy, Your Honor).

				 the petitioners in this case had already enrolled at other schools before they filed their class-action complaint in this case.  Neither petitioner was in the process of reapplying to Michigan through the freshman admissions process at the time this suit was filed, and neither has done so since.  There is a total absence of evidence that either petitioner would receive any benefit from the prospective relief sought by their lawyer.  While some unidentified members of the class may very well have standing to seek prospective relief, it is clear that neither petitioner does.

				Petitioner Jennifer Gratz applied in 1994 for admission to the University of Michigans (University) College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (LSA) as an undergraduate for the 19951996 freshman class.  After the University delayed action on her application and then placed her name on an extended waiting list, Gratz decided to attend the University of Michigan at Dearborn instead; she graduated in 1999.  Petitioner Patrick Hamacher applied for admission to LSA as an undergraduate for the 19971998 freshman class.  After the University postponed decision on his application and then placed his name on an extended waiting list, he attended Michigan State University, graduating in 2001.  In the complaint that petitioners filed on October 14, 1997, Hamacher alleged that [h]e intends to apply to transfer [to the University of Michigan] if the discriminatory admissions system described herein is eliminated.  App. 34.

				At the class certification stage, petitioners sought to have Hamacher represent a class pursuant to Federal Rule Civil Procedure 23(b)(2).

				, at 67 (To the extent that plaintiff Hamacher reapplies to the University of Michigan, he will again face the same harm in that race will continue to be a factor in admissions).

				In subsequent proceedings, the District Court held that the 19951998 admissions system, which was in effect when both petitioners applications were denied, was unlawful but that Michigans new 19992000 admissions system was lawful.  When petitioners sought certiorari from this Court, Michigan did not cross-petition for review of the District Courts judgment concerning the admissions policies that Michigan had in place when Gratz and Hamacher applied for admission in 1994 and 1996 respectively.  See Brief for Respondents 5, n. 7.  Accordingly, we have before us only that portion of the District Courts judgment that upheld Michigans new freshman admissions policy.

				Even though there is not a scintilla of evidence that the freshman admissions program now being administered by respondents will ever have any impact on either Hamacher or Gratz, petitioners nonetheless argue that Hamacher has a personal stake in this suit because at the time the complaint was filed, Hamacher intended to apply to transfer to Michigan once certain admission policy changes occurred.

				  See App. 34; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 45.  Petitioners attempt to base Hamachers standing in this suit on a hypothetical transfer application fails for several reasons.  First, there is no evidence that Hamacher ever actually applied for admission as a transfer student at Michigan.  His claim of future injury is at best conjectural or hypothetical rather than real and immediate.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, as petitioners counsel conceded at oral argument, the transfer policy is not before this Court and was not addressed by the District Court.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 45 (admitting that [t]he transfer admissions policy itself is not before youthe Court).  Unlike the Universitys freshman policy, which is detailed at great length in the Joint Appendix filed with this Court, the specifics of the transfer policy are conspicuously missing from the Joint Appendix filed with this Court.  Furthermore, the transfer policy is not discussed anywhere in the parties briefs.  Nor is it ever even referenced in the District Courts Dec. 13, 2000, opinion that upheld Michigans new freshman admissions policy and struck down Michigans old policy.  Nonetheless, evidence filed with the District Court by Michigan demonstrates that the criteria used to evaluate transfer applications at Michigan differ significantly from the criteria used to evaluate freshman undergraduate applications.  Of special significance, Michigans 2000 freshman admissions policy, for example, provides for 20 points to be added to the selection index scores of minority applicants.
				  
				See
				 ante
				, at 23.
				 
				 In contrast, Michigan does not use points in its transfer policy; some applicants, including minority and socioeconomically disadvantaged applicants, will generally be admitted if they possess certain qualifications, including a 2.5 undergraduate grade point average (GPA), sophomore standing, and a 3.0 high school GPA.  10 Record 16 (Exh. C).  Because of these differences, Hamacher cannot base his right to complain about the 
				<em>
					freshman
				</em>
				 admissions policy on his hypothetical injury under a wholly separate 
				<em>
					transfer
				</em>
				 policy.  For [i]f the right to complain of 
				<em>
					one
				</em>
				 administrative deficiency automatically conferred the right to complain of 
				<em>
					all
				</em>
				 administrative deficiencies, any citizen aggrieved in one respect could bring the whole structure of state administration before the courts for review.

				Third, the differences between the freshman and the transfer admissions policies make it extremely unlikely, at best, that an injunction requiring respondents to modify the freshman admissions program would have any impact on Michigans transfer policy.  See 
				<em>

				<em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">222</a> (1974)
 ([T]he discrete factual context within which the concrete injury occurred or is threatened insures the framing of relief no broader than required by the precise facts to which the courts ruling would be applied).  This is especially true in light of petitioners unequivocal disavowal of any request for equitable relief that would totally preclude the use of race in the processing of all admissions applications.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 1415.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The majority asserts that petitioners have challenged 
				<em>
					any
				</em>
				 use of race by the University in undergraduate admissionsfreshman and transfer alike.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 18, n. 16 (emphasis in original).  Yet when questioned at oral argument about whether petitioners challenge would impact both private and public universities, petitioners counsel stated: Your Honor, I want to be clear about what it is that were arguing for here today.  
				<em>
					We are not suggesting an absolute rule forbidding any use of race under any circumstances.  
				</em>
				What we are arguing is that the interest asserted here by the University, this amorphous, ill-defined, unlimited interest in diversity is not a compelling interest.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 14 (emphasis added).  In addition, when asked whether petitioners took the position that the only permissible use of race is as a remedy for past discrimination, petitioners lawyer stated: I would not go that far. . . . [T]here may be other reasons. I think they would have to be extraordinary and rare… .  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 15.   Consistent with these statements, petitioners briefs filed with this Court attack the Universitys asserted interest in diversity but acknowledge that race could be considered for remedial reasons.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, Brief for Petitioners 1617.  
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Because Michigans transfer policy was not challenged by petitioners and is not before this Court, see 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 5, we do not know whether Michigan would defend its transfer policy on diversity grounds, or whether it might try to justify its transfer policy on other grounds, such as a remedial interest.  Petitioners counsel was therefore incorrect in asserting at oral argument that if the Universitys asserted interest in diversity were to be struck down as a rationale, then the law would be [the] same with respect to the transfer policy as with respect to the original [freshman admissions] policy.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 78.  And the majority is likewise mistaken in assuming that the Universitys use of race in undergraduate transfer admissions does not implicate a significantly different set of concerns than does its use of race in undergraduate freshman admissions.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 16.   Because the transfer policy has never been the subject of this suit, we simply do not know (1) whether Michigan would defend its transfer policy on diversity grounds or some other grounds, or (2) how the absence of a point system in the transfer policy might impact a narrow tailoring analysis of that policy.  
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				At bottom, petitioners interest in obtaining an injunction for the benefit of younger third parties is comparable to that of the unemancipated minor who had no standing to litigate on behalf of older women in 
				<em>
					H. L.
				</em>
				 v.

				<em>

				 v. 
				<em>

				It is true that the petitioners complaint was filed as a class action and that Hamacher has been certified as the representative of a class, some of whose members may well have standing to challenge the LSA freshman admissions program that is presently in effect.  But the fact that a suit may be a class action . . . adds nothing to the question of standing, for even named plaintiffs who represent a class must allege and show that they personally have been injured, not that injury has been suffered by other, unidentified members of the class to which they belong and which they purport to represent. 

The class representatives, however, were in the category of patients threatened with a transfer to less intensive care facilities.

						 In responding to questions about petitioners standing at oral argument, petitioners counsel alluded to the fact that Michigan might continually change the details of its admissions policy.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 9.  The change in Michigans freshman admissions policy, however, is not the reason why petitioners cannot establish standing to seek prospective relief.  Rather, the reason they lack standing to seek forward-looking relief is that when this suit was filed, neither faced a real and immediate threat of future injury under Michigans freshman admissions policy given that they had both already enrolled at other institutions.

						 Hamacher clearly can no longer claim an intent to transfer into Michigans undergraduate program given that he graduated from college in 2001.  However, this fact alone is not necessarily fatal to the instant class action because we have recognized that, if a named class representative has standing at the time a suit is initiated, class actions may proceed in some instances following mootness of the named class representatives claim.  See, e.g., Sosna v. Iowa, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/419/393" class="subref" title="subref">419 U. S. 393</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">402</a> (1975)

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/424/747" class="subref" title="subref">424 U. S. 747</a> (1976)
.  The problem in this case is that neither Gratz nor Hamacher had standing to assert a forward-looking, injunctive claim in federal court at the time this suit was initiated.

						 Under the majoritys view of standing, there would be no end to Hamachers ability to challenge any use of race by the University in a variety of programs.  For if Hamachers right to complain about the transfer policy gives him standing to challenge the freshman policy, presumably his ability to complain about the transfer policy likewise would enable him to challenge Michigans law school admissions policy, as well as any other race-based admissions policy used by Michigan.

				 the petitioners in this case had already enrolled at other schools before they filed their class-action complaint in this case.  Neither petitioner was in the process of reapplying to Michigan through the freshman admissions process at the time this suit was filed, and neither has done so since.  There is a total absence of evidence that either petitioner would receive any benefit from the prospective relief sought by their lawyer.  While some unidentified members of the class may very well have standing to seek prospective relief, it is clear that neither petitioner does.

				Petitioner Jennifer Gratz applied in 1994 for admission to the University of Michigans (University) College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (LSA) as an undergraduate for the 19951996 freshman class.  After the University delayed action on her application and then placed her name on an extended waiting list, Gratz decided to attend the University of Michigan at Dearborn instead; she graduated in 1999.  Petitioner Patrick Hamacher applied for admission to LSA as an undergraduate for the 19971998 freshman class.  After the University postponed decision on his application and then placed his name on an extended waiting list, he attended Michigan State University, graduating in 2001.  In the complaint that petitioners filed on October 14, 1997, Hamacher alleged that [h]e intends to apply to transfer [to the University of Michigan] if the discriminatory admissions system described herein is eliminated.  App. 34.

				, at 67 (To the extent that plaintiff Hamacher reapplies to the University of Michigan, he will again face the same harm in that race will continue to be a factor in admissions).

				In subsequent proceedings, the District Court held that the 19951998 admissions system, which was in effect when both petitioners applications were denied, was unlawful but that Michigans new 19992000 admissions system was lawful.  When petitioners sought certiorari from this Court, Michigan did not cross-petition for review of the District Courts judgment concerning the admissions policies that Michigan had in place when Gratz and Hamacher applied for admission in 1994 and 1996 respectively.  See Brief for Respondents 5, n. 7.  Accordingly, we have before us only that portion of the District Courts judgment that upheld Michigans new freshman admissions policy.

				Even though there is not a scintilla of evidence that the freshman admissions program now being administered by respondents will ever have any impact on either Hamacher or Gratz, petitioners nonetheless argue that Hamacher has a personal stake in this suit because at the time the complaint was filed, Hamacher intended to apply to transfer to Michigan once certain admission policy changes occurred.

				  See App. 34; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 45.  Petitioners attempt to base Hamachers standing in this suit on a hypothetical transfer application fails for several reasons.  First, there is no evidence that Hamacher ever actually applied for admission as a transfer student at Michigan.  His claim of future injury is at best conjectural or hypothetical rather than real and immediate.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, as petitioners counsel conceded at oral argument, the transfer policy is not before this Court and was not addressed by the District Court.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 45 (admitting that [t]he transfer admissions policy itself is not before youthe Court).  Unlike the Universitys freshman policy, which is detailed at great length in the Joint Appendix filed with this Court, the specifics of the transfer policy are conspicuously missing from the Joint Appendix filed with this Court.  Furthermore, the transfer policy is not discussed anywhere in the parties briefs.  Nor is it ever even referenced in the District Courts Dec. 13, 2000, opinion that upheld Michigans new freshman admissions policy and struck down Michigans old policy.  Nonetheless, evidence filed with the District Court by Michigan demonstrates that the criteria used to evaluate transfer applications at Michigan differ significantly from the criteria used to evaluate freshman undergraduate applications.  Of special significance, Michigans 2000 freshman admissions policy, for example, provides for 20 points to be added to the selection index scores of minority applicants.
				  
				See
				 ante
				, at 23.
				 
				 In contrast, Michigan does not use points in its transfer policy; some applicants, including minority and socioeconomically disadvantaged applicants, will generally be admitted if they possess certain qualifications, including a 2.5 undergraduate grade point average (GPA), sophomore standing, and a 3.0 high school GPA.  10 Record 16 (Exh. C).  Because of these differences, Hamacher cannot base his right to complain about the 
				<em>
					freshman
				</em>
				 admissions policy on his hypothetical injury under a wholly separate 
				<em>
					transfer
				</em>
				 policy.  For [i]f the right to complain of 
				<em>
					one
				</em>
				 administrative deficiency automatically conferred the right to complain of 
				<em>
					all
				</em>
				 administrative deficiencies, any citizen aggrieved in one respect could bring the whole structure of state administration before the courts for review.

				Third, the differences between the freshman and the transfer admissions policies make it extremely unlikely, at best, that an injunction requiring respondents to modify the freshman admissions program would have any impact on Michigans transfer policy.  See 
				<em>

				</em>

				<em>

 ([T]he discrete factual context within which the concrete injury occurred or is threatened insures the framing of relief no broader than required by the precise facts to which the courts ruling would be applied).  This is especially true in light of petitioners unequivocal disavowal of any request for equitable relief that would totally preclude the use of race in the processing of all admissions applications.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 1415.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The majority asserts that petitioners have challenged 
				<em>
					any
				</em>
				 use of race by the University in undergraduate admissionsfreshman and transfer alike.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 18, n. 16 (emphasis in original).  Yet when questioned at oral argument about whether petitioners challenge would impact both private and public universities, petitioners counsel stated: Your Honor, I want to be clear about what it is that were arguing for here today.  
				<em>
					We are not suggesting an absolute rule forbidding any use of race under any circumstances.  
				</em>
				What we are arguing is that the interest asserted here by the University, this amorphous, ill-defined, unlimited interest in diversity is not a compelling interest.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 14 (emphasis added).  In addition, when asked whether petitioners took the position that the only permissible use of race is as a remedy for past discrimination, petitioners lawyer stated: I would not go that far. . . . [T]here may be other reasons. I think they would have to be extraordinary and rare… .  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 15.   Consistent with these statements, petitioners briefs filed with this Court attack the Universitys asserted interest in diversity but acknowledge that race could be considered for remedial reasons.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, Brief for Petitioners 1617.  
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Because Michigans transfer policy was not challenged by petitioners and is not before this Court, see 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 5, we do not know whether Michigan would defend its transfer policy on diversity grounds, or whether it might try to justify its transfer policy on other grounds, such as a remedial interest.  Petitioners counsel was therefore incorrect in asserting at oral argument that if the Universitys asserted interest in diversity were to be struck down as a rationale, then the law would be [the] same with respect to the transfer policy as with respect to the original [freshman admissions] policy.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 78.  And the majority is likewise mistaken in assuming that the Universitys use of race in undergraduate transfer admissions does not implicate a significantly different set of concerns than does its use of race in undergraduate freshman admissions.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 16.   Because the transfer policy has never been the subject of this suit, we simply do not know (1) whether Michigan would defend its transfer policy on diversity grounds or some other grounds, or (2) how the absence of a point system in the transfer policy might impact a narrow tailoring analysis of that policy.

				It is true that the petitioners complaint was filed as a class action and that Hamacher has been certified as the representative of a class, some of whose members may well have standing to challenge the LSA freshman admissions program that is presently in effect.  But the fact that a suit may be a class action . . . adds nothing to the question of standing, for even named plaintiffs who represent a class must allege and show that they personally have been injured, not that injury has been suffered by other, unidentified members of the class to which they belong and which they purport to represent. 

Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.

						 In responding to questions about petitioners standing at oral argument, petitioners counsel alluded to the fact that Michigan might continually change the details of its admissions policy.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 9.  The change in Michigans freshman admissions policy, however, is not the reason why petitioners cannot establish standing to seek prospective relief.  Rather, the reason they lack standing to seek forward-looking relief is that when this suit was filed, neither faced a real and immediate threat of future injury under Michigans freshman admissions policy given that they had both already enrolled at other institutions.

						 Hamacher clearly can no longer claim an intent to transfer into Michigans undergraduate program given that he graduated from college in 2001.  However, this fact alone is not necessarily fatal to the instant class action because we have recognized that, if a named class representative has standing at the time a suit is initiated, class actions may proceed in some instances following mootness of the named class representatives claim.  See, e.g., Sosna v. Iowa, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/419/393" class="subref" title="subref">419 U. S. 393</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">402</a> (1975)

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/424/747" class="subref" title="subref">424 U. S. 747</a> (1976)
.  The problem in this case is that neither Gratz nor Hamacher had standing to assert a forward-looking, injunctive claim in federal court at the time this suit was initiated.

						 Under the majoritys view of standing, there would be no end to Hamachers ability to challenge any use of race by the University in a variety of programs.  For if Hamachers right to complain about the transfer policy gives him standing to challenge the freshman policy, presumably his ability to complain about the transfer policy likewise would enable him to challenge Michigans law school admissions policy, as well as any other race-based admissions policy used by Michigan.

				 the petitioners in this case had already enrolled at other schools before they filed their class-action complaint in this case.  Neither petitioner was in the process of reapplying to Michigan through the freshman admissions process at the time this suit was filed, and neither has done so since.  There is a total absence of evidence that either petitioner would receive any benefit from the prospective relief sought by their lawyer.  While some unidentified members of the class may very well have standing to seek prospective relief, it is clear that neither petitioner does.

				Petitioner Jennifer Gratz applied in 1994 for admission to the University of Michigans (University) College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (LSA) as an undergraduate for the 19951996 freshman class.  After the University delayed action on her application and then placed her name on an extended waiting list, Gratz decided to attend the University of Michigan at Dearborn instead; she graduated in 1999.  Petitioner Patrick Hamacher applied for admission to LSA as an undergraduate for the 19971998 freshman class.  After the University postponed decision on his application and then placed his name on an extended waiting list, he attended Michigan State University, graduating in 2001.  In the complaint that petitioners filed on October 14, 1997, Hamacher alleged that [h]e intends to apply to transfer [to the University of Michigan] if the discriminatory admissions system described herein is eliminated.  App. 34.

				, at 67 (To the extent that plaintiff Hamacher reapplies to the University of Michigan, he will again face the same harm in that race will continue to be a factor in admissions).

				In subsequent proceedings, the District Court held that the 19951998 admissions system, which was in effect when both petitioners applications were denied, was unlawful but that Michigans new 19992000 admissions system was lawful.  When petitioners sought certiorari from this Court, Michigan did not cross-petition for review of the District Courts judgment concerning the admissions policies that Michigan had in place when Gratz and Hamacher applied for admission in 1994 and 1996 respectively.  See Brief for Respondents 5, n. 7.  Accordingly, we have before us only that portion of the District Courts judgment that upheld Michigans new freshman admissions policy.

				Even though there is not a scintilla of evidence that the freshman admissions program now being administered by respondents will ever have any impact on either Hamacher or Gratz, petitioners nonetheless argue that Hamacher has a personal stake in this suit because at the time the complaint was filed, Hamacher intended to apply to transfer to Michigan once certain admission policy changes occurred.

				  See App. 34; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 45.  Petitioners attempt to base Hamachers standing in this suit on a hypothetical transfer application fails for several reasons.  First, there is no evidence that Hamacher ever actually applied for admission as a transfer student at Michigan.  His claim of future injury is at best conjectural or hypothetical rather than real and immediate.

.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, as petitioners counsel conceded at oral argument, the transfer policy is not before this Court and was not addressed by the District Court.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 45 (admitting that [t]he transfer admissions policy itself is not before youthe Court).  Unlike the Universitys freshman policy, which is detailed at great length in the Joint Appendix filed with this Court, the specifics of the transfer policy are conspicuously missing from the Joint Appendix filed with this Court.  Furthermore, the transfer policy is not discussed anywhere in the parties briefs.  Nor is it ever even referenced in the District Courts Dec. 13, 2000, opinion that upheld Michigans new freshman admissions policy and struck down Michigans old policy.  Nonetheless, evidence filed with the District Court by Michigan demonstrates that the criteria used to evaluate transfer applications at Michigan differ significantly from the criteria used to evaluate freshman undergraduate applications.  Of special significance, Michigans 2000 freshman admissions policy, for example, provides for 20 points to be added to the selection index scores of minority applicants.
				  
				See
				 ante
				, at 23.
				 
				 In contrast, Michigan does not use points in its transfer policy; some applicants, including minority and socioeconomically disadvantaged applicants, will generally be admitted if they possess certain qualifications, including a 2.5 undergraduate grade point average (GPA), sophomore standing, and a 3.0 high school GPA.  10 Record 16 (Exh. C).  Because of these differences, Hamacher cannot base his right to complain about the 
				<em>
					freshman
				</em>
				 admissions policy on his hypothetical injury under a wholly separate 
				<em>
					transfer
				</em>
				 policy.  For [i]f the right to complain of 
				<em>
					one
				</em>
				 administrative deficiency automatically conferred the right to complain of 
				<em>
					all
				</em>
				 administrative deficiencies, any citizen aggrieved in one respect could bring the whole structure of state administration before the courts for review.

				Third, the differences between the freshman and the transfer admissions policies make it extremely unlikely, at best, that an injunction requiring respondents to modify the freshman admissions program would have any impact on Michigans transfer policy.  See 
				<em>

				</em>

				<em>

 ([T]he discrete factual context within which the concrete injury occurred or is threatened insures the framing of relief no broader than required by the precise facts to which the courts ruling would be applied).  This is especially true in light of petitioners unequivocal disavowal of any request for equitable relief that would totally preclude the use of race in the processing of all admissions applications.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 1415.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The majority asserts that petitioners have challenged 
				<em>
					any
				</em>
				 use of race by the University in undergraduate admissionsfreshman and transfer alike.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 18, n. 16 (emphasis in original).  Yet when questioned at oral argument about whether petitioners challenge would impact both private and public universities, petitioners counsel stated: Your Honor, I want to be clear about what it is that were arguing for here today.  
				<em>
					We are not suggesting an absolute rule forbidding any use of race under any circumstances.  
				</em>
				What we are arguing is that the interest asserted here by the University, this amorphous, ill-defined, unlimited interest in diversity is not a compelling interest.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 14 (emphasis added).  In addition, when asked whether petitioners took the position that the only permissible use of race is as a remedy for past discrimination, petitioners lawyer stated: I would not go that far. . . . [T]here may be other reasons. I think they would have to be extraordinary and rare… .  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 15.   Consistent with these statements, petitioners briefs filed with this Court attack the Universitys asserted interest in diversity but acknowledge that race could be considered for remedial reasons.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, Brief for Petitioners 1617.  
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Because Michigans transfer policy was not challenged by petitioners and is not before this Court, see 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 5, we do not know whether Michigan would defend its transfer policy on diversity grounds, or whether it might try to justify its transfer policy on other grounds, such as a remedial interest.  Petitioners counsel was therefore incorrect in asserting at oral argument that if the Universitys asserted interest in diversity were to be struck down as a rationale, then the law would be [the] same with respect to the transfer policy as with respect to the original [freshman admissions] policy.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 78.  And the majority is likewise mistaken in assuming that the Universitys use of race in undergraduate transfer admissions does not implicate a significantly different set of concerns than does its use of race in undergraduate freshman admissions.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 16.   Because the transfer policy has never been the subject of this suit, we simply do not know (1) whether Michigan would defend its transfer policy on diversity grounds or some other grounds, or (2) how the absence of a point system in the transfer policy might impact a narrow tailoring analysis of that policy.

				It is true that the petitioners complaint was filed as a class action and that Hamacher has been certified as the representative of a class, some of whose members may well have standing to challenge the LSA freshman admissions program that is presently in effect.  But the fact that a suit may be a class action . . . adds nothing to the question of standing, for even named plaintiffs who represent a class must allege and show that they personally have been injured, not that injury has been suffered by other, unidentified members of the class to which they belong and which they purport to represent. 

						 In responding to questions about petitioners standing at oral argument, petitioners counsel alluded to the fact that Michigan might continually change the details of its admissions policy.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 9.  The change in Michigans freshman admissions policy, however, is not the reason why petitioners cannot establish standing to seek prospective relief.  Rather, the reason they lack standing to seek forward-looking relief is that when this suit was filed, neither faced a real and immediate threat of future injury under Michigans freshman admissions policy given that they had both already enrolled at other institutions.

						 Hamacher clearly can no longer claim an intent to transfer into Michigans undergraduate program given that he graduated from college in 2001.  However, this fact alone is not necessarily fatal to the instant class action because we have recognized that, if a named class representative has standing at the time a suit is initiated, class actions may proceed in some instances following mootness of the named class representatives claim.  See, e.g., Sosna v. Iowa, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/419/393" class="subref" title="subref">419 U. S. 393</a>,

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/424/747" class="subref" title="subref">424 U. S. 747</a> (1976)
.  The problem in this case is that neither Gratz nor Hamacher had standing to assert a forward-looking, injunctive claim in federal court at the time this suit was initiated.

						 Under the majoritys view of standing, there would be no end to Hamachers ability to challenge any use of race by the University in a variety of programs.  For if Hamachers right to complain about the transfer policy gives him standing to challenge the freshman policy, presumably his ability to complain about the transfer policy likewise would enable him to challenge Michigans law school admissions policy, as well as any other race-based admissions policy used by Michigan.

				 the petitioners in this case had already enrolled at other schools before they filed their class-action complaint in this case.  Neither petitioner was in the process of reapplying to Michigan through the freshman admissions process at the time this suit was filed, and neither has done so since.  There is a total absence of evidence that either petitioner would receive any benefit from the prospective relief sought by their lawyer.  While some unidentified members of the class may very well have standing to seek prospective relief, it is clear that neither petitioner does.

				Petitioner Jennifer Gratz applied in 1994 for admission to the University of Michigans (University) College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (LSA) as an undergraduate for the 19951996 freshman class.  After the University delayed action on her application and then placed her name on an extended waiting list, Gratz decided to attend the University of Michigan at Dearborn instead; she graduated in 1999.  Petitioner Patrick Hamacher applied for admission to LSA as an undergraduate for the 19971998 freshman class.  After the University postponed decision on his application and then placed his name on an extended waiting list, he attended Michigan State University, graduating in 2001.  In the complaint that petitioners filed on October 14, 1997, Hamacher alleged that [h]e intends to apply to transfer [to the University of Michigan] if the discriminatory admissions system described herein is eliminated.  App. 34.

				, at 67 (To the extent that plaintiff Hamacher reapplies to the University of Michigan, he will again face the same harm in that race will continue to be a factor in admissions).

				In subsequent proceedings, the District Court held that the 19951998 admissions system, which was in effect when both petitioners applications were denied, was unlawful but that Michigans new 19992000 admissions system was lawful.  When petitioners sought certiorari from this Court, Michigan did not cross-petition for review of the District Courts judgment concerning the admissions policies that Michigan had in place when Gratz and Hamacher applied for admission in 1994 and 1996 respectively.  See Brief for Respondents 5, n. 7.  Accordingly, we have before us only that portion of the District Courts judgment that upheld Michigans new freshman admissions policy.

				Even though there is not a scintilla of evidence that the freshman admissions program now being administered by respondents will ever have any impact on either Hamacher or Gratz, petitioners nonetheless argue that Hamacher has a personal stake in this suit because at the time the complaint was filed, Hamacher intended to apply to transfer to Michigan once certain admission policy changes occurred.

				  See App. 34; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 45.  Petitioners attempt to base Hamachers standing in this suit on a hypothetical transfer application fails for several reasons.  First, there is no evidence that Hamacher ever actually applied for admission as a transfer student at Michigan.  His claim of future injury is at best conjectural or hypothetical rather than real and immediate.

.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, as petitioners counsel conceded at oral argument, the transfer policy is not before this Court and was not addressed by the District Court.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 45 (admitting that [t]he transfer admissions policy itself is not before youthe Court).  Unlike the Universitys freshman policy, which is detailed at great length in the Joint Appendix filed with this Court, the specifics of the transfer policy are conspicuously missing from the Joint Appendix filed with this Court.  Furthermore, the transfer policy is not discussed anywhere in the parties briefs.  Nor is it ever even referenced in the District Courts Dec. 13, 2000, opinion that upheld Michigans new freshman admissions policy and struck down Michigans old policy.  Nonetheless, evidence filed with the District Court by Michigan demonstrates that the criteria used to evaluate transfer applications at Michigan differ significantly from the criteria used to evaluate freshman undergraduate applications.  Of special significance, Michigans 2000 freshman admissions policy, for example, provides for 20 points to be added to the selection index scores of minority applicants.
				  
				See
				 ante
				, at 23.
				 
				 In contrast, Michigan does not use points in its transfer policy; some applicants, including minority and socioeconomically disadvantaged applicants, will generally be admitted if they possess certain qualifications, including a 2.5 undergraduate grade point average (GPA), sophomore standing, and a 3.0 high school GPA.  10 Record 16 (Exh. C).  Because of these differences, Hamacher cannot base his right to complain about the 
				<em>
					freshman
				</em>
				 admissions policy on his hypothetical injury under a wholly separate 
				<em>
					transfer
				</em>
				 policy.  For [i]f the right to complain of 
				<em>
					one
				</em>
				 administrative deficiency automatically conferred the right to complain of 
				<em>
					all
				</em>
				 administrative deficiencies, any citizen aggrieved in one respect could bring the whole structure of state administration before the courts for review.

				Third, the differences between the freshman and the transfer admissions policies make it extremely unlikely, at best, that an injunction requiring respondents to modify the freshman admissions program would have any impact on Michigans transfer policy.  See

 ([T]he discrete factual context within which the concrete injury occurred or is threatened insures the framing of relief no broader than required by the precise facts to which the courts ruling would be applied).  This is especially true in light of petitioners unequivocal disavowal of any request for equitable relief that would totally preclude the use of race in the processing of all admissions applications.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 1415.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The majority asserts that petitioners have challenged 
				<em>
					any
				</em>
				 use of race by the University in undergraduate admissionsfreshman and transfer alike.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 18, n. 16 (emphasis in original).  Yet when questioned at oral argument about whether petitioners challenge would impact both private and public universities, petitioners counsel stated: Your Honor, I want to be clear about what it is that were arguing for here today.  
				<em>
					We are not suggesting an absolute rule forbidding any use of race under any circumstances.  
				</em>
				What we are arguing is that the interest asserted here by the University, this amorphous, ill-defined, unlimited interest in diversity is not a compelling interest.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 14 (emphasis added).  In addition, when asked whether petitioners took the position that the only permissible use of race is as a remedy for past discrimination, petitioners lawyer stated: I would not go that far. . . . [T]here may be other reasons. I think they would have to be extraordinary and rare… .  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 15.   Consistent with these statements, petitioners briefs filed with this Court attack the Universitys asserted interest in diversity but acknowledge that race could be considered for remedial reasons.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, Brief for Petitioners 1617.  
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Because Michigans transfer policy was not challenged by petitioners and is not before this Court, see 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 5, we do not know whether Michigan would defend its transfer policy on diversity grounds, or whether it might try to justify its transfer policy on other grounds, such as a remedial interest.  Petitioners counsel was therefore incorrect in asserting at oral argument that if the Universitys asserted interest in diversity were to be struck down as a rationale, then the law would be [the] same with respect to the transfer policy as with respect to the original [freshman admissions] policy.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 78.  And the majority is likewise mistaken in assuming that the Universitys use of race in undergraduate transfer admissions does not implicate a significantly different set of concerns than does its use of race in undergraduate freshman admissions.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 16.   Because the transfer policy has never been the subject of this suit, we simply do not know (1) whether Michigan would defend its transfer policy on diversity grounds or some other grounds, or (2) how the absence of a point system in the transfer policy might impact a narrow tailoring analysis of that policy.

The class representatives, however, were in the category of patients threatened with a transfer to less intensive care facilities.

						 In responding to questions about petitioners standing at oral argument, petitioners counsel alluded to the fact that Michigan might continually change the details of its admissions policy.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 9.  The change in Michigans freshman admissions policy, however, is not the reason why petitioners cannot establish standing to seek prospective relief.  Rather, the reason they lack standing to seek forward-looking relief is that when this suit was filed, neither faced a real and immediate threat of future injury under Michigans freshman admissions policy given that they had both already enrolled at other institutions.

						 Hamacher clearly can no longer claim an intent to transfer into Michigans undergraduate program given that he graduated from college in 2001.  However, this fact alone is not necessarily fatal to the instant class action because we have recognized that, if a named class representative has standing at the time a suit is initiated, class actions may proceed in some instances following mootness of the named class representatives claim.  See, e.g., Sosna v. Iowa, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/419/393" class="subref" title="subref">419 U. S. 393</a>,

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/424/747" class="subref" title="subref">424 U. S. 747</a> (1976)
.  The problem in this case is that neither Gratz nor Hamacher had standing to assert a forward-looking, injunctive claim in federal court at the time this suit was initiated.

						 Under the majoritys view of standing, there would be no end to Hamachers ability to challenge any use of race by the University in a variety of programs.  For if Hamachers right to complain about the transfer policy gives him standing to challenge the freshman policy, presumably his ability to complain about the transfer policy likewise would enable him to challenge Michigans law school admissions policy, as well as any other race-based admissions policy used by Michigan.

				 the petitioners in this case had already enrolled at other schools before they filed their class-action complaint in this case.  Neither petitioner was in the process of reapplying to Michigan through the freshman admissions process at the time this suit was filed, and neither has done so since.  There is a total absence of evidence that either petitioner would receive any benefit from the prospective relief sought by their lawyer.  While some unidentified members of the class may very well have standing to seek prospective relief, it is clear that neither petitioner does.

				Petitioner Jennifer Gratz applied in 1994 for admission to the University of Michigans (University) College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (LSA) as an undergraduate for the 19951996 freshman class.  After the University delayed action on her application and then placed her name on an extended waiting list, Gratz decided to attend the University of Michigan at Dearborn instead; she graduated in 1999.  Petitioner Patrick Hamacher applied for admission to LSA as an undergraduate for the 19971998 freshman class.  After the University postponed decision on his application and then placed his name on an extended waiting list, he attended Michigan State University, graduating in 2001.  In the complaint that petitioners filed on October 14, 1997, Hamacher alleged that [h]e intends to apply to transfer [to the University of Michigan] if the discriminatory admissions system described herein is eliminated.  App. 34.

				, at 67 (To the extent that plaintiff Hamacher reapplies to the University of Michigan, he will again face the same harm in that race will continue to be a factor in admissions).

				In subsequent proceedings, the District Court held that the 19951998 admissions system, which was in effect when both petitioners applications were denied, was unlawful but that Michigans new 19992000 admissions system was lawful.  When petitioners sought certiorari from this Court, Michigan did not cross-petition for review of the District Courts judgment concerning the admissions policies that Michigan had in place when Gratz and Hamacher applied for admission in 1994 and 1996 respectively.  See Brief for Respondents 5, n. 7.  Accordingly, we have before us only that portion of the District Courts judgment that upheld Michigans new freshman admissions policy.

				Even though there is not a scintilla of evidence that the freshman admissions program now being administered by respondents will ever have any impact on either Hamacher or Gratz, petitioners nonetheless argue that Hamacher has a personal stake in this suit because at the time the complaint was filed, Hamacher intended to apply to transfer to Michigan once certain admission policy changes occurred.

				  See App. 34; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 45.  Petitioners attempt to base Hamachers standing in this suit on a hypothetical transfer application fails for several reasons.  First, there is no evidence that Hamacher ever actually applied for admission as a transfer student at Michigan.  His claim of future injury is at best conjectural or hypothetical rather than real and immediate.

.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, as petitioners counsel conceded at oral argument, the transfer policy is not before this Court and was not addressed by the District Court.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 45 (admitting that [t]he transfer admissions policy itself is not before youthe Court).  Unlike the Universitys freshman policy, which is detailed at great length in the Joint Appendix filed with this Court, the specifics of the transfer policy are conspicuously missing from the Joint Appendix filed with this Court.  Furthermore, the transfer policy is not discussed anywhere in the parties briefs.  Nor is it ever even referenced in the District Courts Dec. 13, 2000, opinion that upheld Michigans new freshman admissions policy and struck down Michigans old policy.  Nonetheless, evidence filed with the District Court by Michigan demonstrates that the criteria used to evaluate transfer applications at Michigan differ significantly from the criteria used to evaluate freshman undergraduate applications.  Of special significance, Michigans 2000 freshman admissions policy, for example, provides for 20 points to be added to the selection index scores of minority applicants.
				  
				See
				 ante
				, at 23.
				 
				 In contrast, Michigan does not use points in its transfer policy; some applicants, including minority and socioeconomically disadvantaged applicants, will generally be admitted if they possess certain qualifications, including a 2.5 undergraduate grade point average (GPA), sophomore standing, and a 3.0 high school GPA.  10 Record 16 (Exh. C).  Because of these differences, Hamacher cannot base his right to complain about the 
				<em>
					freshman
				</em>
				 admissions policy on his hypothetical injury under a wholly separate 
				<em>
					transfer
				</em>
				 policy.  For [i]f the right to complain of 
				<em>
					one
				</em>
				 administrative deficiency automatically conferred the right to complain of 
				<em>
					all
				</em>
				 administrative deficiencies, any citizen aggrieved in one respect could bring the whole structure of state administration before the courts for review.

				Third, the differences between the freshman and the transfer admissions policies make it extremely unlikely, at best, that an injunction requiring respondents to modify the freshman admissions program would have any impact on Michigans transfer policy.  See

 ([T]he discrete factual context within which the concrete injury occurred or is threatened insures the framing of relief no broader than required by the precise facts to which the courts ruling would be applied).  This is especially true in light of petitioners unequivocal disavowal of any request for equitable relief that would totally preclude the use of race in the processing of all admissions applications.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 1415.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The majority asserts that petitioners have challenged 
				<em>
					any
				</em>
				 use of race by the University in undergraduate admissionsfreshman and transfer alike.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 18, n. 16 (emphasis in original).  Yet when questioned at oral argument about whether petitioners challenge would impact both private and public universities, petitioners counsel stated: Your Honor, I want to be clear about what it is that were arguing for here today.  
				<em>
					We are not suggesting an absolute rule forbidding any use of race under any circumstances.  
				</em>
				What we are arguing is that the interest asserted here by the University, this amorphous, ill-defined, unlimited interest in diversity is not a compelling interest.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 14 (emphasis added).  In addition, when asked whether petitioners took the position that the only permissible use of race is as a remedy for past discrimination, petitioners lawyer stated: I would not go that far. . . . [T]here may be other reasons. I think they would have to be extraordinary and rare… .  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 15.   Consistent with these statements, petitioners briefs filed with this Court attack the Universitys asserted interest in diversity but acknowledge that race could be considered for remedial reasons.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, Brief for Petitioners 1617.  
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Because Michigans transfer policy was not challenged by petitioners and is not before this Court, see 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 5, we do not know whether Michigan would defend its transfer policy on diversity grounds, or whether it might try to justify its transfer policy on other grounds, such as a remedial interest.  Petitioners counsel was therefore incorrect in asserting at oral argument that if the Universitys asserted interest in diversity were to be struck down as a rationale, then the law would be [the] same with respect to the transfer policy as with respect to the original [freshman admissions] policy.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 78.  And the majority is likewise mistaken in assuming that the Universitys use of race in undergraduate transfer admissions does not implicate a significantly different set of concerns than does its use of race in undergraduate freshman admissions.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 16.   Because the transfer policy has never been the subject of this suit, we simply do not know (1) whether Michigan would defend its transfer policy on diversity grounds or some other grounds, or (2) how the absence of a point system in the transfer policy might impact a narrow tailoring analysis of that policy.

				It is true that the petitioners complaint was filed as a class action and that Hamacher has been certified as the representative of a class, some of whose members may well have standing to challenge the LSA freshman admissions program that is presently in effect.  But the fact that a suit may be a class action . . . adds nothing to the question of standing, for even named plaintiffs who represent a class must allege and show that they personally have been injured, not that injury has been suffered by other, unidentified members of the class to which they belong and which they purport to represent. 

						 In responding to questions about petitioners standing at oral argument, petitioners counsel alluded to the fact that Michigan might continually change the details of its admissions policy.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 9.  The change in Michigans freshman admissions policy, however, is not the reason why petitioners cannot establish standing to seek prospective relief.  Rather, the reason they lack standing to seek forward-looking relief is that when this suit was filed, neither faced a real and immediate threat of future injury under Michigans freshman admissions policy given that they had both already enrolled at other institutions.

						 Hamacher clearly can no longer claim an intent to transfer into Michigans undergraduate program given that he graduated from college in 2001.  However, this fact alone is not necessarily fatal to the instant class action because we have recognized that, if a named class representative has standing at the time a suit is initiated, class actions may proceed in some instances following mootness of the named class representatives claim.  See, e.g., Sosna v. Iowa, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/419/393" class="subref" title="subref">419 U. S. 393</a>,

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/424/747" class="subref" title="subref">424 U. S. 747</a> (1976)
.  The problem in this case is that neither Gratz nor Hamacher had standing to assert a forward-looking, injunctive claim in federal court at the time this suit was initiated.

						 Under the majoritys view of standing, there would be no end to Hamachers ability to challenge any use of race by the University in a variety of programs.  For if Hamachers right to complain about the transfer policy gives him standing to challenge the freshman policy, presumably his ability to complain about the transfer policy likewise would enable him to challenge Michigans law school admissions policy, as well as any other race-based admissions policy used by Michigan.

				 the petitioners in this case had already enrolled at other schools before they filed their class-action complaint in this case.  Neither petitioner was in the process of reapplying to Michigan through the freshman admissions process at the time this suit was filed, and neither has done so since.  There is a total absence of evidence that either petitioner would receive any benefit from the prospective relief sought by their lawyer.

				Petitioner Jennifer Gratz applied in 1994 for admission to the University of Michigans (University) College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (LSA) as an undergraduate for the 19951996 freshman class.  After the University delayed action on her application and then placed her name on an extended waiting list, Gratz decided to attend the University of Michigan at Dearborn instead; she graduated in 1999.  Petitioner Patrick Hamacher applied for admission to LSA as an undergraduate for the 19971998 freshman class.  After the University postponed decision on his application and then placed his name on an extended waiting list, he attended Michigan State University, graduating in 2001.  In the complaint that petitioners filed on October 14, 1997, Hamacher alleged that [h]e intends to apply to transfer [to the University of Michigan] if the discriminatory admissions system described herein is eliminated.  App. 34.

				, at 67 (To the extent that plaintiff Hamacher reapplies to the University of Michigan, he will again face the same harm in that race will continue to be a factor in admissions).

				In subsequent proceedings, the District Court held that the 19951998 admissions system, which was in effect when both petitioners applications were denied, was unlawful but that Michigans new 19992000 admissions system was lawful.  When petitioners sought certiorari from this Court, Michigan did not cross-petition for review of the District Courts judgment concerning the admissions policies that Michigan had in place when Gratz and Hamacher applied for admission in 1994 and 1996 respectively.  See Brief for Respondents 5, n. 7.  Accordingly, we have before us only that portion of the District Courts judgment that upheld Michigans new freshman admissions policy.

				Even though there is not a scintilla of evidence that the freshman admissions program now being administered by respondents will ever have any impact on either Hamacher or Gratz, petitioners nonetheless argue that Hamacher has a personal stake in this suit because at the time the complaint was filed, Hamacher intended to apply to transfer to Michigan once certain admission policy changes occurred.

				  See App. 34; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 45.  Petitioners attempt to base Hamachers standing in this suit on a hypothetical transfer application fails for several reasons.  First, there is no evidence that Hamacher ever actually applied for admission as a transfer student at Michigan.  His claim of future injury is at best conjectural or hypothetical rather than real and immediate.

.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, as petitioners counsel conceded at oral argument, the transfer policy is not before this Court and was not addressed by the District Court.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 45 (admitting that [t]he transfer admissions policy itself is not before youthe Court).  Unlike the Universitys freshman policy, which is detailed at great length in the Joint Appendix filed with this Court, the specifics of the transfer policy are conspicuously missing from the Joint Appendix filed with this Court.  Furthermore, the transfer policy is not discussed anywhere in the parties briefs.  Nor is it ever even referenced in the District Courts Dec. 13, 2000, opinion that upheld Michigans new freshman admissions policy and struck down Michigans old policy.  Nonetheless, evidence filed with the District Court by Michigan demonstrates that the criteria used to evaluate transfer applications at Michigan differ significantly from the criteria used to evaluate freshman undergraduate applications.  Of special significance, Michigans 2000 freshman admissions policy, for example, provides for 20 points to be added to the selection index scores of minority applicants.
				  
				See
				 ante
				, at 23.
				 
				 In contrast, Michigan does not use points in its transfer policy; some applicants, including minority and socioeconomically disadvantaged applicants, will generally be admitted if they possess certain qualifications, including a 2.5 undergraduate grade point average (GPA), sophomore standing, and a 3.0 high school GPA.  10 Record 16 (Exh. C).  Because of these differences, Hamacher cannot base his right to complain about the 
				<em>
					freshman
				</em>
				 admissions policy on his hypothetical injury under a wholly separate 
				<em>
					transfer
				</em>
				 policy.  For [i]f the right to complain of 
				<em>
					one
				</em>
				 administrative deficiency automatically conferred the right to complain of 
				<em>
					all
				</em>
				 administrative deficiencies, any citizen aggrieved in one respect could bring the whole structure of state administration before the courts for review.

				Third, the differences between the freshman and the transfer admissions policies make it extremely unlikely, at best, that an injunction requiring respondents to modify the freshman admissions program would have any impact on Michigans transfer policy.  See

 ([T]he discrete factual context within which the concrete injury occurred or is threatened insures the framing of relief no broader than required by the precise facts to which the courts ruling would be applied).  This is especially true in light of petitioners unequivocal disavowal of any request for equitable relief that would totally preclude the use of race in the processing of all admissions applications.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 1415.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The majority asserts that petitioners have challenged 
				<em>
					any
				</em>
				 use of race by the University in undergraduate admissionsfreshman and transfer alike.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 18, n. 16 (emphasis in original).  Yet when questioned at oral argument about whether petitioners challenge would impact both private and public universities, petitioners counsel stated: Your Honor, I want to be clear about what it is that were arguing for here today.  
				<em>
					We are not suggesting an absolute rule forbidding any use of race under any circumstances.  
				</em>
				What we are arguing is that the interest asserted here by the University, this amorphous, ill-defined, unlimited interest in diversity is not a compelling interest.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 14 (emphasis added).  In addition, when asked whether petitioners took the position that the only permissible use of race is as a remedy for past discrimination, petitioners lawyer stated: I would not go that far. . . . [T]here may be other reasons. I think they would have to be extraordinary and rare… .  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 15.   Consistent with these statements, petitioners briefs filed with this Court attack the Universitys asserted interest in diversity but acknowledge that race could be considered for remedial reasons.  See, 
				<em>

				Because Michigans transfer policy was not challenged by petitioners and is not before this Court, see

				, at 5, we do not know whether Michigan would defend its transfer policy on diversity grounds, or whether it might try to justify its transfer policy on other grounds, such as a remedial interest.  Petitioners counsel was therefore incorrect in asserting at oral argument that if the Universitys asserted interest in diversity were to be struck down as a rationale, then the law would be [the] same with respect to the transfer policy as with respect to the original [freshman admissions] policy.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 78.

Because the transfer policy has never been the subject of this suit, we simply do not know (1) whether Michigan would defend its transfer policy on diversity grounds or some other grounds, or (2) how the absence of a point system in the transfer policy might impact a narrow tailoring analysis of that policy.

				It is true that the petitioners complaint was filed as a class action and that Hamacher has been certified as the representative of a class, some of whose members may well have standing to challenge the LSA freshman admissions program that is presently in effect.  But the fact that a suit may be a class action . . . adds nothing to the question of standing, for even named plaintiffs who represent a class must allege and show that they personally have been injured, not that injury has been suffered by other, unidentified members of the class to which they belong and which they purport to represent. 

						 In responding to questions about petitioners standing at oral argument, petitioners counsel alluded to the fact that Michigan might continually change the details of its admissions policy.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 9.  The change in Michigans freshman admissions policy, however, is not the reason why petitioners cannot establish standing to seek prospective relief.  Rather, the reason they lack standing to seek forward-looking relief is that when this suit was filed, neither faced a real and immediate threat of future injury under Michigans freshman admissions policy given that they had both already enrolled at other institutions.

						 Hamacher clearly can no longer claim an intent to transfer into Michigans undergraduate program given that he graduated from college in 2001.  However, this fact alone is not necessarily fatal to the instant class action because we have recognized that, if a named class representative has standing at the time a suit is initiated, class actions may proceed in some instances following mootness of the named class representatives claim.  See, e.g., Sosna v. Iowa, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/419/393" class="subref" title="subref">419 U. S. 393</a>,

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/424/747" class="subref" title="subref">424 U. S. 747</a> (1976)
.  The problem in this case is that neither Gratz nor Hamacher had standing to assert a forward-looking, injunctive claim in federal court at the time this suit was initiated.

						 Under the majoritys view of standing, there would be no end to Hamachers ability to challenge any use of race by the University in a variety of programs.  For if Hamachers right to complain about the transfer policy gives him standing to challenge the freshman policy, presumably his ability to complain about the transfer policy likewise would enable him to challenge Michigans law school admissions policy, as well as any other race-based admissions policy used by Michigan.

				Petitioner Jennifer Gratz applied in 1994 for admission to the University of Michigans (University) College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (LSA) as an undergraduate for the 19951996 freshman class.  After the University delayed action on her application and then placed her name on an extended waiting list, Gratz decided to attend the University of Michigan at Dearborn instead; she graduated in 1999.  Petitioner Patrick Hamacher applied for admission to LSA as an undergraduate for the 19971998 freshman class.  After the University postponed decision on his application and then placed his name on an extended waiting list, he attended Michigan State University, graduating in 2001.  In the complaint that petitioners filed on October 14, 1997, Hamacher alleged that [h]e intends to apply to transfer [to the University of Michigan] if the discriminatory admissions system described herein is eliminated.  App. 34.

				, at 67 (To the extent that plaintiff Hamacher reapplies to the University of Michigan, he will again face the same harm in that race will continue to be a factor in admissions).

				In subsequent proceedings, the District Court held that the 19951998 admissions system, which was in effect when both petitioners applications were denied, was unlawful but that Michigans new 19992000 admissions system was lawful.  When petitioners sought certiorari from this Court, Michigan did not cross-petition for review of the District Courts judgment concerning the admissions policies that Michigan had in place when Gratz and Hamacher applied for admission in 1994 and 1996 respectively.  See Brief for Respondents 5, n. 7.  Accordingly, we have before us only that portion of the District Courts judgment that upheld Michigans new freshman admissions policy.

				Even though there is not a scintilla of evidence that the freshman admissions program now being administered by respondents will ever have any impact on either Hamacher or Gratz, petitioners nonetheless argue that Hamacher has a personal stake in this suit because at the time the complaint was filed, Hamacher intended to apply to transfer to Michigan once certain admission policy changes occurred.

				  See App. 34; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 45.  Petitioners attempt to base Hamachers standing in this suit on a hypothetical transfer application fails for several reasons.  First, there is no evidence that Hamacher ever actually applied for admission as a transfer student at Michigan.  His claim of future injury is at best conjectural or hypothetical rather than real and immediate.

				Second, as petitioners counsel conceded at oral argument, the transfer policy is not before this Court and was not addressed by the District Court.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 45 (admitting that [t]he transfer admissions policy itself is not before youthe Court).  Unlike the Universitys freshman policy, which is detailed at great length in the Joint Appendix filed with this Court, the specifics of the transfer policy are conspicuously missing from the Joint Appendix filed with this Court.  Furthermore, the transfer policy is not discussed anywhere in the parties briefs.  Nor is it ever even referenced in the District Courts Dec. 13, 2000, opinion that upheld Michigans new freshman admissions policy and struck down Michigans old policy.  Nonetheless, evidence filed with the District Court by Michigan demonstrates that the criteria used to evaluate transfer applications at Michigan differ significantly from the criteria used to evaluate freshman undergraduate applications.  Of special significance, Michigans 2000 freshman admissions policy, for example, provides for 20 points to be added to the selection index scores of minority applicants.
				  
				See
				 ante
				, at 23.
				 
				 In contrast, Michigan does not use points in its transfer policy; some applicants, including minority and socioeconomically disadvantaged applicants, will generally be admitted if they possess certain qualifications, including a 2.5 undergraduate grade point average (GPA), sophomore standing, and a 3.0 high school GPA.  10 Record 16 (Exh. C).  Because of these differences, Hamacher cannot base his right to complain about the 
				<em>
					freshman
				</em>
				 admissions policy on his hypothetical injury under a wholly separate 
				<em>
					transfer
				</em>
				 policy.  For [i]f the right to complain of 
				<em>
					one
				</em>
				 administrative deficiency automatically conferred the right to complain of 
				<em>
					all
				</em>
				 administrative deficiencies, any citizen aggrieved in one respect could bring the whole structure of state administration before the courts for review.

 ([T]he discrete factual context within which the concrete injury occurred or is threatened insures the framing of relief no broader than required by the precise facts to which the courts ruling would be applied).  This is especially true in light of petitioners unequivocal disavowal of any request for equitable relief that would totally preclude the use of race in the processing of all admissions applications.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 1415.

				The majority asserts that petitioners have challenged

				 use of race by the University in undergraduate admissionsfreshman and transfer alike.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 18, n. 16 (emphasis in original).  Yet when questioned at oral argument about whether petitioners challenge would impact both private and public universities, petitioners counsel stated: Your Honor, I want to be clear about what it is that were arguing for here today.  
				<em>
					We are not suggesting an absolute rule forbidding any use of race under any circumstances.  
				</em>
				What we are arguing is that the interest asserted here by the University, this amorphous, ill-defined, unlimited interest in diversity is not a compelling interest.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 14 (emphasis added).  In addition, when asked whether petitioners took the position that the only permissible use of race is as a remedy for past discrimination, petitioners lawyer stated: I would not go that far. . . . [T]here may be other reasons. I think they would have to be extraordinary and rare… .  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 15.   Consistent with these statements, petitioners briefs filed with this Court attack the Universitys asserted interest in diversity but acknowledge that race could be considered for remedial reasons.  See,

				Because Michigans transfer policy was not challenged by petitioners and is not before this Court, see 
				<em>

				, at 5, we do not know whether Michigan would defend its transfer policy on diversity grounds, or whether it might try to justify its transfer policy on other grounds, such as a remedial interest.  Petitioners counsel was therefore incorrect in asserting at oral argument that if the Universitys asserted interest in diversity were to be struck down as a rationale, then the law would be [the] same with respect to the transfer policy as with respect to the original [freshman admissions] policy.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 78.  And the majority is likewise mistaken in assuming that the Universitys use of race in undergraduate transfer admissions does not implicate a significantly different set of concerns than does its use of race in undergraduate freshman admissions.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 16.   Because the transfer policy has never been the subject of this suit, we simply do not know (1) whether Michigan would defend its transfer policy on diversity grounds or some other grounds, or (2) how the absence of a point system in the transfer policy might impact a narrow tailoring analysis of that policy.

				It is true that the petitioners complaint was filed as a class action and that Hamacher has been certified as the representative of a class, some of whose members may well have standing to challenge the LSA freshman admissions program that is presently in effect.  But the fact that a suit may be a class action . . . adds nothing to the question of standing, for even named plaintiffs who represent a class must allege and show that they personally have been injured, not that injury has been suffered by other, unidentified members of the class to which they belong and which they purport to represent. 

						 In responding to questions about petitioners standing at oral argument, petitioners counsel alluded to the fact that Michigan might continually change the details of its admissions policy.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 9.  The change in Michigans freshman admissions policy, however, is not the reason why petitioners cannot establish standing to seek prospective relief.  Rather, the reason they lack standing to seek forward-looking relief is that when this suit was filed, neither faced a real and immediate threat of future injury under Michigans freshman admissions policy given that they had both already enrolled at other institutions.

						 Hamacher clearly can no longer claim an intent to transfer into Michigans undergraduate program given that he graduated from college in 2001.  However, this fact alone is not necessarily fatal to the instant class action because we have recognized that, if a named class representative has standing at the time a suit is initiated, class actions may proceed in some instances following mootness of the named class representatives claim.  See, e.g., Sosna v. Iowa, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/419/393" class="subref" title="subref">419 U. S. 393</a>,

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/424/747" class="subref" title="subref">424 U. S. 747</a> (1976)
.  The problem in this case is that neither Gratz nor Hamacher had standing to assert a forward-looking, injunctive claim in federal court at the time this suit was initiated.

						 Under the majoritys view of standing, there would be no end to Hamachers ability to challenge any use of race by the University in a variety of programs.  For if Hamachers right to complain about the transfer policy gives him standing to challenge the freshman policy, presumably his ability to complain about the transfer policy likewise would enable him to challenge Michigans law school admissions policy, as well as any other race-based admissions policy used by Michigan.

				Petitioner Jennifer Gratz applied in 1994 for admission to the University of Michigans (University) College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (LSA) as an undergraduate for the 19951996 freshman class.  After the University delayed action on her application and then placed her name on an extended waiting list, Gratz decided to attend the University of Michigan at Dearborn instead; she graduated in 1999.  Petitioner Patrick Hamacher applied for admission to LSA as an undergraduate for the 19971998 freshman class.  After the University postponed decision on his application and then placed his name on an extended waiting list, he attended Michigan State University, graduating in 2001.  In the complaint that petitioners filed on October 14, 1997, Hamacher alleged that [h]e intends to apply to transfer [to the University of Michigan] if the discriminatory admissions system described herein is eliminated.  App. 34.

				In subsequent proceedings, the District Court held that the 19951998 admissions system, which was in effect when both petitioners applications were denied, was unlawful but that Michigans new 19992000 admissions system was lawful.  When petitioners sought certiorari from this Court, Michigan did not cross-petition for review of the District Courts judgment concerning the admissions policies that Michigan had in place when Gratz and Hamacher applied for admission in 1994 and 1996 respectively.  See Brief for Respondents 5, n. 7.  Accordingly, we have before us only that portion of the District Courts judgment that upheld Michigans new freshman admissions policy.

				Even though there is not a scintilla of evidence that the freshman admissions program now being administered by respondents will ever have any impact on either Hamacher or Gratz, petitioners nonetheless argue that Hamacher has a personal stake in this suit because at the time the complaint was filed, Hamacher intended to apply to transfer to Michigan once certain admission policy changes occurred.

				  See App. 34; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 45.  Petitioners attempt to base Hamachers standing in this suit on a hypothetical transfer application fails for several reasons.  First, there is no evidence that Hamacher ever actually applied for admission as a transfer student at Michigan.  His claim of future injury is at best conjectural or hypothetical rather than real and immediate.

				Second, as petitioners counsel conceded at oral argument, the transfer policy is not before this Court and was not addressed by the District Court.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 45 (admitting that [t]he transfer admissions policy itself is not before youthe Court).  Unlike the Universitys freshman policy, which is detailed at great length in the Joint Appendix filed with this Court, the specifics of the transfer policy are conspicuously missing from the Joint Appendix filed with this Court.  Furthermore, the transfer policy is not discussed anywhere in the parties briefs.  Nor is it ever even referenced in the District Courts Dec. 13, 2000, opinion that upheld Michigans new freshman admissions policy and struck down Michigans old policy.  Nonetheless, evidence filed with the District Court by Michigan demonstrates that the criteria used to evaluate transfer applications at Michigan differ significantly from the criteria used to evaluate freshman undergraduate applications.  Of special significance, Michigans 2000 freshman admissions policy, for example, provides for 20 points to be added to the selection index scores of minority applicants.
				  
				See
				 ante
				, at 23.
				 
				 In contrast, Michigan does not use points in its transfer policy; some applicants, including minority and socioeconomically disadvantaged applicants, will generally be admitted if they possess certain qualifications, including a 2.5 undergraduate grade point average (GPA), sophomore standing, and a 3.0 high school GPA.  10 Record 16 (Exh. C).  Because of these differences, Hamacher cannot base his right to complain about the 
				<em>
					freshman
				</em>
				 admissions policy on his hypothetical injury under a wholly separate 
				<em>
					transfer
				</em>
				 policy.  For [i]f the right to complain of 
				<em>
					one
				</em>
				 administrative deficiency automatically conferred the right to complain of 
				<em>
					all
				</em>
				 administrative deficiencies, any citizen aggrieved in one respect could bring the whole structure of state administration before the courts for review.

				<em>
					We are not suggesting an absolute rule forbidding any use of race under any circumstances.  
				</em>
				What we are arguing is that the interest asserted here by the University, this amorphous, ill-defined, unlimited interest in diversity is not a compelling interest.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 14 (emphasis added).  In addition, when asked whether petitioners took the position that the only permissible use of race is as a remedy for past discrimination, petitioners lawyer stated: I would not go that far. . . . [T]here may be other reasons. I think they would have to be extraordinary and rare… .  
				<em>
					Id.

				Because Michigans transfer policy was not challenged by petitioners and is not before this Court, see

Petitioners counsel was therefore incorrect in asserting at oral argument that if the Universitys asserted interest in diversity were to be struck down as a rationale, then the law would be [the] same with respect to the transfer policy as with respect to the original [freshman admissions] policy.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 78.  And the majority is likewise mistaken in assuming that the Universitys use of race in undergraduate transfer admissions does not implicate a significantly different set of concerns than does its use of race in undergraduate freshman admissions.  
				<em>
					Ante

				, at 16.   Because the transfer policy has never been the subject of this suit, we simply do not know (1) whether Michigan would defend its transfer policy on diversity grounds or some other grounds, or (2) how the absence of a point system in the transfer policy might impact a narrow tailoring analysis of that policy.

But the fact that a suit may be a class action . . . adds nothing to the question of standing, for even named plaintiffs who represent a class must allege and show that they personally have been injured, not that injury has been suffered by other, unidentified members of the class to which they belong and which they purport to represent. 

						 In responding to questions about petitioners standing at oral argument, petitioners counsel alluded to the fact that Michigan might continually change the details of its admissions policy.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 9.  The change in Michigans freshman admissions policy, however, is not the reason why petitioners cannot establish standing to seek prospective relief.  Rather, the reason they lack standing to seek forward-looking relief is that when this suit was filed, neither faced a real and immediate threat of future injury under Michigans freshman admissions policy given that they had both already enrolled at other institutions.

						 Hamacher clearly can no longer claim an intent to transfer into Michigans undergraduate program given that he graduated from college in 2001.  However, this fact alone is not necessarily fatal to the instant class action because we have recognized that, if a named class representative has standing at the time a suit is initiated, class actions may proceed in some instances following mootness of the named class representatives claim.  See, e.g., Sosna v. Iowa, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/419/393" class="subref" title="subref">419 U. S. 393</a>,

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/424/747" class="subref" title="subref">424 U. S. 747</a> (1976)
.  The problem in this case is that neither Gratz nor Hamacher had standing to assert a forward-looking, injunctive claim in federal court at the time this suit was initiated.

						 Under the majoritys view of standing, there would be no end to Hamachers ability to challenge any use of race by the University in a variety of programs.  For if Hamachers right to complain about the transfer policy gives him standing to challenge the freshman policy, presumably his ability to complain about the transfer policy likewise would enable him to challenge Michigans law school admissions policy, as well as any other race-based admissions policy used by Michigan.

				Petitioner Jennifer Gratz applied in 1994 for admission to the University of Michigans (University) College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (LSA) as an undergraduate for the 19951996 freshman class.  After the University delayed action on her application and then placed her name on an extended waiting list, Gratz decided to attend the University of Michigan at Dearborn instead; she graduated in 1999.  Petitioner Patrick Hamacher applied for admission to LSA as an undergraduate for the 19971998 freshman class.  After the University postponed decision on his application and then placed his name on an extended waiting list, he attended Michigan State University, graduating in 2001.  In the complaint that petitioners filed on October 14, 1997, Hamacher alleged that [h]e intends to apply to transfer [to the University of Michigan] if the discriminatory admissions system described herein is eliminated.  App. 34.

				In subsequent proceedings, the District Court held that the 19951998 admissions system, which was in effect when both petitioners applications were denied, was unlawful but that Michigans new 19992000 admissions system was lawful.  When petitioners sought certiorari from this Court, Michigan did not cross-petition for review of the District Courts judgment concerning the admissions policies that Michigan had in place when Gratz and Hamacher applied for admission in 1994 and 1996 respectively.  See Brief for Respondents 5, n. 7.  Accordingly, we have before us only that portion of the District Courts judgment that upheld Michigans new freshman admissions policy.

				Even though there is not a scintilla of evidence that the freshman admissions program now being administered by respondents will ever have any impact on either Hamacher or Gratz, petitioners nonetheless argue that Hamacher has a personal stake in this suit because at the time the complaint was filed, Hamacher intended to apply to transfer to Michigan once certain admission policy changes occurred.

				  See App. 34; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 45.  Petitioners attempt to base Hamachers standing in this suit on a hypothetical transfer application fails for several reasons.  First, there is no evidence that Hamacher ever actually applied for admission as a transfer student at Michigan.

				Second, as petitioners counsel conceded at oral argument, the transfer policy is not before this Court and was not addressed by the District Court.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 45 (admitting that [t]he transfer admissions policy itself is not before youthe Court).  Unlike the Universitys freshman policy, which is detailed at great length in the Joint Appendix filed with this Court, the specifics of the transfer policy are conspicuously missing from the Joint Appendix filed with this Court.  Furthermore, the transfer policy is not discussed anywhere in the parties briefs.  Nor is it ever even referenced in the District Courts Dec. 13, 2000, opinion that upheld Michigans new freshman admissions policy and struck down Michigans old policy.  Nonetheless, evidence filed with the District Court by Michigan demonstrates that the criteria used to evaluate transfer applications at Michigan differ significantly from the criteria used to evaluate freshman undergraduate applications.  Of special significance, Michigans 2000 freshman admissions policy, for example, provides for 20 points to be added to the selection index scores of minority applicants.
				  
				See
				 ante
				, at 23.
				 
				 In contrast, Michigan does not use points in its transfer policy; some applicants, including minority and socioeconomically disadvantaged applicants, will generally be admitted if they possess certain qualifications, including a 2.5 undergraduate grade point average (GPA), sophomore standing, and a 3.0 high school GPA.  10 Record 16 (Exh. C).  Because of these differences, Hamacher cannot base his right to complain about the 
				<em>
					freshman
				</em>
				 admissions policy on his hypothetical injury under a wholly separate 
				<em>
					transfer
				</em>
				 policy.  For [i]f the right to complain of 
				<em>
					one
				</em>
				 administrative deficiency automatically conferred the right to complain of 
				<em>
					all
				</em>
				 administrative deficiencies, any citizen aggrieved in one respect could bring the whole structure of state administration before the courts for review.

This is especially true in light of petitioners unequivocal disavowal of any request for equitable relief that would totally preclude the use of race in the processing of all admissions applications.

				<em>

				<em>
					We are not suggesting an absolute rule forbidding any use of race under any circumstances.  
				</em>
				What we are arguing is that the interest asserted here by the University, this amorphous, ill-defined, unlimited interest in diversity is not a compelling interest.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 14 (emphasis added).  In addition, when asked whether petitioners took the position that the only permissible use of race is as a remedy for past discrimination, petitioners lawyer stated: I would not go that far. . . . [T]here may be other reasons. I think they would have to be extraordinary and rare… .  
				<em>
					Id.

				, Brief for Petitioners 1617.

				Because Michigans transfer policy was not challenged by petitioners and is not before this Court, see

				, at 5, we do not know whether Michigan would defend its transfer policy on diversity grounds, or whether it might try to justify its transfer policy on other grounds, such as a remedial interest.  Petitioners counsel was therefore incorrect in asserting at oral argument that if the Universitys asserted interest in diversity were to be struck down as a rationale, then the law would be [the] same with respect to the transfer policy as with respect to the original [freshman admissions] policy.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 78.  And the majority is likewise mistaken in assuming that the Universitys use of race in undergraduate transfer admissions does not implicate a significantly different set of concerns than does its use of race in undergraduate freshman admissions.  
				<em>
					Ante

				, at 16.   Because the transfer policy has never been the subject of this suit, we simply do not know (1) whether Michigan would defend its transfer policy on diversity grounds or some other grounds, or (2) how the absence of a point system in the transfer policy might impact a narrow tailoring analysis of that policy.

But the fact that a suit may be a class action . . . adds nothing to the question of standing, for even named plaintiffs who represent a class must allege and show that they personally have been injured, not that injury has been suffered by other, unidentified members of the class to which they belong and which they purport to represent. 

						 In responding to questions about petitioners standing at oral argument, petitioners counsel alluded to the fact that Michigan might continually change the details of its admissions policy.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 9.  The change in Michigans freshman admissions policy, however, is not the reason why petitioners cannot establish standing to seek prospective relief.  Rather, the reason they lack standing to seek forward-looking relief is that when this suit was filed, neither faced a real and immediate threat of future injury under Michigans freshman admissions policy given that they had both already enrolled at other institutions.

						 Hamacher clearly can no longer claim an intent to transfer into Michigans undergraduate program given that he graduated from college in 2001.  However, this fact alone is not necessarily fatal to the instant class action because we have recognized that, if a named class representative has standing at the time a suit is initiated, class actions may proceed in some instances following mootness of the named class representatives claim.  See, e.g., Sosna v. Iowa, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/419/393" class="subref" title="subref">419 U. S. 393</a>,

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/424/747" class="subref" title="subref">424 U. S. 747</a> (1976)

						 Under the majoritys view of standing, there would be no end to Hamachers ability to challenge any use of race by the University in a variety of programs.  For if Hamachers right to complain about the transfer policy gives him standing to challenge the freshman policy, presumably his ability to complain about the transfer policy likewise would enable him to challenge Michigans law school admissions policy, as well as any other race-based admissions policy used by Michigan.

				Petitioner Jennifer Gratz applied in 1994 for admission to the University of Michigans (University) College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (LSA) as an undergraduate for the 19951996 freshman class.  After the University delayed action on her application and then placed her name on an extended waiting list, Gratz decided to attend the University of Michigan at Dearborn instead; she graduated in 1999.  Petitioner Patrick Hamacher applied for admission to LSA as an undergraduate for the 19971998 freshman class.  After the University postponed decision on his application and then placed his name on an extended waiting list, he attended Michigan State University, graduating in 2001.  In the complaint that petitioners filed on October 14, 1997, Hamacher alleged that [h]e intends to apply to transfer [to the University of Michigan] if the discriminatory admissions system described herein is eliminated.  App. 34.

				In subsequent proceedings, the District Court held that the 19951998 admissions system, which was in effect when both petitioners applications were denied, was unlawful but that Michigans new 19992000 admissions system was lawful.  When petitioners sought certiorari from this Court, Michigan did not cross-petition for review of the District Courts judgment concerning the admissions policies that Michigan had in place when Gratz and Hamacher applied for admission in 1994 and 1996 respectively.

				  See App. 34; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 45.  Petitioners attempt to base Hamachers standing in this suit on a hypothetical transfer application fails for several reasons.  First, there is no evidence that Hamacher ever actually applied for admission as a transfer student at Michigan.  His claim of future injury is at best conjectural or hypothetical rather than real and immediate.

				Second, as petitioners counsel conceded at oral argument, the transfer policy is not before this Court and was not addressed by the District Court.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 45 (admitting that [t]he transfer admissions policy itself is not before youthe Court).  Unlike the Universitys freshman policy, which is detailed at great length in the Joint Appendix filed with this Court, the specifics of the transfer policy are conspicuously missing from the Joint Appendix filed with this Court.  Furthermore, the transfer policy is not discussed anywhere in the parties briefs.  Nor is it ever even referenced in the District Courts Dec. 13, 2000, opinion that upheld Michigans new freshman admissions policy and struck down Michigans old policy.  Nonetheless, evidence filed with the District Court by Michigan demonstrates that the criteria used to evaluate transfer applications at Michigan differ significantly from the criteria used to evaluate freshman undergraduate applications.  Of special significance, Michigans 2000 freshman admissions policy, for example, provides for 20 points to be added to the selection index scores of minority applicants.
				  
				See
				 ante
				, at 23.
				 
				 In contrast, Michigan does not use points in its transfer policy; some applicants, including minority and socioeconomically disadvantaged applicants, will generally be admitted if they possess certain qualifications, including a 2.5 undergraduate grade point average (GPA), sophomore standing, and a 3.0 high school GPA.  10 Record 16 (Exh. C).  Because of these differences, Hamacher cannot base his right to complain about the 
				<em>
					freshman
				</em>
				 admissions policy on his hypothetical injury under a wholly separate 
				<em>
					transfer
				</em>
				 policy.  For [i]f the right to complain of 
				<em>
					one
				</em>
				 administrative deficiency automatically conferred the right to complain of 
				<em>
					all
				</em>
				 administrative deficiencies, any citizen aggrieved in one respect could bring the whole structure of state administration before the courts for review.

				Third, the differences between the freshman and the transfer admissions policies make it extremely unlikely, at best, that an injunction requiring respondents to modify the freshman admissions program would have any impact on Michigans transfer policy.  See

 ([T]he discrete factual context within which the concrete injury occurred or is threatened insures the framing of relief no broader than required by the precise facts to which the courts ruling would be applied).  This is especially true in light of petitioners unequivocal disavowal of any request for equitable relief that would totally preclude the use of race in the processing of all admissions applications.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 1415.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The majority asserts that petitioners have challenged 
				<em>
					any
				</em>
				 use of race by the University in undergraduate admissionsfreshman and transfer alike.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 18, n. 16 (emphasis in original).  Yet when questioned at oral argument about whether petitioners challenge would impact both private and public universities, petitioners counsel stated: Your Honor, I want to be clear about what it is that were arguing for here today.  
				<em>
					We are not suggesting an absolute rule forbidding any use of race under any circumstances.  
				</em>
				What we are arguing is that the interest asserted here by the University, this amorphous, ill-defined, unlimited interest in diversity is not a compelling interest.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 14 (emphasis added).  In addition, when asked whether petitioners took the position that the only permissible use of race is as a remedy for past discrimination, petitioners lawyer stated: I would not go that far. . . . [T]here may be other reasons. I think they would have to be extraordinary and rare… .  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 15.   Consistent with these statements, petitioners briefs filed with this Court attack the Universitys asserted interest in diversity but acknowledge that race could be considered for remedial reasons.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, Brief for Petitioners 1617.  
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Because Michigans transfer policy was not challenged by petitioners and is not before this Court, see 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 5, we do not know whether Michigan would defend its transfer policy on diversity grounds, or whether it might try to justify its transfer policy on other grounds, such as a remedial interest.  Petitioners counsel was therefore incorrect in asserting at oral argument that if the Universitys asserted interest in diversity were to be struck down as a rationale, then the law would be [the] same with respect to the transfer policy as with respect to the original [freshman admissions] policy.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 78.  And the majority is likewise mistaken in assuming that the Universitys use of race in undergraduate transfer admissions does not implicate a significantly different set of concerns than does its use of race in undergraduate freshman admissions.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 16.   Because the transfer policy has never been the subject of this suit, we simply do not know (1) whether Michigan would defend its transfer policy on diversity grounds or some other grounds, or (2) how the absence of a point system in the transfer policy might impact a narrow tailoring analysis of that policy.

				It is true that the petitioners complaint was filed as a class action and that Hamacher has been certified as the representative of a class, some of whose members may well have standing to challenge the LSA freshman admissions program that is presently in effect.  But the fact that a suit may be a class action . . . adds nothing to the question of standing, for even named plaintiffs who represent a class must allege and show that they personally have been injured, not that injury has been suffered by other, unidentified members of the class to which they belong and which they purport to represent. 

				  Thus, in

				<em>

The class representatives, however, were in the category of patients threatened with a transfer to less intensive care facilities.

				Respondents suggest that members of the class they represent have been transferred to higher levels of care as a result of [utilization review committee] decisions.

						 In responding to questions about petitioners standing at oral argument, petitioners counsel alluded to the fact that Michigan might continually change the details of its admissions policy.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 9.  The change in Michigans freshman admissions policy, however, is not the reason why petitioners cannot establish standing to seek prospective relief.  Rather, the reason they lack standing to seek forward-looking relief is that when this suit was filed, neither faced a real and immediate threat of future injury under Michigans freshman admissions policy given that they had both already enrolled at other institutions.

						 Hamacher clearly can no longer claim an intent to transfer into Michigans undergraduate program given that he graduated from college in 2001.  However, this fact alone is not necessarily fatal to the instant class action because we have recognized that, if a named class representative has standing at the time a suit is initiated, class actions may proceed in some instances following mootness of the named class representatives claim.  See, e.g., Sosna v. Iowa, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/419/393" class="subref" title="subref">419 U. S. 393</a>,

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/424/747" class="subref" title="subref">424 U. S. 747</a> (1976)
.  The problem in this case is that neither Gratz nor Hamacher had standing to assert a forward-looking, injunctive claim in federal court at the time this suit was initiated.

						 Under the majoritys view of standing, there would be no end to Hamachers ability to challenge any use of race by the University in a variety of programs.  For if Hamachers right to complain about the transfer policy gives him standing to challenge the freshman policy, presumably his ability to complain about the transfer policy likewise would enable him to challenge Michigans law school admissions policy, as well as any other race-based admissions policy used by Michigan.

				Petitioner Jennifer Gratz applied in 1994 for admission to the University of Michigans (University) College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (LSA) as an undergraduate for the 19951996 freshman class.  After the University delayed action on her application and then placed her name on an extended waiting list, Gratz decided to attend the University of Michigan at Dearborn instead; she graduated in 1999.  Petitioner Patrick Hamacher applied for admission to LSA as an undergraduate for the 19971998 freshman class.  After the University postponed decision on his application and then placed his name on an extended waiting list, he attended Michigan State University, graduating in 2001.  In the complaint that petitioners filed on October 14, 1997, Hamacher alleged that [h]e intends to apply to transfer [to the University of Michigan] if the discriminatory admissions system described herein is eliminated.  App. 34.

				In subsequent proceedings, the District Court held that the 19951998 admissions system, which was in effect when both petitioners applications were denied, was unlawful but that Michigans new 19992000 admissions system was lawful.  When petitioners sought certiorari from this Court, Michigan did not cross-petition for review of the District Courts judgment concerning the admissions policies that Michigan had in place when Gratz and Hamacher applied for admission in 1994 and 1996 respectively.  See Brief for Respondents 5, n. 7.  Accordingly, we have before us only that portion of the District Courts judgment that upheld Michigans new freshman admissions policy.

				Even though there is not a scintilla of evidence that the freshman admissions program now being administered by respondents will ever have any impact on either Hamacher or Gratz, petitioners nonetheless argue that Hamacher has a personal stake in this suit because at the time the complaint was filed, Hamacher intended to apply to transfer to Michigan once certain admission policy changes occurred.

				  See App. 34; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 45.  Petitioners attempt to base Hamachers standing in this suit on a hypothetical transfer application fails for several reasons.  First, there is no evidence that Hamacher ever actually applied for admission as a transfer student at Michigan.  His claim of future injury is at best conjectural or hypothetical rather than real and immediate.

				Second, as petitioners counsel conceded at oral argument, the transfer policy is not before this Court and was not addressed by the District Court.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 45 (admitting that [t]he transfer admissions policy itself is not before youthe Court).  Unlike the Universitys freshman policy, which is detailed at great length in the Joint Appendix filed with this Court, the specifics of the transfer policy are conspicuously missing from the Joint Appendix filed with this Court.  Furthermore, the transfer policy is not discussed anywhere in the parties briefs.  Nor is it ever even referenced in the District Courts Dec. 13, 2000, opinion that upheld Michigans new freshman admissions policy and struck down Michigans old policy.  Nonetheless, evidence filed with the District Court by Michigan demonstrates that the criteria used to evaluate transfer applications at Michigan differ significantly from the criteria used to evaluate freshman undergraduate applications.  Of special significance, Michigans 2000 freshman admissions policy, for example, provides for 20 points to be added to the selection index scores of minority applicants.
				  
				See
				 ante
				, at 23.
				 
				 In contrast, Michigan does not use points in its transfer policy; some applicants, including minority and socioeconomically disadvantaged applicants, will generally be admitted if they possess certain qualifications, including a 2.5 undergraduate grade point average (GPA), sophomore standing, and a 3.0 high school GPA.  10 Record 16 (Exh. C).  Because of these differences, Hamacher cannot base his right to complain about the 
				<em>
					freshman
				</em>
				 admissions policy on his hypothetical injury under a wholly separate 
				<em>
					transfer
				</em>
				 policy.  For [i]f the right to complain of 
				<em>
					one
				</em>
				 administrative deficiency automatically conferred the right to complain of 
				<em>
					all
				</em>
				 administrative deficiencies, any citizen aggrieved in one respect could bring the whole structure of state administration before the courts for review.

				Third, the differences between the freshman and the transfer admissions policies make it extremely unlikely, at best, that an injunction requiring respondents to modify the freshman admissions program would have any impact on Michigans transfer policy.  See

 ([T]he discrete factual context within which the concrete injury occurred or is threatened insures the framing of relief no broader than required by the precise facts to which the courts ruling would be applied).  This is especially true in light of petitioners unequivocal disavowal of any request for equitable relief that would totally preclude the use of race in the processing of all admissions applications.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 1415.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The majority asserts that petitioners have challenged 
				<em>
					any
				</em>
				 use of race by the University in undergraduate admissionsfreshman and transfer alike.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 18, n. 16 (emphasis in original).  Yet when questioned at oral argument about whether petitioners challenge would impact both private and public universities, petitioners counsel stated: Your Honor, I want to be clear about what it is that were arguing for here today.  
				<em>
					We are not suggesting an absolute rule forbidding any use of race under any circumstances.  
				</em>
				What we are arguing is that the interest asserted here by the University, this amorphous, ill-defined, unlimited interest in diversity is not a compelling interest.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 14 (emphasis added).  In addition, when asked whether petitioners took the position that the only permissible use of race is as a remedy for past discrimination, petitioners lawyer stated: I would not go that far. . . . [T]here may be other reasons. I think they would have to be extraordinary and rare… .  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 15.   Consistent with these statements, petitioners briefs filed with this Court attack the Universitys asserted interest in diversity but acknowledge that race could be considered for remedial reasons.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, Brief for Petitioners 1617.  
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Because Michigans transfer policy was not challenged by petitioners and is not before this Court, see 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 5, we do not know whether Michigan would defend its transfer policy on diversity grounds, or whether it might try to justify its transfer policy on other grounds, such as a remedial interest.  Petitioners counsel was therefore incorrect in asserting at oral argument that if the Universitys asserted interest in diversity were to be struck down as a rationale, then the law would be [the] same with respect to the transfer policy as with respect to the original [freshman admissions] policy.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 78.  And the majority is likewise mistaken in assuming that the Universitys use of race in undergraduate transfer admissions does not implicate a significantly different set of concerns than does its use of race in undergraduate freshman admissions.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 16.   Because the transfer policy has never been the subject of this suit, we simply do not know (1) whether Michigan would defend its transfer policy on diversity grounds or some other grounds, or (2) how the absence of a point system in the transfer policy might impact a narrow tailoring analysis of that policy.

				It is true that the petitioners complaint was filed as a class action and that Hamacher has been certified as the representative of a class, some of whose members may well have standing to challenge the LSA freshman admissions program that is presently in effect.  But the fact that a suit may be a class action . . . adds nothing to the question of standing, for even named plaintiffs who represent a class must allege and show that they personally have been injured, not that injury has been suffered by other, unidentified members of the class to which they belong and which they purport to represent. 

The class representatives, however, were in the category of patients threatened with a transfer to less intensive care facilities.

				Respondents suggest that members of the class they represent have been transferred to higher levels of care as a result of [utilization review committee] decisions.

						 In responding to questions about petitioners standing at oral argument, petitioners counsel alluded to the fact that Michigan might continually change the details of its admissions policy.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 9.  The change in Michigans freshman admissions policy, however, is not the reason why petitioners cannot establish standing to seek prospective relief.  Rather, the reason they lack standing to seek forward-looking relief is that when this suit was filed, neither faced a real and immediate threat of future injury under Michigans freshman admissions policy given that they had both already enrolled at other institutions.

						 Hamacher clearly can no longer claim an intent to transfer into Michigans undergraduate program given that he graduated from college in 2001.  However, this fact alone is not necessarily fatal to the instant class action because we have recognized that, if a named class representative has standing at the time a suit is initiated, class actions may proceed in some instances following mootness of the named class representatives claim.  See, e.g., Sosna v. Iowa, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/419/393" class="subref" title="subref">419 U. S. 393</a>,

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/424/747" class="subref" title="subref">424 U. S. 747</a> (1976)

						 Under the majoritys view of standing, there would be no end to Hamachers ability to challenge any use of race by the University in a variety of programs.  For if Hamachers right to complain about the transfer policy gives him standing to challenge the freshman policy, presumably his ability to complain about the transfer policy likewise would enable him to challenge Michigans law school admissions policy, as well as any other race-based admissions policy used by Michigan.

				Petitioner Jennifer Gratz applied in 1994 for admission to the University of Michigans (University) College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (LSA) as an undergraduate for the 19951996 freshman class.  After the University delayed action on her application and then placed her name on an extended waiting list, Gratz decided to attend the University of Michigan at Dearborn instead; she graduated in 1999.  Petitioner Patrick Hamacher applied for admission to LSA as an undergraduate for the 19971998 freshman class.  After the University postponed decision on his application and then placed his name on an extended waiting list, he attended Michigan State University, graduating in 2001.  In the complaint that petitioners filed on October 14, 1997, Hamacher alleged that [h]e intends to apply to transfer [to the University of Michigan] if the discriminatory admissions system described herein is eliminated.  App. 34.

When petitioners sought certiorari from this Court, Michigan did not cross-petition for review of the District Courts judgment concerning the admissions policies that Michigan had in place when Gratz and Hamacher applied for admission in 1994 and 1996 respectively.  See Brief for Respondents 5, n. 7.  Accordingly, we have before us only that portion of the District Courts judgment that upheld Michigans new freshman admissions policy.

				Both Hamacher and Gratz, of course, have standing to seek damages as compensation for the alleged wrongful denial of their respective applications under Michigans old freshman admissions system.  However, like the plaintiff in

				Even though there is not a scintilla of evidence that the freshman admissions program now being administered by respondents will ever have any impact on either Hamacher or Gratz, petitioners nonetheless argue that Hamacher has a personal stake in this suit because at the time the complaint was filed, Hamacher intended to apply to transfer to Michigan once certain admission policy changes occurred.

				  See App. 34; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 45.  Petitioners attempt to base Hamachers standing in this suit on a hypothetical transfer application fails for several reasons.  First, there is no evidence that Hamacher ever actually applied for admission as a transfer student at Michigan.  His claim of future injury is at best conjectural or hypothetical rather than real and immediate.

				Second, as petitioners counsel conceded at oral argument, the transfer policy is not before this Court and was not addressed by the District Court.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 45 (admitting that [t]he transfer admissions policy itself is not before youthe Court).  Unlike the Universitys freshman policy, which is detailed at great length in the Joint Appendix filed with this Court, the specifics of the transfer policy are conspicuously missing from the Joint Appendix filed with this Court.  Furthermore, the transfer policy is not discussed anywhere in the parties briefs.  Nor is it ever even referenced in the District Courts Dec. 13, 2000, opinion that upheld Michigans new freshman admissions policy and struck down Michigans old policy.  Nonetheless, evidence filed with the District Court by Michigan demonstrates that the criteria used to evaluate transfer applications at Michigan differ significantly from the criteria used to evaluate freshman undergraduate applications.  Of special significance, Michigans 2000 freshman admissions policy, for example, provides for 20 points to be added to the selection index scores of minority applicants.
				  
				See
				 ante
				, at 23.
				 
				 In contrast, Michigan does not use points in its transfer policy; some applicants, including minority and socioeconomically disadvantaged applicants, will generally be admitted if they possess certain qualifications, including a 2.5 undergraduate grade point average (GPA), sophomore standing, and a 3.0 high school GPA.  10 Record 16 (Exh. C).  Because of these differences, Hamacher cannot base his right to complain about the 
				<em>
					freshman
				</em>
				 admissions policy on his hypothetical injury under a wholly separate 
				<em>
					transfer
				</em>
				 policy.  For [i]f the right to complain of 
				<em>
					one
				</em>
				 administrative deficiency automatically conferred the right to complain of 
				<em>
					all
				</em>
				 administrative deficiencies, any citizen aggrieved in one respect could bring the whole structure of state administration before the courts for review.

				Third, the differences between the freshman and the transfer admissions policies make it extremely unlikely, at best, that an injunction requiring respondents to modify the freshman admissions program would have any impact on Michigans transfer policy.  See 
				<em>

				<em>

 ([T]he discrete factual context within which the concrete injury occurred or is threatened insures the framing of relief no broader than required by the precise facts to which the courts ruling would be applied).  This is especially true in light of petitioners unequivocal disavowal of any request for equitable relief that would totally preclude the use of race in the processing of all admissions applications.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 1415.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The majority asserts that petitioners have challenged 
				<em>
					any
				</em>
				 use of race by the University in undergraduate admissionsfreshman and transfer alike.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 18, n. 16 (emphasis in original).  Yet when questioned at oral argument about whether petitioners challenge would impact both private and public universities, petitioners counsel stated: Your Honor, I want to be clear about what it is that were arguing for here today.  
				<em>
					We are not suggesting an absolute rule forbidding any use of race under any circumstances.  
				</em>
				What we are arguing is that the interest asserted here by the University, this amorphous, ill-defined, unlimited interest in diversity is not a compelling interest.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 14 (emphasis added).  In addition, when asked whether petitioners took the position that the only permissible use of race is as a remedy for past discrimination, petitioners lawyer stated: I would not go that far. . . . [T]here may be other reasons. I think they would have to be extraordinary and rare… .  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 15.   Consistent with these statements, petitioners briefs filed with this Court attack the Universitys asserted interest in diversity but acknowledge that race could be considered for remedial reasons.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, Brief for Petitioners 1617.  
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Because Michigans transfer policy was not challenged by petitioners and is not before this Court, see 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 5, we do not know whether Michigan would defend its transfer policy on diversity grounds, or whether it might try to justify its transfer policy on other grounds, such as a remedial interest.  Petitioners counsel was therefore incorrect in asserting at oral argument that if the Universitys asserted interest in diversity were to be struck down as a rationale, then the law would be [the] same with respect to the transfer policy as with respect to the original [freshman admissions] policy.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 78.  And the majority is likewise mistaken in assuming that the Universitys use of race in undergraduate transfer admissions does not implicate a significantly different set of concerns than does its use of race in undergraduate freshman admissions.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 16.   Because the transfer policy has never been the subject of this suit, we simply do not know (1) whether Michigan would defend its transfer policy on diversity grounds or some other grounds, or (2) how the absence of a point system in the transfer policy might impact a narrow tailoring analysis of that policy.

				It is true that the petitioners complaint was filed as a class action and that Hamacher has been certified as the representative of a class, some of whose members may well have standing to challenge the LSA freshman admissions program that is presently in effect.  But the fact that a suit may be a class action . . . adds nothing to the question of standing, for even named plaintiffs who represent a class must allege and show that they personally have been injured, not that injury has been suffered by other, unidentified members of the class to which they belong and which they purport to represent. 

The class representatives, however, were in the category of patients threatened with a transfer to less intensive care facilities.

				Respondents suggest that members of the class they represent have been transferred to higher levels of care as a result of [utilization review committee] decisions.

						 In responding to questions about petitioners standing at oral argument, petitioners counsel alluded to the fact that Michigan might continually change the details of its admissions policy.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 9.  The change in Michigans freshman admissions policy, however, is not the reason why petitioners cannot establish standing to seek prospective relief.  Rather, the reason they lack standing to seek forward-looking relief is that when this suit was filed, neither faced a real and immediate threat of future injury under Michigans freshman admissions policy given that they had both already enrolled at other institutions.

						 Hamacher clearly can no longer claim an intent to transfer into Michigans undergraduate program given that he graduated from college in 2001.  However, this fact alone is not necessarily fatal to the instant class action because we have recognized that, if a named class representative has standing at the time a suit is initiated, class actions may proceed in some instances following mootness of the named class representatives claim.  See, e.g., Sosna v. Iowa, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/419/393" class="subref" title="subref">419 U. S. 393</a>,

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/424/747" class="subref" title="subref">424 U. S. 747</a> (1976)
.  The problem in this case is that neither Gratz nor Hamacher had standing to assert a forward-looking, injunctive claim in federal court at the time this suit was initiated.

						 Under the majoritys view of standing, there would be no end to Hamachers ability to challenge any use of race by the University in a variety of programs.  For if Hamachers right to complain about the transfer policy gives him standing to challenge the freshman policy, presumably his ability to complain about the transfer policy likewise would enable him to challenge Michigans law school admissions policy, as well as any other race-based admissions policy used by Michigan.

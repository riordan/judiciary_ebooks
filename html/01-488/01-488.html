				At the trial of petitioner Timothy Ring for murder, armed robbery, and related charges, the prosecutor presented evidence sufficient to permit the jury to find the facts here recounted.  On November 28, 1994, a Wells Fargo armored van pulled up to the Dillards department store at Arrowhead Mall in Glendale, Arizona.  Tr. 57, 6061 (Nov. 14, 1996).  Courier Dave Moss left the van to pick up money inside the store.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 61, 7374.  When he returned, the van, and its driver, John Magoch, were gone. 
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 6162.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Later that day, Maricopa County Sheriffs Deputies found the vanits doors locked and its engine runningin the parking lot of a church in Sun City, Arizona.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 99100 (Nov. 13, 1996).  Inside the vehicle they found Magoch, dead from a single gunshot to the head.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 101.  According to Wells Fargo records, more than $562,000 in cash and $271,000 in checks were missing from the van.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 10 (Nov. 18, 1996).  
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Prompted by an informants tip, Glendale police sought to determine whether Ring and his friend James Greenham were involved in the robbery.  The police investigation revealed that the two had made several expensive cash purchases in December 1994 and early 1995.  
				<em>
					E.g.

				, 
				<em>

				, at 153156 (Nov. 14, 1996);  
				<em>
					id.

				, at 9094 (Nov. 21, 1996).  Wiretaps were then placed on the telephones of Ring, Greenham, and a third suspect, William Ferguson.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 1921 (Nov. 18, 1996).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In one recorded phone conversation, Ring told Ferguson that Ring might cu[t] off Greenham because [h]es too much of a risk: Greenham had indiscreetly flaunted a new truck in front of his ex-wife.  States Exh. 49A, pp. 1112.  Ring said he could cut off his associate because he held both [Greenhams] and mine.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 11.  The police engineered a local news broadcast about the robbery investigation; they included in the account several intentional inaccuracies.  Tr. 35, 1314 (Nov. 19, 1996).  On hearing the broadcast report, Ring left a message on Greenhams answering machine to remind me to talk to you tomorrow and tell you about what was on the news tonight.  Very important, and also fairly good.  States Exh. 55A, p. 2.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				After a detective left a note on Greenhams door asking him to call, Tr. 115118 (Nov. 18, 1996), Ring told Ferguson that he was puzzled by the attention the police trained on Greenham.  [H]is house is clean, Ring said; [m]ine, on the other hand, contains a very large bag.  States Exh. 70A, p. 7.  
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				On February 14, 1995, police furnished a staged reenactment of the robbery to the local news, and again included deliberate inaccuracies.  Tr. 5 (Nov. 19, 1996).  Ferguson told Ring that he laughed when he saw the broadcast, and Ring called it humorous.  States Exh. 80A, p. 3.  Ferguson said he was not real worried at all now; Ring, however, said he was slightly concern[ed] about the possibility that the police might eventually ask for hair samples.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 34.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Two days later, the police executed a search warrant at Rings house, discovering a duffel bag in his garage containing more than $271,000 in cash.  Tr. 107108, 111, 125 (Nov. 20, 1996).  They also found a note with the number 575,995 on it, followed by the word splits and the letters F, Y, and T.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 127130.  The prosecution asserted that F was Ferguson, Y was Yoda (Greenhams nickname), and T was Timothy Ring.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 42 (Dec. 5, 1996).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Testifying in his own defense, Ring said the money seized at his house was startup capital for a construction company he and Greenham were planning to form.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 1011 (Dec. 3, 1996).  Ring testified that he made his share of the money as a confidential informant for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and as a bail bondsman and gunsmith.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 162, 166167, 180 (Dec. 2, 1996).  But an FBI agent testified that Ring had been paid only $458, 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 47 (Nov. 20, 1996), and other evidence showed that Ring had made no more than $8,800 as a bail bondsman, 
				<em>

				The trial judge instructed the jury on alternative charges of premeditated murder and felony murder.  The jury deadlocked on premeditated murder, with 6 of 12 jurors voting to acquit, but convicted Ring of felony murder occurring in the course of armed robbery.  See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §131105(A) and (B) (West 2001) (A person commits first degree murder if … [a]cting either alone or with one or more other persons the person commits or attempts to commit … [one of several enumerated felonies] … and in the course of and in furtherance of the offense or immediate flight from the offense, the person or another person causes the death of any person. … Homicide, as prescribed in [this provision] requires no specific mental state other than what is required for the commission of any of the enumerated felonies.). 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				As later summed up by the Arizona Supreme Court, the evidence admitted at trial failed to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that [Ring] was a major participant in the armed robbery or that he actually murdered Magoch.  200 Ariz. 267, 280, 25 P. 3d 1139, 1152 (2001).  Although clear evidence connected Ring to the robberys proceeds, nothing submitted at trial put him at the scene of the robbery.  See 
				<em>
					ibid.  
				</em>
				Furthermore, [f]or all we know from the trial evidence, the Arizona court stated, [Ring] did not participate in, plan, or even expect the killing.  This lack of evidence no doubt explains why the jury found [Ring] guilty of felony, but not premeditated, murder.

        <p class="bodytext">
				

 
				    
				Under Arizona law, Ring could not be sentenced to death, the statutory maximum penalty for first-degree murder, unless further findings were made.  The States first-degree murder statute prescribes that the offense is punishable by death or life imprisonment as provided by §13703.  Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §131105(C) (West 2001).  The cross-referenced section, §13703, directs the judge who presided at trial to conduct a separate sentencing hearing to determine the existence or nonexistence of [certain enumerated] circumstances … for the purpose
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				of determining the sentence to be imposed.  §13703(C) (West Supp. 2001).  The statute further instructs: The hearing shall be conducted before the court alone.  The court alone shall make all factual determinations required by this section or the constitution of the United States or this state.

				Between Rings trial and sentencing hearing, Greenham pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and armed robbery.  He stipulated to a 27½ year sentence and agreed to cooperate with the prosecution in the cases against Ring and Ferguson.  Tr. 3537 (Oct. 9, 1997).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Called by the prosecution at Rings sentencing hearing, Greenham testified that he, Ring, and Ferguson had been planning the robbery for several weeks before it occurred.  According to Greenham, Ring had I guess taken the role as leader because he laid out all the tactics.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 39.  On the day of the robbery, Greenham said, the three watched the armored van pull up to the mall.  
				<em>

				, at 42, 4445.  Greenham then pushed Magochs body aside and drove the van away.  
				<em>
					Id.

				<em>
					Id.

				,
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				at 60.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				On cross-examination, Greenham acknowledged having previously told Rings counsel that Ring had nothing to do with the planning or execution of the robbery.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 8587.  Greenham explained that he had made that prior statement only because Ring had threatened his life.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				On October 29, 1997, the trial judge entered his Special Verdict sentencing Ring to death.  Because Ring was convicted of felony murder, not premeditated murder, the judge recognized that Ring was eligible for the death penalty only if he was Magochs actual killer or if he was a major participant in the armed robbery that led to the killing and exhibited a reckless disregard or indifference for human life.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a47a; see

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Citing Greenhams testimony at the sentencing hearing, the judge concluded that Ring is the one who shot and killed Mr. Magoch.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 47a.  The judge also found that Ring was a major participant in the robbery and that armed robbery is unquestionably a crime which carries with it a grave risk of death.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The judge then turned to the determination of aggravating and mitigating circumstances.  See §13703.  He found two aggravating factors.  First, the judge determined that Ring committed the offense in expectation of receiving something of pecuniary value, as described in §13703; [t]aking the cash from the armored car was the motive and reason for Mr. Magochs murder and not just the result.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a.  Second, the judge found that the offense was committed in an especially heinous, cruel or depraved manner.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  In support of this finding, he cited Rings comment, as reported by Greenham at the sentencing hearing, expressing pride in his marksmanship.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 49a50a.  The judge found one nonstatutory mitigating factor: Rings minimal criminal record.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 52a.  In his judgment, that mitigating circumstance did not call for leniency; he therefore sentenced Ring to death.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 53a.

				On appeal, Ring argued that Arizonas capital sentencing scheme violates the Sixth and 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>s to the U. S. Constitution because it entrusts to a judge the finding of a fact raising the defendants maximum penalty.  See

				<em>

				 v.

				 that 
				<em>

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Reviewing the death sentence, the Arizona Supreme Court made two preliminary observations.  
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Jones
				</em>
				, the Arizona high court said, raise some question about the continued viability of 
				<em>
					Walton

				.  200 Ariz., at 278, 25 P. 3d, at 1150.  The court then examined the 
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				 majoritys interpretation of Arizona law and found it wanting.  
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				, the Arizona court noted, described Arizonas sentencing system as one that  requir[es] judges, after a jury verdict holding a defendant guilty of a capital crime, to find specific aggravating factors before imposing a sentence of death, and not as a system that permits a judge to determine the existence of a factor which makes a crime a capital offense.   200 Ariz., at 279, 25 P. 3d, at 1151 (quoting 
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				, 530 U. S., at 496497).  
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice OConnor
				</span>
				s 
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				 dissent, the Arizona court noted, squarely rejected the 
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				 majoritys characterization of the Arizona sentencing scheme: A defendant convicted of first-degree murder in Arizona cannot receive a death sentence unless a judge makes the factual determination that a statutory aggravating factor exists.  Without that critical finding, the maximum sentence to which the defendant is exposed is life imprisonment, and not the death penalty.  200 Ariz., at 279, 25 P. 3d, at 1151 (quoting 
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				, 530 U. S., at 538).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				After reciting this Courts divergent constructions of Arizona law in 
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				, the Arizona Supreme Court described how capital sentencing in fact works in the State.  The Arizona high court concluded that the present case is precisely as described in Justice OConnors dissent [in 
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				]Defendants death sentence required the judges factual findings.  200 Ariz., at 279, 25 P. 3d, at 1151.  Although it agreed with the 
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				 dissents reading of Arizona law, the Arizona court understood that it was bound by the Supremacy Clause to apply 
				<em>
					Walton
				</em>
				, which this Court had not overruled.  It therefore rejected Rings constitutional attack on the States capital murder judicial sentencing system.  200 Ariz., at 280, 25 P. 3d, at 1152.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The court agreed with Ring that the evidence was insufficient to support the aggravating circumstance of depravity, 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 281282, 25 P. 3d, at 11531154, but it upheld the trial courts finding on the aggravating factor of pecuniary gain.  The Arizona Supreme Court then reweighed that remaining factor against the sole mitigating circumstance (Rings lack of a serious criminal record), and affirmed the death sentence.

				Based solely on the jurys verdict finding Ring guilty of first-degree felony murder, the maximum punishment he could have received was life imprisonment.  See 200 Ariz., at 279, 25 P. 3d, at 1151 (citing Ariz. Rev. Stat. §13703).  This was so because, in Arizona, a death sentence may not legally be imposed … unless at least one aggravating factor is found to exist beyond a reasonable doubt.  200 Ariz., at 279, 25 P. 3d, at 1151 (citing §13703).

				, second-degree possession of a firearm, an offense carrying a maximum penalty of ten years under New Jersey law.  See 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 469470.  On the prosecutors motion, the sentencing judge found by a preponderance of the evidence that Apprendis crime had been motivated by racial animus.  That finding triggered application of New Jerseys hate crime enhancement, which doubled Apprendis maximum authorized sentence.  The judge sentenced Apprendi to 12 years in prison, 2 years over the maximum that would have applied but for the enhancement.

        <p class="bodytext">

Stat. Ann. §131105(C) (West 2001); Ring was therefore sentenced within the range of punishment authorized by the jury verdict.  See Brief for Respondent 919.  This argument overlooks 
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				s instruction that the relevant inquiry is one not of form, but of effect.  530 U. S., at 494.  In effect, the required finding [of an aggravated circumstance] expose[d] [Ring] to a greater punishment than that authorized by the jurys guilty verdict.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.; see 200 Ariz., at 279, 25 P. 3d, at 1151.  The Arizona first-degree murder statute authorizes a maximum penalty
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				of death only in a formal sense, 
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				, 530 U. S., at 541 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					OConnor
				</span>
				, J., dissenting), for it explicitly cross-references the statutory provision requiring the finding
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				of an aggravating circumstance before imposition of the death penalty. See §131105(C) (First degree murder is
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				a class 1 felony and is punishable by death or life imprisonment 
				<em>
					as provided by §13703
				</em>
				. (emphasis added)).  If Arizona prevailed on its opening argument, 
				<em>
					Apprendi

				 would be reduced to a meaningless and formalistic rule of statutory drafting.  See 530 U. S., at 541 (

1. The defendant has been convicted of another offense in the United States for which under Arizona law a sentence of life imprisonment or death was imposable.

						 Rings claim is tightly delineated: He contends only that the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> required jury findings on the aggravating circumstances asserted against him.  No aggravating circumstance related to past convictions in his case; Ring therefore does not challenge Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/523/224" class="subref" title="subref">523 U. S. 224</a> (1998)
, which held that the fact of prior conviction may be found by the judge even if it increases the statutory maximum sentence.  He makes no 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> claim with respect to mitigating circumstances.  See Apprendi v. New Jersey, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/530/466" class="subref" title="subref">530 U. S. 466</a>, n. 16  (2000) (noting the distinction the Court has often recognized between facts in aggravation of punishment and facts in mitigation (citation omitted)).  Nor does he argue that the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> required the jury to make the ultimate determination whether to impose the death penalty.  See Proffitt v. Florida, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/428/242" class="subref" title="subref">428 U. S. 242</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">252</a> (1976)
 (plurality opinion) ([I]t has never [been] suggested that jury sentencing is constitutionally required.).  He does not question the Arizona Supreme Courts authority to reweigh the aggravating and mitigating circumstances after that court struck one aggravator.  See Clemons v. Mississippi, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/494/738" class="subref" title="subref">494 U. S. 738</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">745</a> (1990)
.  Finally, Ring does not contend that his indictment was constitutionally defective.  See Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 477, n. 3 (
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a> has not … been construed to include the

						 In Harris v. United States, ante, p. __, a majority of the Court concludes that the distinction between elements and sentencing factors continues to be meaningful as to facts increasing the minimum sentence.  See ante, at 20 (plurality opinion) (The factual finding in Apprendi extended the power of the judge, allowing him or her to impose a punishment exceeding what was authorized by the jury.  [A] finding [that triggers a mandatory minimum sentence] restrain[s] the judges power, limiting his or her choices within the authorized range.  It is quite consistent to maintain that the former type of fact must be submitted to the jury while the latter need not be.); ante, at 1 (Breyer, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) ([T]he 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> permits judges to apply sentencing factorswhether those factors lead to a sentence beyond the statutory maximum (as inApprendi) or the application of a mandatory minimum (as here).) .

Code §10.95.050 (1990); Wyo. Stat. Ann. §62102 (2001).


Other than Arizona, only four States commit both capital sentencing factfinding and the ultimate sentencing decision entirely to judges.  See Colo. Rev. Stat. §1611103 (2001) (three-judge panel); Idaho Code §192515 (Supp. 2001); Mont. Code Ann. §4618301 (1997); Neb. Rev. Stat. §292520 (1995).


Four States have hybrid systems, in which the jury renders an advisory verdict but the judge makes the ultimate sentencing determinations.  See Ala. Code §§13A546, 13A547 (1994); Del. Code Ann., Tit. 11, §4209 (1995); Fla. Stat. Ann. §921.141 (West 2001); Ind. Code Ann. §355029 (Supp. 2001).

				The trial judge instructed the jury on alternative charges of premeditated murder and felony murder.  The jury deadlocked on premeditated murder, with 6 of 12 jurors voting to acquit, but convicted Ring of felony murder occurring in the course of armed robbery.  See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §131105(A) and (B) (West 2001) (A person commits first degree murder if … [a]cting either alone or with one or more other persons the person commits or attempts to commit … [one of several enumerated felonies] … and in the course of and in furtherance of the offense or immediate flight from the offense, the person or another person causes the death of any person. … Homicide, as prescribed in [this provision] requires no specific mental state other than what is required for the commission of any of the enumerated felonies.).

				As later summed up by the Arizona Supreme Court, the evidence admitted at trial failed to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that [Ring] was a major participant in the armed robbery or that he actually murdered Magoch.  200 Ariz. 267, 280, 25 P. 3d 1139, 1152 (2001).  Although clear evidence connected Ring to the robberys proceeds, nothing submitted at trial put him at the scene of the robbery.  See 
				<em>
					ibid.  
				</em>
				Furthermore, [f]or all we know from the trial evidence, the Arizona court stated, [Ring] did not participate in, plan, or even expect the killing.  This lack of evidence no doubt explains why the jury found [Ring] guilty of felony, but not premeditated, murder.

				Under Arizona law, Ring could not be sentenced to death, the statutory maximum penalty for first-degree murder, unless further findings were made.  The States first-degree murder statute prescribes that the offense is punishable by death or life imprisonment as provided by §13703.  Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §131105(C) (West 2001).  The cross-referenced section, §13703, directs the judge who presided at trial to conduct a separate sentencing hearing to determine the existence or nonexistence of [certain enumerated] circumstances … for the purpose

				On October 29, 1997, the trial judge entered his Special Verdict sentencing Ring to death.  Because Ring was convicted of felony murder, not premeditated murder, the judge recognized that Ring was eligible for the death penalty only if he was Magochs actual killer or if he was a major participant in the armed robbery that led to the killing and exhibited a reckless disregard or indifference for human life.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a47a; see

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The judge then turned to the determination of aggravating and mitigating circumstances.  See §13703.  He found two aggravating factors.  First, the judge determined that Ring committed the offense in expectation of receiving something of pecuniary value, as described in §13703; [t]aking the cash from the armored car was the motive and reason for Mr. Magochs murder and not just the result.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a.  Second, the judge found that the offense was committed in an especially heinous, cruel or depraved manner.

				  In support of this finding, he cited Rings comment, as reported by Greenham at the sentencing hearing, expressing pride in his marksmanship.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>

				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				, the Arizona court noted, described Arizonas sentencing system as one that  requir[es] judges, after a jury verdict holding a defendant guilty of a capital crime, to find specific aggravating factors before imposing a sentence of death, and not as a system that permits a judge to determine the existence of a factor which makes a crime a capital offense.   200 Ariz., at 279, 25 P. 3d, at 1151 (quoting 
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				, 530 U. S., at 496497).  
				<span class="smallcaps">

				s 
				<em>
					Apprendi

Without that critical finding, the maximum sentence to which the defendant is exposed is life imprisonment, and not the death penalty.  200 Ariz., at 279, 25 P. 3d, at 1151 (quoting 
				<em>

				</em>
				, 530 U. S., at 538).

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				After reciting this Courts divergent constructions of Arizona law in 
				<em>
					Apprendi

				, the Arizona Supreme Court described how capital sentencing in fact works in the State.  The Arizona high court concluded that the present case is precisely as described in Justice OConnors dissent [in 
				<em>

				Based solely on the jurys verdict finding Ring guilty of first-degree felony murder, the maximum punishment he could have received was life imprisonment.  See 200 Ariz., at 279, 25 P. 3d, at 1151 (citing Ariz. Rev. Stat. §13703).  This was so because, in Arizona, a death sentence may not legally be imposed … unless at least one aggravating factor is found to exist beyond a reasonable doubt.  200 Ariz., at 279, 25 P. 3d, at 1151 (citing §13703).

				, Arizona first restates the

				 majoritys portrayal of Arizonas system: Ring was convicted of first-degree murder, for which Arizona law specifies death or life imprisonment as the only sentencing options, see Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §131105(C) (West 2001); Ring was therefore sentenced within the range of punishment authorized by the jury verdict.  See Brief for Respondent 919.  This argument overlooks 
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				s instruction that the relevant inquiry is one not of form, but of effect.  530 U. S., at 494.  In effect, the required finding [of an aggravated circumstance] expose[d] [Ring] to a greater punishment than that authorized by the jurys guilty verdict.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.; see 200 Ariz., at 279, 25 P. 3d, at 1151.  The Arizona first-degree murder statute authorizes a maximum penalty
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				of death only in a formal sense, 
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				, 530 U. S., at 541 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					OConnor

				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				of an aggravating circumstance before imposition of the death penalty. See §131105(C) (First degree murder is
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				a class 1 felony and is punishable by death or life imprisonment 
				<em>
					as provided by §13703
				</em>
				. (emphasis added)).  If Arizona prevailed on its opening argument,

The right to trial by jury guaranteed by the

						 The aggravating circumstances, enumerated in Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §13703(G) (West Supp. 2001), are:


1. The defendant has been convicted of another offense in the United States for which under Arizona law a sentence of life imprisonment or death was imposable.


2. The defendant was previously convicted of a serious offense, whether prepatory or completed.


3. In the commission of the offense the defendant knowingly created a grave risk of death to another person or persons in addition to the person murdered during the commission of the offense.


4. The defendant procured the commission of the offense by payment, or promise of payment, of anything of pecuniary value.


5. The defendant committed the offense as consideration for the receipt, or in expectation of the receipt, of anything of pecuniary value.


6. The defendant committed the offense in an especially heinous, cruel or depraved manner.


7. The defendant committed the offense while in the custody of oron authorized or unauthorized release from the state department of corrections, a law enforcement agency or a county or city jail.


8. The defendant has been convicted of one or more other homicides, as defined in §131101, which were committed during the commission of the offense.


9. The defendant was an adult at the time the offense was committed or was tried as an adult and the murdered person was under fifteen years of age or was seventy years of age or older.


10. The murdered person was an on duty peace officer who was killed in the course of performing his official duties and the defendant knew, or should have known, that the murdered person was a peace officer.

						 Rings claim is tightly delineated: He contends only that the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> required jury findings on the aggravating circumstances asserted against him.  No aggravating circumstance related to past convictions in his case; Ring therefore does not challenge Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/523/224" class="subref" title="subref">523 U. S. 224</a> (1998)
, which held that the fact of prior conviction may be found by the judge even if it increases the statutory maximum sentence.  He makes no 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> claim with respect to mitigating circumstances.  See Apprendi v. New Jersey, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/530/466" class="subref" title="subref">530 U. S. 466</a>, n. 16  (2000) (noting the distinction the Court has often recognized between facts in aggravation of punishment and facts in mitigation (citation omitted)).  Nor does he argue that the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> required the jury to make the ultimate determination whether to impose the death penalty.  See Proffitt v. Florida, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/428/242" class="subref" title="subref">428 U. S. 242</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">252</a> (1976)
 (plurality opinion) ([I]t has never [been] suggested that jury sentencing is constitutionally required.).  He does not question the Arizona Supreme Courts authority to reweigh the aggravating and mitigating circumstances after that court struck one aggravator.  See Clemons v. Mississippi, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/494/738" class="subref" title="subref">494 U. S. 738</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">745</a> (1990)
.  Finally, Ring does not contend that his indictment was constitutionally defective.  See Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 477, n. 3 (
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a> has not … been construed to include the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> right to presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury ).

						 In Harris v. United States, ante, p. __, a majority of the Court concludes that the distinction between elements and sentencing factors continues to be meaningful as to facts increasing the minimum sentence.  See ante, at 20 (plurality opinion) (The factual finding in Apprendi extended the power of the judge, allowing him or her to impose a punishment exceeding what was authorized by the jury.  [A] finding [that triggers a mandatory minimum sentence] restrain[s] the judges power, limiting his or her choices within the authorized range.  It is quite consistent to maintain that the former type of fact must be submitted to the jury while the latter need not be.); ante, at 1 (Breyer, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) ([T]he 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> permits judges to apply sentencing factorswhether those factors lead to a sentence beyond the statutory maximum (as inApprendi) or the application of a mandatory minimum (as here).) .

						 Of the 38 States with capital punishment, 29 generally commit sentencing decisions to juries.  See Ark. Code Ann. §54602 (1993); Cal. Penal Code Ann. §190.3 (West 1999); Conn. Gen. Stat. §53a46a (2001); Ga. Code Ann. §171031.1 (Supp. 1996); Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann., ch. 720, §5/91(d) (West 1993); Kan. Stat. Ann. §214624(b) (1995); Ky. Rev. Stat.

Code §10.95.050 (1990); Wyo. Stat. Ann. §62102 (2001).


Other than Arizona, only four States commit both capital sentencing factfinding and the ultimate sentencing decision entirely to judges.  See Colo. Rev. Stat. §1611103 (2001) (three-judge panel); Idaho Code §192515 (Supp. 2001); Mont. Code Ann. §4618301 (1997); Neb. Rev. Stat. §292520 (1995).


Four States have hybrid systems, in which the jury renders an advisory verdict but the judge makes the ultimate sentencing determinations.  See Ala. Code §§13A546, 13A547 (1994); Del. Code Ann., Tit. 11, §4209 (1995); Fla. Stat. Ann. §921.141 (West 2001); Ind. Code Ann. §355029 (Supp. 2001).

						 We do not reach the States assertion that any error was harmless because a pecuniary gain finding was implicit in the jurys guilty verdict.  See Neder v. United States,

				At the trial of petitioner Timothy Ring for murder, armed robbery, and related charges, the prosecutor presented evidence sufficient to permit the jury to find the facts here recounted.  On November 28, 1994, a Wells Fargo armored van pulled up to the Dillards department store at Arrowhead Mall in Glendale, Arizona.  Tr. 57, 6061 (Nov. 14, 1996).  Courier Dave Moss left the van to pick up money inside the store.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Later that day, Maricopa County Sheriffs Deputies found the vanits doors locked and its engine runningin the parking lot of a church in Sun City, Arizona.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 99100 (Nov. 13, 1996).  Inside the vehicle they found Magoch, dead from a single gunshot to the head.  
				<em>
					Id.

				 at 10 (Nov. 18, 1996).

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Prompted by an informants tip, Glendale police sought to determine whether Ring and his friend James Greenham were involved in the robbery.  The police investigation revealed that the two had made several expensive cash purchases in December 1994 and early 1995.

				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 1921 (Nov. 18, 1996).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In one recorded phone conversation, Ring told Ferguson that Ring might cu[t] off Greenham because [h]es too much of a risk: Greenham had indiscreetly flaunted a new truck in front of his ex-wife.  States Exh. 49A, pp. 1112.  Ring said he could cut off his associate because he held both [Greenhams] and mine.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 11.  The police engineered a local news broadcast about the robbery investigation; they included in the account several intentional inaccuracies.  Tr. 35, 1314 (Nov. 19, 1996).  On hearing the broadcast report, Ring left a message on Greenhams answering machine to remind me to talk to you tomorrow and tell you about what was on the news tonight.  Very important, and also fairly good.  States Exh. 55A, p. 2.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				After a detective left a note on Greenhams door asking him to call, Tr. 115118 (Nov. 18, 1996), Ring told Ferguson that he was puzzled by the attention the police trained on Greenham.  [H]is house is clean, Ring said; [m]ine, on the other hand, contains a very large bag.  States Exh. 70A, p. 7.  
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				On February 14, 1995, police furnished a staged reenactment of the robbery to the local news, and again included deliberate inaccuracies.  Tr. 5 (Nov. 19, 1996).  Ferguson told Ring that he laughed when he saw the broadcast, and Ring called it humorous.  States Exh. 80A, p. 3.  Ferguson said he was not real worried at all now; Ring, however, said he was slightly concern[ed] about the possibility that the police might eventually ask for hair samples.  
				<em>
					Id.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Two days later, the police executed a search warrant at Rings house, discovering a duffel bag in his garage containing more than $271,000 in cash.  Tr. 107108, 111, 125 (Nov. 20, 1996).  They also found a note with the number 575,995 on it, followed by the word splits and the letters F, Y, and T.  
				<em>
					Id.

				<em>
					Id.

				The trial judge instructed the jury on alternative charges of premeditated murder and felony murder.  The jury deadlocked on premeditated murder, with 6 of 12 jurors voting to acquit, but convicted Ring of felony murder occurring in the course of armed robbery.  See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §131105(A) and (B) (West 2001) (A person commits first degree murder if … [a]cting either alone or with one or more other persons the person commits or attempts to commit … [one of several enumerated felonies] … and in the course of and in furtherance of the offense or immediate flight from the offense, the person or another person causes the death of any person. … Homicide, as prescribed in [this provision] requires no specific mental state other than what is required for the commission of any of the enumerated felonies.). 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				As later summed up by the Arizona Supreme Court, the evidence admitted at trial failed to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that [Ring] was a major participant in the armed robbery or that he actually murdered Magoch.  200 Ariz. 267, 280, 25 P. 3d 1139, 1152 (2001).  Although clear evidence connected Ring to the robberys proceeds, nothing submitted at trial put him at the scene of the robbery.  See 
				<em>
					ibid.  
				</em>
				Furthermore, [f]or all we know from the trial evidence, the Arizona court stated, [Ring] did not participate in, plan, or even expect the killing.  This lack of evidence no doubt explains why the jury found [Ring] guilty of felony, but not premeditated, murder.

        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

 
				    
				Under Arizona law, Ring could not be sentenced to death, the statutory maximum penalty for first-degree murder, unless further findings were made.  The States first-degree murder statute prescribes that the offense is punishable by death or life imprisonment as provided by §13703.  Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §131105(C) (West 2001).  The cross-referenced section, §13703, directs the judge who presided at trial to conduct a separate sentencing hearing to determine the existence or nonexistence of [certain enumerated] circumstances … for the purpose

				On October 29, 1997, the trial judge entered his Special Verdict sentencing Ring to death.  Because Ring was convicted of felony murder, not premeditated murder, the judge recognized that Ring was eligible for the death penalty only if he was Magochs actual killer or if he was a major participant in the armed robbery that led to the killing and exhibited a reckless disregard or indifference for human life.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a47a; see

				The judge then turned to the determination of aggravating and mitigating circumstances.  See §13703.  He found two aggravating factors.  First, the judge determined that Ring committed the offense in expectation of receiving something of pecuniary value, as described in §13703; [t]aking the cash from the armored car was the motive and reason for Mr. Magochs murder and not just the result.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a.  Second, the judge found that the offense was committed in an especially heinous, cruel or depraved manner.  
				<em>

				  In support of this finding, he cited Rings comment, as reported by Greenham at the sentencing hearing, expressing pride in his marksmanship.

				After reciting this Courts divergent constructions of Arizona law in

				Based solely on the jurys verdict finding Ring guilty of first-degree felony murder, the maximum punishment he could have received was life imprisonment.  See 200 Ariz., at 279, 25 P. 3d, at 1151 (citing Ariz. Rev. Stat. §13703).  This was so because, in Arizona, a death sentence may not legally be imposed … unless at least one aggravating factor is found to exist beyond a reasonable doubt.  200 Ariz., at 279, 25 P. 3d, at 1151 (citing §13703).

That finding triggered application of New Jerseys hate crime enhancement, which doubled Apprendis maximum authorized sentence.  The judge sentenced Apprendi to 12 years in prison, 2 years over the maximum that would have applied but for the enhancement.

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> as interpreted by 
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				, Arizona first restates the 
				<em>
					Apprendi

				 majoritys portrayal of Arizonas system: Ring was convicted of first-degree murder, for which Arizona law specifies death or life imprisonment as the only sentencing options, see Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §131105(C) (West 2001); Ring was therefore sentenced within the range of punishment authorized by the jury verdict.  See Brief for Respondent 919.  This argument overlooks 
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				s instruction that the relevant inquiry is one not of form, but of effect.  530 U. S., at 494.  In effect, the required finding [of an aggravated circumstance] expose[d] [Ring] to a greater punishment than that authorized by the jurys guilty verdict.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.; see 200 Ariz., at 279, 25 P. 3d, at 1151.  The Arizona first-degree murder statute authorizes a maximum penalty
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				of death only in a formal sense, 
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				, 530 U. S., at 541 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					OConnor
				</span>
				, J., dissenting), for it explicitly cross-references the statutory provision requiring the finding
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				of an aggravating circumstance before imposition of the death penalty. See §131105(C) (First degree murder is
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				a class 1 felony and is punishable by death or life imprisonment 
				<em>
					as provided by §13703
				</em>
				. (emphasis added)).  If Arizona prevailed on its opening argument, 
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				 would be reduced to a meaningless and formalistic rule of statutory drafting.  See 530 U. S., at 541 (

				 between elements of an offense and sentencing factors.  See

				 at 494, n. 19 ([W]hen the term sentence enhancement is used to describe an increase beyond the maximum authorized statutory sentence, it is the functional equivalent of an element of a greater offense than the one covered by the jurys guilty verdict.);

						 Rings claim is tightly delineated: He contends only that the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> required jury findings on the aggravating circumstances asserted against him.  No aggravating circumstance related to past convictions in his case; Ring therefore does not challenge Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/523/224" class="subref" title="subref">523 U. S. 224</a> (1998)
, which held that the fact of prior conviction may be found by the judge even if it increases the statutory maximum sentence.  He makes no 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> claim with respect to mitigating circumstances.  See Apprendi v. New Jersey, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/530/466" class="subref" title="subref">530 U. S. 466</a>, n. 16  (2000) (noting the distinction the Court has often recognized between facts in aggravation of punishment and facts in mitigation (citation omitted)).  Nor does he argue that the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> required the jury to make the ultimate determination whether to impose the death penalty.  See Proffitt v. Florida, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/428/242" class="subref" title="subref">428 U. S. 242</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">252</a> (1976)
 (plurality opinion) ([I]t has never [been] suggested that jury sentencing is constitutionally required.).  He does not question the Arizona Supreme Courts authority to reweigh the aggravating and mitigating circumstances after that court struck one aggravator.  See Clemons v. Mississippi, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/494/738" class="subref" title="subref">494 U. S. 738</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">745</a> (1990)
.  Finally, Ring does not contend that his indictment was constitutionally defective.  See Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 477, n. 3 (
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a> has not … been construed to include the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentv" class="subref" title="subref">Fifth Amendment</a> right to presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury ).

						 In Harris v. United States, ante, p. __, a majority of the Court concludes that the distinction between elements and sentencing factors continues to be meaningful as to facts increasing the minimum sentence.  See ante, at 20 (plurality opinion) (The factual finding in Apprendi extended the power of the judge, allowing him or her to impose a punishment exceeding what was authorized by the jury.  [A] finding [that triggers a mandatory minimum sentence] restrain[s] the judges power, limiting his or her choices within the authorized range.  It is quite consistent to maintain that the former type of fact must be submitted to the jury while the latter need not be.); ante, at 1 (Breyer, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) ([T]he 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> permits judges to apply sentencing factorswhether those factors lead to a sentence beyond the statutory maximum (as inApprendi) or the application of a mandatory minimum (as here).) .

				At the trial of petitioner Timothy Ring for murder, armed robbery, and related charges, the prosecutor presented evidence sufficient to permit the jury to find the facts here recounted.  On November 28, 1994, a Wells Fargo armored van pulled up to the Dillards department store at Arrowhead Mall in Glendale, Arizona.  Tr. 57, 6061 (Nov. 14, 1996).  Courier Dave Moss left the van to pick up money inside the store.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Later that day, Maricopa County Sheriffs Deputies found the vanits doors locked and its engine runningin the parking lot of a church in Sun City, Arizona.  
				<em>
					Id.

				, at 99100 (Nov. 13, 1996).  Inside the vehicle they found Magoch, dead from a single gunshot to the head.  
				<em>

				Prompted by an informants tip, Glendale police sought to determine whether Ring and his friend James Greenham were involved in the robbery.  The police investigation revealed that the two had made several expensive cash purchases in December 1994 and early 1995.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In one recorded phone conversation, Ring told Ferguson that Ring might cu[t] off Greenham because [h]es too much of a risk: Greenham had indiscreetly flaunted a new truck in front of his ex-wife.  States Exh. 49A, pp. 1112.  Ring said he could cut off his associate because he held both [Greenhams] and mine.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 11.  The police engineered a local news broadcast about the robbery investigation; they included in the account several intentional inaccuracies.  Tr. 35, 1314 (Nov. 19, 1996).  On hearing the broadcast report, Ring left a message on Greenhams answering machine to remind me to talk to you tomorrow and tell you about what was on the news tonight.  Very important, and also fairly good.  States Exh. 55A, p. 2.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				After a detective left a note on Greenhams door asking him to call, Tr. 115118 (Nov. 18, 1996), Ring told Ferguson that he was puzzled by the attention the police trained on Greenham.  [H]is house is clean, Ring said; [m]ine, on the other hand, contains a very large bag.  States Exh. 70A, p. 7.  
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				On February 14, 1995, police furnished a staged reenactment of the robbery to the local news, and again included deliberate inaccuracies.  Tr. 5 (Nov. 19, 1996).  Ferguson told Ring that he laughed when he saw the broadcast, and Ring called it humorous.  States Exh. 80A, p. 3.  Ferguson said he was not real worried at all now; Ring, however, said he was slightly concern[ed] about the possibility that the police might eventually ask for hair samples.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Two days later, the police executed a search warrant at Rings house, discovering a duffel bag in his garage containing more than $271,000 in cash.  Tr. 107108, 111, 125 (Nov. 20, 1996).  They also found a note with the number 575,995 on it, followed by the word splits and the letters F, Y, and T.  
				<em>

				The trial judge instructed the jury on alternative charges of premeditated murder and felony murder.  The jury deadlocked on premeditated murder, with 6 of 12 jurors voting to acquit, but convicted Ring of felony murder occurring in the course of armed robbery.  See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §131105(A) and (B) (West 2001) (A person commits first degree murder if … [a]cting either alone or with one or more other persons the person commits or attempts to commit … [one of several enumerated felonies] … and in the course of and in furtherance of the offense or immediate flight from the offense, the person or another person causes the death of any person. … Homicide, as prescribed in [this provision] requires no specific mental state other than what is required for the commission of any of the enumerated felonies.). 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				As later summed up by the Arizona Supreme Court, the evidence admitted at trial failed to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that [Ring] was a major participant in the armed robbery or that he actually murdered Magoch.  200 Ariz. 267, 280, 25 P. 3d 1139, 1152 (2001).  Although clear evidence connected Ring to the robberys proceeds, nothing submitted at trial put him at the scene of the robbery.  See 
				<em>
					ibid.  
				</em>
				Furthermore, [f]or all we know from the trial evidence, the Arizona court stated, [Ring] did not participate in, plan, or even expect the killing.  This lack of evidence no doubt explains why the jury found [Ring] guilty of felony, but not premeditated, murder.

				Under Arizona law, Ring could not be sentenced to death, the statutory maximum penalty for first-degree murder, unless further findings were made.  The States first-degree murder statute prescribes that the offense is punishable by death or life imprisonment as provided by §13703.  Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §131105(C) (West 2001).  The cross-referenced section, §13703, directs the judge who presided at trial to conduct a separate sentencing hearing to determine the existence or nonexistence of [certain enumerated] circumstances … for the purpose
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				of determining the sentence to be imposed.  §13703(C) (West Supp. 2001).  The statute further instructs: The hearing shall be conducted before the court alone.  The court alone shall make all factual determinations required by this section or the constitution of the United States or this state.

				Between Rings trial and sentencing hearing, Greenham pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and armed robbery.  He stipulated to a 27½ year sentence and agreed to cooperate with the prosecution in the cases against Ring and Ferguson.  Tr. 3537 (Oct. 9, 1997).

				Called by the prosecution at Rings sentencing hearing, Greenham testified that he, Ring, and Ferguson had been planning the robbery for several weeks before it occurred.  According to Greenham, Ring had I guess taken the role as leader because he laid out all the tactics.

				On October 29, 1997, the trial judge entered his Special Verdict sentencing Ring to death.  Because Ring was convicted of felony murder, not premeditated murder, the judge recognized that Ring was eligible for the death penalty only if he was Magochs actual killer or if he was a major participant in the armed robbery that led to the killing and exhibited a reckless disregard or indifference for human life.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a47a; see

				The judge then turned to the determination of aggravating and mitigating circumstances.  See §13703.  He found two aggravating factors.  First, the judge determined that Ring committed the offense in expectation of receiving something of pecuniary value, as described in §13703; [t]aking the cash from the armored car was the motive and reason for Mr. Magochs murder and not just the result.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a.

				  In support of this finding, he cited Rings comment, as reported by Greenham at the sentencing hearing, expressing pride in his marksmanship.

				On appeal, Ring argued that Arizonas capital sentencing scheme violates the Sixth and

				Based solely on the jurys verdict finding Ring guilty of first-degree felony murder, the maximum punishment he could have received was life imprisonment.  See 200 Ariz., at 279, 25 P. 3d, at 1151 (citing Ariz. Rev. Stat. §13703).  This was so because, in Arizona, a death sentence may not legally be imposed … unless at least one aggravating factor is found to exist beyond a reasonable doubt.  200 Ariz., at 279, 25 P. 3d, at 1151 (citing §13703).

				, second-degree possession of a firearm, an offense carrying a maximum penalty of ten years under New Jersey law.  See 
				<em>
					id.,

				 at 469470.  On the prosecutors motion, the sentencing judge found by a preponderance of the evidence that Apprendis crime had been motivated by racial animus.  That finding triggered application of New Jerseys hate crime enhancement, which doubled Apprendis maximum authorized sentence.  The judge sentenced Apprendi to 12 years in prison, 2 years over the maximum that would have applied but for the enhancement.

				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				, Arizona first restates the 
				<em>
					Apprendi

				 majoritys portrayal of Arizonas system: Ring was convicted of first-degree murder, for which Arizona law specifies death or life imprisonment as the only sentencing options, see Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §131105(C) (West 2001); Ring was therefore sentenced within the range of punishment authorized by the jury verdict.  See Brief for Respondent 919.  This argument overlooks 
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				s instruction that the relevant inquiry is one not of form, but of effect.  530 U. S., at 494.  In effect, the required finding [of an aggravated circumstance] expose[d] [Ring] to a greater punishment than that authorized by the jurys guilty verdict.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.; see 200 Ariz., at 279, 25 P. 3d, at 1151.  The Arizona first-degree murder statute authorizes a maximum penalty
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				of death only in a formal sense, 
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				, 530 U. S., at 541 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					OConnor

				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				of an aggravating circumstance before imposition of the death penalty. See §131105(C) (First degree murder is
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				a class 1 felony and is punishable by death or life imprisonment 
				<em>
					as provided by §13703
				</em>
				. (emphasis added)).  If Arizona prevailed on its opening argument, 
				<em>

				 would be reduced to a meaningless and formalistic rule of statutory drafting.  See 530 U. S., at 541 (

						 Rings claim is tightly delineated: He contends only that the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> required jury findings on the aggravating circumstances asserted against him.  No aggravating circumstance related to past convictions in his case; Ring therefore does not challenge Almendarez-Torres v. United States,

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> claim with respect to mitigating circumstances.  See Apprendi v. New Jersey, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/530/466" class="subref" title="subref">530 U. S. 466</a>, n. 16  (2000) (noting the distinction the Court has often recognized between facts in aggravation of punishment and facts in mitigation (citation omitted)).  Nor does he argue that the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> required the jury to make the ultimate determination whether to impose the death penalty.  See Proffitt v. Florida,

Other than Arizona, only four States commit both capital sentencing factfinding and the ultimate sentencing decision entirely to judges.  See Colo. Rev.

Four States have hybrid systems, in which the jury renders an advisory verdict but the judge makes the ultimate sentencing determinations.  See Ala. Code §§13A546, 13A547 (1994); Del. Code Ann., Tit. 11, §4209 (1995); Fla. Stat. Ann. §921.141 (West 2001); Ind. Code Ann. §355029 (Supp. 2001).

				At the trial of petitioner Timothy Ring for murder, armed robbery, and related charges, the prosecutor presented evidence sufficient to permit the jury to find the facts here recounted.  On November 28, 1994, a Wells Fargo armored van pulled up to the Dillards department store at Arrowhead Mall in Glendale, Arizona.  Tr. 57, 6061 (Nov. 14, 1996).  Courier Dave Moss left the van to pick up money inside the store.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 61, 7374.  When he returned, the van, and its driver, John Magoch, were gone. 
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 6162.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Later that day, Maricopa County Sheriffs Deputies found the vanits doors locked and its engine runningin the parking lot of a church in Sun City, Arizona.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 99100 (Nov. 13, 1996).  Inside the vehicle they found Magoch, dead from a single gunshot to the head.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 101.  According to Wells Fargo records, more than $562,000 in cash and $271,000 in checks were missing from the van.

				 at 10 (Nov. 18, 1996).

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Prompted by an informants tip, Glendale police sought to determine whether Ring and his friend James Greenham were involved in the robbery.  The police investigation revealed that the two had made several expensive cash purchases in December 1994 and early 1995.

				<em>
					Id.

				, at 1921 (Nov. 18, 1996).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In one recorded phone conversation, Ring told Ferguson that Ring might cu[t] off Greenham because [h]es too much of a risk: Greenham had indiscreetly flaunted a new truck in front of his ex-wife.  States Exh. 49A, pp. 1112.  Ring said he could cut off his associate because he held both [Greenhams] and mine.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 11.  The police engineered a local news broadcast about the robbery investigation; they included in the account several intentional inaccuracies.  Tr. 35, 1314 (Nov. 19, 1996).  On hearing the broadcast report, Ring left a message on Greenhams answering machine to remind me to talk to you tomorrow and tell you about what was on the news tonight.  Very important, and also fairly good.  States Exh. 55A, p. 2.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				After a detective left a note on Greenhams door asking him to call, Tr. 115118 (Nov. 18, 1996), Ring told Ferguson that he was puzzled by the attention the police trained on Greenham.  [H]is house is clean, Ring said; [m]ine, on the other hand, contains a very large bag.  States Exh. 70A, p. 7.  
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				On February 14, 1995, police furnished a staged reenactment of the robbery to the local news, and again included deliberate inaccuracies.  Tr. 5 (Nov. 19, 1996).  Ferguson told Ring that he laughed when he saw the broadcast, and Ring called it humorous.  States Exh. 80A, p. 3.  Ferguson said he was not real worried at all now; Ring, however, said he was slightly concern[ed] about the possibility that the police might eventually ask for hair samples.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Two days later, the police executed a search warrant at Rings house, discovering a duffel bag in his garage containing more than $271,000 in cash.  Tr. 107108, 111, 125 (Nov. 20, 1996).  They also found a note with the number 575,995 on it, followed by the word splits and the letters F, Y, and T.  
				<em>
					Id.

				The trial judge instructed the jury on alternative charges of premeditated murder and felony murder.  The jury deadlocked on premeditated murder, with 6 of 12 jurors voting to acquit, but convicted Ring of felony murder occurring in the course of armed robbery.  See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §131105(A) and (B) (West 2001) (A person commits first degree murder if … [a]cting either alone or with one or more other persons the person commits or attempts to commit … [one of several enumerated felonies] … and in the course of and in furtherance of the offense or immediate flight from the offense, the person or another person causes the death of any person. … Homicide, as prescribed in [this provision] requires no specific mental state other than what is required for the commission of any of the enumerated felonies.). 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				As later summed up by the Arizona Supreme Court, the evidence admitted at trial failed to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that [Ring] was a major participant in the armed robbery or that he actually murdered Magoch.  200 Ariz. 267, 280, 25 P. 3d 1139, 1152 (2001).  Although clear evidence connected Ring to the robberys proceeds, nothing submitted at trial put him at the scene of the robbery.  See 
				<em>
					ibid.  
				</em>
				Furthermore, [f]or all we know from the trial evidence, the Arizona court stated, [Ring] did not participate in, plan, or even expect the killing.  This lack of evidence no doubt explains why the jury found [Ring] guilty of felony, but not premeditated, murder.

        <p class="bodytext">
				

 
				    
				Under Arizona law, Ring could not be sentenced to death, the statutory maximum penalty for first-degree murder, unless further findings were made.  The States first-degree murder statute prescribes that the offense is punishable by death or life imprisonment as provided by §13703.  Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §131105(C) (West 2001).  The cross-referenced section, §13703, directs the judge who presided at trial to conduct a separate sentencing hearing to determine the existence or nonexistence of [certain enumerated] circumstances … for the purpose
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				of determining the sentence to be imposed.  §13703(C) (West Supp. 2001).  The statute further instructs: The hearing shall be conducted before the court alone.  The court alone shall make all factual determinations required by this section or the constitution of the United States or this state.

				Between Rings trial and sentencing hearing, Greenham pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and armed robbery.  He stipulated to a 27½ year sentence and agreed to cooperate with the prosecution in the cases against Ring and Ferguson.  Tr. 3537 (Oct. 9, 1997).

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Called by the prosecution at Rings sentencing hearing, Greenham testified that he, Ring, and Ferguson had been planning the robbery for several weeks before it occurred.  According to Greenham, Ring had I guess taken the role as leader because he laid out all the tactics.  
				<em>

					Id.

				On October 29, 1997, the trial judge entered his Special Verdict sentencing Ring to death.  Because Ring was convicted of felony murder, not premeditated murder, the judge recognized that Ring was eligible for the death penalty only if he was Magochs actual killer or if he was a major participant in the armed robbery that led to the killing and exhibited a reckless disregard or indifference for human life.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a47a; see

				Citing Greenhams testimony at the sentencing hearing, the judge concluded that Ring is the one who shot and killed Mr. Magoch.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 47a.  The judge also found that Ring was a major participant in the robbery and that armed robbery is unquestionably a crime which carries with it a grave risk of death.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The judge then turned to the determination of aggravating and mitigating circumstances.  See §13703.  He found two aggravating factors.  First, the judge determined that Ring committed the offense in expectation of receiving something of pecuniary value, as described in §13703; [t]aking the cash from the armored car was the motive and reason for Mr. Magochs murder and not just the result.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a.  Second, the judge found that the offense was committed in an especially heinous, cruel or depraved manner.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  In support of this finding, he cited Rings comment, as reported by Greenham at the sentencing hearing, expressing pride in his marksmanship.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 49a50a.  The judge found one nonstatutory mitigating factor: Rings minimal criminal record.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 52a.  In his judgment, that mitigating circumstance did not call for leniency; he therefore sentenced Ring to death.

				On appeal, Ring argued that Arizonas capital sentencing scheme violates the Sixth and 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>s to the U. S. Constitution because it entrusts to a judge the finding of a fact raising the defendants maximum penalty.  See

				Reviewing the death sentence, the Arizona Supreme Court made two preliminary observations.

				<em>

				, the Arizona high court said, raise some question about the continued viability of 
				<em>

				<em>
					Apprendi

				 majoritys interpretation of Arizona law and found it wanting.  
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				, the Arizona court noted, described Arizonas sentencing system as one that  requir[es] judges, after a jury verdict holding a defendant guilty of a capital crime, to find specific aggravating factors before imposing a sentence of death, and not as a system that permits a judge to determine the existence of a factor which makes a crime a capital offense.   200 Ariz., at 279, 25 P. 3d, at 1151 (quoting 
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				, 530 U. S., at 496497).  
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice OConnor
				</span>
				s 
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				 dissent, the Arizona court noted, squarely rejected the 
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				 majoritys characterization of the Arizona sentencing scheme: A defendant convicted of first-degree murder in Arizona cannot receive a death sentence unless a judge makes the factual determination that a statutory aggravating factor exists.  Without that critical finding, the maximum sentence to which the defendant is exposed is life imprisonment, and not the death penalty.  200 Ariz., at 279, 25 P. 3d, at 1151 (quoting 
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				, 530 U. S., at 538).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				After reciting this Courts divergent constructions of Arizona law in 
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				, the Arizona Supreme Court described how capital sentencing in fact works in the State.  The Arizona high court concluded that the present case is precisely as described in Justice OConnors dissent [in 
				<em>
					Apprendi

				]Defendants death sentence required the judges factual findings.  200 Ariz., at 279, 25 P. 3d, at 1151.  Although it agreed with the

				Based solely on the jurys verdict finding Ring guilty of first-degree felony murder, the maximum punishment he could have received was life imprisonment.

				, second-degree possession of a firearm, an offense carrying a maximum penalty of ten years under New Jersey law.  See 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 469470.  On the prosecutors motion, the sentencing judge found by a preponderance of the evidence that Apprendis crime had been motivated by racial animus.  That finding triggered application of New Jerseys hate crime enhancement, which doubled Apprendis maximum authorized sentence.  The judge sentenced Apprendi to 12 years in prison, 2 years over the maximum that would have applied but for the enhancement.

        <p class="bodytext">

						 Rings claim is tightly delineated: He contends only that the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> required jury findings on the aggravating circumstances asserted against him.  No aggravating circumstance related to past convictions in his case; Ring therefore does not challenge Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/523/224" class="subref" title="subref">523 U. S. 224</a> (1998)
, which held that the fact of prior conviction may be found by the judge even if it increases the statutory maximum sentence.  He makes no 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> claim with respect to mitigating circumstances.  See Apprendi v. New Jersey, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/530/466" class="subref" title="subref">530 U. S. 466</a>, n. 16  (2000) (noting the distinction the Court has often recognized between facts in aggravation of punishment and facts in mitigation (citation omitted)).  Nor does he argue that the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> required the jury to make the ultimate determination whether to impose the death penalty.  See Proffitt v. Florida, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/428/242" class="subref" title="subref">428 U. S. 242</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">252</a> (1976)
 (plurality opinion) ([I]t has never [been] suggested that jury sentencing is constitutionally required.).  He does not question the Arizona Supreme Courts authority to reweigh the aggravating and mitigating circumstances after that court struck one aggravator.  See Clemons v. Mississippi, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/494/738" class="subref" title="subref">494 U. S. 738</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">745</a> (1990)
.  Finally, Ring does not contend that his indictment was constitutionally defective.  See Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 477, n. 3 (
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a> has not … been construed to include the

						 In Harris v. United States, ante, p. __, a majority of the Court concludes that the distinction between elements and sentencing factors continues to be meaningful as to facts increasing the minimum sentence.  See ante, at 20 (plurality opinion) (The factual finding in Apprendi extended the power of the judge, allowing him or her to impose a punishment exceeding what was authorized by the jury.  [A] finding [that triggers a mandatory minimum sentence] restrain[s] the judges power, limiting his or her choices within the authorized range.  It is quite consistent to maintain that the former type of fact must be submitted to the jury while the latter need not be.); ante, at 1 (Breyer, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) ([T]he 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> permits judges to apply sentencing factorswhether those factors lead to a sentence beyond the statutory maximum (as inApprendi) or the application of a mandatory minimum (as here).) .

Other than Arizona, only four States commit both capital sentencing factfinding and the ultimate sentencing decision entirely to judges.  See Colo. Rev. Stat. §1611103 (2001) (three-judge panel); Idaho Code §192515 (Supp. 2001); Mont. Code Ann. §4618301 (1997); Neb. Rev. Stat. §292520 (1995).


Four States have hybrid systems, in which the jury renders an advisory verdict but the judge makes the ultimate sentencing determinations.  See Ala. Code §§13A546, 13A547 (1994); Del. Code Ann., Tit. 11, §4209 (1995); Fla. Stat. Ann. §921.141 (West 2001); Ind. Code Ann. §355029 (Supp. 2001).

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">248</a> (1998)

				, I believe that the fundamental meaning of the jury-trial guarantee of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> is that all facts essential to imposition of the level of punishment that the defendant receiveswhether the statute calls them elements of the offense, sentencing factors, or Mary Janemust be found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The quandary is apparent: Should I continue to apply the last-stated principle when I know that the only reason the fact 
				<em>
					is
				</em>
				 essential is that this Court has mistakenly said that the Constitution 
				<em>
					requires
				</em>
				 state law to impose such aggravating factors?  In 
				<em>
					Walton
				</em>
				, to tell the truth, the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> claim was not put with the clarity it obtained in 
				<em>
					Almendarez-Torres
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				.  There what the appellant argued had to be found by the jury was not all facts essential to imposition of the death penalty, but rather 
				<em>
					every
				</em>
				 finding of fact underlying the sentencing decision, including not only the aggravating factors without which the penalty could not be imposed, but also the 
				<em>
					mitigating
				</em>
				 factors that might induce a sentencer to give a lesser punishment.  497 U. S., at 647 (emphasis added).  But even if the point had been put with greater clarity in 
				<em>
					Walton
				</em>
				, I think I still would have approved the Arizona schemeI would have favored the States freedom to develop their own capital sentencing procedures (already erroneously abridged by 
				<em>
					Furman
				</em>
				) over the logic of the 
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				 principle.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Since 
				<em>
					Walton
				</em>
				, I have acquired new wisdom that consists of two realizationsor, to put it more critically, have discarded old ignorance that consisted of the failure to realize two things: First, that it is impossible to identify with certainty those aggravating factors whose adoption has been wrongfully coerced by 
				<em>
					Furman
				</em>
				, as opposed to those that the State would have adopted in any event.  Some States, for example, already had aggravating-factor requirements for capital murder (
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, murder of a peace officer, see 1965 N. Y. Laws p. 1022 (originally codified at N. Y. Penal Law §1045)) when 
				<em>
					Furman
				</em>
				 was decided.  When such a State has added aggravating factors, are the new ones the 
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				-exempt product of 
				<em>
					Furman
				</em>
				, and the old ones not?  And even as to those States that did not previously have aggravating-factor requirements, who is to say that their adoption of a new one todayor, for that matter, even their retention of old ones adopted immediately post-
				<em>
					Furman
				</em>
				is still the product of that case, and not of a changed social belief that murder 
				<em>
					simpliciter
				</em>
				 does not deserve death?
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, and more important, my observing over the past 12 years the accelerating propensity of both state and federal legislatures to adopt sentencing factors determined by judges that increase punishment beyond what is authorized by the jurys verdict, and my witnessing the belief of a near majority of my colleagues that this novel practice is perfectly OK, see 
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 supra,
				</em>
				 at 523 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					OConnor, J., 
				</span>
				dissenting), cause me to believe that our peoples traditional belief in the right of trial by jury is in perilous decline.  That decline is bound to be confirmed, and indeed accelerated, by the repeated spectacle of a mans going to his death because 
				<em>
					a judge
				</em>
				 found that an aggravating factor existed.  We cannot preserve our veneration for the protection of the jury in criminal cases if we render ourselves callous to the need for that protection by regularly imposing the death penalty without it.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Accordingly, 
				<em>
					whether or not
				</em>
				 the States have been erroneously coerced into the adoption of aggravating factors, wherever those factors exist they must be subject to the usual requirements of the common law, and to the requirement enshrined in our Constitution, in criminal cases: they must be found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I add one further point, lest the holding of todays decision be confused by the separate concurrence.  
				<span class="smallcaps">

				<em>
					fact
				</em>
				 that an aggravating factor existed.  Those States that leave the ultimate life-or-death decision to the judge may continue to do soby requiring a prior jury finding of aggravating factor in the sentencing phase or, more simply, by placing the aggravating-factor determination (where it logically belongs anyway) in the guilt phase.  There is really no way in which

				Second, and more important, my observing over the past 12 years the accelerating propensity of both state and federal legislatures to adopt sentencing factors determined by judges that increase punishment beyond what is authorized by the jurys verdict, and my witnessing the belief of a near majority of my colleagues that this novel practice is perfectly OK, see

				<em>
					a judge
				</em>
				 found that an aggravating factor existed.  We cannot preserve our veneration for the protection of the jury in criminal cases if we render ourselves callous to the need for that protection by regularly imposing the death penalty without it.

				Accordingly,

Those States that leave the ultimate life-or-death decision to the judge may continue to do soby requiring a prior jury finding of aggravating factor in the sentencing phase or, more simply, by placing the aggravating-factor determination (where it logically belongs anyway) in the guilt phase.

What compelled Arizona (and many other States) to specify particular aggravating factors that must be found before the death penalty can be imposed, see 1973 Ariz. Sess.

				On the other hand, as I wrote in my dissent in

				 v.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">248</a> (1998)
, and as I reaffirmed by joining the opinion for the Court in 
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				, I believe that the fundamental meaning of the jury-trial guarantee of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> is that all facts essential to imposition of the level of punishment that the defendant receiveswhether the statute calls them elements of the offense, sentencing factors, or Mary Janemust be found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The quandary is apparent: Should I continue to apply the last-stated principle when I know that the only reason the fact 
				<em>
					is
				</em>
				 essential is that this Court has mistakenly said that the Constitution 
				<em>
					requires
				</em>
				 state law to impose such aggravating factors?  In 
				<em>
					Walton
				</em>
				, to tell the truth, the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> claim was not put with the clarity it obtained in 
				<em>
					Almendarez-Torres
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				.  There what the appellant argued had to be found by the jury was not all facts essential to imposition of the death penalty, but rather 
				<em>
					every
				</em>
				 finding of fact underlying the sentencing decision, including not only the aggravating factors without which the penalty could not be imposed, but also the 
				<em>
					mitigating
				</em>
				 factors that might induce a sentencer to give a lesser punishment.  497 U. S., at 647 (emphasis added).  But even if the point had been put with greater clarity in 
				<em>
					Walton
				</em>
				, I think I still would have approved the Arizona schemeI would have favored the States freedom to develop their own capital sentencing procedures (already erroneously abridged by 
				<em>
					Furman
				</em>
				) over the logic of the 
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				 principle.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Since 
				<em>
					Walton

				, I have acquired new wisdom that consists of two realizationsor, to put it more critically, have discarded old ignorance that consisted of the failure to realize two things: First, that it is impossible to identify with certainty those aggravating factors whose adoption has been wrongfully coerced by 
				<em>
					Furman
				</em>
				, as opposed to those that the State would have adopted in any event.  Some States, for example, already had aggravating-factor requirements for capital murder (
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, murder of a peace officer, see 1965 N. Y. Laws p. 1022 (originally codified at N. Y. Penal Law §1045)) when

What compelled Arizona (and many other States) to specify particular aggravating factors that must be found before the death penalty can be imposed, see 1973 Ariz. Sess. Laws ch. 138, §5 (originally codified as Ariz. Rev. Stat. §13454), was the line of this Courts cases beginning with 
				<em>
					Furman
				</em>
				 v.

				497 U. S., at 659660 (

				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 670 ( [T]he prohibition of the

				<em>
					Furman
				</em>
				 jurisprudence imposes on the States.  Better for the Court to have invented an evidentiary requirement that a judge can find by a preponderance of the evidence, than to invent one that a unanimous jury must find beyond a reasonable doubt.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				On the other hand, as I wrote in my dissent in 
				<em>
					Almendarez-Torres
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					United States,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/523/224" class="subref" title="subref">523 U. S. 224</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">248</a> (1998)
, and as I reaffirmed by joining the opinion for the Court in 
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				, I believe that the fundamental meaning of the jury-trial guarantee of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> is that all facts essential to imposition of the level of punishment that the defendant receiveswhether the statute calls them elements of the offense, sentencing factors, or Mary Janemust be found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The quandary is apparent: Should I continue to apply the last-stated principle when I know that the only reason the fact 
				<em>
					is
				</em>
				 essential is that this Court has mistakenly said that the Constitution 
				<em>
					requires
				</em>
				 state law to impose such aggravating factors?  In 
				<em>
					Walton
				</em>
				, to tell the truth, the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> claim was not put with the clarity it obtained in 
				<em>
					Almendarez-Torres
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				.  There what the appellant argued had to be found by the jury was not all facts essential to imposition of the death penalty, but rather 
				<em>
					every
				</em>
				 finding of fact underlying the sentencing decision, including not only the aggravating factors without which the penalty could not be imposed, but also the 
				<em>
					mitigating
				</em>
				 factors that might induce a sentencer to give a lesser punishment.  497 U. S., at 647 (emphasis added).  But even if the point had been put with greater clarity in 
				<em>
					Walton
				</em>
				, I think I still would have approved the Arizona schemeI would have favored the States freedom to develop their own capital sentencing procedures (already erroneously abridged by 
				<em>
					Furman
				</em>
				) over the logic of the 
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				 principle.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Since 
				<em>
					Walton
				</em>
				, I have acquired new wisdom that consists of two realizationsor, to put it more critically, have discarded old ignorance that consisted of the failure to realize two things: First, that it is impossible to identify with certainty those aggravating factors whose adoption has been wrongfully coerced by 
				<em>
					Furman
				</em>
				, as opposed to those that the State would have adopted in any event.  Some States, for example, already had aggravating-factor requirements for capital murder (
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, murder of a peace officer, see 1965 N. Y. Laws p. 1022 (originally codified at N. Y. Penal Law §1045)) when 
				<em>
					Furman
				</em>
				 was decided.  When such a State has added aggravating factors, are the new ones the 
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				-exempt product of 
				<em>
					Furman
				</em>
				, and the old ones not?  And even as to those States that did not previously have aggravating-factor requirements, who is to say that their adoption of a new one todayor, for that matter, even their retention of old ones adopted immediately post-
				<em>
					Furman
				</em>
				is still the product of that case, and not of a changed social belief that murder 
				<em>
					simpliciter
				</em>
				 does not deserve death?
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, and more important, my observing over the past 12 years the accelerating propensity of both state and federal legislatures to adopt sentencing factors determined by judges that increase punishment beyond what is authorized by the jurys verdict, and my witnessing the belief of a near majority of my colleagues that this novel practice is perfectly OK, see 
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 supra,
				</em>
				 at 523 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					OConnor, J., 
				</span>
				dissenting), cause me to believe that our peoples traditional belief in the right of trial by jury is in perilous decline.  That decline is bound to be confirmed, and indeed accelerated, by the repeated spectacle of a mans going to his death because 
				<em>
					a judge
				</em>
				 found that an aggravating factor existed.  We cannot preserve our veneration for the protection of the jury in criminal cases if we render ourselves callous to the need for that protection by regularly imposing the death penalty without it.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Accordingly, 
				<em>
					whether or not
				</em>
				 the States have been erroneously coerced into the adoption of aggravating factors, wherever those factors exist they must be subject to the usual requirements of the common law, and to the requirement enshrined in our Constitution, in criminal cases: they must be found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I add one further point, lest the holding of todays decision be confused by the separate concurrence.  
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Breyer
				</span>
				, who refuses to accept 
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				, see 530 U. S., at 555 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Breyer, J., 
				</span>
				dissenting); see also 
				<em>
					Harris
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 p. ___ (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Breyer, J., 
				</span>
				concurring in part and concurring in judgment), nonetheless concurs in todays judgment because he believe[s] that jury sentencing in capital cases is mandated by the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentviii" class="subref" title="subref">Eighth Amendment</a>.  
				<em>
					Post
				</em>
				, at 1 (opinion concurring in judgment).  While I am, as always, pleased to travel in 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice 
				</span>
				B
				<span class="smallcaps">
					reyer
				</span>
				s company, the unfortunate fact is that todays judgment has nothing to do with jury sentencing.  What todays decision says is that the jury must find the existence of the 
				<em>
					fact
				</em>
				 that an aggravating factor existed.  Those States that leave the ultimate life-or-death decision to the judge may continue to do soby requiring a prior jury finding of aggravating factor in the sentencing phase or, more simply, by placing the aggravating-factor determination (where it logically belongs anyway) in the guilt phase.  There is really no way in which 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Breyer
				</span>
				 can travel with the happy band that reaches todays result unless he says yes to 
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				.  Concisely put, 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Breyer 
				</span>
				is on the wrong flight; he should either get off before the doors close, or buy a ticket to 
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				-land.

				On the other hand, as I wrote in my dissent in 
				<em>
					Almendarez-Torres
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					United States,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/523/224" class="subref" title="subref">523 U. S. 224</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">248</a> (1998)
, and as I reaffirmed by joining the opinion for the Court in 
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				, I believe that the fundamental meaning of the jury-trial guarantee of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> is that all facts essential to imposition of the level of punishment that the defendant receiveswhether the statute calls them elements of the offense, sentencing factors, or Mary Janemust be found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The quandary is apparent: Should I continue to apply the last-stated principle when I know that the only reason the fact 
				<em>
					is
				</em>
				 essential is that this Court has mistakenly said that the Constitution 
				<em>
					requires
				</em>
				 state law to impose such aggravating factors?  In 
				<em>
					Walton
				</em>
				, to tell the truth, the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> claim was not put with the clarity it obtained in 
				<em>
					Almendarez-Torres
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				.  There what the appellant argued had to be found by the jury was not all facts essential to imposition of the death penalty, but rather 
				<em>
					every
				</em>
				 finding of fact underlying the sentencing decision, including not only the aggravating factors without which the penalty could not be imposed, but also the 
				<em>
					mitigating
				</em>
				 factors that might induce a sentencer to give a lesser punishment.  497 U. S., at 647 (emphasis added).  But even if the point had been put with greater clarity in 
				<em>
					Walton
				</em>
				, I think I still would have approved the Arizona schemeI would have favored the States freedom to develop their own capital sentencing procedures (already erroneously abridged by 
				<em>
					Furman
				</em>
				) over the logic of the 
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				 principle.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Since 
				<em>
					Walton
				</em>
				, I have acquired new wisdom that consists of two realizationsor, to put it more critically, have discarded old ignorance that consisted of the failure to realize two things: First, that it is impossible to identify with certainty those aggravating factors whose adoption has been wrongfully coerced by 
				<em>
					Furman
				</em>
				, as opposed to those that the State would have adopted in any event.  Some States, for example, already had aggravating-factor requirements for capital murder (
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, murder of a peace officer, see 1965 N. Y. Laws p. 1022 (originally codified at N. Y. Penal Law §1045)) when 
				<em>
					Furman
				</em>
				 was decided.  When such a State has added aggravating factors, are the new ones the 
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				-exempt product of 
				<em>
					Furman
				</em>
				, and the old ones not?  And even as to those States that did not previously have aggravating-factor requirements, who is to say that their adoption of a new one todayor, for that matter, even their retention of old ones adopted immediately post-
				<em>
					Furman
				</em>
				is still the product of that case, and not of a changed social belief that murder 
				<em>
					simpliciter
				</em>
				 does not deserve death?
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, and more important, my observing over the past 12 years the accelerating propensity of both state and federal legislatures to adopt sentencing factors determined by judges that increase punishment beyond what is authorized by the jurys verdict, and my witnessing the belief of a near majority of my colleagues that this novel practice is perfectly OK, see 
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 supra,
				</em>
				 at 523 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					OConnor, J., 
				</span>
				dissenting), cause me to believe that our peoples traditional belief in the right of trial by jury is in perilous decline.  That decline is bound to be confirmed, and indeed accelerated, by the repeated spectacle of a mans going to his death because 
				<em>
					a judge
				</em>
				 found that an aggravating factor existed.  We cannot preserve our veneration for the protection of the jury in criminal cases if we render ourselves callous to the need for that protection by regularly imposing the death penalty without it.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Accordingly, 
				<em>
					whether or not
				</em>
				 the States have been erroneously coerced into the adoption of aggravating factors, wherever those factors exist they must be subject to the usual requirements of the common law, and to the requirement enshrined in our Constitution, in criminal cases: they must be found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I add one further point, lest the holding of todays decision be confused by the separate concurrence.  
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Breyer
				</span>
				, who refuses to accept 
				<em>
					Apprendi

				<span class="smallcaps">

				</span>
				B

				<em>
					fact
				</em>
				 that an aggravating factor existed.  Those States that leave the ultimate life-or-death decision to the judge may continue to do soby requiring a prior jury finding of aggravating factor in the sentencing phase or, more simply, by placing the aggravating-factor determination (where it logically belongs anyway) in the guilt phase.  There is really no way in which 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Breyer
				</span>
				 can travel with the happy band that reaches todays result unless he says yes to 
				<em>

				Second, and more important, my observing over the past 12 years the accelerating propensity of both state and federal legislatures to adopt sentencing factors determined by judges that increase punishment beyond what is authorized by the jurys verdict, and my witnessing the belief of a near majority of my colleagues that this novel practice is perfectly OK, see

				On the other hand, as I wrote in my dissent in

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">248</a> (1998)

				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				, I believe that the fundamental meaning of the jury-trial guarantee of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> is that all facts essential to imposition of the level of punishment that the defendant receiveswhether the statute calls them elements of the offense, sentencing factors, or Mary Janemust be found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The quandary is apparent: Should I continue to apply the last-stated principle when I know that the only reason the fact 
				<em>
					is
				</em>
				 essential is that this Court has mistakenly said that the Constitution 
				<em>
					requires
				</em>
				 state law to impose such aggravating factors?  In 
				<em>
					Walton
				</em>
				, to tell the truth, the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> claim was not put with the clarity it obtained in 
				<em>
					Almendarez-Torres
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				.  There what the appellant argued had to be found by the jury was not all facts essential to imposition of the death penalty, but rather 
				<em>
					every
				</em>
				 finding of fact underlying the sentencing decision, including not only the aggravating factors without which the penalty could not be imposed, but also the 
				<em>
					mitigating
				</em>
				 factors that might induce a sentencer to give a lesser punishment.  497 U. S., at 647 (emphasis added).  But even if the point had been put with greater clarity in 
				<em>
					Walton
				</em>
				, I think I still would have approved the Arizona schemeI would have favored the States freedom to develop their own capital sentencing procedures (already erroneously abridged by 
				<em>
					Furman
				</em>
				) over the logic of the 
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				 principle.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Since 
				<em>
					Walton

				, I have acquired new wisdom that consists of two realizationsor, to put it more critically, have discarded old ignorance that consisted of the failure to realize two things: First, that it is impossible to identify with certainty those aggravating factors whose adoption has been wrongfully coerced by 
				<em>
					Furman
				</em>
				, as opposed to those that the State would have adopted in any event.  Some States, for example, already had aggravating-factor requirements for capital murder (
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, murder of a peace officer, see 1965 N. Y. Laws p. 1022 (originally codified at N. Y. Penal Law §1045)) when 
				<em>

				 was decided.  When such a State has added aggravating factors, are the new ones the 
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				-exempt product of 
				<em>
					Furman
				</em>
				, and the old ones not?  And even as to those States that did not previously have aggravating-factor requirements, who is to say that their adoption of a new one todayor, for that matter, even their retention of old ones adopted immediately post-
				<em>
					Furman
				</em>
				is still the product of that case, and not of a changed social belief that murder

I believe many of these challenges will ultimately be unsuccessful, either because the prisoners will be unable to satisfy the standards of harmless error or plain error review, or because, having completed their direct appeals, they will be barred from taking advantage of todays holding on federal collateral review.

I believe many of these challenges will ultimately be unsuccessful, either because the prisoners will be unable to satisfy the standards of harmless error or plain error review, or because, having completed their direct appeals, they will be barred from taking advantage of todays holding on federal collateral review.

I believe many of these challenges will ultimately be unsuccessful, either because the prisoners will be unable to satisfy the standards of harmless error or plain error review, or because, having completed their direct appeals, they will be barred from taking advantage of todays holding on federal collateral review.

				I understand why the Court holds that the reasoning of

					Apprendi

				 v.

					New Jersey, 
				</em>

				I continue to believe, for the reasons I articulated in my dissent in 
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				, that the decision in 
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				 was a serious mistake.  As I argued in that dissent, 
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				s rule that any fact that increases the maximum penalty must be treated as an element of the crime is not required by the Constitution, by history, or by our prior cases.  See 530 U. S., at 524552.  Indeed, the rule directly contradicts several of our prior cases.  See

				it ignores the significant history in this country of … discretionary sentencing by judges.  530 U. S., at 544 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					OConnor
				</span>
				, J., dissenting).  The Court has failed, both in 
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				 and in the decision announced today, to offer any meaningful justification for deviating from years of cases both suggesting and holding that application of the increase in the maximum penalty rule is not required by the Constitution.

				 at 539.

				Not only was the decision in 
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				 unjustified in my view, but it has also had a severely destabilizing effect on our criminal justice system.  I predicted in my dissent that the decision would unleash a flood of petitions by convicted defendants seeking to invalidate their sentences in whole or in part on the authority of 
				<em>
					[Apprendi]
				</em>
				.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 551.  As of May 31, 2002, less than two years after 
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				 was announced, the United States Courts of Appeals had decided approximately 1,802 criminal appeals in which defendants challenged their sentences, and in some cases even their convictions, under 
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				.

				  These federal appeals are likely only the tip of the iceberg, as federal criminal prosecutions represent a tiny fraction of the total number of criminal prosecutions nationwide.  See 
				<em>
					ibid.
				</em>
				 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					OConnor
				</span>
				, J., dissenting) (In 1998 … federal criminal prosecutions represented only about 0.4% of the total number of criminal prosecutions in federal and state courts).  The number of second or successive habeas corpus petitions filed in the federal courts also increased by 77% in 2001, a phenomenon the Administrative Office of the United States Courts attributes to prisoners bringing 
				<em>
					Apprendi
				</em>
				 claims.  Administrative Office of the U. S. Courts, 2001 Judicial Business 17.  This Court has been similarly overwhelmed by the aftershocks of 
				<em>

				Respondent, a paraplegic, suffered serious injuries that left him unable to work full time when, after arrest, he was transported to a Kansas City police station in a van that was not equipped to accommodate the disabled.  He sued petitioner police officials and officers for discriminating against him on the basis of his disability, in violation of §202 of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and §504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, by failing to maintain appropriate policies for the arrest and transportation of persons with spinal cord injuries.  A jury awarded him compensatory and punitive damages, but the District Court vacated as to punitive damages, holding that they are unavailable in private suits brought under §202 of the ADA and §504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  In reversing, the Eighth Circuit found punitive damages available under the general rule of

            <em>
					Held:
				</em>
				 Punitive damages may not be awarded in private suits brought under §202 of the ADA and §504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  These sections are enforceable through private causes of action, whose remedies are coextensive with those available in a private action under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  See §203 of the ADA and §505(a)(2) of the Rehabilitation Act.  Title VI invokes Congresss Spending Clause power to place conditions on the grant of federal funds.  This Court has regularly applied a contract-law analogy in defining the scope of conduct for which funding recipients may be held liable in money damages, and in finding a damages remedy available, in private suits under Spending Clause legislation.  The same analogy applies in determining the scope of damages remedies.  A remedy is appropriate relief only if the recipient is on notice that, by accepting federal funding, it exposes itself to such liability.  A funding recipient is generally on notice that it is subject not only to those remedies explicitly provided in the relevant legislation but also to those traditionally available in breach of contract suits.  Title VI mentions no remedies; and punitive damages are generally not available for breach of contract.  Nor could it be said that Title VI funding recipients have, merely by accepting funds, implicitly consented to a remedy which is not normally available for contract actions, and the indeterminate magnitude of which could produce liability exceeding the level of federal funding.  Because punitive damages may not be awarded in private suits under Title VI, it follows that they may not be awarded in suits under §202 of the ADA and §504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  Pp. 39.

				Respondent Jeffrey Gorman, a paraplegic, is confined to a wheelchair and lacks voluntary control over his lower torso, including his bladder, forcing him to wear a catheter attached to a urine bag around his waist.  In May 1992, he was arrested for trespass after fighting with a bouncer at a Kansas City, Missouri, nightclub.  While waiting for a police van to transport him to the station, he was denied permission to use a restroom to empty his urine bag.  When the van arrived, it was not equipped to receive respondents wheelchair.  Over respondents objection, the officers removed him from his wheelchair and used a seatbelt and his own belt to strap him to a narrow bench in the rear of the van.  During the ride to the police station, respondent released his seatbelt, fearing it placed excessive pressure on his urine bag.  Eventually, the other belt came loose and respondent fell to the floor, rupturing his urine bag and injuring his shoulder and back.  The driver, the only officer in the van, finding it impossible to lift respondent, fastened him to a support for the remainder of the trip.  Upon arriving at the station, respondent was booked, processed, and released; later he was convicted of misdemeanor trespass.  After these events, respondent suffered serious medical problemsincluding a bladder infection, serious lower back pain, and uncontrollable spasms in his paralyzed areasthat left him unable to work full time.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Respondent brought suit against petitionersmembers of the Kansas City Board of Police Commissioners, the chief of police, and the officer who drove the vanin the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri.  The suit claimed petitioners had discriminated against respondent on the basis of his disability, in violation of §202 of the ADA and §504 of the Rehabilitation Act, by failing to maintain appropriate policies for the arrest and transportation of persons with spinal cord injuries.

				A jury found petitioners liable and awarded over $1 million in compensatory damages and $1.2 million in punitive damages.  The District Court vacated the punitive damages award, holding that punitive damages are unavailable in suits under §202 of the ADA and §504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed, relying on this Courts decision in

, which stated the general rule that absent clear direction to the contrary by Congress, the federal courts have the power to award any appropriate relief in a cognizable cause of action brought pursuant to a federal statute.  Punitive damages are appropriate relief, the Eighth Circuit held, because they are an integral part of the common law tradition and the judicial arsenal, 257 F. 3d 738, 745 (2001), and Congress did nothing to disturb this tradition in enacting or amending the relevant statutes,

 (Title I), we have regularly applied the contract-law analogy in cases defining the scope of conduct for which funding recipients may be held liable for money damages.  Thus, a recipient may be held liable to third-party beneficiaries for intentional conduct that violates the clear terms of the relevant statute, 
				<em>
					Davis
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 642, but not for its failure to comply with vague language describing the objectives of the statute, 
				<em>
					Pennhurst
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 2425; and, if the statute implies that only violations brought to the attention of an official with power to correct them are actionable, not for conduct unknown to any such official, see 
				<em>
					Gebser
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 290.  We have also applied the contract-law analogy in finding a damages remedy available in private suits under Spending Clause legislation.  
				<em>
					Franklin

				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 7475.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The same analogy applies, we think, in determining the 
				<em>
					scope
				</em>
				 of damages remedies.  We said as much in 
				<em>
					Gebser:
				</em>
				 Title IXs contractual nature has implications for our construction of the scope of available remedies.  524 U. S., at 287.  One of these implications, we believe, is that a remedy is appropriate relief, 
				<em>
					Franklin
				</em>
				, 503 U. S., at 73, only if the funding recipient is 
				<em>
					on notice
				</em>
				 that, by accepting federal funding, it exposes itself to liability of that nature.  A funding recipient is generally on notice that it is subject not only to those remedies explicitly provided in the relevant legislation, but also to those remedies traditionally available in suits for breach of contract.  Thus we have held that under Title IX, which contains no express remedies, a recipient of federal funds is nevertheless subject to suit for compensatory damages, 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 76, and injunction, 
				<em>
					Cannon
				</em>
				, 441 U. S., at 711712, forms of relief traditionally available in suits for breach of contract.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, Restatement
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				(Second) of Contracts §357 (1981); 3 S. Williston, Law of Contracts §§14451450 (1920); J. Pomeroy, A
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				Treatise on the Specific Performance of Contracts 15 (1879).  Like Title IX, Title VI mentions no remediesindeed, it fails to mention even a private right of action (hence this Courts decision finding an 
				<em>
					implied
				</em>
				 right of action in 
				<em>
					Cannon
				</em>
				).  But punitive damages, unlike compensatory damages and injunction, are generally not available for breach of contract, see 3 E. Farnsworth, Contracts §12.8, 192201 (2d ed. 1998); Restatement (Second) of Contracts §355; 1 T. Sedgwick, Measure of Damages §370 (8th ed. 1891).

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Nor (if such an interpretive technique were available) could an 
				<em>
					implied
				</em>
				 punitive damages provision reasonably be found in Title VI.  Some authorities say that reasonably implied contractual terms are those that the parties would have agreed to if they had adverted to the matters in question.  See 2 Farnsworth, 
				<em>
					supra, 
				</em>
				§7.16, at 335, and authorities cited.  More recent commentary suggests that reasonably implied contractual terms are simply those that compor[t] with community standards of fairness, Restatement (Second) of Contracts §204, Comment

						 Justice Stevens believes that our reliance on Pennhurst is inappropriate because that case addressed legislation imposing affirmative obligations on recipients whereas Title VI  simply prohibit[s] certain discriminatory conduct.   Post, at 2.  He does not explain why he thinks this distinctionwhich played no role in the Courts application of contract-law principles in Pennhurst, 451 U. S., at 2425ought to make a difference.  Whatever his reason, we have regularly applied Pennhursts contract analogy to legislation that  simply prohibit[s] certain discriminatory conduct.   See, e.g., Davis v. Monroe County Bd. of Ed.,

						 We cannot understand Justice Stevens Chicken-Little statement that todays decision has potentially far-reaching consequences that go well beyond the issues briefed and argued in this case.  Post, at 3.  Our decision merely applies a principle expressed and applied many times before: that the contractual nature of Spending Clause legislation has implications for our construction of the scope of available remedies.  Gebser, 524 U. S., at 287 (emphasis added).  We do not imply, for example, that suits under Spending Clause legislation are suits in contract, or that contract-law principles apply to all issues that they raise.  Since Justice Stevens is unable to identify any far-reaching consequenc[e] that might reasonably follow from our decision today, and since we are merely occupying ground that the Court has long held, we surely do not deserve his praise that we are fearless crusaders, post, at 3, n. 3.

						 Justice Stevens believes that our analysis of Title VI does not carry over to the ADA because the latter is not Spending Clause legislation, and identifies tortious conduct.  Post, at 2, 3, n. 2.  Perhaps he thinks that it should not carry over, but that is a question for Congress, and Congress has unequivocally said otherwise.  The ADA could not be clearer that the remedies, procedures, and rights … this subchapter provides for violations of §202 are the same as the remedies, procedures, and rights set forth in §505(a)(2) of the Rehabilitation Act, which is Spending Clause legislation.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/12133.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §12133</a>.  Section 505(a)(2), in turn, explains that the remedies, procedures, and rights set forth in title VI … shall be available for violations of §504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/29/794a.html#a_2" class="subref" title="subref">29 U. S. C. §794a(a)(2)</a>.  These explicit provisions make discussion of the ADAs status as a non Spending Clause tort statute quite irrelevant.

						 Justice Stevens suggests that our decision likewise rests on a theory neither presented nor passed on below.  Post, at 12.  But the parties raised, and the courts below passed on, the applicability of Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/503/60" class="subref" title="subref">503 U. S. 60</a> (1992)

That case addressed Spending Clause legislation (Title IX) and cited the contract-analogy discussion in Pennhurst as the basis for its acknowledgment of a notice requirement.  See 503 U.

				Respondent Jeffrey Gorman, a paraplegic, is confined to a wheelchair and lacks voluntary control over his lower torso, including his bladder, forcing him to wear a catheter attached to a urine bag around his waist.  In May 1992, he was arrested for trespass after fighting with a bouncer at a Kansas City, Missouri, nightclub.  While waiting for a police van to transport him to the station, he was denied permission to use a restroom to empty his urine bag.  When the van arrived, it was not equipped to receive respondents wheelchair.  Over respondents objection, the officers removed him from his wheelchair and used a seatbelt and his own belt to strap him to a narrow bench in the rear of the van.  During the ride to the police station, respondent released his seatbelt, fearing it placed excessive pressure on his urine bag.  Eventually, the other belt came loose and respondent fell to the floor, rupturing his urine bag and injuring his shoulder and back.  The driver, the only officer in the van, finding it impossible to lift respondent, fastened him to a support for the remainder of the trip.  Upon arriving at the station, respondent was booked, processed, and released; later he was convicted of misdemeanor trespass.  After these events, respondent suffered serious medical problemsincluding a bladder infection, serious lower back pain, and uncontrollable spasms in his paralyzed areasthat left him unable to work full time.

				Respondent brought suit against petitionersmembers of the Kansas City Board of Police Commissioners, the chief of police, and the officer who drove the vanin the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri.  The suit claimed petitioners had discriminated against respondent on the basis of his disability, in violation of §202 of the ADA and §504 of the Rehabilitation Act, by failing to maintain appropriate policies for the arrest and transportation of persons with spinal cord injuries.

				A jury found petitioners liable and awarded over $1 million in compensatory damages and $1.2 million in punitive damages.  The District Court vacated the punitive damages award, holding that punitive damages are unavailable in suits under §202 of the ADA and §504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed, relying on this Courts decision in

, which stated the general rule that absent clear direction to the contrary by Congress, the federal courts have the power to award any appropriate relief in a cognizable cause of action brought pursuant to a federal statute.  Punitive damages are appropriate relief, the Eighth Circuit held, because they are an integral part of the common law tradition and the judicial arsenal, 257 F. 3d 738, 745 (2001), and Congress did nothing to disturb this tradition in enacting or amending the relevant statutes,

				The same analogy applies, we think, in determining the

				 Title IXs contractual nature has implications for our construction of the scope of available remedies.  524 U. S., at 287.  One of these implications, we believe, is that a remedy is appropriate relief,

A funding recipient is generally on notice that it is subject not only to those remedies explicitly provided in the relevant legislation, but also to those remedies traditionally available in suits for breach of contract.  Thus we have held that under Title IX, which contains no express remedies, a recipient of federal funds is nevertheless subject to suit for compensatory damages,

				if punitive damages liability was a required condition.  Without doubt, the scope of potential damages liability is one of the most significant factors a school would consider in deciding whether to receive federal funds.

In sum, it must be concluded that Title VI funding recipients have not, merely by accepting funds, implicitly consented to liability for punitive damages.

						 Justice Stevens believes that our reliance on Pennhurst is inappropriate because that case addressed legislation imposing affirmative obligations on recipients whereas Title VI  simply prohibit[s] certain discriminatory conduct.   Post, at 2.  He does not explain why he thinks this distinctionwhich played no role in the Courts application of contract-law principles in Pennhurst, 451 U. S., at 2425ought to make a difference.  Whatever his reason, we have regularly applied Pennhursts contract analogy to legislation that  simply prohibit[s] certain discriminatory conduct.   See, e.g., Davis v.

						 We cannot understand Justice Stevens Chicken-Little statement that todays decision has potentially far-reaching consequences that go well beyond the issues briefed and argued in this case.  Post, at 3.  Our decision merely applies a principle expressed and applied many times before: that the contractual nature of Spending Clause legislation has implications for our construction of the scope of available remedies.  Gebser, 524 U. S., at 287 (emphasis added).  We do not imply, for example, that suits under Spending Clause legislation are suits in contract, or that contract-law principles apply to all issues that they raise.  Since Justice Stevens is unable to identify any far-reaching consequenc[e] that might reasonably follow from our decision today, and since we are merely occupying ground that the Court has long held, we surely do not deserve his praise that we are fearless crusaders, post, at 3, n. 3.

						 Justice Stevens believes that our analysis of Title VI does not carry over to the ADA because the latter is not Spending Clause legislation, and identifies tortious conduct.  Post, at 2, 3, n. 2.  Perhaps he thinks that it should not carry over, but that is a question for Congress, and Congress has unequivocally said otherwise.  The ADA could not be clearer that the remedies, procedures, and rights … this subchapter provides for violations of §202 are the same as the remedies, procedures, and rights set forth in §505(a)(2) of the Rehabilitation Act, which is Spending Clause legislation.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/12133.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §12133</a>.  Section 505(a)(2), in turn, explains that the remedies, procedures, and rights set forth in title VI … shall be available for violations of §504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/29/794a.html#a_2" class="subref" title="subref">29 U. S. C. §794a(a)(2)</a>.  These explicit provisions make discussion of the ADAs status as a non Spending Clause tort statute quite irrelevant.

						 Justice Stevens suggests that our decision likewise rests on a theory neither presented nor passed on below.  Post, at 12.  But the parties raised, and the courts below passed on, the applicability of Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/503/60" class="subref" title="subref">503 U. S. 60</a> (1992)

That case addressed Spending Clause legislation (Title IX) and cited the contract-analogy discussion in Pennhurst as the basis for its acknowledgment of a notice requirement.  See 503 U. S., at 7475.  Respondent did argue (quite correctly) that petitioners had failed to rely on the Newport ground that the dissent uses, Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc.,

				Respondent Jeffrey Gorman, a paraplegic, is confined to a wheelchair and lacks voluntary control over his lower torso, including his bladder, forcing him to wear a catheter attached to a urine bag around his waist.  In May 1992, he was arrested for trespass after fighting with a bouncer at a Kansas City, Missouri, nightclub.  While waiting for a police van to transport him to the station, he was denied permission to use a restroom to empty his urine bag.  When the van arrived, it was not equipped to receive respondents wheelchair.  Over respondents objection, the officers removed him from his wheelchair and used a seatbelt and his own belt to strap him to a narrow bench in the rear of the van.  During the ride to the police station, respondent released his seatbelt, fearing it placed excessive pressure on his urine bag.  Eventually, the other belt came loose and respondent fell to the floor, rupturing his urine bag and injuring his shoulder and back.  The driver, the only officer in the van, finding it impossible to lift respondent, fastened him to a support for the remainder of the trip.  Upon arriving at the station, respondent was booked, processed, and released; later he was convicted of misdemeanor trespass.  After these events, respondent suffered serious medical problemsincluding a bladder infection, serious lower back pain, and uncontrollable spasms in his paralyzed areasthat left him unable to work full time.

				Respondent brought suit against petitionersmembers of the Kansas City Board of Police Commissioners, the chief of police, and the officer who drove the vanin the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri.  The suit claimed petitioners had discriminated against respondent on the basis of his disability, in violation of §202 of the ADA and §504 of the Rehabilitation Act, by failing to maintain appropriate policies for the arrest and transportation of persons with spinal cord injuries.

				A jury found petitioners liable and awarded over $1 million in compensatory damages and $1.2 million in punitive damages.  The District Court vacated the punitive damages award, holding that punitive damages are unavailable in suits under §202 of the ADA and §504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed, relying on this Courts decision in

, which stated the general rule that absent clear direction to the contrary by Congress, the federal courts have the power to award any appropriate relief in a cognizable cause of action brought pursuant to a federal statute.  Punitive damages are appropriate relief, the Eighth Circuit held, because they are an integral part of the common law tradition and the judicial arsenal, 257 F. 3d 738, 745 (2001), and Congress did nothing to disturb this tradition in enacting or amending the relevant statutes,

				The same analogy applies, we think, in determining the 
				<em>
					scope
				</em>
				 of damages remedies.  We said as much in 
				<em>
					Gebser:
				</em>
				 Title IXs contractual nature has implications for our construction of the scope of available remedies.  524 U. S., at 287.  One of these implications, we believe, is that a remedy is appropriate relief, 
				<em>
					Franklin
				</em>
				, 503 U. S., at 73, only if the funding recipient is 
				<em>
					on notice
				</em>
				 that, by accepting federal funding, it exposes itself to liability of that nature.  A funding recipient is generally on notice that it is subject not only to those remedies explicitly provided in the relevant legislation, but also to those remedies traditionally available in suits for breach of contract.  Thus we have held that under Title IX, which contains no express remedies, a recipient of federal funds is nevertheless subject to suit for compensatory damages, 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 76, and injunction, 
				<em>
					Cannon
				</em>
				, 441 U. S., at 711712, forms of relief traditionally available in suits for breach of contract.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.

				, Restatement
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				(Second) of Contracts §357 (1981); 3 S. Williston, Law of Contracts §§14451450 (1920); J. Pomeroy, A
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				Treatise on the Specific Performance of Contracts 15 (1879).  Like Title IX, Title VI mentions no remediesindeed, it fails to mention even a private right of action (hence this Courts decision finding an 
				<em>
					implied
				</em>
				 right of action in 
				<em>
					Cannon
				</em>
				).  But punitive damages, unlike compensatory damages and injunction, are generally not available for breach of contract, see 3 E. Farnsworth, Contracts §12.8, 192201 (2d ed. 1998); Restatement (Second) of Contracts §355; 1 T. Sedgwick, Measure of Damages §370 (8th ed. 1891).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Nor (if such an interpretive technique were available) could an 
				<em>
					implied
				</em>
				 punitive damages provision reasonably be found in Title VI.  Some authorities say that reasonably implied contractual terms are those that the parties would have agreed to if they had adverted to the matters in question.  See 2 Farnsworth, 
				<em>
					supra, 
				</em>
				§7.16, at 335, and authorities cited.  More recent commentary suggests that reasonably implied contractual terms are simply those that compor[t] with community standards of fairness, Restatement (Second) of Contracts §204, Comment 
				<em>
					d;
				</em>
				 see also 2 Farnsworth, 
				<em>
					supra, 
				</em>
				§7.16, at 334336.  Neither approach would support the implication here of a remedy that is not normally available for contract actions and that is of indeterminate magnitude.  We have acknowledged that compensatory damages alone might well exceed a recipients level of federal funding, 
				<em>
					Gebser
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 290; punitive damages on top of that could well be disastrous.  Not only is it doubtful that funding recipients would have agreed to exposure to such unorthodox and indeterminate liability; it is doubtful whether they would even have 
				<em>
					accepted the funding 
				</em>
				if punitive damages liability was a required condition.  Without doubt, the scope of potential damages liability is one of the most significant factors a school would consider in deciding whether to receive federal funds.  
				<em>
					Davis
				</em>
				, 526 U. S., at 656 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Kennedy
				</span>
				, J., dissenting).  And for the same reason of unusual and disproportionate exposure, it can hardly be said that community standards of fairness support such an implication.  In sum, it must be concluded that Title VI funding recipients have not, merely by accepting funds, implicitly consented to liability for punitive damages.

						 Justice Stevens believes that our reliance on Pennhurst is inappropriate because that case addressed legislation imposing affirmative obligations on recipients whereas Title VI  simply prohibit[s] certain discriminatory conduct.   Post, at 2.  He does not explain why he thinks this distinctionwhich played no role in the Courts application of contract-law principles in Pennhurst, 451 U. S., at 2425ought to make a difference.  Whatever his reason, we have regularly applied Pennhursts contract analogy to legislation that  simply prohibit[s] certain discriminatory conduct.   See, e.g., Davis v. Monroe County Bd. of Ed.,

						 We cannot understand Justice Stevens Chicken-Little statement that todays decision has potentially far-reaching consequences that go well beyond the issues briefed and argued in this case.  Post, at 3.  Our decision merely applies a principle expressed and applied many times before: that the contractual nature of Spending Clause legislation has implications for our construction of the scope of available remedies.  Gebser, 524 U. S., at 287 (emphasis added).  We do not imply, for example, that suits under Spending Clause legislation are suits in contract, or that contract-law principles apply to all issues that they raise.  Since Justice Stevens is unable to identify any far-reaching consequenc[e] that might reasonably follow from our decision today, and since we are merely occupying ground that the Court has long held, we surely do not deserve his praise that we are fearless crusaders, post, at 3, n. 3.

						 Justice Stevens believes that our analysis of Title VI does not carry over to the ADA because the latter is not Spending Clause legislation, and identifies tortious conduct.  Post, at 2, 3, n. 2.  Perhaps he thinks that it should not carry over, but that is a question for Congress, and Congress has unequivocally said otherwise.  The ADA could not be clearer that the remedies, procedures, and rights … this subchapter provides for violations of §202 are the same as the remedies, procedures, and rights set forth in §505(a)(2) of the Rehabilitation Act, which is Spending Clause legislation.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/12133.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §12133</a>.  Section 505(a)(2), in turn, explains that the remedies, procedures, and rights set forth in title VI … shall be available for violations of §504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/29/794a.html#a_2" class="subref" title="subref">29 U. S. C. §794a(a)(2)</a>.  These explicit provisions make discussion of the ADAs status as a non Spending Clause tort statute quite irrelevant.

						 Justice Stevens suggests that our decision likewise rests on a theory neither presented nor passed on below.  Post, at 12.  But the parties raised, and the courts below passed on, the applicability of Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/503/60" class="subref" title="subref">503 U. S. 60</a> (1992)

That case addressed Spending Clause legislation (Title IX) and cited the contract-analogy discussion in Pennhurst as the basis for its acknowledgment of a notice requirement.  See 503 U. S., at 7475.  Respondent did argue (quite correctly) that petitioners had failed to rely on the Newport ground that the dissent uses, Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc.,

				Respondent Jeffrey Gorman, a paraplegic, is confined to a wheelchair and lacks voluntary control over his lower torso, including his bladder, forcing him to wear a catheter attached to a urine bag around his waist.  In May 1992, he was arrested for trespass after fighting with a bouncer at a Kansas City, Missouri, nightclub.  While waiting for a police van to transport him to the station, he was denied permission to use a restroom to empty his urine bag.  When the van arrived, it was not equipped to receive respondents wheelchair.  Over respondents objection, the officers removed him from his wheelchair and used a seatbelt and his own belt to strap him to a narrow bench in the rear of the van.  During the ride to the police station, respondent released his seatbelt, fearing it placed excessive pressure on his urine bag.  Eventually, the other belt came loose and respondent fell to the floor, rupturing his urine bag and injuring his shoulder and back.  The driver, the only officer in the van, finding it impossible to lift respondent, fastened him to a support for the remainder of the trip.  Upon arriving at the station, respondent was booked, processed, and released; later he was convicted of misdemeanor trespass.  After these events, respondent suffered serious medical problemsincluding a bladder infection, serious lower back pain, and uncontrollable spasms in his paralyzed areasthat left him unable to work full time.

				Respondent brought suit against petitionersmembers of the Kansas City Board of Police Commissioners, the chief of police, and the officer who drove the vanin the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri.  The suit claimed petitioners had discriminated against respondent on the basis of his disability, in violation of §202 of the ADA and §504 of the Rehabilitation Act, by failing to maintain appropriate policies for the arrest and transportation of persons with spinal cord injuries.

				A jury found petitioners liable and awarded over $1 million in compensatory damages and $1.2 million in punitive damages.

The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed, relying on this Courts decision in

, which stated the general rule that absent clear direction to the contrary by Congress, the federal courts have the power to award any appropriate relief in a cognizable cause of action brought pursuant to a federal statute.  Punitive damages are appropriate relief, the Eighth Circuit held, because they are an integral part of the common law tradition and the judicial arsenal, 257 F. 3d 738, 745 (2001), and Congress did nothing to disturb this tradition in enacting or amending the relevant statutes,

 (Title I), we have regularly applied the contract-law analogy in cases defining the scope of conduct for which funding recipients may be held liable for money damages.  Thus, a recipient may be held liable to third-party beneficiaries for intentional conduct that violates the clear terms of the relevant statute, 
				<em>
					Davis
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 642, but not for its failure to comply with vague language describing the objectives of the statute, 
				<em>
					Pennhurst
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 2425; and, if the statute implies that only violations brought to the attention of an official with power to correct them are actionable, not for conduct unknown to any such official, see 
				<em>
					Gebser
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 290.  We have also applied the contract-law analogy in finding a damages remedy available in private suits under Spending Clause legislation.

				<em>

				The same analogy applies, we think, in determining the 
				<em>
					scope
				</em>
				 of damages remedies.  We said as much in 
				<em>
					Gebser:
				</em>
				 Title IXs contractual nature has implications for our construction of the scope of available remedies.  524 U. S., at 287.  One of these implications, we believe, is that a remedy is appropriate relief, 
				<em>
					Franklin
				</em>
				, 503 U. S., at 73, only if the funding recipient is 
				<em>
					on notice
				</em>
				 that, by accepting federal funding, it exposes itself to liability of that nature.  A funding recipient is generally on notice that it is subject not only to those remedies explicitly provided in the relevant legislation, but also to those remedies traditionally available in suits for breach of contract.  Thus we have held that under Title IX, which contains no express remedies, a recipient of federal funds is nevertheless subject to suit for compensatory damages, 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 76, and injunction, 
				<em>
					Cannon
				</em>
				, 441 U. S., at 711712, forms of relief traditionally available in suits for breach of contract.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, Restatement
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				(Second) of Contracts §357 (1981); 3 S. Williston, Law of Contracts §§14451450 (1920); J. Pomeroy, A
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				Treatise on the Specific Performance of Contracts 15 (1879).  Like Title IX, Title VI mentions no remediesindeed, it fails to mention even a private right of action (hence this Courts decision finding an 
				<em>
					implied
				</em>
				 right of action in 
				<em>
					Cannon
				</em>
				).  But punitive damages, unlike compensatory damages and injunction, are generally not available for breach of contract, see 3 E. Farnsworth, Contracts §12.8, 192201 (2d ed. 1998); Restatement (Second) of Contracts §355; 1 T. Sedgwick, Measure of Damages §370 (8th ed. 1891).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Nor (if such an interpretive technique were available) could an 
				<em>
					implied
				</em>
				 punitive damages provision reasonably be found in Title VI.  Some authorities say that reasonably implied contractual terms are those that the parties would have agreed to if they had adverted to the matters in question.  See 2 Farnsworth, 
				<em>
					supra, 
				</em>
				§7.16, at 335, and authorities cited.  More recent commentary suggests that reasonably implied contractual terms are simply those that compor[t] with community standards of fairness, Restatement (Second) of Contracts §204, Comment 
				<em>
					d;
				</em>
				 see also 2 Farnsworth, 
				<em>
					supra, 
				</em>
				§7.16, at 334336.  Neither approach would support the implication here of a remedy that is not normally available for contract actions and that is of indeterminate magnitude.  We have acknowledged that compensatory damages alone might well exceed a recipients level of federal funding, 
				<em>
					Gebser
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 290; punitive damages on top of that could well be disastrous.  Not only is it doubtful that funding recipients would have agreed to exposure to such unorthodox and indeterminate liability; it is doubtful whether they would even have 
				<em>
					accepted the funding 
				</em>
				if punitive damages liability was a required condition.  Without doubt, the scope of potential damages liability is one of the most significant factors a school would consider in deciding whether to receive federal funds.  
				<em>
					Davis
				</em>
				, 526 U. S., at 656 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Kennedy
				</span>
				, J., dissenting).  And for the same reason of unusual and disproportionate exposure, it can hardly be said that community standards of fairness support such an implication.  In sum, it must be concluded that Title VI funding recipients have not, merely by accepting funds, implicitly consented to liability for punitive damages.

						 Justice Stevens believes that our reliance on Pennhurst is inappropriate because that case addressed legislation imposing affirmative obligations on recipients whereas Title VI  simply prohibit[s] certain discriminatory conduct.   Post, at 2.  He does not explain why he thinks this distinctionwhich played no role in the Courts application of contract-law principles in Pennhurst, 451 U. S., at 2425ought to make a difference.  Whatever his reason, we have regularly applied Pennhursts contract analogy to legislation that  simply prohibit[s] certain discriminatory conduct.   See, e.g., Davis v.

						 We cannot understand Justice Stevens Chicken-Little statement that todays decision has potentially far-reaching consequences that go well beyond the issues briefed and argued in this case.  Post, at 3.  Our decision merely applies a principle expressed and applied many times before: that the contractual nature of Spending Clause legislation has implications for our construction of the scope of available remedies.  Gebser, 524 U. S., at 287 (emphasis added).  We do not imply, for example, that suits under Spending Clause legislation are suits in contract, or that contract-law principles apply to all issues that they raise.  Since Justice Stevens is unable to identify any far-reaching consequenc[e] that might reasonably follow from our decision today, and since we are merely occupying ground that the Court has long held, we surely do not deserve his praise that we are fearless crusaders, post, at 3, n. 3.

						 Justice Stevens believes that our analysis of Title VI does not carry over to the ADA because the latter is not Spending Clause legislation, and identifies tortious conduct.  Post, at 2, 3, n. 2.  Perhaps he thinks that it should not carry over, but that is a question for Congress, and Congress has unequivocally said otherwise.  The ADA could not be clearer that the remedies, procedures, and rights … this subchapter provides for violations of §202 are the same as the remedies, procedures, and rights set forth in §505(a)(2) of the Rehabilitation Act, which is Spending Clause legislation.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/12133.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §12133</a>.  Section 505(a)(2), in turn, explains that the remedies, procedures, and rights set forth in title VI … shall be available for violations of §504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/29/794a.html#a_2" class="subref" title="subref">29 U. S. C. §794a(a)(2)</a>.  These explicit provisions make discussion of the ADAs status as a non Spending Clause tort statute quite irrelevant.

						 Justice Stevens suggests that our decision likewise rests on a theory neither presented nor passed on below.  Post, at 12.  But the parties raised, and the courts below passed on, the applicability of Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/503/60" class="subref" title="subref">503 U. S. 60</a> (1992)

That case addressed Spending Clause legislation (Title IX) and cited the contract-analogy discussion in Pennhurst as the basis for its acknowledgment of a notice requirement.  See 503 U.

				Respondent Jeffrey Gorman, a paraplegic, is confined to a wheelchair and lacks voluntary control over his lower torso, including his bladder, forcing him to wear a catheter attached to a urine bag around his waist.  In May 1992, he was arrested for trespass after fighting with a bouncer at a Kansas City, Missouri, nightclub.  While waiting for a police van to transport him to the station, he was denied permission to use a restroom to empty his urine bag.  When the van arrived, it was not equipped to receive respondents wheelchair.  Over respondents objection, the officers removed him from his wheelchair and used a seatbelt and his own belt to strap him to a narrow bench in the rear of the van.  During the ride to the police station, respondent released his seatbelt, fearing it placed excessive pressure on his urine bag.  Eventually, the other belt came loose and respondent fell to the floor, rupturing his urine bag and injuring his shoulder and back.  The driver, the only officer in the van, finding it impossible to lift respondent, fastened him to a support for the remainder of the trip.  Upon arriving at the station, respondent was booked, processed, and released; later he was convicted of misdemeanor trespass.  After these events, respondent suffered serious medical problemsincluding a bladder infection, serious lower back pain, and uncontrollable spasms in his paralyzed areasthat left him unable to work full time.

				Respondent brought suit against petitionersmembers of the Kansas City Board of Police Commissioners, the chief of police, and the officer who drove the vanin the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri.  The suit claimed petitioners had discriminated against respondent on the basis of his disability, in violation of §202 of the ADA and §504 of the Rehabilitation Act, by failing to maintain appropriate policies for the arrest and transportation of persons with spinal cord injuries.

				A jury found petitioners liable and awarded over $1 million in compensatory damages and $1.2 million in punitive damages.

, which stated the general rule that absent clear direction to the contrary by Congress, the federal courts have the power to award any appropriate relief in a cognizable cause of action brought pursuant to a federal statute.  Punitive damages are appropriate relief, the Eighth Circuit held, because they are an integral part of the common law tradition and the judicial arsenal, 257 F. 3d 738, 745 (2001), and Congress did nothing to disturb this tradition in enacting or amending the relevant statutes,

.  Just as a valid contract requires offer and acceptance of its terms, [t]he legitimacy of Congress power to legislate under the spending power … rests on whether the [recipient] voluntarily and knowingly accepts the terms of the contract. … Accordingly, if Congress intends to impose a condition on the grant of federal moneys, it must do so unambiguously.

 (Title I), we have regularly applied the contract-law analogy in cases defining the scope of conduct for which funding recipients may be held liable for money damages.  Thus, a recipient may be held liable to third-party beneficiaries for intentional conduct that violates the clear terms of the relevant statute, 
				<em>
					Davis
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 642, but not for its failure to comply with vague language describing the objectives of the statute, 
				<em>
					Pennhurst
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 2425; and, if the statute implies that only violations brought to the attention of an official with power to correct them are actionable, not for conduct unknown to any such official, see 
				<em>
					Gebser
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 290.  We have also applied the contract-law analogy in finding a damages remedy available in private suits under Spending Clause legislation.  
				<em>
					Franklin
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 7475.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The same analogy applies, we think, in determining the 
				<em>
					scope
				</em>
				 of damages remedies.  We said as much in 
				<em>
					Gebser:
				</em>
				 Title IXs contractual nature has implications for our construction of the scope of available remedies.  524 U. S., at 287.  One of these implications, we believe, is that a remedy is appropriate relief, 
				<em>
					Franklin
				</em>
				, 503 U. S., at 73, only if the funding recipient is 
				<em>
					on notice
				</em>
				 that, by accepting federal funding, it exposes itself to liability of that nature.  A funding recipient is generally on notice that it is subject not only to those remedies explicitly provided in the relevant legislation, but also to those remedies traditionally available in suits for breach of contract.  Thus we have held that under Title IX, which contains no express remedies, a recipient of federal funds is nevertheless subject to suit for compensatory damages, 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 76, and injunction, 
				<em>
					Cannon
				</em>
				, 441 U. S., at 711712, forms of relief traditionally available in suits for breach of contract.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, Restatement
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				(Second) of Contracts §357 (1981); 3 S. Williston, Law of Contracts §§14451450 (1920); J. Pomeroy, A
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				Treatise on the Specific Performance of Contracts 15 (1879).  Like Title IX, Title VI mentions no remediesindeed, it fails to mention even a private right of action (hence this Courts decision finding an 
				<em>
					implied
				</em>
				 right of action in 
				<em>
					Cannon
				</em>
				).  But punitive damages, unlike compensatory damages and injunction, are generally not available for breach of contract, see 3 E. Farnsworth, Contracts §12.8, 192201 (2d ed. 1998); Restatement (Second) of Contracts §355; 1 T. Sedgwick, Measure of Damages §370 (8th ed. 1891).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Nor (if such an interpretive technique were available) could an 
				<em>
					implied
				</em>
				 punitive damages provision reasonably be found in Title VI.  Some authorities say that reasonably implied contractual terms are those that the parties would have agreed to if they had adverted to the matters in question.  See 2 Farnsworth, 
				<em>
					supra, 
				</em>
				§7.16, at 335, and authorities cited.  More recent commentary suggests that reasonably implied contractual terms are simply those that compor[t] with community standards of fairness, Restatement (Second) of Contracts §204, Comment 
				<em>
					d;
				</em>
				 see also 2 Farnsworth, 
				<em>
					supra, 
				</em>
				§7.16, at 334336.  Neither approach would support the implication here of a remedy that is not normally available for contract actions and that is of indeterminate magnitude.  We have acknowledged that compensatory damages alone might well exceed a recipients level of federal funding, 
				<em>
					Gebser
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 290; punitive damages on top of that could well be disastrous.  Not only is it doubtful that funding recipients would have agreed to exposure to such unorthodox and indeterminate liability; it is doubtful whether they would even have 
				<em>
					accepted the funding 
				</em>
				if punitive damages liability was a required condition.  Without doubt, the scope of potential damages liability is one of the most significant factors a school would consider in deciding whether to receive federal funds.  
				<em>
					Davis
				</em>
				, 526 U. S., at 656 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Kennedy
				</span>
				, J., dissenting).  And for the same reason of unusual and disproportionate exposure, it can hardly be said that community standards of fairness support such an implication.  In sum, it must be concluded that Title VI funding recipients have not, merely by accepting funds, implicitly consented to liability for punitive damages.

				</em>
				 the Federal Government or a third-party beneficiary (as in this case) for the loss caused by that failure.  See

Punitive damages are not compensatory, and are therefore not embraced within the rule described in

						 Justice Stevens believes that our reliance on Pennhurst is inappropriate because that case addressed legislation imposing affirmative obligations on recipients whereas Title VI  simply prohibit[s] certain discriminatory conduct.   Post, at 2.  He does not explain why he thinks this distinctionwhich played no role in the Courts application of contract-law principles in Pennhurst, 451 U. S., at 2425ought to make a difference.  Whatever his reason, we have regularly applied Pennhursts contract analogy to legislation that  simply prohibit[s] certain discriminatory conduct.   See, e.g., Davis v. Monroe County Bd. of Ed.,

						 We cannot understand Justice Stevens Chicken-Little statement that todays decision has potentially far-reaching consequences that go well beyond the issues briefed and argued in this case.  Post, at 3.  Our decision merely applies a principle expressed and applied many times before: that the contractual nature of Spending Clause legislation has implications for our construction of the scope of available remedies.  Gebser, 524 U. S., at 287 (emphasis added).  We do not imply, for example, that suits under Spending Clause legislation are suits in contract, or that contract-law principles apply to all issues that they raise.  Since Justice Stevens is unable to identify any far-reaching consequenc[e] that might reasonably follow from our decision today, and since we are merely occupying ground that the Court has long held, we surely do not deserve his praise that we are fearless crusaders, post, at 3, n. 3.

						 Justice Stevens believes that our analysis of Title VI does not carry over to the ADA because the latter is not Spending Clause legislation, and identifies tortious conduct.  Post, at 2, 3, n. 2.  Perhaps he thinks that it should not carry over, but that is a question for Congress, and Congress has unequivocally said otherwise.  The ADA could not be clearer that the remedies, procedures, and rights … this subchapter provides for violations of §202 are the same as the remedies, procedures, and rights set forth in §505(a)(2) of the Rehabilitation Act, which is Spending Clause legislation.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/12133.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. §12133</a>.  Section 505(a)(2), in turn, explains that the remedies, procedures, and rights set forth in title VI … shall be available for violations of §504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/29/794a.html#a_2" class="subref" title="subref">29 U. S. C. §794a(a)(2)</a>.  These explicit provisions make discussion of the ADAs status as a non Spending Clause tort statute quite irrelevant.

						 Justice Stevens suggests that our decision likewise rests on a theory neither presented nor passed on below.  Post, at 12.  But the parties raised, and the courts below passed on, the applicability of Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/503/60" class="subref" title="subref">503 U. S. 60</a> (1992)
, to the question presented.  That case addressed Spending Clause legislation (Title IX) and cited the contract-analogy discussion in Pennhurst as the basis for its acknowledgment of a notice requirement.  See 503 U. S., at 7475.  Respondent did argue (quite correctly) that petitioners had failed to rely on the Newport ground that the dissent uses, Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc.,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">262</a>263 (1981)
, see Brief for Respondent 4143, but not that they had failed to rely on the contract analogy initiated in Pennhurst, Brief for Respondent 3541.

				The State of Ohio has established a pilot program designed to provide educational choices to families with children who reside in the Cleveland City School District.  The question presented is whether this program offends the Establishment Clause of the United States Constitution.  We hold that it does not.

				There are more than 75,000 children enrolled in the Cleveland City School District.  The majority of these children are from low-income and minority families.  Few of these families enjoy the means to send their children to any school other than an inner-city public school.  For more than a generation, however, Clevelands public schools have been among the worst performing public schools in the Nation.  In 1995, a Federal District Court declared a crisis of magnitude and placed the entire Cleveland school district under state control.  See 
				<em>
					Reed 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					Rhodes
				</em>
				, No. 1:73 CV 1300 (ND Ohio, Mar. 3, 1995).  Shortly thereafter, the state auditor found that Clevelands public schools were in the midst of a crisis that is perhaps unprecedented in the history of American education.  Cleveland City School District Performance Audit 21 (Mar. 1996).  The district had failed to meet any of the 18 state standards for minimal acceptable performance.  Only 1 in 10 ninth graders could pass a basic proficiency examination, and students at all levels performed at a dismal rate compared with students in other Ohio public schools.  More than two-thirds of high school students either dropped or failed out before graduation.  Of those students who managed to reach their senior year, one of every four still failed to graduate.  Of those students who did graduate, few could read, write, or compute at levels comparable to their counterparts in other cities.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It is against this backdrop that Ohio enacted, among other initiatives, its Pilot Project Scholarship Program, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §§3313.9743313.979 (Anderson 1999 and Supp. 2000) (program).  The program provides financial assistance to families in any Ohio school district that is or has been under federal court order requiring supervision and operational management of the district by the state superintendent.  §3313.975(A).  Cleveland is the only Ohio school district to fall within that category.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The program provides two basic kinds of assistance to parents of children in a covered district.  First, the program provides tuition aid for students in kindergarten through third grade, expanding each year through eighth grade, to attend a participating public or private school of their parents choosing.  §§3313.975(B) and (C)(1).  Second, the program provides tutorial aid for students who choose to remain enrolled in public school.  §3313.975(A).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The tuition aid portion of the program is designed to provide educational choices to parents who reside in a covered district.  Any private school, whether religious or nonreligious, may participate in the program and accept program students so long as the school is located within the boundaries of a covered district and meets statewide educational standards.  §313.976(A)(3).  Participating private schools must agree not to discriminate on the basis of race, religion, or ethnic background, or to advocate or foster unlawful behavior or teach hatred of any person or group on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion.  §3313.976(A)(6).  Any public school located in a school district adjacent to the covered district may also participate in the program.  §3313.976(C).  Adjacent public schools are eligible to receive a $2,250 tuition grant for each program student accepted in addition to the full amount of per-pupil state funding attributable to each additional student.  §§3313.976(C), 3317.03(I)(1).

				  All participating schools, whether public or private, are required to accept students in accordance with rules and procedures established by the state superintendent.  §§3313.977(A)(1)(a)(c).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Tuition aid is distributed to parents according to financial need.  Families with incomes below 200% of the poverty line are given priority and are eligible to receive 90% of private school tuition up to $2,250.  §§3313.978(A) and (C)(1).  For these lowest-income families, participating private schools may not charge a parental co-payment greater than $250.  §3313.976(A)(8).  For all other families, the program pays 75% of tuition costs, up to $1,875, with no co-payment cap.  §§3313.976(A)(8), 3313.978(A).  These families receive tuition aid only if the number of available scholarships exceeds the number of low-income children who choose to participate.

				  Where tuition aid is spent depends solely upon where parents who receive tuition aid choose to enroll their child.  If parents choose a private school, checks are made payable to the parents who then endorse the checks over to the chosen school.  §3313.979.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The tutorial aid portion of the program provides tutorial assistance through grants to any student in a covered district who chooses to remain in public school.  Parents arrange for registered tutors to provide assistance to their children and then submit bills for those services to the State for payment.  §§3313.976(D), 3313.979(C).  Students from low-income families receive 90% of the amount charged for such assistance up to $360.  All other students receive 75% of that amount.  §3313.978(B).  The number of tutorial assistance grants offered to students in a covered district must equal the number of tuition aid scholarships provided to students enrolled at participating private or adjacent public schools.  §3313.975(A).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The program has been in operation within the Cleveland City School District since the 19961997 school year.  In the 19992000 school year, 56 private schools participated in the program, 46 (or 82%) of which had a religious affiliation.  None of the public schools in districts adjacent to Cleveland have elected to participate.  More than 3,700 students participated in the scholarship program, most of whom (96%) enrolled in religiously affiliated schools.  Sixty percent of these students were from families at or below the poverty line.  In the 19981999 school year, approximately 1,400 Cleveland public school students received tutorial aid.  This number was expected to double during the 19992000 school year.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The program is part of a broader undertaking by the State to enhance the educational options of Clevelands schoolchildren in response to the 1995 takeover.  That undertaking includes programs governing community and magnet schools.  Community schools are funded under state law but are run by their own school boards, not by local school districts.  §§3314.01(B), 3314.04.  These schools enjoy academic independence to hire their own teachers and to determine their own curriculum.  They can have no religious affiliation and are required to accept students by lottery.  During the 19992000 school year, there were 10 start-up community schools in the Cleveland City School District with more than 1,900 students enrolled.  For each child enrolled in a community school, the school receives state funding of $4,518, twice the funding a participating program school may receive.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Magnet schools are public schools operated by a local school board that emphasize a particular subject area, teaching method, or service to students.  For each student enrolled in a magnet school, the school district receives $7,746, including state funding of $4,167, the same amount received per student enrolled at a traditional public school.  As of 1999, parents in Cleveland were able to choose from among 23 magnet schools, which together enrolled more than 13,000 students in kindergarten through eighth grade.  These schools provide specialized teaching methods, such as Montessori, or a particularized curriculum focus, such as foreign language, computers, or the arts.

				In 1996, respondents, a group of Ohio taxpayers, challenged the Ohio program in state court on state and federal grounds.  The Ohio Supreme Court rejected respondents federal claims, but held that the enactment of the program violated certain procedural requirements of the Ohio Constitution.

				, 86 Ohio St. 3d 1, 89, 711 N. E. 2d 203, 211 (1999).  The state legislature immediately cured this defect, leaving the basic provisions discussed above intact.

				In July 1999, respondents filed this action in United States District Court, seeking to enjoin the reenacted program on the ground that it violated the Establishment Clause of the United States Constitution.  In August 1999, the District Court issued a preliminary injunction barring further implementation of the program, 54 F. Supp. 2d 725 (ND Ohio), which we stayed pending review by the Court of Appeals, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/528/983" class="subref" title="subref">528 U. S. 983</a> (1999)
.  In December 1999, the District Court granted summary judgment for respondents.  72 F. Supp. 2d 834.  In December 2000, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the District Court, finding that the program had the primary effect of advancing religion in violation of the Establishment Clause.  234 F. 3d 945 (CA6).  The Court of Appeals stayed its mandate pending disposition in this Court.  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 011779, p. 151.  We granted certiorari,

				<em>

				<em>

				our jurisprudence with respect to true private choice programs has remained consistent and unbroken.

Three times we have rejected such challenges.

				In 
				<em>
					Mueller
				</em>
				, we rejected an Establishment Clause challenge to a Minnesota program authorizing tax deductions for various educational expenses, including private school tuition costs, even though the great majority of the programs beneficiaries (96%) were parents of children in religious schools.  We began by focusing on the class of beneficiaries, finding that because the class included 
				<em>
					all
				</em>
				 parents, including parents with children [who] attend nonsectarian private schools or sectarian private schools, 463 U. S., at 397 (emphasis in original), the program was not readily subject to challenge under the Establishment Clause,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">274</a> (1981)
 (The provision of benefits to so broad a spectrum of groups is an important index of secular effect)).  Then, viewing the program as a whole, we emphasized the principle of private choice, noting that public funds were made available to religious schools only as a result of numerous, private choices of individual parents of school-age children.  463 U. S., at 399400.  This, we said, ensured that  no imprimatur of state approval can be deemed to have been conferred on any particular religion, or on religion generally.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 399 (quoting 
				<em>
					Widmar, supra
				</em>
				, at 274)).  We thus found it irrelevant to the constitutional inquiry that the vast majority of beneficiaries were parents of children in religious schools, saying:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				We would be loath to adopt a rule grounding the constitutionality of a facially neutral law on annual reports reciting the extent to which various classes of private citizens claimed benefits under the law.  463 U. S., at 401.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
That the program was one of true private choice, with no evidence that the State deliberately skewed incentives toward religious schools, was sufficient for the program to survive scrutiny under the Establishment Clause.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In 
				<em>
					Witters
				</em>
				, we used identical reasoning to reject an Establishment Clause challenge to a vocational scholarship program that provided tuition aid to a student studying at a religious institution to become a pastor.  Looking at the program as a whole, we observed that [a]ny aid … that ultimately flows to religious institutions does so only as a result of the genuinely independent and private choices of aid recipients.  474 U. S., at 487.  We further remarked that, as in 
				<em>
					Mueller
				</em>
				, [the] program is made available generally without regard to the sectarian-nonsectarian, or public-nonpublic nature of the institution benefited.  474 U. S., at 487.  In light of these factors, we held that the program was not inconsistent with the Establishment Clause.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 488489.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Five Members of the Court, in separate opinions, emphasized the general rule from 
				<em>
					Mueller 
				</em>
				that the amount of government aid channeled to religious institutions by individual aid recipients was not relevant to the constitutional inquiry.  474 U. S., at 490491 (Powell, J., joined by Burger, C. J., and 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Rehnquist
				</span>
				, J., concurring) (citing 
				<em>
					Mueller, supra
				</em>
				, at 398399); 474 U. S., at 493 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					OConnor
				</span>
				, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 490 (White, J., concurring).  Our holding thus rested not on whether few or many recipients chose to expend government aid at a religious school but, rather, on whether recipients generally were empowered to direct the aid to schools or institutions of their own choosing.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Finally, in 
				<em>
					Zobrest
				</em>
				, we applied 
				<em>
					Mueller
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Witters
				</em>
				 to reject an Establishment Clause challenge to a federal program that permitted sign-language interpreters to assist deaf children enrolled in religious schools.  Reviewing our earlier decisions, we stated that government programs that neutrally provide benefits to a broad class of citizens defined without reference to religion are not readily subject to an Establishment Clause challenge.  509 U. S., at 8.  Looking once again to the challenged program as a whole
				<em>
					,
				</em>
				 we observed that the program distributes benefits neutrally to any child qualifying as disabled.   
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 10.  Its primary beneficiaries, we said, were disabled children, not sectarian schools.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 12.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We further observed that [b]y according parents freedom to select a school of their choice, the statute ensures that a government-paid interpreter will be present in a sectarian school only as a result of the private decision of individual parents.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 10.  Our focus again was on neutrality and the principle of private choice, not on the number of program beneficiaries attending religious schools.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 1011.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Agostini,
				</em>
				 521 U. S
				<em>
					.,
				</em>
				 at 229 (
				<em>
					Zobrest
				</em>
				 did not turn on the fact that James Zobrest had, at the time of litigation, been the only child using a publicly funded sign-language interpreter to attend a parochial school).  Because the program ensured that parents were the ones to select a religious school as the best learning environment for their handicapped child, the circuit between government and religion was broken, and the Establishment Clause was not implicated.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>
					Mueller
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Witters
				</em>
				, and 
				<em>
					Zobrest
				</em>
				 thus make clear that where a government aid program is neutral with respect to religion, and provides assistance directly to a broad class of citizens who, in turn, direct government aid to religious schools wholly as a result of their own genuine and independent private choice, the program is not readily subject to challenge under the Establishment Clause.  A program that shares these features permits government aid to reach religious institutions only by way of the deliberate choices of numerous individual recipients.  The incidental advancement of a religious mission, or the perceived endorsement of a religious message, is reasonably attributable to the individual recipient, not to the government, whose role ends with the disbursement of benefits.  As a plurality of this Court recently observed:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				[I]f numerous private choices, rather than the single choice of a government, determine the distribution of aid, pursuant to neutral eligibility criteria, then a government cannot, or at least cannot easily, grant special favors that might lead to a religious establishment.

					Mitchell,

				 530 U. S., at 810.

				We believe that the program challenged here is a program of true private choice, consistent with 
				<em>
					Mueller

				, 
				<em>
					Witters

				, and 
				<em>
					Zobrest
				</em>
				, and thus constitutional.  As was true in those cases, the Ohio program is neutral in all respects toward religion.  It is part of a general and multifaceted undertaking by the State of Ohio to provide educational opportunities to the children of a failed school district.  It confers educational assistance directly to a broad class of individuals defined without reference to religion, 
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, any parent of a school-age child who resides in the Cleveland City School District.  The program permits the participation of 
				<em>
					all
				</em>
				 schools within the district, religious or nonreligious.  Adjacent public schools also may participate and have a financial incentive to do so.  Program benefits are available to participating families on neutral terms, with no reference to religion.  The only preference stated anywhere in the program is a preference for low-income families, who receive greater assistance and are given priority for admission at participating schools.

				incentives for religious schools, with private schools receiving only half the government assistance given to community schools and one-third the assistance given to magnet schools.  Adjacent public schools, should any choose to accept program students, are also eligible to receive two to three times the state funding of a private religious school.  Families too have a financial disincentive to choose a private religious school over other schools.  Parents that choose to participate in the scholarship program and then to enroll their children in a private school (religious or nonreligious) must copay a portion of the schools tuition.  Families that choose a community school, magnet school, or traditional public school pay nothing.  Although such features of the program are not necessary to its constitutionality, they clearly dispel the claim that the program creates … financial incentive[s] for parents to choose a sectarian school.

				Respondents suggest that even without a financial incentive for parents to choose a religious school, the program creates a public perception that the State is endorsing religious practices and beliefs.  Brief for Respondents Simmons-Harris et al. 3738.

				There also is no evidence that the program fails to provide genuine opportunities for Cleveland parents to select secular educational options for their school-age children.  Cleveland schoolchildren enjoy a range of educational choices: They may remain in public school as before, remain in public school with publicly funded tutoring aid, obtain a scholarship and choose a religious school, obtain a scholarship and choose a nonreligious private school, enroll in a community school, or enroll in a magnet school.  That 46 of the 56 private schools now participating in the program are religious schools does not condemn it as a violation of the Establishment Clause.  The Establishment Clause question is whether Ohio is coercing parents into sending their children to religious schools, and that question must be answered by evaluating 
				<em>
					all
				</em>
				 options Ohio provides Cleveland schoolchildren, only one of which is to obtain a program scholarship and then choose a religious school.

				  But Clevelands preponderance of religiously affiliated private schools certainly did not arise as a result of the program; it is a phenomenon common to many American cities.  See U. S. Dept. of Ed., National Center for Education Statistics, Private School Universe Survey: 19992000, pp. 24 (NCES 2001330, 2001) (hereinafter Private School Universe Survey) (cited in Brief for United States as 
				<em>
					Amicus Curiae
				</em>
				 24).  Indeed, by all accounts the program has captured a remarkable cross-section of private schools, religious and nonreligious.  It is true that 82% of Clevelands participating private schools are religious schools, but it is also true that 81% of private schools in Ohio are religious schools.  See Brief for State of Florida et al. as 
				<em>
					Amici Curiae
				</em>
				 16 (citing Private School Universe Survey).  To attribute constitutional significance to this figure, moreover, would lead to the absurd result that a neutral school-choice program might be permissible in some parts of Ohio, such as Columbus, where a lower percentage of private schools are religious schools, see Ohio Educational Directory (Lodging of Respondents Gatton et al., available in Clerk of Courts case file), and Reply Brief for Petitioners in No. 001751, p. 12, n. 1, but not in inner-city Cleveland, where Ohio has deemed such programs most sorely needed, but where the preponderance of religious schools happens to be greater.  Cf. Brief for State of Florida et al. as 
				<em>
					Amici Curiae
				</em>
				 17 ([T]he percentages of sectarian to nonsectarian private schools within Floridas 67 school districts … vary from zero to 100 percent).  Likewise, an identical private choice program might be constitutional in some States, such as Maine or Utah, where less than 45% of private schools are religious schools, but not in other States, such as Nebraska or Kansas, where over 90% of private schools are religious schools.

				Respondents and

				claim that even if we do not focus on the number of participating schools that are religious schools, we should attach constitutional significance to the fact that 96% of scholarship recipients have enrolled in religious schools.  They claim that this alone proves parents lack genuine choice, even if no parent has ever said so.  We need not consider this argument in detail, since it was flatly rejected in 
				<em>
					Mueller
				</em>
				, where we found it irrelevant that 96% of parents taking deductions for tuition expenses paid tuition at religious schools.  Indeed, we have recently found it irrelevant even to the constitutionality of a direct aid program that a vast majority of program benefits went to religious schools.  See 
				<em>
					Agostini

				, 521 U. S., at 229 (Nor are we willing to conclude that the constitutionality of an aid program depends on the number of sectarian school students who happen to receive the otherwise neutral aid (citing

				This point is aptly illustrated here.  The 96% figure upon which respondents and 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter 
				</span>
				rely discounts entirely (1) the more than 1,900 Cleveland children enrolled in alternative community schools, (2) the more than 13,000 children enrolled in alternative magnet schools, and (3) the more than 1,400 children enrolled in traditional public schools with tutorial assistance.  See s
				<em>
					upra
				</em>
				, at 56.  Including some or all of these children in the denominator of children enrolled in nontraditional schools during the 19992000 school year drops the percentage enrolled in religious schools from 96% to under 20%.  See also J. Greene, The Racial, Economic, and Religious Context of Parental Choice in Cleveland 11, Table 4 (Oct. 8, 1999), App. 217a (reporting that only 16.5% of nontraditional schoolchildren in Cleveland choose religious schools).  The 96% figure also represents but a snapshot of one particular school year.  In the 19971998 school year, by contrast, only 78% of scholarship recipients attended religious schools.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 011751, p. 5a.  The difference was attributable to two private nonreligious schools that had accepted 15% of all scholarship students electing instead to register as community schools, in light of larger per-pupil funding for community schools and the uncertain future of the scholarship program generated by this litigation.  See App. 59a62a, 209a, 223a227a.

				<em>
					Nyquist
				</em>
				 was quite different from the program challenged here.  
				<em>
					Nyquist
				</em>
				 involved a New York program that gave a package of benefits exclusively to private schools and the parents of private school enrollees.  Although the program was enacted for ostensibly secular purposes, 
				<em>
					id.

				<em>
					unmistakably
				</em>
				 to provide desired financial support for nonpublic, sectarian institutions, 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 783 (emphasis added).  Its genesis, we said, was that private religious schools faced increasingly grave fiscal problems.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 795.  The program thus provided direct money grants to religious schools.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 762764.  It provided tax benefits unrelated to the amount of money actually expended by any parent on tuition, ensuring a windfall to parents of children in religious schools.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 790.  It similarly provided tuition reimbursements designed explicitly to offe[r] … an incentive to parents to send their children to sectarian schools.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 786.  Indeed, the program flatly prohibited the participation of any public school, or parent of any public school enrollee.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 763765.  Ohios program shares none of these features.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, were there any doubt that the program challenged in 
				<em>
					Nyquist
				</em>
				 is far removed from the program challenged here, we expressly reserved judgment with respect to a case involving some form of public assistance (
				<em>

				<em>

				</em>
				at 783, n. 38.  That, of course, is the very question now before us, and it has since been answered, first in 
				<em>
					Mueller
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				463 U. S., at 398399 ([A] program … that neutrally provides state assistance to a broad spectrum of citizens is not readily subject to challenge under the Establishment Clause (citing

				<em>
					Nyquist
				</em>
				 has remained an open question in light of these later decisions, we now hold that 
				<em>
					Nyquist
				</em>
				 does not govern neutral educational assistance programs that, like the program here, offer aid directly to a broad class of individual recipients defined without regard to religion.

				In sum, the Ohio program is entirely neutral with respect to religion.  It provides benefits directly to a wide spectrum of individuals, defined only by financial need and residence in a particular school district.  It permits such individuals to exercise genuine choice among options public and private, secular and religious.  The program is therefore a program of true private choice.  In keeping with an unbroken line of decisions rejecting challenges to similar programs, we hold that the program does not offend the Establishment Clause.

						 Although the parties dispute the precise amount of state funding received by suburban school districts adjacent to the Cleveland City School District, there is no dispute that any suburban district agreeing to participate in the program would receive a $2,250 tuition grant plus the ordinary allotment of per-pupil state funding for each program student enrolled in a suburban public school.  See Brief for Respondents Simmons-Harris et al. 30, n. 11 (suburban schools would receive on average, approximately, $4,750 per program student); Brief for Petitioners in No. 001779, p. 39 (suburban schools would receive about $6,544 per program student).

						 Justice Souter suggests the program is not neutral because program students cannot spend scholarship vouchers at traditional public schools.  Post, at 1314 (dissenting opinion).  This objection is mistaken: Public schools in Cleveland already receive $7,097 in public funding per pupil$4,167 of which is attributable to the State.  App. 56a.  Program students who receive tutoring aid and remain enrolled in traditional public schools therefore direct almost twice as much state funding to their chosen school as do program students who receive a scholarship and attend a private school.  Ibid.  Justice Souter does not seriously claim that the program differentiates based on the religious status of beneficiaries or providers of services, the touchstone of neutrality under the Establishment Clause.

						 Justice Souter appears to base this claim on the unfounded assumption that capping the amount of tuition charged to low-income students (at $2,500) favors participation by religious schools.  Post, at 2122 (dissenting opinion).  But elsewhere he claims that the program spends too much money on private schools and chides the state legislature for even proposing to raise the scholarship amount for low-income recipients.  Post, at 1011, 2728, 3132.  His assumption also finds no support in the record, which shows that nonreligious private schools operating in Cleveland also seek and receive substantial third-party contributions.  App. 194a195a; App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 001777, p. 119a.  Indeed, the actual operation of the program refutes Justice Souters argument that few but religious schools can afford to participate: Ten secular private schools operated within the Cleveland City School District when the program was adopted.  Reply Brief for Petitioners in No. 001777, p. 4 (citing Ohio Educational Directory, 19992000 School Year, Alphabetic List of Nonpublic Schools, Ohio Dept. of Education).  All 10 chose to participate in the program and have continued to participate to this day.  App. 281a286a.  And while no religious schools have been created in response to the program, several nonreligious schools have been created, id., at 144a148a, 224a225a, in spite of the fact that a principal barrier to entry of new private schools is the uncertainty caused by protracted litigation which has plagued the program since its inception, post, at 11 (OConnor, J., concurring) (citing App. 225a, 227a).  See also 234 F. 3d 945, 970 (CA6 2000) (There is not a scintilla of evidence in this case that any school, public or private, has been discouraged from participating in the school voucher program because it cannot afford to do so) (Ryan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  Similarly mistaken is Justice Souters reliance on the low enrollment of scholarship students in nonreligious schools during the 19992000 school year.  Post, at 21 (citing Brief for California Alliance for Public Schools as Amicus Curiae 15).  These figures ignore the fact that the number of program students enrolled in nonreligious schools has widely varied from year to year, infra, at 1718; e.g., n. 5, infra, underscoring why the constitutionality of a neutral choice program does not turn on annual tallies of private decisions made in any given year by thousands of individual aid recipients, infra, at 1617 (citing Mueller v.

						 The fluctuations seen in the Cleveland program are hardly atypical.  Experience in Milwaukee, which since 1991 has operated an educational choice program similar to the Ohio program, demonstrates that the mix of participating schools fluctuates significantly from year to year based on a number of factors, one of which is the uncertainty caused by persistent litigation.  See App. 218a, 229a236a; Brief for State of Wisconsin as Amicus Curiae 1013 (hereinafter Brief for Wisconsin) (citing Wisconsin Dept. of Public Instruction, Milwaukee Parental Choice Program Facts and Figures for 20012002).  Since the Wisconsin Supreme Court declared the Milwaukee program constitutional in 1998, Jackson v. Benson, 218 Wis. 2d 835, 578 N. W. 2d 602 (1998), several nonreligious private schools have entered the Milwaukee market, and now represent 32% of all participating schools.  Brief for Wisconsin 1112.  Similarly, the number of program students attending nonreligious private schools increased from 2,048 to 3,582; these students now represent 33% of all program students.  Id., at 1213.  There are currently 34 nonreligious private schools participating in the Milwaukee program, a nearly a five-fold increase from the 7 nonreligious schools that participated when the program began in 1990.  See App. 218a; Brief for Wisconsin 12.  And the total number of students enrolled in nonreligious schools has grown from 337 when the program began to 3,582 in the most recent school year.  See App. 218a, 234a236a; Brief for Wisconsin 1213.  These numbers further demonstrate the wisdom of our refusal in Mueller v. Allen,

, to make the constitutionality of such a program depend on annual reports reciting the extent to which various classes of private citizens claimed benefits under the law.

						 Justice Souter and Justice Stevens claim that community schools and magnet schools are separate and distinct from program schools, simply because the program itself does not include community and magnet school options.  Post, at 1417 (Souter, J., dissenting); post, at 2 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  But none of the dissenting opinions explain how there is any perceptible difference between scholarship schools, community schools, or magnet schools from the perspective of Cleveland parents looking to choose the best educational option for their school-age children.  Parents who choose a program school in fact receive from the State precisely what parents who choose a community or magnet school receivethe opportunity to send their children largely at state expense to schools they prefer to their local public school.  See, e.g., App. 147a, 168a169a; App. in Nos. 00305, etc. (CA6), pp. 16351645 and 16571673 (Cleveland parents who enroll their children in schools other than local public schools typically explore all state-funded options before choosing an alternative school).

						 Justice Breyer would raise the invisible specters of divisiveness and religious strife to find the program unconstitutional.  Post, at 3, 913 (dissenting opinion).  It is unclear exactly what sort of principle Justice Breyer has in mind, considering that the program has ignited no divisiveness or strife other than this litigation.  Nor is it clear where Justice Breyer would locate this presumed authority to deprive Cleveland residents of a program that they have chosen but that we subjectively find divisive.  We quite rightly have rejected the claim that some speculative potential for divisiveness bears on the constitutionality of educational aid programs.

S., at 825 (plurality opinion) (The dissent resurrects the concern for political divisiveness that once occupied the Court but that post-Aguilar cases have rightly disregarded) (citing cases); id., at 825826 ( It is curious indeed to base our interpretation of the Constitution on speculation as to the likelihood of a phenomenon which the parties may create merely by prosecuting a lawsuit  (quoting  Aguilar v.

				The State of Ohio has established a pilot program designed to provide educational choices to families with children who reside in the Cleveland City School District.  The question presented is whether this program offends the Establishment Clause of the United States Constitution.  We hold that it does not.
			</p>

				There are more than 75,000 children enrolled in the Cleveland City School District.  The majority of these children are from low-income and minority families.  Few of these families enjoy the means to send their children to any school other than an inner-city public school.  For more than a generation, however, Clevelands public schools have been among the worst performing public schools in the Nation.  In 1995, a Federal District Court declared a crisis of magnitude and placed the entire Cleveland school district under state control.  See 
				<em>
					Reed 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					Rhodes
				</em>
				, No. 1:73 CV 1300 (ND Ohio, Mar. 3, 1995).  Shortly thereafter, the state auditor found that Clevelands public schools were in the midst of a crisis that is perhaps unprecedented in the history of American education.  Cleveland City School District Performance Audit 21 (Mar. 1996).  The district had failed to meet any of the 18 state standards for minimal acceptable performance.  Only 1 in 10 ninth graders could pass a basic proficiency examination, and students at all levels performed at a dismal rate compared with students in other Ohio public schools.  More than two-thirds of high school students either dropped or failed out before graduation.  Of those students who managed to reach their senior year, one of every four still failed to graduate.  Of those students who did graduate, few could read, write, or compute at levels comparable to their counterparts in other cities.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It is against this backdrop that Ohio enacted, among other initiatives, its Pilot Project Scholarship Program, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §§3313.9743313.979 (Anderson 1999 and Supp. 2000) (program).  The program provides financial assistance to families in any Ohio school district that is or has been under federal court order requiring supervision and operational management of the district by the state superintendent.  §3313.975(A).  Cleveland is the only Ohio school district to fall within that category.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The program provides two basic kinds of assistance to parents of children in a covered district.  First, the program provides tuition aid for students in kindergarten through third grade, expanding each year through eighth grade, to attend a participating public or private school of their parents choosing.  §§3313.975(B) and (C)(1).  Second, the program provides tutorial aid for students who choose to remain enrolled in public school.  §3313.975(A).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The tuition aid portion of the program is designed to provide educational choices to parents who reside in a covered district.  Any private school, whether religious or nonreligious, may participate in the program and accept program students so long as the school is located within the boundaries of a covered district and meets statewide educational standards.  §313.976(A)(3).  Participating private schools must agree not to discriminate on the basis of race, religion, or ethnic background, or to advocate or foster unlawful behavior or teach hatred of any person or group on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion.  §3313.976(A)(6).  Any public school located in a school district adjacent to the covered district may also participate in the program.  §3313.976(C).  Adjacent public schools are eligible to receive a $2,250 tuition grant for each program student accepted in addition to the full amount of per-pupil state funding attributable to each additional student.  §§3313.976(C), 3317.03(I)(1).

				  All participating schools, whether public or private, are required to accept students in accordance with rules and procedures established by the state superintendent.  §§3313.977(A)(1)(a)(c).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Tuition aid is distributed to parents according to financial need.  Families with incomes below 200% of the poverty line are given priority and are eligible to receive 90% of private school tuition up to $2,250.  §§3313.978(A) and (C)(1).  For these lowest-income families, participating private schools may not charge a parental co-payment greater than $250.  §3313.976(A)(8).  For all other families, the program pays 75% of tuition costs, up to $1,875, with no co-payment cap.  §§3313.976(A)(8), 3313.978(A).  These families receive tuition aid only if the number of available scholarships exceeds the number of low-income children who choose to participate.

				  Where tuition aid is spent depends solely upon where parents who receive tuition aid choose to enroll their child.  If parents choose a private school, checks are made payable to the parents who then endorse the checks over to the chosen school.  §3313.979.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The tutorial aid portion of the program provides tutorial assistance through grants to any student in a covered district who chooses to remain in public school.  Parents arrange for registered tutors to provide assistance to their children and then submit bills for those services to the State for payment.  §§3313.976(D), 3313.979(C).  Students from low-income families receive 90% of the amount charged for such assistance up to $360.  All other students receive 75% of that amount.  §3313.978(B).  The number of tutorial assistance grants offered to students in a covered district must equal the number of tuition aid scholarships provided to students enrolled at participating private or adjacent public schools.  §3313.975(A).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The program has been in operation within the Cleveland City School District since the 19961997 school year.  In the 19992000 school year, 56 private schools participated in the program, 46 (or 82%) of which had a religious affiliation.  None of the public schools in districts adjacent to Cleveland have elected to participate.  More than 3,700 students participated in the scholarship program, most of whom (96%) enrolled in religiously affiliated schools.  Sixty percent of these students were from families at or below the poverty line.  In the 19981999 school year, approximately 1,400 Cleveland public school students received tutorial aid.  This number was expected to double during the 19992000 school year.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The program is part of a broader undertaking by the State to enhance the educational options of Clevelands schoolchildren in response to the 1995 takeover.  That undertaking includes programs governing community and magnet schools.  Community schools are funded under state law but are run by their own school boards, not by local school districts.  §§3314.01(B), 3314.04.  These schools enjoy academic independence to hire their own teachers and to determine their own curriculum.  They can have no religious affiliation and are required to accept students by lottery.  During the 19992000 school year, there were 10 start-up community schools in the Cleveland City School District with more than 1,900 students enrolled.  For each child enrolled in a community school, the school receives state funding of $4,518, twice the funding a participating program school may receive.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Magnet schools are public schools operated by a local school board that emphasize a particular subject area, teaching method, or service to students.  For each student enrolled in a magnet school, the school district receives $7,746, including state funding of $4,167, the same amount received per student enrolled at a traditional public school.  As of 1999, parents in Cleveland were able to choose from among 23 magnet schools, which together enrolled more than 13,000 students in kindergarten through eighth grade.  These schools provide specialized teaching methods, such as Montessori, or a particularized curriculum focus, such as foreign language, computers, or the arts.

				In 1996, respondents, a group of Ohio taxpayers, challenged the Ohio program in state court on state and federal grounds.  The Ohio Supreme Court rejected respondents federal claims, but held that the enactment of the program violated certain procedural requirements of the Ohio Constitution.

				In July 1999, respondents filed this action in United States District Court, seeking to enjoin the reenacted program on the ground that it violated the Establishment Clause of the United States Constitution.  In August 1999, the District Court issued a preliminary injunction barring further implementation of the program, 54 F. Supp. 2d 725 (ND Ohio), which we stayed pending review by the Court of Appeals, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/528/983" class="subref" title="subref">528 U. S. 983</a> (1999)
.  In December 1999, the District Court granted summary judgment for respondents.  72 F. Supp. 2d 834.  In December 2000, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the District Court, finding that the program had the primary effect of advancing religion in violation of the Establishment Clause.  234 F. 3d 945 (CA6).  The Court of Appeals stayed its mandate pending disposition in this Court.  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 011779, p. 151.  We granted certiorari,

				<em>

				<em>

				our jurisprudence with respect to true private choice programs has remained consistent and unbroken.

				In 
				<em>
					Mueller
				</em>
				, we rejected an Establishment Clause challenge to a Minnesota program authorizing tax deductions for various educational expenses, including private school tuition costs, even though the great majority of the programs beneficiaries (96%) were parents of children in religious schools.  We began by focusing on the class of beneficiaries, finding that because the class included 
				<em>
					all
				</em>
				 parents, including parents with children [who] attend nonsectarian private schools or sectarian private schools, 463 U. S., at 397 (emphasis in original), the program was not readily subject to challenge under the Establishment Clause,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">274</a> (1981)
 (The provision of benefits to so broad a spectrum of groups is an important index of secular effect)).  Then, viewing the program as a whole, we emphasized the principle of private choice, noting that public funds were made available to religious schools only as a result of numerous, private choices of individual parents of school-age children.  463 U. S., at 399400.  This, we said, ensured that  no imprimatur of state approval can be deemed to have been conferred on any particular religion, or on religion generally.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 399 (quoting 
				<em>
					Widmar, supra
				</em>
				, at 274)).  We thus found it irrelevant to the constitutional inquiry that the vast majority of beneficiaries were parents of children in religious schools, saying:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				We would be loath to adopt a rule grounding the constitutionality of a facially neutral law on annual reports reciting the extent to which various classes of private citizens claimed benefits under the law.  463 U. S., at 401.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
That the program was one of true private choice, with no evidence that the State deliberately skewed incentives toward religious schools, was sufficient for the program to survive scrutiny under the Establishment Clause.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In 
				<em>
					Witters
				</em>
				, we used identical reasoning to reject an Establishment Clause challenge to a vocational scholarship program that provided tuition aid to a student studying at a religious institution to become a pastor.  Looking at the program as a whole, we observed that [a]ny aid … that ultimately flows to religious institutions does so only as a result of the genuinely independent and private choices of aid recipients.  474 U. S., at 487.  We further remarked that, as in 
				<em>
					Mueller
				</em>
				, [the] program is made available generally without regard to the sectarian-nonsectarian, or public-nonpublic nature of the institution benefited.  474 U. S., at 487.  In light of these factors, we held that the program was not inconsistent with the Establishment Clause.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 488489.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Five Members of the Court, in separate opinions, emphasized the general rule from 
				<em>
					Mueller 
				</em>
				that the amount of government aid channeled to religious institutions by individual aid recipients was not relevant to the constitutional inquiry.  474 U. S., at 490491 (Powell, J., joined by Burger, C. J., and 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Rehnquist
				</span>
				, J., concurring) (citing 
				<em>
					Mueller, supra

				<span class="smallcaps">
					OConnor
				</span>
				, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 490 (White, J., concurring).  Our holding thus rested not on whether few or many recipients chose to expend government aid at a religious school but, rather, on whether recipients generally were empowered to direct the aid to schools or institutions of their own choosing.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Finally, in 
				<em>
					Zobrest
				</em>
				, we applied 
				<em>
					Mueller
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Witters
				</em>
				 to reject an Establishment Clause challenge to a federal program that permitted sign-language interpreters to assist deaf children enrolled in religious schools.  Reviewing our earlier decisions, we stated that government programs that neutrally provide benefits to a broad class of citizens defined without reference to religion are not readily subject to an Establishment Clause challenge.  509 U. S., at 8.  Looking once again to the challenged program as a whole
				<em>
					,
				</em>
				 we observed that the program distributes benefits neutrally to any child qualifying as disabled.   
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 10.  Its primary beneficiaries, we said, were disabled children, not sectarian schools.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 12.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We further observed that [b]y according parents freedom to select a school of their choice, the statute ensures that a government-paid interpreter will be present in a sectarian school only as a result of the private decision of individual parents.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 10.  Our focus again was on neutrality and the principle of private choice, not on the number of program beneficiaries attending religious schools.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 1011.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Agostini,
				</em>
				 521 U. S
				<em>
					.,
				</em>
				 at 229 (
				<em>
					Zobrest
				</em>
				 did not turn on the fact that James Zobrest had, at the time of litigation, been the only child using a publicly funded sign-language interpreter to attend a parochial school).  Because the program ensured that parents were the ones to select a religious school as the best learning environment for their handicapped child, the circuit between government and religion was broken, and the Establishment Clause was not implicated.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>
					Mueller
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Witters
				</em>
				, and 
				<em>
					Zobrest
				</em>
				 thus make clear that where a government aid program is neutral with respect to religion, and provides assistance directly to a broad class of citizens who, in turn, direct government aid to religious schools wholly as a result of their own genuine and independent private choice, the program is not readily subject to challenge under the Establishment Clause.  A program that shares these features permits government aid to reach religious institutions only by way of the deliberate choices of numerous individual recipients.  The incidental advancement of a religious mission, or the perceived endorsement of a religious message, is reasonably attributable to the individual recipient, not to the government, whose role ends with the disbursement of benefits.  As a plurality of this Court recently observed:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				[I]f numerous private choices, rather than the single choice of a government, determine the distribution of aid, pursuant to neutral eligibility criteria, then a government cannot, or at least cannot easily, grant special favors that might lead to a religious establishment.

Program benefits are available to participating families on neutral terms, with no reference to religion.  The only preference stated anywhere in the program is a preference for low-income families, who receive greater assistance and are given priority for admission at participating schools.

Adjacent public schools, should any choose to accept program students, are also eligible to receive two to three times the state funding of a private religious school.  Families too have a financial disincentive to choose a private religious school over other schools.  Parents that choose to participate in the scholarship program and then to enroll their children in a private school (religious or nonreligious) must copay a portion of the schools tuition.  Families that choose a community school, magnet school, or traditional public school pay nothing.  Although such features of the program are not necessary to its constitutionality, they clearly dispel the claim that the program creates … financial incentive[s] for parents to choose a sectarian school.

				Respondents suggest that even without a financial incentive for parents to choose a religious school, the program creates a public perception that the State is endorsing religious practices and beliefs.  Brief for Respondents Simmons-Harris et al. 3738.

				There also is no evidence that the program fails to provide genuine opportunities for Cleveland parents to select secular educational options for their school-age children.  Cleveland schoolchildren enjoy a range of educational choices: They may remain in public school as before, remain in public school with publicly funded tutoring aid, obtain a scholarship and choose a religious school, obtain a scholarship and choose a nonreligious private school, enroll in a community school, or enroll in a magnet school.  That 46 of the 56 private schools now participating in the program are religious schools does not condemn it as a violation of the Establishment Clause.  The Establishment Clause question is whether Ohio is coercing parents into sending their children to religious schools, and that question must be answered by evaluating 
				<em>
					all
				</em>
				 options Ohio provides Cleveland schoolchildren, only one of which is to obtain a program scholarship and then choose a religious school.

				  But Clevelands preponderance of religiously affiliated private schools certainly did not arise as a result of the program; it is a phenomenon common to many American cities.  See U. S. Dept. of Ed., National Center for Education Statistics, Private School Universe Survey: 19992000, pp. 24 (NCES 2001330, 2001) (hereinafter Private School Universe Survey) (cited in Brief for United States as 
				<em>
					Amicus Curiae
				</em>
				 24).  Indeed, by all accounts the program has captured a remarkable cross-section of private schools, religious and nonreligious.  It is true that 82% of Clevelands participating private schools are religious schools, but it is also true that 81% of private schools in Ohio are religious schools.  See Brief for State of Florida et al. as 
				<em>
					Amici Curiae
				</em>
				 16 (citing Private School Universe Survey).  To attribute constitutional significance to this figure, moreover, would lead to the absurd result that a neutral school-choice program might be permissible in some parts of Ohio, such as Columbus, where a lower percentage of private schools are religious schools, see Ohio Educational Directory (Lodging of Respondents Gatton et al., available in Clerk of Courts case file), and Reply Brief for Petitioners in No. 001751, p. 12, n. 1, but not in inner-city Cleveland, where Ohio has deemed such programs most sorely needed, but where the preponderance of religious schools happens to be greater.  Cf. Brief for State of Florida et al. as 
				<em>
					Amici Curiae
				</em>
				 17 ([T]he percentages of sectarian to nonsectarian private schools within Floridas 67 school districts … vary from zero to 100 percent).  Likewise, an identical private choice program might be constitutional in some States, such as Maine or Utah, where less than 45% of private schools are religious schools, but not in other States, such as Nebraska or Kansas, where over 90% of private schools are religious schools.

				Respondents and

				claim that even if we do not focus on the number of participating schools that are religious schools, we should attach constitutional significance to the fact that 96% of scholarship recipients have enrolled in religious schools.  They claim that this alone proves parents lack genuine choice, even if no parent has ever said so.  We need not consider this argument in detail, since it was flatly rejected in 
				<em>
					Mueller
				</em>
				, where we found it irrelevant that 96% of parents taking deductions for tuition expenses paid tuition at religious schools.  Indeed, we have recently found it irrelevant even to the constitutionality of a direct aid program that a vast majority of program benefits went to religious schools.  See

				This point is aptly illustrated here.  The 96% figure upon which respondents and 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter 
				</span>
				rely discounts entirely (1) the more than 1,900 Cleveland children enrolled in alternative community schools, (2) the more than 13,000 children enrolled in alternative magnet schools, and (3) the more than 1,400 children enrolled in traditional public schools with tutorial assistance.  See s
				<em>
					upra
				</em>
				, at 56.  Including some or all of these children in the denominator of children enrolled in nontraditional schools during the 19992000 school year drops the percentage enrolled in religious schools from 96% to under 20%.  See also J. Greene, The Racial, Economic, and Religious Context of Parental Choice in Cleveland 11, Table 4 (Oct. 8, 1999), App. 217a (reporting that only 16.5% of nontraditional schoolchildren in Cleveland choose religious schools).  The 96% figure also represents but a snapshot of one particular school year.  In the 19971998 school year, by contrast, only 78% of scholarship recipients attended religious schools.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 011751, p. 5a.  The difference was attributable to two private nonreligious schools that had accepted 15% of all scholarship students electing instead to register as community schools, in light of larger per-pupil funding for community schools and the uncertain future of the scholarship program generated by this litigation.  See App. 59a62a, 209a, 223a227a.

				<em>
					Nyquist
				</em>
				 was quite different from the program challenged here.  
				<em>
					Nyquist
				</em>
				 involved a New York program that gave a package of benefits exclusively to private schools and the parents of private school enrollees.  Although the program was enacted for ostensibly secular purposes, 
				<em>
					id.

				, at 773774, we found that its function was 
				<em>
					unmistakably
				</em>
				 to provide desired financial support for nonpublic, sectarian institutions, 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 783 (emphasis added).  Its genesis, we said, was that private religious schools faced increasingly grave fiscal problems.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 795.  The program thus provided direct money grants to religious schools.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 762764.  It provided tax benefits unrelated to the amount of money actually expended by any parent on tuition, ensuring a windfall to parents of children in religious schools.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 790.  It similarly provided tuition reimbursements designed explicitly to offe[r] … an incentive to parents to send their children to sectarian schools.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 786.  Indeed, the program flatly prohibited the participation of any public school, or parent of any public school enrollee.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 763765.  Ohios program shares none of these features.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, were there any doubt that the program challenged in 
				<em>
					Nyquist
				</em>
				 is far removed from the program challenged here, we expressly reserved judgment with respect to a case involving some form of public assistance (
				<em>
					e.g.

				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 783, n. 38.  That, of course, is the very question now before us, and it has since been answered, first in 
				<em>
					Mueller
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				463 U. S., at 398399 ([A] program … that neutrally provides state assistance to a broad spectrum of citizens is not readily subject to challenge under the Establishment Clause (citing

				<em>

				<em>
					Nyquist
				</em>
				 has remained an open question in light of these later decisions, we now hold that 
				<em>
					Nyquist
				</em>
				 does not govern neutral educational assistance programs that, like the program here, offer aid directly to a broad class of individual recipients defined without regard to religion.

				In sum, the Ohio program is entirely neutral with respect to religion.  It provides benefits directly to a wide spectrum of individuals, defined only by financial need and residence in a particular school district.  It permits such individuals to exercise genuine choice among options public and private, secular and religious.  The program is therefore a program of true private choice.  In keeping with an unbroken line of decisions rejecting challenges to similar programs, we hold that the program does not offend the Establishment Clause.

						 Although the parties dispute the precise amount of state funding received by suburban school districts adjacent to the Cleveland City School District, there is no dispute that any suburban district agreeing to participate in the program would receive a $2,250 tuition grant plus the ordinary allotment of per-pupil state funding for each program student enrolled in a suburban public school.  See Brief for Respondents Simmons-Harris et al. 30, n. 11 (suburban schools would receive on average, approximately, $4,750 per program student); Brief for Petitioners in No. 001779, p. 39 (suburban schools would receive about $6,544 per program student).

						 Justice Souter suggests the program is not neutral because program students cannot spend scholarship vouchers at traditional public schools.  Post, at 1314 (dissenting opinion).  This objection is mistaken: Public schools in Cleveland already receive $7,097 in public funding per pupil$4,167 of which is attributable to the State.  App. 56a.  Program students who receive tutoring aid and remain enrolled in traditional public schools therefore direct almost twice as much state funding to their chosen school as do program students who receive a scholarship and attend a private school.  Ibid.  Justice Souter does not seriously claim that the program differentiates based on the religious status of beneficiaries or providers of services, the touchstone of neutrality under the Establishment Clause.

						 Justice Souter appears to base this claim on the unfounded assumption that capping the amount of tuition charged to low-income students (at $2,500) favors participation by religious schools.  Post, at 2122 (dissenting opinion).  But elsewhere he claims that the program spends too much money on private schools and chides the state legislature for even proposing to raise the scholarship amount for low-income recipients.  Post, at 1011, 2728, 3132.  His assumption also finds no support in the record, which shows that nonreligious private schools operating in Cleveland also seek and receive substantial third-party contributions.  App. 194a195a; App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 001777, p. 119a.  Indeed, the actual operation of the program refutes Justice Souters argument that few but religious schools can afford to participate: Ten secular private schools operated within the Cleveland City School District when the program was adopted.  Reply Brief for Petitioners in No. 001777, p. 4 (citing Ohio Educational Directory, 19992000 School Year, Alphabetic List of Nonpublic Schools, Ohio Dept. of Education).  All 10 chose to participate in the program and have continued to participate to this day.  App. 281a286a.  And while no religious schools have been created in response to the program, several nonreligious schools have been created, id., at 144a148a, 224a225a, in spite of the fact that a principal barrier to entry of new private schools is the uncertainty caused by protracted litigation which has plagued the program since its inception, post, at 11 (OConnor, J., concurring) (citing App. 225a, 227a).  See also 234 F. 3d 945, 970 (CA6 2000) (There is not a scintilla of evidence in this case that any school, public or private, has been discouraged from participating in the school voucher program because it cannot afford to do so) (Ryan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  Similarly mistaken is Justice Souters reliance on the low enrollment of scholarship students in nonreligious schools during the 19992000 school year.  Post, at 21 (citing Brief for California Alliance for Public Schools as Amicus Curiae 15).  These figures ignore the fact that the number of program students enrolled in nonreligious schools has widely varied from year to year, infra, at 1718; e.g., n. 5, infra, underscoring why the constitutionality of a neutral choice program does not turn on annual tallies of private decisions made in any given year by thousands of individual aid recipients, infra, at 1617 (citing Mueller v.

						 The fluctuations seen in the Cleveland program are hardly atypical.  Experience in Milwaukee, which since 1991 has operated an educational choice program similar to the Ohio program, demonstrates that the mix of participating schools fluctuates significantly from year to year based on a number of factors, one of which is the uncertainty caused by persistent litigation.  See App. 218a, 229a236a; Brief for State of Wisconsin as Amicus Curiae 1013 (hereinafter Brief for Wisconsin) (citing Wisconsin Dept. of Public Instruction, Milwaukee Parental Choice Program Facts and Figures for 20012002).  Since the Wisconsin Supreme Court declared the Milwaukee program constitutional in 1998, Jackson v. Benson, 218 Wis. 2d 835, 578 N. W. 2d 602 (1998), several nonreligious private schools have entered the Milwaukee market, and now represent 32% of all participating schools.  Brief for Wisconsin 1112.  Similarly, the number of program students attending nonreligious private schools increased from 2,048 to 3,582; these students now represent 33% of all program students.  Id., at 1213.  There are currently 34 nonreligious private schools participating in the Milwaukee program, a nearly a five-fold increase from the 7 nonreligious schools that participated when the program began in 1990.  See App. 218a; Brief for Wisconsin 12.  And the total number of students enrolled in nonreligious schools has grown from 337 when the program began to 3,582 in the most recent school year.  See App. 218a, 234a236a; Brief for Wisconsin 1213.  These numbers further demonstrate the wisdom of our refusal in Mueller v. Allen,

						 Justice Souter and Justice Stevens claim that community schools and magnet schools are separate and distinct from program schools, simply because the program itself does not include community and magnet school options.  Post, at 1417 (Souter, J., dissenting); post, at 2 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  But none of the dissenting opinions explain how there is any perceptible difference between scholarship schools, community schools, or magnet schools from the perspective of Cleveland parents looking to choose the best educational option for their school-age children.  Parents who choose a program school in fact receive from the State precisely what parents who choose a community or magnet school receivethe opportunity to send their children largely at state expense to schools they prefer to their local public school.  See, e.g., App. 147a, 168a169a; App. in Nos. 00305, etc. (CA6), pp. 16351645 and 16571673 (Cleveland parents who enroll their children in schools other than local public schools typically explore all state-funded options before choosing an alternative school).

It is unclear exactly what sort of principle Justice Breyer has in mind, considering that the program has ignited no divisiveness or strife other than this litigation.  Nor is it clear where Justice Breyer would locate this presumed authority to deprive Cleveland residents of a program that they have chosen but that we subjectively find divisive.  We quite rightly have rejected the claim that some speculative potential for divisiveness bears on the constitutionality of educational aid programs.

				The State of Ohio has established a pilot program designed to provide educational choices to families with children who reside in the Cleveland City School District.  The question presented is whether this program offends the Establishment Clause of the United States Constitution.  We hold that it does not.
			</p>

				There are more than 75,000 children enrolled in the Cleveland City School District.  The majority of these children are from low-income and minority families.  Few of these families enjoy the means to send their children to any school other than an inner-city public school.  For more than a generation, however, Clevelands public schools have been among the worst performing public schools in the Nation.  In 1995, a Federal District Court declared a crisis of magnitude and placed the entire Cleveland school district under state control.  See 
				<em>
					Reed 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					Rhodes
				</em>
				, No. 1:73 CV 1300 (ND Ohio, Mar. 3, 1995).  Shortly thereafter, the state auditor found that Clevelands public schools were in the midst of a crisis that is perhaps unprecedented in the history of American education.  Cleveland City School District Performance Audit 21 (Mar. 1996).  The district had failed to meet any of the 18 state standards for minimal acceptable performance.  Only 1 in 10 ninth graders could pass a basic proficiency examination, and students at all levels performed at a dismal rate compared with students in other Ohio public schools.  More than two-thirds of high school students either dropped or failed out before graduation.  Of those students who managed to reach their senior year, one of every four still failed to graduate.  Of those students who did graduate, few could read, write, or compute at levels comparable to their counterparts in other cities.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It is against this backdrop that Ohio enacted, among other initiatives, its Pilot Project Scholarship Program, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §§3313.9743313.979 (Anderson 1999 and Supp. 2000) (program).  The program provides financial assistance to families in any Ohio school district that is or has been under federal court order requiring supervision and operational management of the district by the state superintendent.  §3313.975(A).  Cleveland is the only Ohio school district to fall within that category.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The program provides two basic kinds of assistance to parents of children in a covered district.  First, the program provides tuition aid for students in kindergarten through third grade, expanding each year through eighth grade, to attend a participating public or private school of their parents choosing.  §§3313.975(B) and (C)(1).  Second, the program provides tutorial aid for students who choose to remain enrolled in public school.  §3313.975(A).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The tuition aid portion of the program is designed to provide educational choices to parents who reside in a covered district.  Any private school, whether religious or nonreligious, may participate in the program and accept program students so long as the school is located within the boundaries of a covered district and meets statewide educational standards.  §313.976(A)(3).  Participating private schools must agree not to discriminate on the basis of race, religion, or ethnic background, or to advocate or foster unlawful behavior or teach hatred of any person or group on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion.  §3313.976(A)(6).  Any public school located in a school district adjacent to the covered district may also participate in the program.  §3313.976(C).  Adjacent public schools are eligible to receive a $2,250 tuition grant for each program student accepted in addition to the full amount of per-pupil state funding attributable to each additional student.  §§3313.976(C), 3317.03(I)(1).

				  All participating schools, whether public or private, are required to accept students in accordance with rules and procedures established by the state superintendent.  §§3313.977(A)(1)(a)(c).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Tuition aid is distributed to parents according to financial need.  Families with incomes below 200% of the poverty line are given priority and are eligible to receive 90% of private school tuition up to $2,250.  §§3313.978(A) and (C)(1).  For these lowest-income families, participating private schools may not charge a parental co-payment greater than $250.  §3313.976(A)(8).  For all other families, the program pays 75% of tuition costs, up to $1,875, with no co-payment cap.  §§3313.976(A)(8), 3313.978(A).  These families receive tuition aid only if the number of available scholarships exceeds the number of low-income children who choose to participate.

				  Where tuition aid is spent depends solely upon where parents who receive tuition aid choose to enroll their child.  If parents choose a private school, checks are made payable to the parents who then endorse the checks over to the chosen school.  §3313.979.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The tutorial aid portion of the program provides tutorial assistance through grants to any student in a covered district who chooses to remain in public school.  Parents arrange for registered tutors to provide assistance to their children and then submit bills for those services to the State for payment.  §§3313.976(D), 3313.979(C).  Students from low-income families receive 90% of the amount charged for such assistance up to $360.  All other students receive 75% of that amount.  §3313.978(B).  The number of tutorial assistance grants offered to students in a covered district must equal the number of tuition aid scholarships provided to students enrolled at participating private or adjacent public schools.  §3313.975(A).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The program has been in operation within the Cleveland City School District since the 19961997 school year.  In the 19992000 school year, 56 private schools participated in the program, 46 (or 82%) of which had a religious affiliation.  None of the public schools in districts adjacent to Cleveland have elected to participate.  More than 3,700 students participated in the scholarship program, most of whom (96%) enrolled in religiously affiliated schools.  Sixty percent of these students were from families at or below the poverty line.  In the 19981999 school year, approximately 1,400 Cleveland public school students received tutorial aid.  This number was expected to double during the 19992000 school year.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The program is part of a broader undertaking by the State to enhance the educational options of Clevelands schoolchildren in response to the 1995 takeover.  That undertaking includes programs governing community and magnet schools.  Community schools are funded under state law but are run by their own school boards, not by local school districts.  §§3314.01(B), 3314.04.  These schools enjoy academic independence to hire their own teachers and to determine their own curriculum.  They can have no religious affiliation and are required to accept students by lottery.  During the 19992000 school year, there were 10 start-up community schools in the Cleveland City School District with more than 1,900 students enrolled.  For each child enrolled in a community school, the school receives state funding of $4,518, twice the funding a participating program school may receive.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Magnet schools are public schools operated by a local school board that emphasize a particular subject area, teaching method, or service to students.  For each student enrolled in a magnet school, the school district receives $7,746, including state funding of $4,167, the same amount received per student enrolled at a traditional public school.  As of 1999, parents in Cleveland were able to choose from among 23 magnet schools, which together enrolled more than 13,000 students in kindergarten through eighth grade.  These schools provide specialized teaching methods, such as Montessori, or a particularized curriculum focus, such as foreign language, computers, or the arts.

				In 1996, respondents, a group of Ohio taxpayers, challenged the Ohio program in state court on state and federal grounds.  The Ohio Supreme Court rejected respondents federal claims, but held that the enactment of the program violated certain procedural requirements of the Ohio Constitution.

				In July 1999, respondents filed this action in United States District Court, seeking to enjoin the reenacted program on the ground that it violated the Establishment Clause of the United States Constitution.  In August 1999, the District Court issued a preliminary injunction barring further implementation of the program, 54 F. Supp. 2d 725 (ND Ohio), which we stayed pending review by the Court of Appeals, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/528/983" class="subref" title="subref">528 U. S. 983</a> (1999)

In December 2000, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the District Court, finding that the program had the primary effect of advancing religion in violation of the Establishment Clause.  234 F. 3d 945 (CA6).  The Court of Appeals stayed its mandate pending disposition in this Court.  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 011779, p. 151.  We granted certiorari,

				<em>

				our jurisprudence with respect to true private choice programs has remained consistent and unbroken.

				In 
				<em>
					Mueller
				</em>
				, we rejected an Establishment Clause challenge to a Minnesota program authorizing tax deductions for various educational expenses, including private school tuition costs, even though the great majority of the programs beneficiaries (96%) were parents of children in religious schools.  We began by focusing on the class of beneficiaries, finding that because the class included 
				<em>
					all
				</em>
				 parents, including parents with children [who] attend nonsectarian private schools or sectarian private schools, 463 U. S., at 397 (emphasis in original), the program was not readily subject to challenge under the Establishment Clause,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">274</a> (1981)
 (The provision of benefits to so broad a spectrum of groups is an important index of secular effect)).  Then, viewing the program as a whole, we emphasized the principle of private choice, noting that public funds were made available to religious schools only as a result of numerous, private choices of individual parents of school-age children.  463 U. S., at 399400.  This, we said, ensured that  no imprimatur of state approval can be deemed to have been conferred on any particular religion, or on religion generally.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 399 (quoting 
				<em>
					Widmar, supra
				</em>
				, at 274)).  We thus found it irrelevant to the constitutional inquiry that the vast majority of beneficiaries were parents of children in religious schools, saying:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				We would be loath to adopt a rule grounding the constitutionality of a facially neutral law on annual reports reciting the extent to which various classes of private citizens claimed benefits under the law.  463 U. S., at 401.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
That the program was one of true private choice, with no evidence that the State deliberately skewed incentives toward religious schools, was sufficient for the program to survive scrutiny under the Establishment Clause.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In 
				<em>
					Witters
				</em>
				, we used identical reasoning to reject an Establishment Clause challenge to a vocational scholarship program that provided tuition aid to a student studying at a religious institution to become a pastor.  Looking at the program as a whole, we observed that [a]ny aid … that ultimately flows to religious institutions does so only as a result of the genuinely independent and private choices of aid recipients.  474 U. S., at 487.  We further remarked that, as in 
				<em>
					Mueller
				</em>
				, [the] program is made available generally without regard to the sectarian-nonsectarian, or public-nonpublic nature of the institution benefited.  474 U. S., at 487.  In light of these factors, we held that the program was not inconsistent with the Establishment Clause.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 488489.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Five Members of the Court, in separate opinions, emphasized the general rule from 
				<em>
					Mueller 
				</em>
				that the amount of government aid channeled to religious institutions by individual aid recipients was not relevant to the constitutional inquiry.  474 U. S., at 490491 (Powell, J., joined by Burger, C. J., and 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Rehnquist
				</span>
				, J., concurring) (citing 
				<em>
					Mueller, supra

				<span class="smallcaps">
					OConnor
				</span>
				, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 490 (White, J., concurring).  Our holding thus rested not on whether few or many recipients chose to expend government aid at a religious school but, rather, on whether recipients generally were empowered to direct the aid to schools or institutions of their own choosing.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Finally, in 
				<em>
					Zobrest
				</em>
				, we applied 
				<em>
					Mueller
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Witters
				</em>
				 to reject an Establishment Clause challenge to a federal program that permitted sign-language interpreters to assist deaf children enrolled in religious schools.  Reviewing our earlier decisions, we stated that government programs that neutrally provide benefits to a broad class of citizens defined without reference to religion are not readily subject to an Establishment Clause challenge.  509 U. S., at 8.  Looking once again to the challenged program as a whole
				<em>
					,
				</em>
				 we observed that the program distributes benefits neutrally to any child qualifying as disabled.   
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 10.  Its primary beneficiaries, we said, were disabled children, not sectarian schools.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 12.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We further observed that [b]y according parents freedom to select a school of their choice, the statute ensures that a government-paid interpreter will be present in a sectarian school only as a result of the private decision of individual parents.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 10.  Our focus again was on neutrality and the principle of private choice, not on the number of program beneficiaries attending religious schools.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 1011.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Agostini,
				</em>
				 521 U. S
				<em>
					.,
				</em>
				 at 229 (
				<em>
					Zobrest
				</em>
				 did not turn on the fact that James Zobrest had, at the time of litigation, been the only child using a publicly funded sign-language interpreter to attend a parochial school).  Because the program ensured that parents were the ones to select a religious school as the best learning environment for their handicapped child, the circuit between government and religion was broken, and the Establishment Clause was not implicated.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>
					Mueller
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Witters
				</em>
				, and 
				<em>
					Zobrest
				</em>
				 thus make clear that where a government aid program is neutral with respect to religion, and provides assistance directly to a broad class of citizens who, in turn, direct government aid to religious schools wholly as a result of their own genuine and independent private choice, the program is not readily subject to challenge under the Establishment Clause.  A program that shares these features permits government aid to reach religious institutions only by way of the deliberate choices of numerous individual recipients.  The incidental advancement of a religious mission, or the perceived endorsement of a religious message, is reasonably attributable to the individual recipient, not to the government, whose role ends with the disbursement of benefits.  As a plurality of this Court recently observed:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				[I]f numerous private choices, rather than the single choice of a government, determine the distribution of aid, pursuant to neutral eligibility criteria, then a government cannot, or at least cannot easily, grant special favors that might lead to a religious establishment.

It is part of a general and multifaceted undertaking by the State of Ohio to provide educational opportunities to the children of a failed school district.  It confers educational assistance directly to a broad class of individuals defined without reference to religion, 
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, any parent of a school-age child who resides in the Cleveland City School District.  The program permits the participation of 
				<em>
					all
				</em>
				 schools within the district, religious or nonreligious.  Adjacent public schools also may participate and have a financial incentive to do so.  Program benefits are available to participating families on neutral terms, with no reference to religion.  The only preference stated anywhere in the program is a preference for low-income families, who receive greater assistance and are given priority for admission at participating schools.

Adjacent public schools, should any choose to accept program students, are also eligible to receive two to three times the state funding of a private religious school.  Families too have a financial disincentive to choose a private religious school over other schools.  Parents that choose to participate in the scholarship program and then to enroll their children in a private school (religious or nonreligious) must copay a portion of the schools tuition.  Families that choose a community school, magnet school, or traditional public school pay nothing.  Although such features of the program are not necessary to its constitutionality, they clearly dispel the claim that the program creates … financial incentive[s] for parents to choose a sectarian school.

				Respondents suggest that even without a financial incentive for parents to choose a religious school, the program creates a public perception that the State is endorsing religious practices and beliefs.  Brief for Respondents Simmons-Harris et al. 3738.

				There also is no evidence that the program fails to provide genuine opportunities for Cleveland parents to select secular educational options for their school-age children.  Cleveland schoolchildren enjoy a range of educational choices: They may remain in public school as before, remain in public school with publicly funded tutoring aid, obtain a scholarship and choose a religious school, obtain a scholarship and choose a nonreligious private school, enroll in a community school, or enroll in a magnet school.  That 46 of the 56 private schools now participating in the program are religious schools does not condemn it as a violation of the Establishment Clause.  The Establishment Clause question is whether Ohio is coercing parents into sending their children to religious schools, and that question must be answered by evaluating 
				<em>
					all
				</em>
				 options Ohio provides Cleveland schoolchildren, only one of which is to obtain a program scholarship and then choose a religious school.

				  But Clevelands preponderance of religiously affiliated private schools certainly did not arise as a result of the program; it is a phenomenon common to many American cities.  See U. S. Dept. of Ed., National Center for Education Statistics, Private School Universe Survey: 19992000, pp. 24 (NCES 2001330, 2001) (hereinafter Private School Universe Survey) (cited in Brief for United States as 
				<em>
					Amicus Curiae
				</em>
				 24).  Indeed, by all accounts the program has captured a remarkable cross-section of private schools, religious and nonreligious.  It is true that 82% of Clevelands participating private schools are religious schools, but it is also true that 81% of private schools in Ohio are religious schools.  See Brief for State of Florida et al. as 
				<em>
					Amici Curiae
				</em>
				 16 (citing Private School Universe Survey).  To attribute constitutional significance to this figure, moreover, would lead to the absurd result that a neutral school-choice program might be permissible in some parts of Ohio, such as Columbus, where a lower percentage of private schools are religious schools, see Ohio Educational Directory (Lodging of Respondents Gatton et al., available in Clerk of Courts case file), and Reply Brief for Petitioners in No. 001751, p. 12, n. 1, but not in inner-city Cleveland, where Ohio has deemed such programs most sorely needed, but where the preponderance of religious schools happens to be greater.  Cf. Brief for State of Florida et al. as 
				<em>
					Amici Curiae
				</em>
				 17 ([T]he percentages of sectarian to nonsectarian private schools within Floridas 67 school districts … vary from zero to 100 percent).  Likewise, an identical private choice program might be constitutional in some States, such as Maine or Utah, where less than 45% of private schools are religious schools, but not in other States, such as Nebraska or Kansas, where over 90% of private schools are religious schools.

				Respondents and

				claim that even if we do not focus on the number of participating schools that are religious schools, we should attach constitutional significance to the fact that 96% of scholarship recipients have enrolled in religious schools.  They claim that this alone proves parents lack genuine choice, even if no parent has ever said so.  We need not consider this argument in detail, since it was flatly rejected in 
				<em>
					Mueller
				</em>
				, where we found it irrelevant that 96% of parents taking deductions for tuition expenses paid tuition at religious schools.  Indeed, we have recently found it irrelevant even to the constitutionality of a direct aid program that a vast majority of program benefits went to religious schools.  See 
				<em>

				This point is aptly illustrated here.  The 96% figure upon which respondents and 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter 
				</span>
				rely discounts entirely (1) the more than 1,900 Cleveland children enrolled in alternative community schools, (2) the more than 13,000 children enrolled in alternative magnet schools, and (3) the more than 1,400 children enrolled in traditional public schools with tutorial assistance.  See s
				<em>
					upra
				</em>
				, at 56.  Including some or all of these children in the denominator of children enrolled in nontraditional schools during the 19992000 school year drops the percentage enrolled in religious schools from 96% to under 20%.  See also J. Greene, The Racial, Economic, and Religious Context of Parental Choice in Cleveland 11, Table 4 (Oct. 8, 1999), App. 217a (reporting that only 16.5% of nontraditional schoolchildren in Cleveland choose religious schools).  The 96% figure also represents but a snapshot of one particular school year.  In the 19971998 school year, by contrast, only 78% of scholarship recipients attended religious schools.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 011751, p. 5a.  The difference was attributable to two private nonreligious schools that had accepted 15% of all scholarship students electing instead to register as community schools, in light of larger per-pupil funding for community schools and the uncertain future of the scholarship program generated by this litigation.  See App. 59a62a, 209a, 223a227a.

				<em>
					Nyquist
				</em>
				 was quite different from the program challenged here.  
				<em>
					Nyquist
				</em>
				 involved a New York program that gave a package of benefits exclusively to private schools and the parents of private school enrollees.  Although the program was enacted for ostensibly secular purposes, 
				<em>
					id.

				<em>
					unmistakably
				</em>
				 to provide desired financial support for nonpublic, sectarian institutions, 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 783 (emphasis added).  Its genesis, we said, was that private religious schools faced increasingly grave fiscal problems.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 795.  The program thus provided direct money grants to religious schools.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 762764.  It provided tax benefits unrelated to the amount of money actually expended by any parent on tuition, ensuring a windfall to parents of children in religious schools.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 790.  It similarly provided tuition reimbursements designed explicitly to offe[r] … an incentive to parents to send their children to sectarian schools.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 786.  Indeed, the program flatly prohibited the participation of any public school, or parent of any public school enrollee.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 763765.  Ohios program shares none of these features.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, were there any doubt that the program challenged in 
				<em>
					Nyquist
				</em>
				 is far removed from the program challenged here, we expressly reserved judgment with respect to a case involving some form of public assistance (
				<em>

				<em>

				</em>
				at 783, n. 38.  That, of course, is the very question now before us, and it has since been answered, first in 
				<em>
					Mueller
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				463 U. S., at 398399 ([A] program … that neutrally provides state assistance to a broad spectrum of citizens is not readily subject to challenge under the Establishment Clause (citing

				<em>
					Nyquist
				</em>
				 has remained an open question in light of these later decisions, we now hold that 
				<em>
					Nyquist
				</em>
				 does not govern neutral educational assistance programs that, like the program here, offer aid directly to a broad class of individual recipients defined without regard to religion.

				In sum, the Ohio program is entirely neutral with respect to religion.  It provides benefits directly to a wide spectrum of individuals, defined only by financial need and residence in a particular school district.  It permits such individuals to exercise genuine choice among options public and private, secular and religious.  The program is therefore a program of true private choice.  In keeping with an unbroken line of decisions rejecting challenges to similar programs, we hold that the program does not offend the Establishment Clause.

						 Although the parties dispute the precise amount of state funding received by suburban school districts adjacent to the Cleveland City School District, there is no dispute that any suburban district agreeing to participate in the program would receive a $2,250 tuition grant plus the ordinary allotment of per-pupil state funding for each program student enrolled in a suburban public school.  See Brief for Respondents Simmons-Harris et al. 30, n. 11 (suburban schools would receive on average, approximately, $4,750 per program student); Brief for Petitioners in No. 001779, p. 39 (suburban schools would receive about $6,544 per program student).

						 Justice Souter suggests the program is not neutral because program students cannot spend scholarship vouchers at traditional public schools.  Post, at 1314 (dissenting opinion).  This objection is mistaken: Public schools in Cleveland already receive $7,097 in public funding per pupil$4,167 of which is attributable to the State.  App. 56a.  Program students who receive tutoring aid and remain enrolled in traditional public schools therefore direct almost twice as much state funding to their chosen school as do program students who receive a scholarship and attend a private school.  Ibid.  Justice Souter does not seriously claim that the program differentiates based on the religious status of beneficiaries or providers of services, the touchstone of neutrality under the Establishment Clause.

						 Justice Souter appears to base this claim on the unfounded assumption that capping the amount of tuition charged to low-income students (at $2,500) favors participation by religious schools.  Post, at 2122 (dissenting opinion).  But elsewhere he claims that the program spends too much money on private schools and chides the state legislature for even proposing to raise the scholarship amount for low-income recipients.  Post, at 1011, 2728, 3132.  His assumption also finds no support in the record, which shows that nonreligious private schools operating in Cleveland also seek and receive substantial third-party contributions.  App. 194a195a; App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 001777, p. 119a.  Indeed, the actual operation of the program refutes Justice Souters argument that few but religious schools can afford to participate: Ten secular private schools operated within the Cleveland City School District when the program was adopted.  Reply Brief for Petitioners in No. 001777, p. 4 (citing Ohio Educational Directory, 19992000 School Year, Alphabetic List of Nonpublic Schools, Ohio Dept. of Education).  All 10 chose to participate in the program and have continued to participate to this day.  App. 281a286a.  And while no religious schools have been created in response to the program, several nonreligious schools have been created, id., at 144a148a, 224a225a, in spite of the fact that a principal barrier to entry of new private schools is the uncertainty caused by protracted litigation which has plagued the program since its inception, post, at 11 (OConnor, J., concurring) (citing App. 225a, 227a).  See also 234 F. 3d 945, 970 (CA6 2000) (There is not a scintilla of evidence in this case that any school, public or private, has been discouraged from participating in the school voucher program because it cannot afford to do so) (Ryan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  Similarly mistaken is Justice Souters reliance on the low enrollment of scholarship students in nonreligious schools during the 19992000 school year.  Post, at 21 (citing Brief for California Alliance for Public Schools as Amicus Curiae 15).  These figures ignore the fact that the number of program students enrolled in nonreligious schools has widely varied from year to year, infra, at 1718; e.g., n. 5, infra, underscoring why the constitutionality of a neutral choice program does not turn on annual tallies of private decisions made in any given year by thousands of individual aid recipients, infra, at 1617 (citing Mueller v.

						 The fluctuations seen in the Cleveland program are hardly atypical.  Experience in Milwaukee, which since 1991 has operated an educational choice program similar to the Ohio program, demonstrates that the mix of participating schools fluctuates significantly from year to year based on a number of factors, one of which is the uncertainty caused by persistent litigation.  See App. 218a, 229a236a; Brief for State of Wisconsin as Amicus Curiae 1013 (hereinafter Brief for Wisconsin) (citing Wisconsin Dept. of Public Instruction, Milwaukee Parental Choice Program Facts and Figures for 20012002).  Since the Wisconsin Supreme Court declared the Milwaukee program constitutional in 1998, Jackson v. Benson, 218 Wis. 2d 835, 578 N. W. 2d 602 (1998), several nonreligious private schools have entered the Milwaukee market, and now represent 32% of all participating schools.  Brief for Wisconsin 1112.  Similarly, the number of program students attending nonreligious private schools increased from 2,048 to 3,582; these students now represent 33% of all program students.  Id., at 1213.  There are currently 34 nonreligious private schools participating in the Milwaukee program, a nearly a five-fold increase from the 7 nonreligious schools that participated when the program began in 1990.  See App. 218a; Brief for Wisconsin 12.  And the total number of students enrolled in nonreligious schools has grown from 337 when the program began to 3,582 in the most recent school year.  See App. 218a, 234a236a; Brief for Wisconsin 1213.  These numbers further demonstrate the wisdom of our refusal in Mueller v. Allen,

						 Justice Souter and Justice Stevens claim that community schools and magnet schools are separate and distinct from program schools, simply because the program itself does not include community and magnet school options.  Post, at 1417 (Souter, J., dissenting); post, at 2 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  But none of the dissenting opinions explain how there is any perceptible difference between scholarship schools, community schools, or magnet schools from the perspective of Cleveland parents looking to choose the best educational option for their school-age children.  Parents who choose a program school in fact receive from the State precisely what parents who choose a community or magnet school receivethe opportunity to send their children largely at state expense to schools they prefer to their local public school.  See, e.g., App. 147a, 168a169a; App. in Nos. 00305, etc. (CA6), pp. 16351645 and 16571673 (Cleveland parents who enroll their children in schools other than local public schools typically explore all state-funded options before choosing an alternative school).

						 Justice Breyer would raise the invisible specters of divisiveness and religious strife to find the program unconstitutional.  Post, at 3, 913 (dissenting opinion).  It is unclear exactly what sort of principle Justice Breyer has in mind, considering that the program has ignited no divisiveness or strife other than this litigation.  Nor is it clear where Justice Breyer would locate this presumed authority to deprive Cleveland residents of a program that they have chosen but that we subjectively find divisive.  We quite rightly have rejected the claim that some speculative potential for divisiveness bears on the constitutionality of educational aid programs.

				The State of Ohio has established a pilot program designed to provide educational choices to families with children who reside in the Cleveland City School District.  The question presented is whether this program offends the Establishment Clause of the United States Constitution.  We hold that it does not.
			</p>

				There are more than 75,000 children enrolled in the Cleveland City School District.  The majority of these children are from low-income and minority families.  Few of these families enjoy the means to send their children to any school other than an inner-city public school.  For more than a generation, however, Clevelands public schools have been among the worst performing public schools in the Nation.  In 1995, a Federal District Court declared a crisis of magnitude and placed the entire Cleveland school district under state control.  See 
				<em>
					Reed 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					Rhodes
				</em>
				, No. 1:73 CV 1300 (ND Ohio, Mar. 3, 1995).  Shortly thereafter, the state auditor found that Clevelands public schools were in the midst of a crisis that is perhaps unprecedented in the history of American education.  Cleveland City School District Performance Audit 21 (Mar. 1996).  The district had failed to meet any of the 18 state standards for minimal acceptable performance.  Only 1 in 10 ninth graders could pass a basic proficiency examination, and students at all levels performed at a dismal rate compared with students in other Ohio public schools.  More than two-thirds of high school students either dropped or failed out before graduation.  Of those students who managed to reach their senior year, one of every four still failed to graduate.  Of those students who did graduate, few could read, write, or compute at levels comparable to their counterparts in other cities.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It is against this backdrop that Ohio enacted, among other initiatives, its Pilot Project Scholarship Program, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §§3313.9743313.979 (Anderson 1999 and Supp. 2000) (program).  The program provides financial assistance to families in any Ohio school district that is or has been under federal court order requiring supervision and operational management of the district by the state superintendent.  §3313.975(A).  Cleveland is the only Ohio school district to fall within that category.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The program provides two basic kinds of assistance to parents of children in a covered district.  First, the program provides tuition aid for students in kindergarten through third grade, expanding each year through eighth grade, to attend a participating public or private school of their parents choosing.  §§3313.975(B) and (C)(1).  Second, the program provides tutorial aid for students who choose to remain enrolled in public school.  §3313.975(A).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The tuition aid portion of the program is designed to provide educational choices to parents who reside in a covered district.  Any private school, whether religious or nonreligious, may participate in the program and accept program students so long as the school is located within the boundaries of a covered district and meets statewide educational standards.  §313.976(A)(3).  Participating private schools must agree not to discriminate on the basis of race, religion, or ethnic background, or to advocate or foster unlawful behavior or teach hatred of any person or group on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion.  §3313.976(A)(6).  Any public school located in a school district adjacent to the covered district may also participate in the program.  §3313.976(C).  Adjacent public schools are eligible to receive a $2,250 tuition grant for each program student accepted in addition to the full amount of per-pupil state funding attributable to each additional student.  §§3313.976(C), 3317.03(I)(1).

				  All participating schools, whether public or private, are required to accept students in accordance with rules and procedures established by the state superintendent.  §§3313.977(A)(1)(a)(c).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Tuition aid is distributed to parents according to financial need.  Families with incomes below 200% of the poverty line are given priority and are eligible to receive 90% of private school tuition up to $2,250.  §§3313.978(A) and (C)(1).  For these lowest-income families, participating private schools may not charge a parental co-payment greater than $250.  §3313.976(A)(8).  For all other families, the program pays 75% of tuition costs, up to $1,875, with no co-payment cap.  §§3313.976(A)(8), 3313.978(A).  These families receive tuition aid only if the number of available scholarships exceeds the number of low-income children who choose to participate.

				  Where tuition aid is spent depends solely upon where parents who receive tuition aid choose to enroll their child.  If parents choose a private school, checks are made payable to the parents who then endorse the checks over to the chosen school.  §3313.979.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The tutorial aid portion of the program provides tutorial assistance through grants to any student in a covered district who chooses to remain in public school.  Parents arrange for registered tutors to provide assistance to their children and then submit bills for those services to the State for payment.  §§3313.976(D), 3313.979(C).  Students from low-income families receive 90% of the amount charged for such assistance up to $360.  All other students receive 75% of that amount.  §3313.978(B).  The number of tutorial assistance grants offered to students in a covered district must equal the number of tuition aid scholarships provided to students enrolled at participating private or adjacent public schools.  §3313.975(A).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The program has been in operation within the Cleveland City School District since the 19961997 school year.  In the 19992000 school year, 56 private schools participated in the program, 46 (or 82%) of which had a religious affiliation.  None of the public schools in districts adjacent to Cleveland have elected to participate.  More than 3,700 students participated in the scholarship program, most of whom (96%) enrolled in religiously affiliated schools.  Sixty percent of these students were from families at or below the poverty line.  In the 19981999 school year, approximately 1,400 Cleveland public school students received tutorial aid.  This number was expected to double during the 19992000 school year.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The program is part of a broader undertaking by the State to enhance the educational options of Clevelands schoolchildren in response to the 1995 takeover.  That undertaking includes programs governing community and magnet schools.  Community schools are funded under state law but are run by their own school boards, not by local school districts.  §§3314.01(B), 3314.04.  These schools enjoy academic independence to hire their own teachers and to determine their own curriculum.  They can have no religious affiliation and are required to accept students by lottery.  During the 19992000 school year, there were 10 start-up community schools in the Cleveland City School District with more than 1,900 students enrolled.  For each child enrolled in a community school, the school receives state funding of $4,518, twice the funding a participating program school may receive.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Magnet schools are public schools operated by a local school board that emphasize a particular subject area, teaching method, or service to students.  For each student enrolled in a magnet school, the school district receives $7,746, including state funding of $4,167, the same amount received per student enrolled at a traditional public school.  As of 1999, parents in Cleveland were able to choose from among 23 magnet schools, which together enrolled more than 13,000 students in kindergarten through eighth grade.  These schools provide specialized teaching methods, such as Montessori, or a particularized curriculum focus, such as foreign language, computers, or the arts.

				In 1996, respondents, a group of Ohio taxpayers, challenged the Ohio program in state court on state and federal grounds.  The Ohio Supreme Court rejected respondents federal claims, but held that the enactment of the program violated certain procedural requirements of the Ohio Constitution.

				In July 1999, respondents filed this action in United States District Court, seeking to enjoin the reenacted program on the ground that it violated the Establishment Clause of the United States Constitution.  In August 1999, the District Court issued a preliminary injunction barring further implementation of the program, 54 F. Supp. 2d 725 (ND Ohio), which we stayed pending review by the Court of Appeals, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/528/983" class="subref" title="subref">528 U. S. 983</a> (1999)

In December 2000, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the District Court, finding that the program had the primary effect of advancing religion in violation of the Establishment Clause.  234 F. 3d 945 (CA6).  The Court of Appeals stayed its mandate pending disposition in this Court.  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 011779, p. 151.  We granted certiorari,

				<em>

				<em>

				our jurisprudence with respect to true private choice programs has remained consistent and unbroken.

				In 
				<em>
					Mueller
				</em>
				, we rejected an Establishment Clause challenge to a Minnesota program authorizing tax deductions for various educational expenses, including private school tuition costs, even though the great majority of the programs beneficiaries (96%) were parents of children in religious schools.  We began by focusing on the class of beneficiaries, finding that because the class included 
				<em>
					all
				</em>
				 parents, including parents with children [who] attend nonsectarian private schools or sectarian private schools, 463 U. S., at 397 (emphasis in original), the program was not readily subject to challenge under the Establishment Clause,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">274</a> (1981)
 (The provision of benefits to so broad a spectrum of groups is an important index of secular effect)).  Then, viewing the program as a whole, we emphasized the principle of private choice, noting that public funds were made available to religious schools only as a result of numerous, private choices of individual parents of school-age children.  463 U. S., at 399400.  This, we said, ensured that  no imprimatur of state approval can be deemed to have been conferred on any particular religion, or on religion generally.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 399 (quoting 
				<em>
					Widmar, supra
				</em>
				, at 274)).  We thus found it irrelevant to the constitutional inquiry that the vast majority of beneficiaries were parents of children in religious schools, saying:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				We would be loath to adopt a rule grounding the constitutionality of a facially neutral law on annual reports reciting the extent to which various classes of private citizens claimed benefits under the law.  463 U. S., at 401.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
That the program was one of true private choice, with no evidence that the State deliberately skewed incentives toward religious schools, was sufficient for the program to survive scrutiny under the Establishment Clause.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In 
				<em>
					Witters
				</em>
				, we used identical reasoning to reject an Establishment Clause challenge to a vocational scholarship program that provided tuition aid to a student studying at a religious institution to become a pastor.  Looking at the program as a whole, we observed that [a]ny aid … that ultimately flows to religious institutions does so only as a result of the genuinely independent and private choices of aid recipients.  474 U. S., at 487.  We further remarked that, as in 
				<em>
					Mueller
				</em>
				, [the] program is made available generally without regard to the sectarian-nonsectarian, or public-nonpublic nature of the institution benefited.  474 U. S., at 487.  In light of these factors, we held that the program was not inconsistent with the Establishment Clause.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 488489.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Five Members of the Court, in separate opinions, emphasized the general rule from 
				<em>
					Mueller 
				</em>
				that the amount of government aid channeled to religious institutions by individual aid recipients was not relevant to the constitutional inquiry.  474 U. S., at 490491 (Powell, J., joined by Burger, C. J., and 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Rehnquist
				</span>
				, J., concurring) (citing 
				<em>

					OConnor
				</span>
				, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 490 (White, J., concurring).  Our holding thus rested not on whether few or many recipients chose to expend government aid at a religious school but, rather, on whether recipients generally were empowered to direct the aid to schools or institutions of their own choosing.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Finally, in 
				<em>
					Zobrest
				</em>
				, we applied 
				<em>
					Mueller
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Witters
				</em>
				 to reject an Establishment Clause challenge to a federal program that permitted sign-language interpreters to assist deaf children enrolled in religious schools.  Reviewing our earlier decisions, we stated that government programs that neutrally provide benefits to a broad class of citizens defined without reference to religion are not readily subject to an Establishment Clause challenge.  509 U. S., at 8.  Looking once again to the challenged program as a whole
				<em>
					,
				</em>
				 we observed that the program distributes benefits neutrally to any child qualifying as disabled.   
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 10.  Its primary beneficiaries, we said, were disabled children, not sectarian schools.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 12.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We further observed that [b]y according parents freedom to select a school of their choice, the statute ensures that a government-paid interpreter will be present in a sectarian school only as a result of the private decision of individual parents.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 10.  Our focus again was on neutrality and the principle of private choice, not on the number of program beneficiaries attending religious schools.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 1011.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Agostini,
				</em>
				 521 U. S
				<em>
					.,
				</em>
				 at 229 (
				<em>
					Zobrest
				</em>
				 did not turn on the fact that James Zobrest had, at the time of litigation, been the only child using a publicly funded sign-language interpreter to attend a parochial school).  Because the program ensured that parents were the ones to select a religious school as the best learning environment for their handicapped child, the circuit between government and religion was broken, and the Establishment Clause was not implicated.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>
					Mueller
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Witters
				</em>
				, and 
				<em>
					Zobrest

				 thus make clear that where a government aid program is neutral with respect to religion, and provides assistance directly to a broad class of citizens who, in turn, direct government aid to religious schools wholly as a result of their own genuine and independent private choice, the program is not readily subject to challenge under the Establishment Clause.  A program that shares these features permits government aid to reach religious institutions only by way of the deliberate choices of numerous individual recipients.  The incidental advancement of a religious mission, or the perceived endorsement of a religious message, is reasonably attributable to the individual recipient, not to the government, whose role ends with the disbursement of benefits.  As a plurality of this Court recently observed:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				[I]f numerous private choices, rather than the single choice of a government, determine the distribution of aid, pursuant to neutral eligibility criteria, then a government cannot, or at least cannot easily, grant special favors that might lead to a religious establishment.

				<em>

				<em>
					Witters

				, and 
				<em>

				, and thus constitutional.  As was true in those cases, the Ohio program is neutral in all respects toward religion.  It is part of a general and multifaceted undertaking by the State of Ohio to provide educational opportunities to the children of a failed school district.  It confers educational assistance directly to a broad class of individuals defined without reference to religion, 
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, any parent of a school-age child who resides in the Cleveland City School District.  The program permits the participation of 
				<em>
					all
				</em>
				 schools within the district, religious or nonreligious.  Adjacent public schools also may participate and have a financial incentive to do so.  Program benefits are available to participating families on neutral terms, with no reference to religion.  The only preference stated anywhere in the program is a preference for low-income families, who receive greater assistance and are given priority for admission at participating schools.

Adjacent public schools, should any choose to accept program students, are also eligible to receive two to three times the state funding of a private religious school.  Families too have a financial disincentive to choose a private religious school over other schools.  Parents that choose to participate in the scholarship program and then to enroll their children in a private school (religious or nonreligious) must copay a portion of the schools tuition.  Families that choose a community school, magnet school, or traditional public school pay nothing.  Although such features of the program are not necessary to its constitutionality, they clearly dispel the claim that the program creates … financial incentive[s] for parents to choose a sectarian school.

				Respondents suggest that even without a financial incentive for parents to choose a religious school, the program creates a public perception that the State is endorsing religious practices and beliefs.  Brief for Respondents Simmons-Harris et al. 3738.  But we have repeatedly recognized that no reasonable observer would think a neutral program of private choice, where state aid reaches religious schools solely as a result of the numerous independent decisions of private individuals, carries with it the

				There also is no evidence that the program fails to provide genuine opportunities for Cleveland parents to select secular educational options for their school-age children.  Cleveland schoolchildren enjoy a range of educational choices: They may remain in public school as before, remain in public school with publicly funded tutoring aid, obtain a scholarship and choose a religious school, obtain a scholarship and choose a nonreligious private school, enroll in a community school, or enroll in a magnet school.  That 46 of the 56 private schools now participating in the program are religious schools does not condemn it as a violation of the Establishment Clause.  The Establishment Clause question is whether Ohio is coercing parents into sending their children to religious schools, and that question must be answered by evaluating 
				<em>
					all
				</em>
				 options Ohio provides Cleveland schoolchildren, only one of which is to obtain a program scholarship and then choose a religious school.

				  But Clevelands preponderance of religiously affiliated private schools certainly did not arise as a result of the program; it is a phenomenon common to many American cities.  See U. S. Dept. of Ed., National Center for Education Statistics, Private School Universe Survey: 19992000, pp. 24 (NCES 2001330, 2001) (hereinafter Private School Universe Survey) (cited in Brief for United States as 
				<em>
					Amicus Curiae
				</em>
				 24).  Indeed, by all accounts the program has captured a remarkable cross-section of private schools, religious and nonreligious.  It is true that 82% of Clevelands participating private schools are religious schools, but it is also true that 81% of private schools in Ohio are religious schools.  See Brief for State of Florida et al. as 
				<em>
					Amici Curiae
				</em>
				 16 (citing Private School Universe Survey).  To attribute constitutional significance to this figure, moreover, would lead to the absurd result that a neutral school-choice program might be permissible in some parts of Ohio, such as Columbus, where a lower percentage of private schools are religious schools, see Ohio Educational Directory (Lodging of Respondents Gatton et al., available in Clerk of Courts case file), and Reply Brief for Petitioners in No. 001751, p. 12, n. 1, but not in inner-city Cleveland, where Ohio has deemed such programs most sorely needed, but where the preponderance of religious schools happens to be greater.  Cf. Brief for State of Florida et al. as 
				<em>
					Amici Curiae
				</em>
				 17 ([T]he percentages of sectarian to nonsectarian private schools within Floridas 67 school districts … vary from zero to 100 percent).  Likewise, an identical private choice program might be constitutional in some States, such as Maine or Utah, where less than 45% of private schools are religious schools, but not in other States, such as Nebraska or Kansas, where over 90% of private schools are religious schools.

				Respondents and

					Justice Souter

				claim that even if we do not focus on the number of participating schools that are religious schools, we should attach constitutional significance to the fact that 96% of scholarship recipients have enrolled in religious schools.  They claim that this alone proves parents lack genuine choice, even if no parent has ever said so.  We need not consider this argument in detail, since it was flatly rejected in 
				<em>
					Mueller
				</em>
				, where we found it irrelevant that 96% of parents taking deductions for tuition expenses paid tuition at religious schools.  Indeed, we have recently found it irrelevant even to the constitutionality of a direct aid program that a vast majority of program benefits went to religious schools.  See 
				<em>
					Agostini
				</em>
				, 521 U. S., at 229 (Nor are we willing to conclude that the constitutionality of an aid program depends on the number of sectarian school students who happen to receive the otherwise neutral aid (citing

				<em>

				This point is aptly illustrated here.  The 96% figure upon which respondents and 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter 
				</span>
				rely discounts entirely (1) the more than 1,900 Cleveland children enrolled in alternative community schools, (2) the more than 13,000 children enrolled in alternative magnet schools, and (3) the more than 1,400 children enrolled in traditional public schools with tutorial assistance.  See s
				<em>
					upra
				</em>
				, at 56.  Including some or all of these children in the denominator of children enrolled in nontraditional schools during the 19992000 school year drops the percentage enrolled in religious schools from 96% to under 20%.  See also J. Greene, The Racial, Economic, and Religious Context of Parental Choice in Cleveland 11, Table 4 (Oct. 8, 1999), App. 217a (reporting that only 16.5% of nontraditional schoolchildren in Cleveland choose religious schools).  The 96% figure also represents but a snapshot of one particular school year.  In the 19971998 school year, by contrast, only 78% of scholarship recipients attended religious schools.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 011751, p. 5a.  The difference was attributable to two private nonreligious schools that had accepted 15% of all scholarship students electing instead to register as community schools, in light of larger per-pupil funding for community schools and the uncertain future of the scholarship program generated by this litigation.  See App. 59a62a, 209a, 223a227a.

				<em>
					Nyquist
				</em>
				 was quite different from the program challenged here.  
				<em>
					Nyquist
				</em>
				 involved a New York program that gave a package of benefits exclusively to private schools and the parents of private school enrollees.  Although the program was enacted for ostensibly secular purposes, 
				<em>
					id.

				, at 773774, we found that its function was 
				<em>
					unmistakably
				</em>
				 to provide desired financial support for nonpublic, sectarian institutions, 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 783 (emphasis added).  Its genesis, we said, was that private religious schools faced increasingly grave fiscal problems.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 795.  The program thus provided direct money grants to religious schools.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 762764.  It provided tax benefits unrelated to the amount of money actually expended by any parent on tuition, ensuring a windfall to parents of children in religious schools.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 790.  It similarly provided tuition reimbursements designed explicitly to offe[r] … an incentive to parents to send their children to sectarian schools.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 786.  Indeed, the program flatly prohibited the participation of any public school, or parent of any public school enrollee.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 763765.  Ohios program shares none of these features.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, were there any doubt that the program challenged in 
				<em>
					Nyquist
				</em>
				 is far removed from the program challenged here, we expressly reserved judgment with respect to a case involving some form of public assistance (
				<em>
					e.g.

				, scholarships) made available generally without regard to the sectarian-nonsectarian, or public-nonpublic nature of the institution benefited.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 783, n. 38.  That, of course, is the very question now before us, and it has since been answered, first in 
				<em>
					Mueller
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				463 U. S., at 398399 ([A] program … that neutrally provides state assistance to a broad spectrum of citizens is not readily subject to challenge under the Establishment Clause (citing

				<em>

				<em>
					Nyquist
				</em>
				 has remained an open question in light of these later decisions, we now hold that 
				<em>
					Nyquist
				</em>
				 does not govern neutral educational assistance programs that, like the program here, offer aid directly to a broad class of individual recipients defined without regard to religion.

				In sum, the Ohio program is entirely neutral with respect to religion.  It provides benefits directly to a wide spectrum of individuals, defined only by financial need and residence in a particular school district.  It permits such individuals to exercise genuine choice among options public and private, secular and religious.  The program is therefore a program of true private choice.  In keeping with an unbroken line of decisions rejecting challenges to similar programs, we hold that the program does not offend the Establishment Clause.

						 Although the parties dispute the precise amount of state funding received by suburban school districts adjacent to the Cleveland City School District, there is no dispute that any suburban district agreeing to participate in the program would receive a $2,250 tuition grant plus the ordinary allotment of per-pupil state funding for each program student enrolled in a suburban public school.

						 Justice Souter suggests the program is not neutral because program students cannot spend scholarship vouchers at traditional public schools.  Post, at 1314 (dissenting opinion).  This objection is mistaken: Public schools in Cleveland already receive $7,097 in public funding per pupil$4,167 of which is attributable to the State.  App. 56a.  Program students who receive tutoring aid and remain enrolled in traditional public schools therefore direct almost twice as much state funding to their chosen school as do program students who receive a scholarship and attend a private school.  Ibid.  Justice Souter does not seriously claim that the program differentiates based on the religious status of beneficiaries or providers of services, the touchstone of neutrality under the Establishment Clause.

						 Justice Souter appears to base this claim on the unfounded assumption that capping the amount of tuition charged to low-income students (at $2,500) favors participation by religious schools.  Post, at 2122 (dissenting opinion).  But elsewhere he claims that the program spends too much money on private schools and chides the state legislature for even proposing to raise the scholarship amount for low-income recipients.  Post, at 1011, 2728, 3132.  His assumption also finds no support in the record, which shows that nonreligious private schools operating in Cleveland also seek and receive substantial third-party contributions.  App. 194a195a; App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 001777, p. 119a.  Indeed, the actual operation of the program refutes Justice Souters argument that few but religious schools can afford to participate: Ten secular private schools operated within the Cleveland City School District when the program was adopted.  Reply Brief for Petitioners in No. 001777, p. 4 (citing Ohio Educational Directory, 19992000 School Year, Alphabetic List of Nonpublic Schools, Ohio Dept. of Education).  All 10 chose to participate in the program and have continued to participate to this day.  App. 281a286a.  And while no religious schools have been created in response to the program, several nonreligious schools have been created, id., at 144a148a, 224a225a, in spite of the fact that a principal barrier to entry of new private schools is the uncertainty caused by protracted litigation which has plagued the program since its inception, post, at 11 (OConnor, J., concurring) (citing App. 225a, 227a).  See also 234 F. 3d 945, 970 (CA6 2000) (There is not a scintilla of evidence in this case that any school, public or private, has been discouraged from participating in the school voucher program because it cannot afford to do so) (Ryan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  Similarly mistaken is Justice Souters reliance on the low enrollment of scholarship students in nonreligious schools during the 19992000 school year.  Post, at 21 (citing Brief for California Alliance for Public Schools as Amicus Curiae 15).  These figures ignore the fact that the number of program students enrolled in nonreligious schools has widely varied from year to year, infra, at 1718; e.g., n. 5, infra, underscoring why the constitutionality of a neutral choice program does not turn on annual tallies of private decisions made in any given year by thousands of individual aid recipients, infra, at 1617 (citing Mueller v.

						 The fluctuations seen in the Cleveland program are hardly atypical.  Experience in Milwaukee, which since 1991 has operated an educational choice program similar to the Ohio program, demonstrates that the mix of participating schools fluctuates significantly from year to year based on a number of factors, one of which is the uncertainty caused by persistent litigation.  See App. 218a, 229a236a; Brief for State of Wisconsin as Amicus Curiae 1013 (hereinafter Brief for Wisconsin) (citing Wisconsin Dept. of Public Instruction, Milwaukee Parental Choice Program Facts and Figures for 20012002).  Since the Wisconsin Supreme Court declared the Milwaukee program constitutional in 1998, Jackson v. Benson, 218 Wis. 2d 835, 578 N. W. 2d 602 (1998), several nonreligious private schools have entered the Milwaukee market, and now represent 32% of all participating schools.  Brief for Wisconsin 1112.  Similarly, the number of program students attending nonreligious private schools increased from 2,048 to 3,582; these students now represent 33% of all program students.  Id., at 1213.  There are currently 34 nonreligious private schools participating in the Milwaukee program, a nearly a five-fold increase from the 7 nonreligious schools that participated when the program began in 1990.  See App. 218a; Brief for Wisconsin 12.  And the total number of students enrolled in nonreligious schools has grown from 337 when the program began to 3,582 in the most recent school year.  See App. 218a, 234a236a; Brief for Wisconsin 1213.  These numbers further demonstrate the wisdom of our refusal in Mueller v. Allen,

						 Justice Souter and Justice Stevens claim that community schools and magnet schools are separate and distinct from program schools, simply because the program itself does not include community and magnet school options.  Post, at 1417 (Souter, J., dissenting); post, at 2 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  But none of the dissenting opinions explain how there is any perceptible difference between scholarship schools, community schools, or magnet schools from the perspective of Cleveland parents looking to choose the best educational option for their school-age children.  Parents who choose a program school in fact receive from the State precisely what parents who choose a community or magnet school receivethe opportunity to send their children largely at state expense to schools they prefer to their local public school.  See, e.g., App. 147a, 168a169a; App. in Nos. 00305, etc. (CA6), pp. 16351645 and 16571673 (Cleveland parents who enroll their children in schools other than local public schools typically explore all state-funded options before choosing an alternative school).

						 Justice Breyer would raise the invisible specters of divisiveness and religious strife to find the program unconstitutional.  Post, at 3, 913 (dissenting opinion).  It is unclear exactly what sort of principle Justice Breyer has in mind, considering that the program has ignited no divisiveness or strife other than this litigation.  Nor is it clear where Justice Breyer would locate this presumed authority to deprive Cleveland residents of a program that they have chosen but that we subjectively find divisive.  We quite rightly have rejected the claim that some speculative potential for divisiveness bears on the constitutionality of educational aid programs.

				The State of Ohio has established a pilot program designed to provide educational choices to families with children who reside in the Cleveland City School District.  The question presented is whether this program offends the Establishment Clause of the United States Constitution.  We hold that it does not.

				There are more than 75,000 children enrolled in the Cleveland City School District.  The majority of these children are from low-income and minority families.  Few of these families enjoy the means to send their children to any school other than an inner-city public school.  For more than a generation, however, Clevelands public schools have been among the worst performing public schools in the Nation.  In 1995, a Federal District Court declared a crisis of magnitude and placed the entire Cleveland school district under state control.  See 
				<em>
					Reed 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					Rhodes
				</em>
				, No. 1:73 CV 1300 (ND Ohio, Mar. 3, 1995).  Shortly thereafter, the state auditor found that Clevelands public schools were in the midst of a crisis that is perhaps unprecedented in the history of American education.  Cleveland City School District Performance Audit 21 (Mar. 1996).  The district had failed to meet any of the 18 state standards for minimal acceptable performance.  Only 1 in 10 ninth graders could pass a basic proficiency examination, and students at all levels performed at a dismal rate compared with students in other Ohio public schools.  More than two-thirds of high school students either dropped or failed out before graduation.  Of those students who managed to reach their senior year, one of every four still failed to graduate.  Of those students who did graduate, few could read, write, or compute at levels comparable to their counterparts in other cities.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It is against this backdrop that Ohio enacted, among other initiatives, its Pilot Project Scholarship Program, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §§3313.9743313.979 (Anderson 1999 and Supp. 2000) (program).  The program provides financial assistance to families in any Ohio school district that is or has been under federal court order requiring supervision and operational management of the district by the state superintendent.  §3313.975(A).  Cleveland is the only Ohio school district to fall within that category.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The program provides two basic kinds of assistance to parents of children in a covered district.  First, the program provides tuition aid for students in kindergarten through third grade, expanding each year through eighth grade, to attend a participating public or private school of their parents choosing.  §§3313.975(B) and (C)(1).  Second, the program provides tutorial aid for students who choose to remain enrolled in public school.  §3313.975(A).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The tuition aid portion of the program is designed to provide educational choices to parents who reside in a covered district.  Any private school, whether religious or nonreligious, may participate in the program and accept program students so long as the school is located within the boundaries of a covered district and meets statewide educational standards.  §313.976(A)(3).  Participating private schools must agree not to discriminate on the basis of race, religion, or ethnic background, or to advocate or foster unlawful behavior or teach hatred of any person or group on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion.  §3313.976(A)(6).  Any public school located in a school district adjacent to the covered district may also participate in the program.  §3313.976(C).  Adjacent public schools are eligible to receive a $2,250 tuition grant for each program student accepted in addition to the full amount of per-pupil state funding attributable to each additional student.  §§3313.976(C), 3317.03(I)(1).

				  All participating schools, whether public or private, are required to accept students in accordance with rules and procedures established by the state superintendent.  §§3313.977(A)(1)(a)(c).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Tuition aid is distributed to parents according to financial need.  Families with incomes below 200% of the poverty line are given priority and are eligible to receive 90% of private school tuition up to $2,250.  §§3313.978(A) and (C)(1).  For these lowest-income families, participating private schools may not charge a parental co-payment greater than $250.  §3313.976(A)(8).  For all other families, the program pays 75% of tuition costs, up to $1,875, with no co-payment cap.  §§3313.976(A)(8), 3313.978(A).  These families receive tuition aid only if the number of available scholarships exceeds the number of low-income children who choose to participate.

				  Where tuition aid is spent depends solely upon where parents who receive tuition aid choose to enroll their child.  If parents choose a private school, checks are made payable to the parents who then endorse the checks over to the chosen school.  §3313.979.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The tutorial aid portion of the program provides tutorial assistance through grants to any student in a covered district who chooses to remain in public school.  Parents arrange for registered tutors to provide assistance to their children and then submit bills for those services to the State for payment.  §§3313.976(D), 3313.979(C).  Students from low-income families receive 90% of the amount charged for such assistance up to $360.  All other students receive 75% of that amount.  §3313.978(B).  The number of tutorial assistance grants offered to students in a covered district must equal the number of tuition aid scholarships provided to students enrolled at participating private or adjacent public schools.  §3313.975(A).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The program has been in operation within the Cleveland City School District since the 19961997 school year.  In the 19992000 school year, 56 private schools participated in the program, 46 (or 82%) of which had a religious affiliation.  None of the public schools in districts adjacent to Cleveland have elected to participate.  More than 3,700 students participated in the scholarship program, most of whom (96%) enrolled in religiously affiliated schools.  Sixty percent of these students were from families at or below the poverty line.  In the 19981999 school year, approximately 1,400 Cleveland public school students received tutorial aid.  This number was expected to double during the 19992000 school year.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The program is part of a broader undertaking by the State to enhance the educational options of Clevelands schoolchildren in response to the 1995 takeover.  That undertaking includes programs governing community and magnet schools.  Community schools are funded under state law but are run by their own school boards, not by local school districts.  §§3314.01(B), 3314.04.  These schools enjoy academic independence to hire their own teachers and to determine their own curriculum.  They can have no religious affiliation and are required to accept students by lottery.  During the 19992000 school year, there were 10 start-up community schools in the Cleveland City School District with more than 1,900 students enrolled.  For each child enrolled in a community school, the school receives state funding of $4,518, twice the funding a participating program school may receive.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Magnet schools are public schools operated by a local school board that emphasize a particular subject area, teaching method, or service to students.  For each student enrolled in a magnet school, the school district receives $7,746, including state funding of $4,167, the same amount received per student enrolled at a traditional public school.  As of 1999, parents in Cleveland were able to choose from among 23 magnet schools, which together enrolled more than 13,000 students in kindergarten through eighth grade.  These schools provide specialized teaching methods, such as Montessori, or a particularized curriculum focus, such as foreign language, computers, or the arts.

				In 1996, respondents, a group of Ohio taxpayers, challenged the Ohio program in state court on state and federal grounds.  The Ohio Supreme Court rejected respondents federal claims, but held that the enactment of the program violated certain procedural requirements of the Ohio Constitution.

				In July 1999, respondents filed this action in United States District Court, seeking to enjoin the reenacted program on the ground that it violated the Establishment Clause of the United States Constitution.  In August 1999, the District Court issued a preliminary injunction barring further implementation of the program, 54 F. Supp. 2d 725 (ND Ohio), which we stayed pending review by the Court of Appeals, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/528/983" class="subref" title="subref">528 U. S. 983</a> (1999)
.  In December 1999, the District Court granted summary judgment for respondents.  72 F. Supp. 2d 834.  In December 2000, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the District Court, finding that the program had the primary effect of advancing religion in violation of the Establishment Clause.  234 F. 3d 945 (CA6).  The Court of Appeals stayed its mandate pending disposition in this Court.  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 011779, p. 151.  We granted certiorari,

				<em>

				<em>

				our jurisprudence with respect to true private choice programs has remained consistent and unbroken.

				In 
				<em>
					Mueller
				</em>
				, we rejected an Establishment Clause challenge to a Minnesota program authorizing tax deductions for various educational expenses, including private school tuition costs, even though the great majority of the programs beneficiaries (96%) were parents of children in religious schools.  We began by focusing on the class of beneficiaries, finding that because the class included 
				<em>
					all
				</em>
				 parents, including parents with children [who] attend nonsectarian private schools or sectarian private schools, 463 U. S., at 397 (emphasis in original), the program was not readily subject to challenge under the Establishment Clause,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">274</a> (1981)
 (The provision of benefits to so broad a spectrum of groups is an important index of secular effect)).  Then, viewing the program as a whole, we emphasized the principle of private choice, noting that public funds were made available to religious schools only as a result of numerous, private choices of individual parents of school-age children.  463 U. S., at 399400.  This, we said, ensured that  no imprimatur of state approval can be deemed to have been conferred on any particular religion, or on religion generally.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 399 (quoting 
				<em>
					Widmar, supra
				</em>
				, at 274)).  We thus found it irrelevant to the constitutional inquiry that the vast majority of beneficiaries were parents of children in religious schools, saying:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				We would be loath to adopt a rule grounding the constitutionality of a facially neutral law on annual reports reciting the extent to which various classes of private citizens claimed benefits under the law.  463 U. S., at 401.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
That the program was one of true private choice, with no evidence that the State deliberately skewed incentives toward religious schools, was sufficient for the program to survive scrutiny under the Establishment Clause.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In 
				<em>
					Witters
				</em>
				, we used identical reasoning to reject an Establishment Clause challenge to a vocational scholarship program that provided tuition aid to a student studying at a religious institution to become a pastor.  Looking at the program as a whole, we observed that [a]ny aid … that ultimately flows to religious institutions does so only as a result of the genuinely independent and private choices of aid recipients.  474 U. S., at 487.  We further remarked that, as in 
				<em>
					Mueller
				</em>
				, [the] program is made available generally without regard to the sectarian-nonsectarian, or public-nonpublic nature of the institution benefited.  474 U. S., at 487.  In light of these factors, we held that the program was not inconsistent with the Establishment Clause.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 488489.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Five Members of the Court, in separate opinions, emphasized the general rule from 
				<em>
					Mueller 
				</em>
				that the amount of government aid channeled to religious institutions by individual aid recipients was not relevant to the constitutional inquiry.  474 U. S., at 490491 (Powell, J., joined by Burger, C. J., and 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Rehnquist
				</span>
				, J., concurring) (citing 
				<em>

					OConnor
				</span>
				, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 490 (White, J., concurring).  Our holding thus rested not on whether few or many recipients chose to expend government aid at a religious school but, rather, on whether recipients generally were empowered to direct the aid to schools or institutions of their own choosing.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Finally, in 
				<em>
					Zobrest
				</em>
				, we applied 
				<em>
					Mueller
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Witters
				</em>
				 to reject an Establishment Clause challenge to a federal program that permitted sign-language interpreters to assist deaf children enrolled in religious schools.  Reviewing our earlier decisions, we stated that government programs that neutrally provide benefits to a broad class of citizens defined without reference to religion are not readily subject to an Establishment Clause challenge.  509 U. S., at 8.  Looking once again to the challenged program as a whole
				<em>
					,
				</em>
				 we observed that the program distributes benefits neutrally to any child qualifying as disabled.   
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 10.  Its primary beneficiaries, we said, were disabled children, not sectarian schools.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 12.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We further observed that [b]y according parents freedom to select a school of their choice, the statute ensures that a government-paid interpreter will be present in a sectarian school only as a result of the private decision of individual parents.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 10.  Our focus again was on neutrality and the principle of private choice, not on the number of program beneficiaries attending religious schools.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 1011.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Agostini,
				</em>
				 521 U. S
				<em>
					.,
				</em>
				 at 229 (
				<em>
					Zobrest
				</em>
				 did not turn on the fact that James Zobrest had, at the time of litigation, been the only child using a publicly funded sign-language interpreter to attend a parochial school).  Because the program ensured that parents were the ones to select a religious school as the best learning environment for their handicapped child, the circuit between government and religion was broken, and the Establishment Clause was not implicated.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>
					Mueller
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					Witters
				</em>
				, and 
				<em>
					Zobrest
				</em>
				 thus make clear that where a government aid program is neutral with respect to religion, and provides assistance directly to a broad class of citizens who, in turn, direct government aid to religious schools wholly as a result of their own genuine and independent private choice, the program is not readily subject to challenge under the Establishment Clause.  A program that shares these features permits government aid to reach religious institutions only by way of the deliberate choices of numerous individual recipients.  The incidental advancement of a religious mission, or the perceived endorsement of a religious message, is reasonably attributable to the individual recipient, not to the government, whose role ends with the disbursement of benefits.  As a plurality of this Court recently observed:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				[I]f numerous private choices, rather than the single choice of a government, determine the distribution of aid, pursuant to neutral eligibility criteria, then a government cannot, or at least cannot easily, grant special favors that might lead to a religious establishment.

It is part of a general and multifaceted undertaking by the State of Ohio to provide educational opportunities to the children of a failed school district.  It confers educational assistance directly to a broad class of individuals defined without reference to religion, 
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, any parent of a school-age child who resides in the Cleveland City School District.  The program permits the participation of 
				<em>
					all
				</em>
				 schools within the district, religious or nonreligious.  Adjacent public schools also may participate and have a financial incentive to do so.  Program benefits are available to participating families on neutral terms, with no reference to religion.  The only preference stated anywhere in the program is a preference for low-income families, who receive greater assistance and are given priority for admission at participating schools.

Adjacent public schools, should any choose to accept program students, are also eligible to receive two to three times the state funding of a private religious school.  Families too have a financial disincentive to choose a private religious school over other schools.  Parents that choose to participate in the scholarship program and then to enroll their children in a private school (religious or nonreligious) must copay a portion of the schools tuition.  Families that choose a community school, magnet school, or traditional public school pay nothing.  Although such features of the program are not necessary to its constitutionality, they clearly dispel the claim that the program creates … financial incentive[s] for parents to choose a sectarian school.

				Respondents suggest that even without a financial incentive for parents to choose a religious school, the program creates a public perception that the State is endorsing religious practices and beliefs.  Brief for Respondents Simmons-Harris et al. 3738.

				There also is no evidence that the program fails to provide genuine opportunities for Cleveland parents to select secular educational options for their school-age children.  Cleveland schoolchildren enjoy a range of educational choices: They may remain in public school as before, remain in public school with publicly funded tutoring aid, obtain a scholarship and choose a religious school, obtain a scholarship and choose a nonreligious private school, enroll in a community school, or enroll in a magnet school.  That 46 of the 56 private schools now participating in the program are religious schools does not condemn it as a violation of the Establishment Clause.  The Establishment Clause question is whether Ohio is coercing parents into sending their children to religious schools, and that question must be answered by evaluating 
				<em>
					all
				</em>
				 options Ohio provides Cleveland schoolchildren, only one of which is to obtain a program scholarship and then choose a religious school.

				  But Clevelands preponderance of religiously affiliated private schools certainly did not arise as a result of the program; it is a phenomenon common to many American cities.  See U. S. Dept. of Ed., National Center for Education Statistics, Private School Universe Survey: 19992000, pp. 24 (NCES 2001330, 2001) (hereinafter Private School Universe Survey) (cited in Brief for United States as 
				<em>
					Amicus Curiae
				</em>
				 24).  Indeed, by all accounts the program has captured a remarkable cross-section of private schools, religious and nonreligious.  It is true that 82% of Clevelands participating private schools are religious schools, but it is also true that 81% of private schools in Ohio are religious schools.  See Brief for State of Florida et al. as 
				<em>
					Amici Curiae
				</em>
				 16 (citing Private School Universe Survey).  To attribute constitutional significance to this figure, moreover, would lead to the absurd result that a neutral school-choice program might be permissible in some parts of Ohio, such as Columbus, where a lower percentage of private schools are religious schools, see Ohio Educational Directory (Lodging of Respondents Gatton et al., available in Clerk of Courts case file), and Reply Brief for Petitioners in No. 001751, p. 12, n. 1, but not in inner-city Cleveland, where Ohio has deemed such programs most sorely needed, but where the preponderance of religious schools happens to be greater.  Cf. Brief for State of Florida et al. as 
				<em>
					Amici Curiae
				</em>
				 17 ([T]he percentages of sectarian to nonsectarian private schools within Floridas 67 school districts … vary from zero to 100 percent).  Likewise, an identical private choice program might be constitutional in some States, such as Maine or Utah, where less than 45% of private schools are religious schools, but not in other States, such as Nebraska or Kansas, where over 90% of private schools are religious schools.

				Respondents and

				claim that even if we do not focus on the number of participating schools that are religious schools, we should attach constitutional significance to the fact that 96% of scholarship recipients have enrolled in religious schools.  They claim that this alone proves parents lack genuine choice, even if no parent has ever said so.  We need not consider this argument in detail, since it was flatly rejected in 
				<em>
					Mueller
				</em>
				, where we found it irrelevant that 96% of parents taking deductions for tuition expenses paid tuition at religious schools.  Indeed, we have recently found it irrelevant even to the constitutionality of a direct aid program that a vast majority of program benefits went to religious schools.  See 
				<em>
					Agostini

				, 521 U. S., at 229 (Nor are we willing to conclude that the constitutionality of an aid program depends on the number of sectarian school students who happen to receive the otherwise neutral aid (citing

				<em>

				This point is aptly illustrated here.  The 96% figure upon which respondents and 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter 
				</span>
				rely discounts entirely (1) the more than 1,900 Cleveland children enrolled in alternative community schools, (2) the more than 13,000 children enrolled in alternative magnet schools, and (3) the more than 1,400 children enrolled in traditional public schools with tutorial assistance.  See s

				, at 56.  Including some or all of these children in the denominator of children enrolled in nontraditional schools during the 19992000 school year drops the percentage enrolled in religious schools from 96% to under 20%.  See also J. Greene, The Racial, Economic, and Religious Context of Parental Choice in Cleveland 11, Table 4 (Oct. 8, 1999), App. 217a (reporting that only 16.5% of nontraditional schoolchildren in Cleveland choose religious schools).  The 96% figure also represents but a snapshot of one particular school year.  In the 19971998 school year, by contrast, only 78% of scholarship recipients attended religious schools.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 011751, p. 5a.  The difference was attributable to two private nonreligious schools that had accepted 15% of all scholarship students electing instead to register as community schools, in light of larger per-pupil funding for community schools and the uncertain future of the scholarship program generated by this litigation.  See App. 59a62a, 209a, 223a227a.

				<em>
					Nyquist
				</em>
				 was quite different from the program challenged here.  
				<em>
					Nyquist
				</em>
				 involved a New York program that gave a package of benefits exclusively to private schools and the parents of private school enrollees.  Although the program was enacted for ostensibly secular purposes, 
				<em>
					id.

				, at 773774, we found that its function was 
				<em>
					unmistakably
				</em>
				 to provide desired financial support for nonpublic, sectarian institutions, 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 783 (emphasis added).  Its genesis, we said, was that private religious schools faced increasingly grave fiscal problems.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 795.  The program thus provided direct money grants to religious schools.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 762764.  It provided tax benefits unrelated to the amount of money actually expended by any parent on tuition, ensuring a windfall to parents of children in religious schools.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 790.  It similarly provided tuition reimbursements designed explicitly to offe[r] … an incentive to parents to send their children to sectarian schools.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 786.  Indeed, the program flatly prohibited the participation of any public school, or parent of any public school enrollee.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 763765.  Ohios program shares none of these features.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, were there any doubt that the program challenged in 
				<em>
					Nyquist
				</em>
				 is far removed from the program challenged here, we expressly reserved judgment with respect to a case involving some form of public assistance (
				<em>

				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 783, n. 38.  That, of course, is the very question now before us, and it has since been answered, first in 
				<em>
					Mueller
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				463 U. S., at 398399 ([A] program … that neutrally provides state assistance to a broad spectrum of citizens is not readily subject to challenge under the Establishment Clause (citing

				<em>

				<em>
					Nyquist
				</em>
				 has remained an open question in light of these later decisions, we now hold that 
				<em>
					Nyquist
				</em>
				 does not govern neutral educational assistance programs that, like the program here, offer aid directly to a broad class of individual recipients defined without regard to religion.

				In sum, the Ohio program is entirely neutral with respect to religion.

In keeping with an unbroken line of decisions rejecting challenges to similar programs, we hold that the program does not offend the Establishment Clause.

						 Although the parties dispute the precise amount of state funding received by suburban school districts adjacent to the Cleveland City School District, there is no dispute that any suburban district agreeing to participate in the program would receive a $2,250 tuition grant plus the ordinary allotment of per-pupil state funding for each program student enrolled in a suburban public school.

						 Justice Souter suggests the program is not neutral because program students cannot spend scholarship vouchers at traditional public schools.  Post, at 1314 (dissenting opinion).  This objection is mistaken: Public schools in Cleveland already receive $7,097 in public funding per pupil$4,167 of which is attributable to the State.  App. 56a.  Program students who receive tutoring aid and remain enrolled in traditional public schools therefore direct almost twice as much state funding to their chosen school as do program students who receive a scholarship and attend a private school.  Ibid.  Justice Souter does not seriously claim that the program differentiates based on the religious status of beneficiaries or providers of services, the touchstone of neutrality under the Establishment Clause.

						 Justice Souter appears to base this claim on the unfounded assumption that capping the amount of tuition charged to low-income students (at $2,500) favors participation by religious schools.  Post, at 2122 (dissenting opinion).  But elsewhere he claims that the program spends too much money on private schools and chides the state legislature for even proposing to raise the scholarship amount for low-income recipients.  Post, at 1011, 2728, 3132.  His assumption also finds no support in the record, which shows that nonreligious private schools operating in Cleveland also seek and receive substantial third-party contributions.  App. 194a195a; App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 001777, p. 119a.  Indeed, the actual operation of the program refutes Justice Souters argument that few but religious schools can afford to participate: Ten secular private schools operated within the Cleveland City School District when the program was adopted.  Reply Brief for Petitioners in No. 001777, p. 4 (citing Ohio Educational Directory, 19992000 School Year, Alphabetic List of Nonpublic Schools, Ohio Dept. of Education).  All 10 chose to participate in the program and have continued to participate to this day.  App. 281a286a.  And while no religious schools have been created in response to the program, several nonreligious schools have been created, id., at 144a148a, 224a225a, in spite of the fact that a principal barrier to entry of new private schools is the uncertainty caused by protracted litigation which has plagued the program since its inception, post, at 11 (OConnor, J., concurring) (citing App. 225a, 227a).  See also 234 F. 3d 945, 970 (CA6 2000) (There is not a scintilla of evidence in this case that any school, public or private, has been discouraged from participating in the school voucher program because it cannot afford to do so) (Ryan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  Similarly mistaken is Justice Souters reliance on the low enrollment of scholarship students in nonreligious schools during the 19992000 school year.  Post, at 21 (citing Brief for California Alliance for Public Schools as Amicus Curiae 15).  These figures ignore the fact that the number of program students enrolled in nonreligious schools has widely varied from year to year, infra, at 1718; e.g., n. 5, infra, underscoring why the constitutionality of a neutral choice program does not turn on annual tallies of private decisions made in any given year by thousands of individual aid recipients, infra, at 1617 (citing Mueller v.

						 The fluctuations seen in the Cleveland program are hardly atypical.  Experience in Milwaukee, which since 1991 has operated an educational choice program similar to the Ohio program, demonstrates that the mix of participating schools fluctuates significantly from year to year based on a number of factors, one of which is the uncertainty caused by persistent litigation.  See App. 218a, 229a236a; Brief for State of Wisconsin as Amicus Curiae 1013 (hereinafter Brief for Wisconsin) (citing Wisconsin Dept. of Public Instruction, Milwaukee Parental Choice Program Facts and Figures for 20012002).  Since the Wisconsin Supreme Court declared the Milwaukee program constitutional in 1998, Jackson v. Benson, 218 Wis. 2d 835, 578 N. W. 2d 602 (1998), several nonreligious private schools have entered the Milwaukee market, and now represent 32% of all participating schools.  Brief for Wisconsin 1112.  Similarly, the number of program students attending nonreligious private schools increased from 2,048 to 3,582; these students now represent 33% of all program students.  Id., at 1213.  There are currently 34 nonreligious private schools participating in the Milwaukee program, a nearly a five-fold increase from the 7 nonreligious schools that participated when the program began in 1990.  See App. 218a; Brief for Wisconsin 12.  And the total number of students enrolled in nonreligious schools has grown from 337 when the program began to 3,582 in the most recent school year.  See App. 218a, 234a236a; Brief for Wisconsin 1213.  These numbers further demonstrate the wisdom of our refusal in Mueller v. Allen, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/463/388" class="subref" title="subref">463 U. S. 388</a>,

						 Justice Souter and Justice Stevens claim that community schools and magnet schools are separate and distinct from program schools, simply because the program itself does not include community and magnet school options.  Post, at 1417 (Souter, J., dissenting); post, at 2 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  But none of the dissenting opinions explain how there is any perceptible difference between scholarship schools, community schools, or magnet schools from the perspective of Cleveland parents looking to choose the best educational option for their school-age children.  Parents who choose a program school in fact receive from the State precisely what parents who choose a community or magnet school receivethe opportunity to send their children largely at state expense to schools they prefer to their local public school.  See, e.g., App. 147a, 168a169a; App. in Nos. 00305, etc. (CA6), pp. 16351645 and 16571673 (Cleveland parents who enroll their children in schools other than local public schools typically explore all state-funded options before choosing an alternative school).

						 Justice Breyer would raise the invisible specters of divisiveness and religious strife to find the program unconstitutional.  Post, at 3, 913 (dissenting opinion).  It is unclear exactly what sort of principle Justice Breyer has in mind, considering that the program has ignited no divisiveness or strife other than this litigation.  Nor is it clear where Justice Breyer would locate this presumed authority to deprive Cleveland residents of a program that they have chosen but that we subjectively find divisive.  We quite rightly have rejected the claim that some speculative potential for divisiveness bears on the constitutionality of educational aid programs.

S., at 825 (plurality opinion) (The dissent resurrects the concern for political divisiveness that once occupied the Court but that post-Aguilar cases have rightly disregarded) (citing cases); id., at 825826 ( It is curious indeed to base our interpretation of the Constitution on speculation as to the likelihood of a phenomenon which the parties may create merely by prosecuting a lawsuit  (quoting  Aguilar v.

				The Court holds that Ohios Pilot Project Scholarship Program, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §§3313.9743313.979 (Anderson 1999 and Supp. 2000) (voucher program), survives respondents Establishment Clause challenge.  While I join the Courts opinion, I write separately for two reasons.  First, although the Court takes an important step, I do not believe that todays decision, when considered in light of other longstanding government programs that impact religious organizations and our prior Establishment Clause jurisprudence, marks a dramatic break from the past.  Second, given the emphasis the Court places on verifying that parents of voucher students in religious schools have exercised true private choice, I think it is worth elaborating on the Courts conclusion that this inquiry should consider all reasonable educational alternatives to religious schools that are available to parents.  To do otherwise is to ignore how the educational system in Cleveland actually functions.

        <p class="opcentered">

				These cases are different from prior indirect aid cases in part because a significant portion of the funds appropriated for the voucher program reach religious schools without restrictions on the use of these funds.  The share of public resources that reach religious schools is not, however, as significant as respondents suggest.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, Brief for Respondents Simmons-Harris et al. 12.  Data from the 19992000 school year indicate that 82 percent of schools participating in the voucher program were religious and that 96 percent of participating students enrolled in religious schools, see App. in Nos. 003055, etc. (CA6), p. 1679 (46 of 56 private schools in the program are
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				religiously-affiliated; 3,637 of 3,765 voucher students attend religious private schools), but these data are incomplete.  These statistics do not take into account all of the reasonable educational choices that may be available to students in Cleveland public schools.  When one considers the option to attend community schools, the percentage of students enrolled in religious schools falls to 62.1 percent.  If magnet schools are included in the mix, this percentage falls to 16.5 percent.  See J. Greene, The Racial, Economic, and Religious Context of Parental Choice in Cleveland 11, Table 4 (Oct. 8, 1999), App. 217a (reporting 2,087 students in community schools and 16,184 students in magnet schools).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Even these numbers do not paint a complete picture.  The Cleveland program provides voucher applicants from low-income families with up to $2,250 in tuition assistance and provides the remaining applicants with up to $1,875 in tuition assistance.  §§3313.976(A)(8), 3313.978(A) and (C)(1).  In contrast, the State provides community schools $4,518 per pupil and magnet schools, on average, $7,097 per pupil.  Affidavit of Caroline M. Hoxby ¶¶4b, 4c, App. 56a.  Even if one assumes that all voucher students came from low-income families and that each voucher student used up the entire $2,250 voucher, at most $8.2 million of public funds flowed to religious schools under the voucher program in 19992000.  Although just over one-half as many students attended community schools as religious private schools on the state fisc, the State spent over $1 million more$9.4 millionon students in community schools than on students in religious private schools because per-pupil aid to community schools is more than double the per-pupil aid to private schools under the voucher program.  Moreover, the amount spent on religious private schools is minor compared to the $114.8 million the State spent on students in the Cleveland magnet schools.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Although $8.2 million is no small sum, it pales in comparison to the amount of funds that federal, state, and local governments already provide religious institutions.  Religious organizations may qualify for exemptions from the federal corporate income tax, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/26/501.html#c_3" class="subref" title="subref">26 U. S. C. §501(c)(3)</a>; the corporate income tax in many States, see,

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/26/1402.html#a_8" class="subref" title="subref">26 U. S. C. §1402(a)(8)</a>.  In addition, the Federal Government provides individuals, corporations, trusts, and estates a tax deduction for charitable contributions to qualified religious groups.  See §§170, 642(c).  Finally, the Federal Government and certain state governments provide tax credits for educational expenses, many of which are spent on education at religious schools.  See, 
				<em>

The state property tax exemptions for religious institutions alone amount to very large sums annually.

As for the Federal Government, the tax deduction for charitable contributions reduces federal tax revenues by nearly $25 billion annually, see U. S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census, Statistical Abstract of the United States 344 (2000) (hereinafter Statistical Abstract), and it is reported that over 60 percent of household charitable contributions go to religious charities,

				A significant portion of the funds appropriated for these programs reach religiously affiliated institutions, typically without restrictions on its subsequent use.  For example, it has been reported that religious hospitals, which account for 18 percent of all hospital beds nationwide, rely on Medicare funds for 36 percent of their revenue.  MergerWatch, New Study Details Public Funding of Religious Hospitals (Jan. 2002), http://www.mergerwatch.org/
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				inthenews/publicfunding.html.  Moreover, taking into account both Medicare and Medicaid, religious hospitals received nearly $45 billion from the federal fisc in 1998.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  Federal aid to religious schools is also substantial.  Although data for all States is not available, data from Minnesota, for example, suggest that a substantial share of Pell Grant and other federal funds for college tuition reach religious schools.  Roughly one-third or $27.1 million of the federal tuition dollars spent on students at schools in Minnesota were used at private 4-year colleges.  Minnesota Higher Education Services Office, Financial Aid Awarded, Fiscal Year 1999: Grants, Loans, and Student Earning from Institution Jobs (Jan. 24, 2001).  The vast majority of these funds$23.5 millionflowed to religiously affiliated institutions.

				Nor does todays decision signal a major departure from this Courts prior Establishment Clause jurisprudence.  A central tool in our analysis of cases in this area has been the

Courts are instructed to consider two factors: first, whether the program administers aid in a neutral fashion, without differentiation based on the religious status of beneficiaries or providers of services; second, and more importantly, whether beneficiaries of indirect aid have a genuine choice among religious and nonreligious organizations when determining the organization to which they will direct that aid.  If the answer to either query is no, the program should be struck down under the Establishment Clause.  See

				I do not agree that the nonreligious schools have failed to provide Cleveland parents reasonable alternatives to religious schools in the voucher program.  For nonreligious schools to qualify as genuine options for parents, they need not be superior to religious schools in every respect.  They need only be adequate substitutes for religious schools in the eyes of parents.  The District Court record demonstrates that nonreligious schools were able to compete effectively with Catholic and other religious schools in the Cleveland voucher program.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1415, n. 4.  The best evidence of this is that many parents with vouchers selected nonreligious private schools over religious alternatives and an even larger number of parents send their children to community and magnet schools rather than seeking vouchers at all.

				<span class="smallcaps">

				 ignores evidence which suggests that, at a national level, nonreligious private schools may target a market for different, if not higher, quality of education.

				In my view the more significant finding in these cases is that Cleveland parents who use vouchers to send their children to religious private schools do so as a result of true private choice.  The Court rejects, correctly, the notion that the high percentage of voucher recipients who enroll in religious private schools necessarily demonstrates that parents do not actually have the option to send their children to nonreligious schools.  
				<em>
					Ante, 
				</em>
				at 1419.  Likewise, the mere fact that some parents enrolled their children in religious schools associated with a different faith than their own, see 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Souter, J

Declaration of David P. Zanotti ¶¶5, 10, App. 225a, 227a.  Finally, as demonstrated above, the Cleveland program does not establish financial incentives to undertake a religious education.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I find the Courts answer to the question whether parents of students eligible for vouchers have a genuine choice between religious and nonreligious schools persuasive.  In looking at the voucher program, all the choices available to potential beneficiaries of the government program should be considered.  In these cases, parents who were eligible to apply for a voucher also had the option, at a minimum, to send their children to community schools.  Yet the Court of Appeals chose not to look at community schools, let alone magnet schools, when evaluating the Cleveland voucher program.  See 234 F. 3d, at 958.  That decision was incorrect.  Focusing in these cases only on the program challenged by respondents ignores how the educational system in Cleveland actually functions.  The record indicates that, in 1999, two nonreligious private schools that had previously served 15 percent of the students in the voucher program were prompted to convert to community schools because parents were concerned about the litigation surrounding the program, and because a new community schools program provided more per-pupil financial aid.  Many of the students that enrolled in the two schools under the voucher program transferred to the community schools program and continued to attend these schools.  See Affidavit of David L. Brennan ¶¶3, 10, App. 145a, 147a; Declaration of David P. Zanotti ¶¶410, 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 225a227a.  This incident provides strong evidence that both parents and nonreligious schools view the voucher program and the community schools program as reasonable alternatives.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Considering all the educational options available to parents whose children are eligible for vouchers, including community and magnet schools, the Court finds that parents in the Cleveland schools have an array of nonreligious options.  
				<em>
					Ante,

				 at 1314.  Not surprisingly, respondents present no evidence that any students who were candidates for a voucher were denied slots in a community school or a magnet school.

See 
				<em>

But a community school need not offer primary school classes to be an alternative to religious middle schools, and catering to impoverished or otherwise challenged students may make a school more attractive to certain inner-city parents.  Moreover, the one community school that was

				Of the six community schools that 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter

				<em>
					after
				</em>
				 the District Courts grant of summary judgment to respondents, according to report cards prepared by the Ohio Department of Education.  See 
				<em>
					post, 
				</em>
				at 1819, n. 10 (dissenting opinion).  (One, Old Brooklyn Montessori School, performed better than public schools.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.; see also Ohio Department of Education, 2001 Community School Report Card, Old Brooklyn Montessori School 5 (community school scored higher than public schools in four of five subjects in 19992000).)  These report cards underestimate the value of the four Hope Academy schools.  Before they entered the community school program, two of them participated in the voucher program.  Although they received far less state funding in that capacity, they had among the highest rates of parental satisfaction of all voucher schools, religious or nonreligious.  See P. Peterson, W. Howell, &amp; J. Greene, An Evaluation of the Cleveland Voucher Program after Two Years 6, Table 4 (June 1999) (hereinafter Peterson).  This is particularly impressive given that a Harvard University study found that the Hope Academy schools attracted the poorest and most educationally disadvantaged students.  J. Greene, W. Howell, P. Peterson, Lessons from the Cleveland Scholarship Program 22, 24 (Oct. 15, 1997).  Moreover, 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				s evaluation of the Hope Academy schools assumes that the only relevant measure of school quality is academic performance.  It is reasonable to suppose, however, that parents in the inner city also choose schools that provide discipline and a safe environment for their children.  On these dimensions some of the schools that 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				 derides have performed quite ably.  See  Peterson, Table 7.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Ultimately, 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter 
				</span>
				relies on very narrow data to draw rather broad conclusions.  One year of poor test scores at four community schools targeted at the most challenged students from the inner city says little about the value of those schools, let alone the quality of the 6 other community schools and 24 magnet schools in Cleveland.  
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				s use of statistics confirms the Courts wisdom in refusing to consider them when assessing the Cleveland programs constitutionality.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 17.  What appears to motivate 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				s analysis is a desire for a limiting principle to rule out certain nonreligious schools as alternatives to religious schools in the voucher program.  See 
				<em>
					post, 
				</em>
				at 16, 1718, n. 9 (dissenting opinion).  But the goal of the Courts
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				Establishment Clause jurisprudence is to determine whether, after the Cleveland voucher program was enacted, parents were free to direct state educational aid in either a nonreligious or religious direction.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 14.  That inquiry requires an evaluation of all reasonable educational options Ohio provides the Cleveland school system, regardless of whether they are formally made available in the same section of the Ohio Code as the voucher program.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Based on the reasoning in the Courts opinion, which is consistent with the realities of the Cleveland educational system, I am persuaded that the Cleveland voucher program affords parents of eligible children genuine nonreligious options and is consistent with the Establishment Clause.

				The Court holds that Ohios Pilot Project Scholarship Program, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §§3313.9743313.979 (Anderson 1999 and Supp. 2000) (voucher program), survives respondents Establishment Clause challenge.  While I join the Courts opinion, I write separately for two reasons.  First, although the Court takes an important step, I do not believe that todays decision, when considered in light of other longstanding government programs that impact religious organizations and our prior Establishment Clause jurisprudence, marks a dramatic break from the past.  Second, given the emphasis the Court places on verifying that parents of voucher students in religious schools have exercised true private choice, I think it is worth elaborating on the Courts conclusion that this inquiry should consider all reasonable educational alternatives to religious schools that are available to parents.  To do otherwise is to ignore how the educational system in Cleveland actually functions.

				These cases are different from prior indirect aid cases in part because a significant portion of the funds appropriated for the voucher program reach religious schools without restrictions on the use of these funds.  The share of public resources that reach religious schools is not, however, as significant as respondents suggest.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, Brief for Respondents Simmons-Harris et al. 12.  Data from the 19992000 school year indicate that 82 percent of schools participating in the voucher program were religious and that 96 percent of participating students enrolled in religious schools, see App. in Nos. 003055, etc. (CA6), p. 1679 (46 of 56 private schools in the program are
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				religiously-affiliated; 3,637 of 3,765 voucher students attend religious private schools), but these data are incomplete.  These statistics do not take into account all of the reasonable educational choices that may be available to students in Cleveland public schools.  When one considers the option to attend community schools, the percentage of students enrolled in religious schools falls to 62.1 percent.  If magnet schools are included in the mix, this percentage falls to 16.5 percent.  See J. Greene, The Racial, Economic, and Religious Context of Parental Choice in Cleveland 11, Table 4 (Oct. 8, 1999), App. 217a (reporting 2,087 students in community schools and 16,184 students in magnet schools).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Even these numbers do not paint a complete picture.  The Cleveland program provides voucher applicants from low-income families with up to $2,250 in tuition assistance and provides the remaining applicants with up to $1,875 in tuition assistance.  §§3313.976(A)(8), 3313.978(A) and (C)(1).  In contrast, the State provides community schools $4,518 per pupil and magnet schools, on average, $7,097 per pupil.  Affidavit of Caroline M. Hoxby ¶¶4b, 4c, App. 56a.  Even if one assumes that all voucher students came from low-income families and that each voucher student used up the entire $2,250 voucher, at most $8.2 million of public funds flowed to religious schools under the voucher program in 19992000.  Although just over one-half as many students attended community schools as religious private schools on the state fisc, the State spent over $1 million more$9.4 millionon students in community schools than on students in religious private schools because per-pupil aid to community schools is more than double the per-pupil aid to private schools under the voucher program.  Moreover, the amount spent on religious private schools is minor compared to the $114.8 million the State spent on students in the Cleveland magnet schools.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Although $8.2 million is no small sum, it pales in comparison to the amount of funds that federal, state, and local governments already provide religious institutions.  Religious organizations may qualify for exemptions from the federal corporate income tax, see

In addition, the Federal Government provides individuals, corporations, trusts, and estates a tax deduction for charitable contributions to qualified religious groups.  See §§170, 642(c).  Finally, the Federal Government and certain state governments provide tax credits for educational expenses, many of which are spent on education at religious schools.  See,

				A significant portion of the funds appropriated for these programs reach religiously affiliated institutions, typically without restrictions on its subsequent use.  For example, it has been reported that religious hospitals, which account for 18 percent of all hospital beds nationwide, rely on Medicare funds for 36 percent of their revenue.

Although data for all States is not available, data from Minnesota, for example, suggest that a substantial share of Pell Grant and other federal funds for college tuition reach religious schools.  Roughly one-third or $27.1 million of the federal tuition dollars spent on students at schools in Minnesota were used at private 4-year colleges.  Minnesota Higher Education Services Office, Financial Aid Awarded, Fiscal Year 1999: Grants, Loans, and Student Earning from Institution Jobs (Jan. 24, 2001).  The vast majority of these funds$23.5 millionflowed to religiously affiliated institutions.

Courts are instructed to consider two factors: first, whether the program administers aid in a neutral fashion, without differentiation based on the religious status of beneficiaries or providers of services; second, and more importantly, whether beneficiaries of indirect aid have a genuine choice among religious and nonreligious organizations when determining the organization to which they will direct that aid.  If the answer to either query is no, the program should be struck down under the Establishment Clause.  See

				<span class="smallcaps">

				I do not agree that the nonreligious schools have failed to provide Cleveland parents reasonable alternatives to religious schools in the voucher program.  For nonreligious schools to qualify as genuine options for parents, they need not be superior to religious schools in every respect.  They need only be adequate substitutes for religious schools in the eyes of parents.  The District Court record demonstrates that nonreligious schools were able to compete effectively with Catholic and other religious schools in the Cleveland voucher program.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1415, n. 4.  The best evidence of this is that many parents with vouchers selected nonreligious private schools over religious alternatives and an even larger number of parents send their children to community and magnet schools rather than seeking vouchers at all.  
				<em>
					Supra
				</em>
				, at 2.  More-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				over, there is no record evidence that any voucher-eligible student was turned away from a nonreligious private school in the voucher program, let alone a community or magnet school.

				To support his hunch about the effect of the cap on tuition under the voucher program, 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter

				 cites national data to suggest that, on average, Catholic schools have a cost advantage over other types of schools.  See 
				<em>

				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				 ignores evidence which suggests that, at a national level, nonreligious private schools may target a market for different, if not higher, quality of education.  For example, nonreligious private schools are smaller, see U. S. Dept. of Ed., National Center for Education Statistics, Private Universe School Survey, 19971998, (Oct. 1999) (Table 60) (87 and 269 students per private nonreligious and Catholic elementary school, re-

				<em>
					ibid
				</em>
				. (9.4 and
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				18.8 students per teacher at private nonreligious and Catholic elementary schools, respectively); have more highly educated teachers, see U. S. Dept. of Ed., National Center for Education Statistics, Private Schools in the United States: A Statistical Profile, 19931994, (NCES 97459, July 1997) (Table 3.4) (37.9 percent of non-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>

				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				of Catholic school teachers have Masters degrees); and have principals with longer job tenure than Catholic schools, see

				. (Table 3.7) (average tenure of principals at private nonreligious and Catholic schools is 8.2 and 4.7 years, respectively).

				Additionally, 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter

				s theory that the Cleveland voucher programs cap on the tuition encourages low-income student to attend religious schools ignores that these students receive nearly double the amount of tuition assistance under the community schools program than under the voucher program and that none of the community schools is religious.

				In my view the more significant finding in these cases is that Cleveland parents who use vouchers to send their children to religious private schools do so as a result of true private choice.  The Court rejects, correctly, the notion that the high percentage of voucher recipients who enroll in religious private schools necessarily demonstrates that parents do not actually have the option to send their children to nonreligious schools.  
				<em>
					Ante, 
				</em>
				at 1419.  Likewise, the mere fact that some parents enrolled their children in religious schools associated with a different faith than their own, see 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Souter, J
				</span>
				., dissenting), at 2021, says little about whether these parents had reasonable nonreligious options.  Indeed, no voucher student has been known to be turned away from a nonreligious private school participating in the voucher program.  
				<em>

				, at 10.  This is impressive given evidence in the record that the present litigation has discouraged the entry of some nonreligious private schools into the voucher program.  Declaration of David P. Zanotti ¶¶5, 10, App. 225a, 227a.  Finally, as demonstrated above, the Cleveland program does not establish financial incentives to undertake a religious education.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I find the Courts answer to the question whether parents of students eligible for vouchers have a genuine choice between religious and nonreligious schools persuasive.  In looking at the voucher program, all the choices available to potential beneficiaries of the government program should be considered.  In these cases, parents who were eligible to apply for a voucher also had the option, at a minimum, to send their children to community schools.  Yet the Court of Appeals chose not to look at community schools, let alone magnet schools, when evaluating the Cleveland voucher program.  See 234 F. 3d, at 958.  That decision was incorrect.  Focusing in these cases only on the program challenged by respondents ignores how the educational system in Cleveland actually functions.  The record indicates that, in 1999, two nonreligious private schools that had previously served 15 percent of the students in the voucher program were prompted to convert to community schools because parents were concerned about the litigation surrounding the program, and because a new community schools program provided more per-pupil financial aid.  Many of the students that enrolled in the two schools under the voucher program transferred to the community schools program and continued to attend these schools.  See Affidavit of David L. Brennan ¶¶3, 10, App. 145a, 147a; Declaration of David P. Zanotti ¶¶410, 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 225a227a.  This incident provides strong evidence that both parents and nonreligious schools view the voucher program and the community schools program as reasonable alternatives.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Considering all the educational options available to parents whose children are eligible for vouchers, including community and magnet schools, the Court finds that parents in the Cleveland schools have an array of nonreligious options.  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 1314.  Not surprisingly, respondents present no evidence that any students who were candidates for a voucher were denied slots in a community school or a magnet school.  Indeed, the record suggests the opposite with respect to community schools.  See Affidavit of David L. Brennan ¶8, App. 147a.

				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter

				rejects the three other community schools (Horizon Science Academy, Cleveland Alternative Learning, and International Preparatory School) because they did not offer primary school classes, were targeted towards poor students or students with disciplinary or academic problems, or were not in operation for a year.  See 
				<em>
					post, 
				</em>
				at 1819, n. 10.  But a community school need not offer primary school classes to be an alternative to religious middle schools, and catering to impoverished or otherwise challenged students may make a school more attractive to certain inner-city parents.  Moreover, the one community school that was
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				closed in 19992000 was merely looking for a new loca-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				tion and was operational in other years.  See Affidavit of Steven M. Puckett ¶12, App. 162a; Ohio Department

				<span class="softbreak"></span>

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Of the six community schools that 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				 admits as alternatives to the voucher program in 19992000, he notes that four (the Broadway, Cathedral, Chapelside, and Lincoln Park campuses of the Hope Academy) reported lower test scores than public schools during the school year 
				<em>
					after
				</em>
				 the District Courts grant of summary judgment to respondents, according to report cards prepared by the Ohio Department of Education.  See 
				<em>
					post, 
				</em>
				at 1819, n. 10 (dissenting opinion).  (One, Old Brooklyn Montessori School, performed better than public schools.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.; see also Ohio Department of Education, 2001 Community School Report Card, Old Brooklyn Montessori School 5 (community school scored higher than public schools in four of five subjects in 19992000).)  These report cards underestimate the value of the four Hope Academy schools.  Before they entered the community school program, two of them participated in the voucher program.  Although they received far less state funding in that capacity, they had among the highest rates of parental satisfaction of all voucher schools, religious or nonreligious.  See P. Peterson, W. Howell, &amp; J. Greene, An Evaluation of the Cleveland Voucher Program after Two Years 6, Table 4 (June 1999) (hereinafter Peterson).  This is particularly impressive given that a Harvard University study found that the Hope Academy schools attracted the poorest and most educationally disadvantaged students.  J. Greene, W. Howell, P. Peterson, Lessons from the Cleveland Scholarship Program 22, 24 (Oct. 15, 1997).  Moreover, 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				s evaluation of the Hope Academy schools assumes that the only relevant measure of school quality is academic performance.  It is reasonable to suppose, however, that parents in the inner city also choose schools that provide discipline and a safe environment for their children.  On these dimensions some of the schools that 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				 derides have performed quite ably.  See  Peterson, Table 7.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Ultimately, 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter 
				</span>
				relies on very narrow data to draw rather broad conclusions.  One year of poor test scores at four community schools targeted at the most challenged students from the inner city says little about the value of those schools, let alone the quality of the 6 other community schools and 24 magnet schools in Cleveland.  
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				s use of statistics confirms the Courts wisdom in refusing to consider them when assessing the Cleveland programs constitutionality.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 17.  What appears to motivate 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				s analysis is a desire for a limiting principle to rule out certain nonreligious schools as alternatives to religious schools in the voucher program.  See 
				<em>
					post, 
				</em>
				at 16, 1718, n. 9 (dissenting opinion).  But the goal of the Courts
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				Establishment Clause jurisprudence is to determine whether, after the Cleveland voucher program was enacted, parents were free to direct state educational aid in either a nonreligious or religious direction.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 14.  That inquiry requires an evaluation of all reasonable educational options Ohio provides the Cleveland school system, regardless of whether they are formally made available in the same section of the Ohio Code as the voucher program.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Based on the reasoning in the Courts opinion, which is consistent with the realities of the Cleveland educational system, I am persuaded that the Cleveland voucher program affords parents of eligible children genuine nonreligious options and is consistent with the Establishment Clause.

While I join the Courts opinion, I write separately for two reasons.  First, although the Court takes an important step, I do not believe that todays decision, when considered in light of other longstanding government programs that impact religious organizations and our prior Establishment Clause jurisprudence, marks a dramatic break from the past.  Second, given the emphasis the Court places on verifying that parents of voucher students in religious schools have exercised true private choice, I think it is worth elaborating on the Courts conclusion that this inquiry should consider all reasonable educational alternatives to religious schools that are available to parents.  To do otherwise is to ignore how the educational system in Cleveland actually functions.

				These cases are different from prior indirect aid cases in part because a significant portion of the funds appropriated for the voucher program reach religious schools without restrictions on the use of these funds.  The share of public resources that reach religious schools is not, however, as significant as respondents suggest.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, Brief for Respondents Simmons-Harris et al. 12.  Data from the 19992000 school year indicate that 82 percent of schools participating in the voucher program were religious and that 96 percent of participating students enrolled in religious schools, see App. in Nos. 003055, etc. (CA6), p. 1679 (46 of 56 private schools in the program are
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				religiously-affiliated; 3,637 of 3,765 voucher students attend religious private schools), but these data are incomplete.  These statistics do not take into account all of the reasonable educational choices that may be available to students in Cleveland public schools.  When one considers the option to attend community schools, the percentage of students enrolled in religious schools falls to 62.1 percent.  If magnet schools are included in the mix, this percentage falls to 16.5 percent.  See J. Greene, The Racial, Economic, and Religious Context of Parental Choice in Cleveland 11, Table 4 (Oct. 8, 1999), App. 217a (reporting 2,087 students in community schools and 16,184 students in magnet schools).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Even these numbers do not paint a complete picture.  The Cleveland program provides voucher applicants from low-income families with up to $2,250 in tuition assistance and provides the remaining applicants with up to $1,875 in tuition assistance.  §§3313.976(A)(8), 3313.978(A) and (C)(1).  In contrast, the State provides community schools $4,518 per pupil and magnet schools, on average, $7,097 per pupil.  Affidavit of Caroline M. Hoxby ¶¶4b, 4c, App. 56a.  Even if one assumes that all voucher students came from low-income families and that each voucher student used up the entire $2,250 voucher, at most $8.2 million of public funds flowed to religious schools under the voucher program in 19992000.  Although just over one-half as many students attended community schools as religious private schools on the state fisc, the State spent over $1 million more$9.4 millionon students in community schools than on students in religious private schools because per-pupil aid to community schools is more than double the per-pupil aid to private schools under the voucher program.  Moreover, the amount spent on religious private schools is minor compared to the $114.8 million the State spent on students in the Cleveland magnet schools.

				Although $8.2 million is no small sum, it pales in comparison to the amount of funds that federal, state, and local governments already provide religious institutions.  Religious organizations may qualify for exemptions from the federal corporate income tax, see

In addition, the Federal Government provides individuals, corporations, trusts, and estates a tax deduction for charitable contributions to qualified religious groups.  See §§170, 642(c).  Finally, the Federal Government and certain state governments provide tax credits for educational expenses, many of which are spent on education at religious schools.  See,

				A significant portion of the funds appropriated for these programs reach religiously affiliated institutions, typically without restrictions on its subsequent use.  For example, it has been reported that religious hospitals, which account for 18 percent of all hospital beds nationwide, rely on Medicare funds for 36 percent of their revenue.  MergerWatch, New Study Details Public Funding of Religious Hospitals (Jan. 2002), http://www.mergerwatch.org/

				<em>

				.  Federal aid to religious schools is also substantial.  Although data for all States is not available, data from Minnesota, for example, suggest that a substantial share of Pell Grant and other federal funds for college tuition reach religious schools.  Roughly one-third or $27.1 million of the federal tuition dollars spent on students at schools in Minnesota were used at private 4-year colleges.  Minnesota Higher Education Services Office, Financial Aid Awarded, Fiscal Year 1999: Grants, Loans, and Student Earning from Institution Jobs (Jan. 24, 2001).  The vast majority of these funds$23.5 millionflowed to religiously affiliated institutions.

Courts are instructed to consider two factors: first, whether the program administers aid in a neutral fashion, without differentiation based on the religious status of beneficiaries or providers of services; second, and more importantly, whether beneficiaries of indirect aid have a genuine choice among religious and nonreligious organizations when determining the organization to which they will direct that aid.  If the answer to either query is no, the program should be struck down under the Establishment Clause.  See

				I do not agree that the nonreligious schools have failed to provide Cleveland parents reasonable alternatives to religious schools in the voucher program.  For nonreligious schools to qualify as genuine options for parents, they need not be superior to religious schools in every respect.  They need only be adequate substitutes for religious schools in the eyes of parents.  The District Court record demonstrates that nonreligious schools were able to compete effectively with Catholic and other religious schools in the Cleveland voucher program.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1415, n. 4.  The best evidence of this is that many parents with vouchers selected nonreligious private schools over religious alternatives and an even larger number of parents send their children to community and magnet schools rather than seeking vouchers at all.  
				<em>
					Supra
				</em>

				<span class="softbreak"></span>

				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				 ignores evidence which suggests that, at a national level, nonreligious private schools may target a market for different, if not higher, quality of education.  For example, nonreligious private schools are smaller, see U. S. Dept. of Ed., National Center for Education Statistics, Private Universe School Survey, 19971998, (Oct. 1999) (Table 60) (87 and 269 students per private nonreligious and Catholic elementary school, re-

				<em>
					ibid

				. (9.4 and
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				18.8 students per teacher at private nonreligious and Catholic elementary schools, respectively); have more highly educated teachers, see U. S. Dept. of Ed., National Center for Education Statistics, Private Schools in the United States: A Statistical Profile, 19931994, (NCES 97459, July 1997) (Table 3.4) (37.9 percent of non-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>

				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				of Catholic school teachers have Masters degrees); and have principals with longer job tenure than Catholic schools, see 
				<em>

				. (Table 3.7) (average tenure of principals at private nonreligious and Catholic schools is 8.2 and 4.7 years, respectively).

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Additionally, 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				s theory that the Cleveland voucher programs cap on the tuition encourages low-income student to attend religious schools ignores that these students receive nearly double the amount of tuition assistance under the community schools program than under the voucher program and that none of the community schools is religious.

				In my view the more significant finding in these cases is that Cleveland parents who use vouchers to send their children to religious private schools do so as a result of true private choice.  The Court rejects, correctly, the notion that the high percentage of voucher recipients who enroll in religious private schools necessarily demonstrates that parents do not actually have the option to send their children to nonreligious schools.  
				<em>
					Ante, 
				</em>
				at 1419.  Likewise, the mere fact that some parents enrolled their children in religious schools associated with a different faith than their own, see 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Souter, J

				I find the Courts answer to the question whether parents of students eligible for vouchers have a genuine choice between religious and nonreligious schools persuasive.  In looking at the voucher program, all the choices available to potential beneficiaries of the government program should be considered.  In these cases, parents who were eligible to apply for a voucher also had the option, at a minimum, to send their children to community schools.  Yet the Court of Appeals chose not to look at community schools, let alone magnet schools, when evaluating the Cleveland voucher program.  See 234 F. 3d, at 958.  That decision was incorrect.  Focusing in these cases only on the program challenged by respondents ignores how the educational system in Cleveland actually functions.  The record indicates that, in 1999, two nonreligious private schools that had previously served 15 percent of the students in the voucher program were prompted to convert to community schools because parents were concerned about the litigation surrounding the program, and because a new community schools program provided more per-pupil financial aid.  Many of the students that enrolled in the two schools under the voucher program transferred to the community schools program and continued to attend these schools.  See Affidavit of David L. Brennan ¶¶3, 10, App. 145a, 147a; Declaration of David P. Zanotti ¶¶410, 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 225a227a.  This incident provides strong evidence that both parents and nonreligious schools view the voucher program and the community schools program as reasonable alternatives.

				Considering all the educational options available to parents whose children are eligible for vouchers, including community and magnet schools, the Court finds that parents in the Cleveland schools have an array of nonreligious options.  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 1314.  Not surprisingly, respondents present no evidence that any students who were candidates for a voucher were denied slots in a community school or a magnet school.  Indeed, the record suggests the opposite with respect to community schools.  See Affidavit of David L. Brennan ¶8, App. 147a.

But a community school need not offer primary school classes to be an alternative to religious middle schools, and catering to impoverished or otherwise challenged students may make a school more attractive to certain inner-city parents.

				Of the six community schools that 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>

				<em>
					after
				</em>
				 the District Courts grant of summary judgment to respondents, according to report cards prepared by the Ohio Department of Education.  See 
				<em>
					post, 
				</em>
				at 1819, n. 10 (dissenting opinion).  (One, Old Brooklyn Montessori School, performed better than public schools.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.; see also Ohio Department of Education, 2001 Community School Report Card, Old Brooklyn Montessori School 5 (community school scored higher than public schools in four of five subjects in 19992000).)  These report cards underestimate the value of the four Hope Academy schools.  Before they entered the community school program, two of them participated in the voucher program.  Although they received far less state funding in that capacity, they had among the highest rates of parental satisfaction of all voucher schools, religious or nonreligious.  See P. Peterson, W. Howell, &amp; J. Greene, An Evaluation of the Cleveland Voucher Program after Two Years 6, Table 4 (June 1999) (hereinafter Peterson).  This is particularly impressive given that a Harvard University study found that the Hope Academy schools attracted the poorest and most educationally disadvantaged students.  J. Greene, W. Howell, P. Peterson, Lessons from the Cleveland Scholarship Program 22, 24 (Oct. 15, 1997).  Moreover, 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				s evaluation of the Hope Academy schools assumes that the only relevant measure of school quality is academic performance.  It is reasonable to suppose, however, that parents in the inner city also choose schools that provide discipline and a safe environment for their children.  On these dimensions some of the schools that 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				 derides have performed quite ably.  See  Peterson, Table 7.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Ultimately, 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter 
				</span>
				relies on very narrow data to draw rather broad conclusions.  One year of poor test scores at four community schools targeted at the most challenged students from the inner city says little about the value of those schools, let alone the quality of the 6 other community schools and 24 magnet schools in Cleveland.  
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				s use of statistics confirms the Courts wisdom in refusing to consider them when assessing the Cleveland programs constitutionality.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 17.  What appears to motivate 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				s analysis is a desire for a limiting principle to rule out certain nonreligious schools as alternatives to religious schools in the voucher program.  See 
				<em>
					post, 
				</em>
				at 16, 1718, n. 9 (dissenting opinion).  But the goal of the Courts
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				Establishment Clause jurisprudence is to determine whether, after the Cleveland voucher program was enacted, parents were free to direct state educational aid in either a nonreligious or religious direction.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 14.  That inquiry requires an evaluation of all reasonable educational options Ohio provides the Cleveland school system, regardless of whether they are formally made available in the same section of the Ohio Code as the voucher program.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Based on the reasoning in the Courts opinion, which is consistent with the realities of the Cleveland educational system, I am persuaded that the Cleveland voucher program affords parents of eligible children genuine nonreligious options and is consistent with the Establishment Clause.

				The Court holds that Ohios Pilot Project Scholarship Program, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §§3313.9743313.979 (Anderson 1999 and Supp. 2000) (voucher program), survives respondents Establishment Clause challenge.  While I join the Courts opinion, I write separately for two reasons.  First, although the Court takes an important step, I do not believe that todays decision, when considered in light of other longstanding government programs that impact religious organizations and our prior Establishment Clause jurisprudence, marks a dramatic break from the past.  Second, given the emphasis the Court places on verifying that parents of voucher students in religious schools have exercised true private choice, I think it is worth elaborating on the Courts conclusion that this inquiry should consider all reasonable educational alternatives to religious schools that are available to parents.  To do otherwise is to ignore how the educational system in Cleveland actually functions.

				These cases are different from prior indirect aid cases in part because a significant portion of the funds appropriated for the voucher program reach religious schools without restrictions on the use of these funds.  The share of public resources that reach religious schools is not, however, as significant as respondents suggest.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, Brief for Respondents Simmons-Harris et al. 12.  Data from the 19992000 school year indicate that 82 percent of schools participating in the voucher program were religious and that 96 percent of participating students enrolled in religious schools, see App. in Nos. 003055, etc. (CA6), p. 1679 (46 of 56 private schools in the program are
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				religiously-affiliated; 3,637 of 3,765 voucher students attend religious private schools), but these data are incomplete.  These statistics do not take into account all of the reasonable educational choices that may be available to students in Cleveland public schools.  When one considers the option to attend community schools, the percentage of students enrolled in religious schools falls to 62.1 percent.  If magnet schools are included in the mix, this percentage falls to 16.5 percent.  See J. Greene, The Racial, Economic, and Religious Context of Parental Choice in Cleveland 11, Table 4 (Oct. 8, 1999), App. 217a (reporting 2,087 students in community schools and 16,184 students in magnet schools).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Even these numbers do not paint a complete picture.  The Cleveland program provides voucher applicants from low-income families with up to $2,250 in tuition assistance and provides the remaining applicants with up to $1,875 in tuition assistance.  §§3313.976(A)(8), 3313.978(A) and (C)(1).  In contrast, the State provides community schools $4,518 per pupil and magnet schools, on average, $7,097 per pupil.  Affidavit of Caroline M. Hoxby ¶¶4b, 4c, App. 56a.  Even if one assumes that all voucher students came from low-income families and that each voucher student used up the entire $2,250 voucher, at most $8.2 million of public funds flowed to religious schools under the voucher program in 19992000.  Although just over one-half as many students attended community schools as religious private schools on the state fisc, the State spent over $1 million more$9.4 millionon students in community schools than on students in religious private schools because per-pupil aid to community schools is more than double the per-pupil aid to private schools under the voucher program.  Moreover, the amount spent on religious private schools is minor compared to the $114.8 million the State spent on students in the Cleveland magnet schools.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Although $8.2 million is no small sum, it pales in comparison to the amount of funds that federal, state, and local governments already provide religious institutions.  Religious organizations may qualify for exemptions from the federal corporate income tax, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/26/501.html#c_3" class="subref" title="subref">26 U. S. C. §501(c)(3)</a>; the corporate income tax in many States, see,

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/26/1402.html#a_8" class="subref" title="subref">26 U. S. C. §1402(a)(8)</a>.  In addition, the Federal Government provides individuals, corporations, trusts, and estates a tax deduction for charitable contributions to qualified religious groups.  See §§170, 642(c).  Finally, the Federal Government and certain state governments provide tax credits for educational expenses, many of which are spent on education at religious schools.  See, 
				<em>

As for the Federal Government, the tax deduction for charitable contributions reduces federal tax revenues by nearly $25 billion annually, see U. S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census, Statistical Abstract of the United States 344 (2000) (hereinafter Statistical Abstract), and it is reported that over 60 percent of household charitable contributions go to religious charities,

				A significant portion of the funds appropriated for these programs reach religiously affiliated institutions, typically without restrictions on its subsequent use.  For example, it has been reported that religious hospitals, which account for 18 percent of all hospital beds nationwide, rely on Medicare funds for 36 percent of their revenue.  MergerWatch, New Study Details Public Funding of Religious Hospitals (Jan. 2002), http://www.mergerwatch.org/
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				inthenews/publicfunding.html.  Moreover, taking into account both Medicare and Medicaid, religious hospitals received nearly $45 billion from the federal fisc in 1998.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  Federal aid to religious schools is also substantial.  Although data for all States is not available, data from Minnesota, for example, suggest that a substantial share of Pell Grant and other federal funds for college tuition reach religious schools.  Roughly one-third or $27.1 million of the federal tuition dollars spent on students at schools in Minnesota were used at private 4-year colleges.  Minnesota Higher Education Services Office, Financial Aid Awarded, Fiscal Year 1999: Grants, Loans, and Student Earning from Institution Jobs (Jan. 24, 2001).  The vast majority of these funds$23.5 millionflowed to religiously affiliated institutions.

Courts are instructed to consider two factors: first, whether the program administers aid in a neutral fashion, without differentiation based on the religious status of beneficiaries or providers of services; second, and more importantly, whether beneficiaries of indirect aid have a genuine choice among religious and nonreligious organizations when determining the organization to which they will direct that aid.  If the answer to either query is no, the program should be struck down under the Establishment Clause.  See

				I do not agree that the nonreligious schools have failed to provide Cleveland parents reasonable alternatives to religious schools in the voucher program.  For nonreligious schools to qualify as genuine options for parents, they need not be superior to religious schools in every respect.  They need only be adequate substitutes for religious schools in the eyes of parents.  The District Court record demonstrates that nonreligious schools were able to compete effectively with Catholic and other religious schools in the Cleveland voucher program.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1415, n. 4.  The best evidence of this is that many parents with vouchers selected nonreligious private schools over religious alternatives and an even larger number of parents send their children to community and magnet schools rather than seeking vouchers at all.

				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter

				 ignores evidence which suggests that, at a national level, nonreligious private schools may target a market for different, if not higher, quality of education.  For example, nonreligious private schools are smaller, see U. S.

				Additionally,

				In my view the more significant finding in these cases is that Cleveland parents who use vouchers to send their children to religious private schools do so as a result of true private choice.  The Court rejects, correctly, the notion that the high percentage of voucher recipients who enroll in religious private schools necessarily demonstrates that parents do not actually have the option to send their children to nonreligious schools.  
				<em>
					Ante, 
				</em>
				at 1419.  Likewise, the mere fact that some parents enrolled their children in religious schools associated with a different faith than their own, see 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Souter, J
				</span>

				, at 10.  This is impressive given evidence in the record that the present litigation has discouraged the entry of some nonreligious private schools into the voucher program.  Declaration of David P. Zanotti ¶¶5, 10, App. 225a, 227a.  Finally, as demonstrated above, the Cleveland program does not establish financial incentives to undertake a religious education.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I find the Courts answer to the question whether parents of students eligible for vouchers have a genuine choice between religious and nonreligious schools persuasive.  In looking at the voucher program, all the choices available to potential beneficiaries of the government program should be considered.  In these cases, parents who were eligible to apply for a voucher also had the option, at a minimum, to send their children to community schools.  Yet the Court of Appeals chose not to look at community schools, let alone magnet schools, when evaluating the Cleveland voucher program.  See 234 F. 3d, at 958.  That decision was incorrect.  Focusing in these cases only on the program challenged by respondents ignores how the educational system in Cleveland actually functions.  The record indicates that, in 1999, two nonreligious private schools that had previously served 15 percent of the students in the voucher program were prompted to convert to community schools because parents were concerned about the litigation surrounding the program, and because a new community schools program provided more per-pupil financial aid.  Many of the students that enrolled in the two schools under the voucher program transferred to the community schools program and continued to attend these schools.  See Affidavit of David L. Brennan ¶¶3, 10, App. 145a, 147a; Declaration of David P. Zanotti ¶¶410, 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 225a227a.  This incident provides strong evidence that both parents and nonreligious schools view the voucher program and the community schools program as reasonable alternatives.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Considering all the educational options available to parents whose children are eligible for vouchers, including community and magnet schools, the Court finds that parents in the Cleveland schools have an array of nonreligious options.  
				<em>
					Ante,

				 at 1314.  Not surprisingly, respondents present no evidence that any students who were candidates for a voucher were denied slots in a community school or a magnet school.

See 
				<em>

				at 1819, n. 10.  But a community school need not offer primary school classes to be an alternative to religious middle schools, and catering to impoverished or otherwise challenged students may make a school more attractive to certain inner-city parents.  Moreover, the one community school that was
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				closed in 19992000 was merely looking for a new loca-

				Of the six community schools that 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>

				<em>
					after
				</em>
				 the District Courts grant of summary judgment to respondents, according to report cards prepared by the Ohio Department of Education.  See 
				<em>
					post, 
				</em>
				at 1819, n. 10 (dissenting opinion).  (One, Old Brooklyn Montessori School, performed better than public schools.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.; see also Ohio Department of Education, 2001 Community School Report Card, Old Brooklyn Montessori School 5 (community school scored higher than public schools in four of five subjects in 19992000).)  These report cards underestimate the value of the four Hope Academy schools.  Before they entered the community school program, two of them participated in the voucher program.  Although they received far less state funding in that capacity, they had among the highest rates of parental satisfaction of all voucher schools, religious or nonreligious.  See P. Peterson, W. Howell, &amp; J. Greene, An Evaluation of the Cleveland Voucher Program after Two Years 6, Table 4 (June 1999) (hereinafter Peterson).  This is particularly impressive given that a Harvard University study found that the Hope Academy schools attracted the poorest and most educationally disadvantaged students.  J. Greene, W. Howell, P. Peterson, Lessons from the Cleveland Scholarship Program 22, 24 (Oct. 15, 1997).  Moreover, 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				s evaluation of the Hope Academy schools assumes that the only relevant measure of school quality is academic performance.  It is reasonable to suppose, however, that parents in the inner city also choose schools that provide discipline and a safe environment for their children.  On these dimensions some of the schools that 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				 derides have performed quite ably.  See  Peterson, Table 7.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Ultimately, 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter 
				</span>
				relies on very narrow data to draw rather broad conclusions.  One year of poor test scores at four community schools targeted at the most challenged students from the inner city says little about the value of those schools, let alone the quality of the 6 other community schools and 24 magnet schools in Cleveland.  
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				s use of statistics confirms the Courts wisdom in refusing to consider them when assessing the Cleveland programs constitutionality.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 17.  What appears to motivate 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				s analysis is a desire for a limiting principle to rule out certain nonreligious schools as alternatives to religious schools in the voucher program.  See 
				<em>
					post, 
				</em>
				at 16, 1718, n. 9 (dissenting opinion).  But the goal of the Courts
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				Establishment Clause jurisprudence is to determine whether, after the Cleveland voucher program was enacted, parents were free to direct state educational aid in either a nonreligious or religious direction.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 14.  That inquiry requires an evaluation of all reasonable educational options Ohio provides the Cleveland school system, regardless of whether they are formally made available in the same section of the Ohio Code as the voucher program.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Based on the reasoning in the Courts opinion, which is consistent with the realities of the Cleveland educational system, I am persuaded that the Cleveland voucher program affords parents of eligible children genuine nonreligious options and is consistent with the Establishment Clause.

				The Court holds that Ohios Pilot Project Scholarship Program, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §§3313.9743313.979 (Anderson 1999 and Supp. 2000) (voucher program), survives respondents Establishment Clause challenge.  While I join the Courts opinion, I write separately for two reasons.  First, although the Court takes an important step, I do not believe that todays decision, when considered in light of other longstanding government programs that impact religious organizations and our prior Establishment Clause jurisprudence, marks a dramatic break from the past.  Second, given the emphasis the Court places on verifying that parents of voucher students in religious schools have exercised true private choice, I think it is worth elaborating on the Courts conclusion that this inquiry should consider all reasonable educational alternatives to religious schools that are available to parents.  To do otherwise is to ignore how the educational system in Cleveland actually functions.

				These cases are different from prior indirect aid cases in part because a significant portion of the funds appropriated for the voucher program reach religious schools without restrictions on the use of these funds.  The share of public resources that reach religious schools is not, however, as significant as respondents suggest.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, Brief for Respondents Simmons-Harris et al. 12.  Data from the 19992000 school year indicate that 82 percent of schools participating in the voucher program were religious and that 96 percent of participating students enrolled in religious schools, see App. in Nos. 003055, etc. (CA6), p. 1679 (46 of 56 private schools in the program are
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				religiously-affiliated; 3,637 of 3,765 voucher students attend religious private schools), but these data are incomplete.  These statistics do not take into account all of the reasonable educational choices that may be available to students in Cleveland public schools.  When one considers the option to attend community schools, the percentage of students enrolled in religious schools falls to 62.1 percent.  If magnet schools are included in the mix, this percentage falls to 16.5 percent.  See J. Greene, The Racial, Economic, and Religious Context of Parental Choice in Cleveland 11, Table 4 (Oct. 8, 1999), App. 217a (reporting 2,087 students in community schools and 16,184 students in magnet schools).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Even these numbers do not paint a complete picture.  The Cleveland program provides voucher applicants from low-income families with up to $2,250 in tuition assistance and provides the remaining applicants with up to $1,875 in tuition assistance.  §§3313.976(A)(8), 3313.978(A) and (C)(1).  In contrast, the State provides community schools $4,518 per pupil and magnet schools, on average, $7,097 per pupil.  Affidavit of Caroline M. Hoxby ¶¶4b, 4c, App. 56a.  Even if one assumes that all voucher students came from low-income families and that each voucher student used up the entire $2,250 voucher, at most $8.2 million of public funds flowed to religious schools under the voucher program in 19992000.  Although just over one-half as many students attended community schools as religious private schools on the state fisc, the State spent over $1 million more$9.4 millionon students in community schools than on students in religious private schools because per-pupil aid to community schools is more than double the per-pupil aid to private schools under the voucher program.  Moreover, the amount spent on religious private schools is minor compared to the $114.8 million the State spent on students in the Cleveland magnet schools.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Although $8.2 million is no small sum, it pales in comparison to the amount of funds that federal, state, and local governments already provide religious institutions.  Religious organizations may qualify for exemptions from the federal corporate income tax, see

In addition, the Federal Government provides individuals, corporations, trusts, and estates a tax deduction for charitable contributions to qualified religious groups.  See §§170, 642(c).  Finally, the Federal Government and certain state governments provide tax credits for educational expenses, many of which are spent on education at religious schools.  See,

				A significant portion of the funds appropriated for these programs reach religiously affiliated institutions, typically without restrictions on its subsequent use.  For example, it has been reported that religious hospitals, which account for 18 percent of all hospital beds nationwide, rely on Medicare funds for 36 percent of their revenue.

				.  Federal aid to religious schools is also substantial.  Although data for all States is not available, data from Minnesota, for example, suggest that a substantial share of Pell Grant and other federal funds for college tuition reach religious schools.  Roughly one-third or $27.1 million of the federal tuition dollars spent on students at schools in Minnesota were used at private 4-year colleges.  Minnesota Higher Education Services Office, Financial Aid Awarded, Fiscal Year 1999: Grants, Loans, and Student Earning from Institution Jobs (Jan. 24, 2001).

Courts are instructed to consider two factors: first, whether the program administers aid in a neutral fashion, without differentiation based on the religious status of beneficiaries or providers of services; second, and more importantly, whether beneficiaries of indirect aid have a genuine choice among religious and nonreligious organizations when determining the organization to which they will direct that aid.  If the answer to either query is no, the program should be struck down under the Establishment Clause.  See

				I do not agree that the nonreligious schools have failed to provide Cleveland parents reasonable alternatives to religious schools in the voucher program.  For nonreligious schools to qualify as genuine options for parents, they need not be superior to religious schools in every respect.  They need only be adequate substitutes for religious schools in the eyes of parents.  The District Court record demonstrates that nonreligious schools were able to compete effectively with Catholic and other religious schools in the Cleveland voucher program.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1415, n. 4.  The best evidence of this is that many parents with vouchers selected nonreligious private schools over religious alternatives and an even larger number of parents send their children to community and magnet schools rather than seeking vouchers at all.  
				<em>
					Supra
				</em>
				, at 2.  More-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				over, there is no record evidence that any voucher-eligible student was turned away from a nonreligious private school in the voucher program, let alone a community or magnet school.

				To support his hunch about the effect of the cap on tuition under the voucher program,

				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				 ignores evidence which suggests that, at a national level, nonreligious private schools may target a market for different, if not higher, quality of education.  For example, nonreligious private schools are smaller, see U. S. Dept. of Ed., National Center for Education Statistics, Private Universe School Survey, 19971998, (Oct. 1999) (Table 60) (87 and 269 students per private nonreligious and Catholic elementary school, re-

				spectively); have smaller class sizes, see 
				<em>
					ibid
				</em>
				. (9.4 and
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				18.8 students per teacher at private nonreligious and Catholic elementary schools, respectively); have more highly educated teachers, see U. S. Dept. of Ed., National Center for Education Statistics, Private Schools in the United States: A Statistical Profile, 19931994, (NCES 97459, July 1997) (Table 3.4) (37.9 percent of non-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>

				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				of Catholic school teachers have Masters degrees); and have principals with longer job tenure than Catholic schools, see 
				<em>

				Additionally, 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				s theory that the Cleveland voucher programs cap on the tuition encourages low-income student to attend religious schools ignores that these students receive nearly double the amount of tuition assistance under the community schools program than under the voucher program and that none of the community schools is religious.

				In my view the more significant finding in these cases is that Cleveland parents who use vouchers to send their children to religious private schools do so as a result of true private choice.  The Court rejects, correctly, the notion that the high percentage of voucher recipients who enroll in religious private schools necessarily demonstrates that parents do not actually have the option to send their children to nonreligious schools.  
				<em>
					Ante, 
				</em>
				at 1419.  Likewise, the mere fact that some parents enrolled their children in religious schools associated with a different faith than their own, see 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Souter, J
				</span>
				., dissenting), at 2021, says little about whether these parents had reasonable nonreligious options.  Indeed, no voucher student has been known to be turned away from a nonreligious private school participating in the voucher program.  
				<em>

				, at 10.  This is impressive given evidence in the record that the present litigation has discouraged the entry of some nonreligious private schools into the voucher program.  Declaration of David P. Zanotti ¶¶5, 10, App. 225a, 227a.  Finally, as demonstrated above, the Cleveland program does not establish financial incentives to undertake a religious education.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I find the Courts answer to the question whether parents of students eligible for vouchers have a genuine choice between religious and nonreligious schools persuasive.  In looking at the voucher program, all the choices available to potential beneficiaries of the government program should be considered.  In these cases, parents who were eligible to apply for a voucher also had the option, at a minimum, to send their children to community schools.  Yet the Court of Appeals chose not to look at community schools, let alone magnet schools, when evaluating the Cleveland voucher program.  See 234 F. 3d, at 958.  That decision was incorrect.  Focusing in these cases only on the program challenged by respondents ignores how the educational system in Cleveland actually functions.  The record indicates that, in 1999, two nonreligious private schools that had previously served 15 percent of the students in the voucher program were prompted to convert to community schools because parents were concerned about the litigation surrounding the program, and because a new community schools program provided more per-pupil financial aid.  Many of the students that enrolled in the two schools under the voucher program transferred to the community schools program and continued to attend these schools.  See Affidavit of David L. Brennan ¶¶3, 10, App. 145a, 147a; Declaration of David P. Zanotti ¶¶410, 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 225a227a.  This incident provides strong evidence that both parents and nonreligious schools view the voucher program and the community schools program as reasonable alternatives.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Considering all the educational options available to parents whose children are eligible for vouchers, including community and magnet schools, the Court finds that parents in the Cleveland schools have an array of nonreligious options.  
				<em>
					Ante,

				 at 1314.  Not surprisingly, respondents present no evidence that any students who were candidates for a voucher were denied slots in a community school or a magnet school.

See 
				<em>

But a community school need not offer primary school classes to be an alternative to religious middle schools, and catering to impoverished or otherwise challenged students may make a school more attractive to certain inner-city parents.  Moreover, the one community school that was

				.; see also Ohio Department of Education, 2001 Community School Report Card, Old Brooklyn Montessori School 5 (community school scored higher than public schools in four of five subjects in 19992000).)  These report cards underestimate the value of the four Hope Academy schools.  Before they entered the community school program, two of them participated in the voucher program.  Although they received far less state funding in that capacity, they had among the highest rates of parental satisfaction of all voucher schools, religious or nonreligious.  See P. Peterson, W. Howell, &amp; J. Greene, An Evaluation of the Cleveland Voucher Program after Two Years 6, Table 4 (June 1999) (hereinafter Peterson).  This is particularly impressive given that a Harvard University study found that the Hope Academy schools attracted the poorest and most educationally disadvantaged students.  J. Greene, W. Howell, P. Peterson, Lessons from the Cleveland Scholarship Program 22, 24 (Oct. 15, 1997).  Moreover, 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				s evaluation of the Hope Academy schools assumes that the only relevant measure of school quality is academic performance.  It is reasonable to suppose, however, that parents in the inner city also choose schools that provide discipline and a safe environment for their children.  On these dimensions some of the schools that 
				<span class="smallcaps">

				Ultimately, 
				<span class="smallcaps">

				relies on very narrow data to draw rather broad conclusions.  One year of poor test scores at four community schools targeted at the most challenged students from the inner city says little about the value of those schools, let alone the quality of the 6 other community schools and 24 magnet schools in Cleveland.

				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				s analysis is a desire for a limiting principle to rule out certain nonreligious schools as alternatives to religious schools in the voucher program.  See 
				<em>
					post, 
				</em>
				at 16, 1718, n. 9 (dissenting opinion).  But the goal of the Courts
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				Establishment Clause jurisprudence is to determine whether, after the Cleveland voucher program was enacted, parents were free to direct state educational aid in either a nonreligious or religious direction.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 14.  That inquiry requires an evaluation of all reasonable educational options Ohio provides the Cleveland school system, regardless of whether they are formally made available in the same section of the Ohio Code as the voucher program.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Based on the reasoning in the Courts opinion, which is consistent with the realities of the Cleveland educational system, I am persuaded that the Cleveland voucher program affords parents of eligible children genuine nonreligious options and is consistent with the Establishment Clause.

				The Court holds that Ohios Pilot Project Scholarship Program, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §§3313.9743313.979 (Anderson 1999 and Supp. 2000) (voucher program), survives respondents Establishment Clause challenge.  While I join the Courts opinion, I write separately for two reasons.  First, although the Court takes an important step, I do not believe that todays decision, when considered in light of other longstanding government programs that impact religious organizations and our prior Establishment Clause jurisprudence, marks a dramatic break from the past.  Second, given the emphasis the Court places on verifying that parents of voucher students in religious schools have exercised true private choice, I think it is worth elaborating on the Courts conclusion that this inquiry should consider all reasonable educational alternatives to religious schools that are available to parents.  To do otherwise is to ignore how the educational system in Cleveland actually functions.

				These cases are different from prior indirect aid cases in part because a significant portion of the funds appropriated for the voucher program reach religious schools without restrictions on the use of these funds.  The share of public resources that reach religious schools is not, however, as significant as respondents suggest.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, Brief for Respondents Simmons-Harris et al. 12.  Data from the 19992000 school year indicate that 82 percent of schools participating in the voucher program were religious and that 96 percent of participating students enrolled in religious schools, see App. in Nos. 003055, etc. (CA6), p. 1679 (46 of 56 private schools in the program are
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				religiously-affiliated; 3,637 of 3,765 voucher students attend religious private schools), but these data are incomplete.  These statistics do not take into account all of the reasonable educational choices that may be available to students in Cleveland public schools.  When one considers the option to attend community schools, the percentage of students enrolled in religious schools falls to 62.1 percent.  If magnet schools are included in the mix, this percentage falls to 16.5 percent.  See J. Greene, The Racial, Economic, and Religious Context of Parental Choice in Cleveland 11, Table 4 (Oct. 8, 1999), App. 217a (reporting 2,087 students in community schools and 16,184 students in magnet schools).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Even these numbers do not paint a complete picture.  The Cleveland program provides voucher applicants from low-income families with up to $2,250 in tuition assistance and provides the remaining applicants with up to $1,875 in tuition assistance.  §§3313.976(A)(8), 3313.978(A) and (C)(1).  In contrast, the State provides community schools $4,518 per pupil and magnet schools, on average, $7,097 per pupil.  Affidavit of Caroline M. Hoxby ¶¶4b, 4c, App. 56a.  Even if one assumes that all voucher students came from low-income families and that each voucher student used up the entire $2,250 voucher, at most $8.2 million of public funds flowed to religious schools under the voucher program in 19992000.  Although just over one-half as many students attended community schools as religious private schools on the state fisc, the State spent over $1 million more$9.4 millionon students in community schools than on students in religious private schools because per-pupil aid to community schools is more than double the per-pupil aid to private schools under the voucher program.  Moreover, the amount spent on religious private schools is minor compared to the $114.8 million the State spent on students in the Cleveland magnet schools.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Although $8.2 million is no small sum, it pales in comparison to the amount of funds that federal, state, and local governments already provide religious institutions.  Religious organizations may qualify for exemptions from the federal corporate income tax, see

In addition, the Federal Government provides individuals, corporations, trusts, and estates a tax deduction for charitable contributions to qualified religious groups.  See §§170, 642(c).  Finally, the Federal Government and certain state governments provide tax credits for educational expenses, many of which are spent on education at religious schools.  See,

As for the Federal Government, the tax deduction for charitable contributions reduces federal tax revenues by nearly $25 billion annually, see U. S.

				A significant portion of the funds appropriated for these programs reach religiously affiliated institutions, typically without restrictions on its subsequent use.  For example, it has been reported that religious hospitals, which account for 18 percent of all hospital beds nationwide, rely on Medicare funds for 36 percent of their revenue.  MergerWatch, New Study Details Public Funding of Religious Hospitals (Jan. 2002), http://www.mergerwatch.org/
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				inthenews/publicfunding.html.  Moreover, taking into account both Medicare and Medicaid, religious hospitals received nearly $45 billion from the federal fisc in 1998.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  Federal aid to religious schools is also substantial.  Although data for all States is not available, data from Minnesota, for example, suggest that a substantial share of Pell Grant and other federal funds for college tuition reach religious schools.  Roughly one-third or $27.1 million of the federal tuition dollars spent on students at schools in Minnesota were used at private 4-year colleges.  Minnesota Higher Education Services Office, Financial Aid Awarded, Fiscal Year 1999: Grants, Loans, and Student Earning from Institution Jobs (Jan. 24, 2001).  The vast majority of these funds$23.5 millionflowed to religiously affiliated institutions.

Courts are instructed to consider two factors: first, whether the program administers aid in a neutral fashion, without differentiation based on the religious status of beneficiaries or providers of services; second, and more importantly, whether beneficiaries of indirect aid have a genuine choice among religious and nonreligious organizations when determining the organization to which they will direct that aid.  If the answer to either query is no, the program should be struck down under the Establishment Clause.  See

				I do not agree that the nonreligious schools have failed to provide Cleveland parents reasonable alternatives to religious schools in the voucher program.  For nonreligious schools to qualify as genuine options for parents, they need not be superior to religious schools in every respect.  They need only be adequate substitutes for religious schools in the eyes of parents.  The District Court record demonstrates that nonreligious schools were able to compete effectively with Catholic and other religious schools in the Cleveland voucher program.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1415, n. 4.  The best evidence of this is that many parents with vouchers selected nonreligious private schools over religious alternatives and an even larger number of parents send their children to community and magnet schools rather than seeking vouchers at all.

				<span class="smallcaps">

				 ignores evidence which suggests that, at a national level, nonreligious private schools may target a market for different, if not higher, quality of education.  For example, nonreligious private schools are smaller, see U. S.

				In my view the more significant finding in these cases is that Cleveland parents who use vouchers to send their children to religious private schools do so as a result of true private choice.  The Court rejects, correctly, the notion that the high percentage of voucher recipients who enroll in religious private schools necessarily demonstrates that parents do not actually have the option to send their children to nonreligious schools.  
				<em>
					Ante, 
				</em>
				at 1419.  Likewise, the mere fact that some parents enrolled their children in religious schools associated with a different faith than their own, see 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Souter, J

Declaration of David P. Zanotti ¶¶5, 10, App. 225a, 227a.  Finally, as demonstrated above, the Cleveland program does not establish financial incentives to undertake a religious education.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I find the Courts answer to the question whether parents of students eligible for vouchers have a genuine choice between religious and nonreligious schools persuasive.  In looking at the voucher program, all the choices available to potential beneficiaries of the government program should be considered.  In these cases, parents who were eligible to apply for a voucher also had the option, at a minimum, to send their children to community schools.  Yet the Court of Appeals chose not to look at community schools, let alone magnet schools, when evaluating the Cleveland voucher program.  See 234 F. 3d, at 958.  That decision was incorrect.  Focusing in these cases only on the program challenged by respondents ignores how the educational system in Cleveland actually functions.  The record indicates that, in 1999, two nonreligious private schools that had previously served 15 percent of the students in the voucher program were prompted to convert to community schools because parents were concerned about the litigation surrounding the program, and because a new community schools program provided more per-pupil financial aid.  Many of the students that enrolled in the two schools under the voucher program transferred to the community schools program and continued to attend these schools.  See Affidavit of David L. Brennan ¶¶3, 10, App. 145a, 147a; Declaration of David P. Zanotti ¶¶410, 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 225a227a.  This incident provides strong evidence that both parents and nonreligious schools view the voucher program and the community schools program as reasonable alternatives.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Considering all the educational options available to parents whose children are eligible for vouchers, including community and magnet schools, the Court finds that parents in the Cleveland schools have an array of nonreligious options.  
				<em>
					Ante,

				 at 1314.  Not surprisingly, respondents present no evidence that any students who were candidates for a voucher were denied slots in a community school or a magnet school.

See 
				<em>

But a community school need not offer primary school classes to be an alternative to religious middle schools, and catering to impoverished or otherwise challenged students may make a school more attractive to certain inner-city parents.  Moreover, the one community school that was

				Of the six community schools that 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>

				<em>
					after
				</em>
				 the District Courts grant of summary judgment to respondents, according to report cards prepared by the Ohio Department of Education.  See 
				<em>
					post, 
				</em>
				at 1819, n. 10 (dissenting opinion).  (One, Old Brooklyn Montessori School, performed better than public schools.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.; see also Ohio Department of Education, 2001 Community School Report Card, Old Brooklyn Montessori School 5 (community school scored higher than public schools in four of five subjects in 19992000).)  These report cards underestimate the value of the four Hope Academy schools.  Before they entered the community school program, two of them participated in the voucher program.  Although they received far less state funding in that capacity, they had among the highest rates of parental satisfaction of all voucher schools, religious or nonreligious.  See P. Peterson, W. Howell, &amp; J. Greene, An Evaluation of the Cleveland Voucher Program after Two Years 6, Table 4 (June 1999) (hereinafter Peterson).  This is particularly impressive given that a Harvard University study found that the Hope Academy schools attracted the poorest and most educationally disadvantaged students.  J. Greene, W. Howell, P. Peterson, Lessons from the Cleveland Scholarship Program 22, 24 (Oct. 15, 1997).  Moreover, 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				s evaluation of the Hope Academy schools assumes that the only relevant measure of school quality is academic performance.  It is reasonable to suppose, however, that parents in the inner city also choose schools that provide discipline and a safe environment for their children.  On these dimensions some of the schools that 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				 derides have performed quite ably.  See  Peterson, Table 7.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Ultimately, 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter 
				</span>
				relies on very narrow data to draw rather broad conclusions.  One year of poor test scores at four community schools targeted at the most challenged students from the inner city says little about the value of those schools, let alone the quality of the 6 other community schools and 24 magnet schools in Cleveland.  
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				s use of statistics confirms the Courts wisdom in refusing to consider them when assessing the Cleveland programs constitutionality.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 17.  What appears to motivate 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				s analysis is a desire for a limiting principle to rule out certain nonreligious schools as alternatives to religious schools in the voucher program.  See 
				<em>
					post, 
				</em>
				at 16, 1718, n. 9 (dissenting opinion).  But the goal of the Courts
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				Establishment Clause jurisprudence is to determine whether, after the Cleveland voucher program was enacted, parents were free to direct state educational aid in either a nonreligious or religious direction.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 14.  That inquiry requires an evaluation of all reasonable educational options Ohio provides the Cleveland school system, regardless of whether they are formally made available in the same section of the Ohio Code as the voucher program.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Based on the reasoning in the Courts opinion, which is consistent with the realities of the Cleveland educational system, I am persuaded that the Cleveland voucher program affords parents of eligible children genuine nonreligious options and is consistent with the Establishment Clause.

				The Court holds that Ohios Pilot Project Scholarship Program, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §§3313.9743313.979 (Anderson 1999 and Supp. 2000) (voucher program), survives respondents Establishment Clause challenge.  While I join the Courts opinion, I write separately for two reasons.  First, although the Court takes an important step, I do not believe that todays decision, when considered in light of other longstanding government programs that impact religious organizations and our prior Establishment Clause jurisprudence, marks a dramatic break from the past.  Second, given the emphasis the Court places on verifying that parents of voucher students in religious schools have exercised true private choice, I think it is worth elaborating on the Courts conclusion that this inquiry should consider all reasonable educational alternatives to religious schools that are available to parents.  To do otherwise is to ignore how the educational system in Cleveland actually functions.

				These cases are different from prior indirect aid cases in part because a significant portion of the funds appropriated for the voucher program reach religious schools without restrictions on the use of these funds.  The share of public resources that reach religious schools is not, however, as significant as respondents suggest.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, Brief for Respondents Simmons-Harris et al. 12.  Data from the 19992000 school year indicate that 82 percent of schools participating in the voucher program were religious and that 96 percent of participating students enrolled in religious schools, see App. in Nos. 003055, etc. (CA6), p. 1679 (46 of 56 private schools in the program are
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				religiously-affiliated; 3,637 of 3,765 voucher students attend religious private schools), but these data are incomplete.  These statistics do not take into account all of the reasonable educational choices that may be available to students in Cleveland public schools.  When one considers the option to attend community schools, the percentage of students enrolled in religious schools falls to 62.1 percent.  If magnet schools are included in the mix, this percentage falls to 16.5 percent.  See J. Greene, The Racial, Economic, and Religious Context of Parental Choice in Cleveland 11, Table 4 (Oct. 8, 1999), App. 217a (reporting 2,087 students in community schools and 16,184 students in magnet schools).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Even these numbers do not paint a complete picture.  The Cleveland program provides voucher applicants from low-income families with up to $2,250 in tuition assistance and provides the remaining applicants with up to $1,875 in tuition assistance.  §§3313.976(A)(8), 3313.978(A) and (C)(1).  In contrast, the State provides community schools $4,518 per pupil and magnet schools, on average, $7,097 per pupil.  Affidavit of Caroline M. Hoxby ¶¶4b, 4c, App. 56a.  Even if one assumes that all voucher students came from low-income families and that each voucher student used up the entire $2,250 voucher, at most $8.2 million of public funds flowed to religious schools under the voucher program in 19992000.  Although just over one-half as many students attended community schools as religious private schools on the state fisc, the State spent over $1 million more$9.4 millionon students in community schools than on students in religious private schools because per-pupil aid to community schools is more than double the per-pupil aid to private schools under the voucher program.  Moreover, the amount spent on religious private schools is minor compared to the $114.8 million the State spent on students in the Cleveland magnet schools.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Although $8.2 million is no small sum, it pales in comparison to the amount of funds that federal, state, and local governments already provide religious institutions.  Religious organizations may qualify for exemptions from the federal corporate income tax, see

In addition, the Federal Government provides individuals, corporations, trusts, and estates a tax deduction for charitable contributions to qualified religious groups.  See §§170, 642(c).  Finally, the Federal Government and certain state governments provide tax credits for educational expenses, many of which are spent on education at religious schools.  See,

				A significant portion of the funds appropriated for these programs reach religiously affiliated institutions, typically without restrictions on its subsequent use.  For example, it has been reported that religious hospitals, which account for 18 percent of all hospital beds nationwide, rely on Medicare funds for 36 percent of their revenue.

				.  Federal aid to religious schools is also substantial.  Although data for all States is not available, data from Minnesota, for example, suggest that a substantial share of Pell Grant and other federal funds for college tuition reach religious schools.  Roughly one-third or $27.1 million of the federal tuition dollars spent on students at schools in Minnesota were used at private 4-year colleges.  Minnesota Higher Education Services Office, Financial Aid Awarded, Fiscal Year 1999: Grants, Loans, and Student Earning from Institution Jobs (Jan. 24, 2001).  The vast majority of these funds$23.5 millionflowed to religiously affiliated institutions.

Courts are instructed to consider two factors: first, whether the program administers aid in a neutral fashion, without differentiation based on the religious status of beneficiaries or providers of services; second, and more importantly, whether beneficiaries of indirect aid have a genuine choice among religious and nonreligious organizations when determining the organization to which they will direct that aid.  If the answer to either query is no, the program should be struck down under the Establishment Clause.  See

				I do not agree that the nonreligious schools have failed to provide Cleveland parents reasonable alternatives to religious schools in the voucher program.  For nonreligious schools to qualify as genuine options for parents, they need not be superior to religious schools in every respect.  They need only be adequate substitutes for religious schools in the eyes of parents.  The District Court record demonstrates that nonreligious schools were able to compete effectively with Catholic and other religious schools in the Cleveland voucher program.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1415, n. 4.  The best evidence of this is that many parents with vouchers selected nonreligious private schools over religious alternatives and an even larger number of parents send their children to community and magnet schools rather than seeking vouchers at all.  
				<em>
					Supra
				</em>
				, at 2.  More-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				over, there is no record evidence that any voucher-eligible student was turned away from a nonreligious private school in the voucher program, let alone a community or magnet school.

				To support his hunch about the effect of the cap on tuition under the voucher program, 
				<span class="smallcaps">

				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				 ignores evidence which suggests that, at a national level, nonreligious private schools may target a market for different, if not higher, quality of education.  For example, nonreligious private schools are smaller, see U. S. Dept. of Ed., National Center for Education Statistics, Private Universe School Survey, 19971998, (Oct. 1999) (Table 60) (87 and 269 students per private nonreligious and Catholic elementary school, re-

				<em>
					ibid
				</em>
				. (9.4 and
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				18.8 students per teacher at private nonreligious and Catholic elementary schools, respectively); have more highly educated teachers, see U. S. Dept. of Ed., National Center for Education Statistics, Private Schools in the United States: A Statistical Profile, 19931994, (NCES 97459, July 1997) (Table 3.4) (37.9 percent of non-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>

				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				of Catholic school teachers have Masters degrees); and have principals with longer job tenure than Catholic schools, see 
				<em>

				. (Table 3.7) (average tenure of principals at private nonreligious and Catholic schools is 8.2 and 4.7 years, respectively).

				Additionally, 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter

				s theory that the Cleveland voucher programs cap on the tuition encourages low-income student to attend religious schools ignores that these students receive nearly double the amount of tuition assistance under the community schools program than under the voucher program and that none of the community schools is religious.

				In my view the more significant finding in these cases is that Cleveland parents who use vouchers to send their children to religious private schools do so as a result of true private choice.  The Court rejects, correctly, the notion that the high percentage of voucher recipients who enroll in religious private schools necessarily demonstrates that parents do not actually have the option to send their children to nonreligious schools.  
				<em>
					Ante, 
				</em>
				at 1419.  Likewise, the mere fact that some parents enrolled their children in religious schools associated with a different faith than their own, see 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Souter, J
				</span>
				., dissenting), at 2021, says little about whether these parents had reasonable nonreligious options.  Indeed, no voucher student has been known to be turned away from a nonreligious private school participating in the voucher program.  
				<em>

				, at 10.  This is impressive given evidence in the record that the present litigation has discouraged the entry of some nonreligious private schools into the voucher program.  Declaration of David P. Zanotti ¶¶5, 10, App. 225a, 227a.  Finally, as demonstrated above, the Cleveland program does not establish financial incentives to undertake a religious education.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I find the Courts answer to the question whether parents of students eligible for vouchers have a genuine choice between religious and nonreligious schools persuasive.  In looking at the voucher program, all the choices available to potential beneficiaries of the government program should be considered.  In these cases, parents who were eligible to apply for a voucher also had the option, at a minimum, to send their children to community schools.  Yet the Court of Appeals chose not to look at community schools, let alone magnet schools, when evaluating the Cleveland voucher program.  See 234 F. 3d, at 958.  That decision was incorrect.  Focusing in these cases only on the program challenged by respondents ignores how the educational system in Cleveland actually functions.  The record indicates that, in 1999, two nonreligious private schools that had previously served 15 percent of the students in the voucher program were prompted to convert to community schools because parents were concerned about the litigation surrounding the program, and because a new community schools program provided more per-pupil financial aid.  Many of the students that enrolled in the two schools under the voucher program transferred to the community schools program and continued to attend these schools.  See Affidavit of David L. Brennan ¶¶3, 10, App. 145a, 147a; Declaration of David P. Zanotti ¶¶410, 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 225a227a.  This incident provides strong evidence that both parents and nonreligious schools view the voucher program and the community schools program as reasonable alternatives.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Considering all the educational options available to parents whose children are eligible for vouchers, including community and magnet schools, the Court finds that parents in the Cleveland schools have an array of nonreligious options.  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 1314.  Not surprisingly, respondents present no evidence that any students who were candidates for a voucher were denied slots in a community school or a magnet school.

				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter

				rejects the three other community schools (Horizon Science Academy, Cleveland Alternative Learning, and International Preparatory School) because they did not offer primary school classes, were targeted towards poor students or students with disciplinary or academic problems, or were not in operation for a year.  See 
				<em>
					post, 
				</em>
				at 1819, n. 10.  But a community school need not offer primary school classes to be an alternative to religious middle schools, and catering to impoverished or otherwise challenged students may make a school more attractive to certain inner-city parents.  Moreover, the one community school that was
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				closed in 19992000 was merely looking for a new loca-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				tion and was operational in other years.  See Affidavit of Steven M. Puckett ¶12, App. 162a; Ohio Department

				<span class="softbreak"></span>

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Of the six community schools that 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				 admits as alternatives to the voucher program in 19992000, he notes that four (the Broadway, Cathedral, Chapelside, and Lincoln Park campuses of the Hope Academy) reported lower test scores than public schools during the school year 
				<em>
					after
				</em>
				 the District Courts grant of summary judgment to respondents, according to report cards prepared by the Ohio Department of Education.  See 
				<em>
					post, 
				</em>
				at 1819, n. 10 (dissenting opinion).  (One, Old Brooklyn Montessori School, performed better than public schools.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.; see also Ohio Department of Education, 2001 Community School Report Card, Old Brooklyn Montessori School 5 (community school scored higher than public schools in four of five subjects in 19992000).)  These report cards underestimate the value of the four Hope Academy schools.  Before they entered the community school program, two of them participated in the voucher program.  Although they received far less state funding in that capacity, they had among the highest rates of parental satisfaction of all voucher schools, religious or nonreligious.  See P. Peterson, W. Howell, &amp; J. Greene, An Evaluation of the Cleveland Voucher Program after Two Years 6, Table 4 (June 1999) (hereinafter Peterson).  This is particularly impressive given that a Harvard University study found that the Hope Academy schools attracted the poorest and most educationally disadvantaged students.  J. Greene, W. Howell, P. Peterson, Lessons from the Cleveland Scholarship Program 22, 24 (Oct. 15, 1997).  Moreover, 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				s evaluation of the Hope Academy schools assumes that the only relevant measure of school quality is academic performance.  It is reasonable to suppose, however, that parents in the inner city also choose schools that provide discipline and a safe environment for their children.  On these dimensions some of the schools that 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				 derides have performed quite ably.  See  Peterson, Table 7.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Ultimately, 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter 
				</span>
				relies on very narrow data to draw rather broad conclusions.  One year of poor test scores at four community schools targeted at the most challenged students from the inner city says little about the value of those schools, let alone the quality of the 6 other community schools and 24 magnet schools in Cleveland.  
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				s use of statistics confirms the Courts wisdom in refusing to consider them when assessing the Cleveland programs constitutionality.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 17.  What appears to motivate 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				s analysis is a desire for a limiting principle to rule out certain nonreligious schools as alternatives to religious schools in the voucher program.  See 
				<em>
					post, 
				</em>
				at 16, 1718, n. 9 (dissenting opinion).  But the goal of the Courts
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				Establishment Clause jurisprudence is to determine whether, after the Cleveland voucher program was enacted, parents were free to direct state educational aid in either a nonreligious or religious direction.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 14.  That inquiry requires an evaluation of all reasonable educational options Ohio provides the Cleveland school system, regardless of whether they are formally made available in the same section of the Ohio Code as the voucher program.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Based on the reasoning in the Courts opinion, which is consistent with the realities of the Cleveland educational system, I am persuaded that the Cleveland voucher program affords parents of eligible children genuine nonreligious options and is consistent with the Establishment Clause.

				The Court holds that Ohios Pilot Project Scholarship Program, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §§3313.9743313.979 (Anderson 1999 and Supp. 2000) (voucher program), survives respondents Establishment Clause challenge.  While I join the Courts opinion, I write separately for two reasons.  First, although the Court takes an important step, I do not believe that todays decision, when considered in light of other longstanding government programs that impact religious organizations and our prior Establishment Clause jurisprudence, marks a dramatic break from the past.  Second, given the emphasis the Court places on verifying that parents of voucher students in religious schools have exercised true private choice, I think it is worth elaborating on the Courts conclusion that this inquiry should consider all reasonable educational alternatives to religious schools that are available to parents.  To do otherwise is to ignore how the educational system in Cleveland actually functions.

				These cases are different from prior indirect aid cases in part because a significant portion of the funds appropriated for the voucher program reach religious schools without restrictions on the use of these funds.  The share of public resources that reach religious schools is not, however, as significant as respondents suggest.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, Brief for Respondents Simmons-Harris et al. 12.  Data from the 19992000 school year indicate that 82 percent of schools participating in the voucher program were religious and that 96 percent of participating students enrolled in religious schools, see App. in Nos. 003055, etc. (CA6), p. 1679 (46 of 56 private schools in the program are
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				religiously-affiliated; 3,637 of 3,765 voucher students attend religious private schools), but these data are incomplete.  These statistics do not take into account all of the reasonable educational choices that may be available to students in Cleveland public schools.  When one considers the option to attend community schools, the percentage of students enrolled in religious schools falls to 62.1 percent.  If magnet schools are included in the mix, this percentage falls to 16.5 percent.  See J. Greene, The Racial, Economic, and Religious Context of Parental Choice in Cleveland 11, Table 4 (Oct. 8, 1999), App. 217a (reporting 2,087 students in community schools and 16,184 students in magnet schools).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Even these numbers do not paint a complete picture.  The Cleveland program provides voucher applicants from low-income families with up to $2,250 in tuition assistance and provides the remaining applicants with up to $1,875 in tuition assistance.  §§3313.976(A)(8), 3313.978(A) and (C)(1).  In contrast, the State provides community schools $4,518 per pupil and magnet schools, on average, $7,097 per pupil.  Affidavit of Caroline M. Hoxby ¶¶4b, 4c, App. 56a.  Even if one assumes that all voucher students came from low-income families and that each voucher student used up the entire $2,250 voucher, at most $8.2 million of public funds flowed to religious schools under the voucher program in 19992000.  Although just over one-half as many students attended community schools as religious private schools on the state fisc, the State spent over $1 million more$9.4 millionon students in community schools than on students in religious private schools because per-pupil aid to community schools is more than double the per-pupil aid to private schools under the voucher program.  Moreover, the amount spent on religious private schools is minor compared to the $114.8 million the State spent on students in the Cleveland magnet schools.

				Although $8.2 million is no small sum, it pales in comparison to the amount of funds that federal, state, and local governments already provide religious institutions.  Religious organizations may qualify for exemptions from the federal corporate income tax, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/26/501.html#c_3" class="subref" title="subref">26 U. S. C. §501(c)(3)</a>; the corporate income tax in many States, see,

In addition, the Federal Government provides individuals, corporations, trusts, and estates a tax deduction for charitable contributions to qualified religious groups.  See §§170, 642(c).  Finally, the Federal Government and certain state governments provide tax credits for educational expenses, many of which are spent on education at religious schools.  See, 
				<em>

The state property tax exemptions for religious institutions alone amount to very large sums annually.

As for the Federal Government, the tax deduction for charitable contributions reduces federal tax revenues by nearly $25 billion annually, see U. S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census, Statistical Abstract of the United States 344 (2000) (hereinafter Statistical Abstract), and it is reported that over 60 percent of household charitable contributions go to religious charities,

				A significant portion of the funds appropriated for these programs reach religiously affiliated institutions, typically without restrictions on its subsequent use.  For example, it has been reported that religious hospitals, which account for 18 percent of all hospital beds nationwide, rely on Medicare funds for 36 percent of their revenue.  MergerWatch, New Study Details Public Funding of Religious Hospitals (Jan. 2002), http://www.mergerwatch.org/
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				inthenews/publicfunding.html.  Moreover, taking into account both Medicare and Medicaid, religious hospitals received nearly $45 billion from the federal fisc in 1998.  
				<em>

				.  Federal aid to religious schools is also substantial.  Although data for all States is not available, data from Minnesota, for example, suggest that a substantial share of Pell Grant and other federal funds for college tuition reach religious schools.  Roughly one-third or $27.1 million of the federal tuition dollars spent on students at schools in Minnesota were used at private 4-year colleges.  Minnesota Higher Education Services Office, Financial Aid Awarded, Fiscal Year 1999: Grants, Loans, and Student Earning from Institution Jobs (Jan. 24, 2001).  The vast majority of these funds$23.5 millionflowed to religiously affiliated institutions.

				Nor does todays decision signal a major departure from this Courts prior Establishment Clause jurisprudence.  A central tool in our analysis of cases in this area has been the 
				<em>
					Lemon

				test.  As originally formulated, a statute passed this test only if it had a secular legislative purpose, if its principal or primary effect was one that neither advance[d] nor inhibit[ed] religion, and if it did not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion.

Courts are instructed to consider two factors: first, whether the program administers aid in a neutral fashion, without differentiation based on the religious status of beneficiaries or providers of services; second, and more importantly, whether beneficiaries of indirect aid have a genuine choice among religious and nonreligious organizations when determining the organization to which they will direct that aid.  If the answer to either query is no, the program should be struck down under the Establishment Clause.  See

				There is little question in my mind that the Cleveland voucher program is neutral as between religious schools and nonreligious schools.  See

				<span class="smallcaps">

				I do not agree that the nonreligious schools have failed to provide Cleveland parents reasonable alternatives to religious schools in the voucher program.  For nonreligious schools to qualify as genuine options for parents, they need not be superior to religious schools in every respect.  They need only be adequate substitutes for religious schools in the eyes of parents.  The District Court record demonstrates that nonreligious schools were able to compete effectively with Catholic and other religious schools in the Cleveland voucher program.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1415, n. 4.  The best evidence of this is that many parents with vouchers selected nonreligious private schools over religious alternatives and an even larger number of parents send their children to community and magnet schools rather than seeking vouchers at all.  
				<em>
					Supra
				</em>
				, at 2.  More-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				over, there is no record evidence that any voucher-eligible student was turned away from a nonreligious private school in the voucher program, let alone a community or magnet school.

				To support his hunch about the effect of the cap on tuition under the voucher program, 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				 cites national data to suggest that, on average, Catholic schools have a cost advantage over other types of schools.  See 
				<em>
					post, 
				</em>
				at 2223, n. 15 (dissenting opinion).  Even if national statistics were relevant for evaluating the Cleveland program, 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				 ignores evidence which suggests that, at a national level, nonreligious private schools may target a market for different, if not higher, quality of education.  For example, nonreligious private schools are smaller, see U. S. Dept. of Ed., National Center for Education Statistics, Private Universe School Survey, 19971998, (Oct. 1999) (Table 60) (87 and 269 students per private nonreligious and Catholic elementary school, re-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				spectively); have smaller class sizes, see 
				<em>
					ibid
				</em>
				. (9.4 and
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				18.8 students per teacher at private nonreligious and Catholic elementary schools, respectively); have more highly educated teachers, see U. S. Dept. of Ed., National Center for Education Statistics, Private Schools in the United States: A Statistical Profile, 19931994, (NCES 97459, July 1997) (Table 3.4) (37.9 percent of non-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				religious private school teachers but only 29.9 percent
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				of Catholic school teachers have Masters degrees); and have principals with longer job tenure than Catholic schools, see 
				<em>
					ibid
				</em>
				. (Table 3.7) (average tenure of principals at private nonreligious and Catholic schools is 8.2 and 4.7 years, respectively).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Additionally, 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				s theory that the Cleveland voucher programs cap on the tuition encourages low-income student to attend religious schools ignores that these students receive nearly double the amount of tuition assistance under the community schools program than under the voucher program and that none of the community schools is religious.

				In my view the more significant finding in these cases is that Cleveland parents who use vouchers to send their children to religious private schools do so as a result of true private choice.  The Court rejects, correctly, the notion that the high percentage of voucher recipients who enroll in religious private schools necessarily demonstrates that parents do not actually have the option to send their children to nonreligious schools.

				I find the Courts answer to the question whether parents of students eligible for vouchers have a genuine choice between religious and nonreligious schools persuasive.  In looking at the voucher program, all the choices available to potential beneficiaries of the government program should be considered.  In these cases, parents who were eligible to apply for a voucher also had the option, at a minimum, to send their children to community schools.  Yet the Court of Appeals chose not to look at community schools, let alone magnet schools, when evaluating the Cleveland voucher program.  See 234 F. 3d, at 958.  That decision was incorrect.  Focusing in these cases only on the program challenged by respondents ignores how the educational system in Cleveland actually functions.  The record indicates that, in 1999, two nonreligious private schools that had previously served 15 percent of the students in the voucher program were prompted to convert to community schools because parents were concerned about the litigation surrounding the program, and because a new community schools program provided more per-pupil financial aid.  Many of the students that enrolled in the two schools under the voucher program transferred to the community schools program and continued to attend these schools.  See Affidavit of David L. Brennan ¶¶3, 10, App. 145a, 147a; Declaration of David P. Zanotti ¶¶410, 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 225a227a.  This incident provides strong evidence that both parents and nonreligious schools view the voucher program and the community schools program as reasonable alternatives.

				Considering all the educational options available to parents whose children are eligible for vouchers, including community and magnet schools, the Court finds that parents in the Cleveland schools have an array of nonreligious options.  
				<em>
					Ante,

				 at 1314.  Not surprisingly, respondents present no evidence that any students who were candidates for a voucher were denied slots in a community school or a magnet school.  Indeed, the record suggests the opposite with respect to community schools.  See Affidavit of David L. Brennan ¶8, App. 147a.

				Of the six community schools that

				 the District Courts grant of summary judgment to respondents, according to report cards prepared by the Ohio Department of Education.  See

				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.; see also Ohio Department of Education, 2001 Community School Report Card, Old Brooklyn Montessori School 5 (community school scored higher than public schools in four of five subjects in 19992000).)  These report cards underestimate the value of the four Hope Academy schools.  Before they entered the community school program, two of them participated in the voucher program.  Although they received far less state funding in that capacity, they had among the highest rates of parental satisfaction of all voucher schools, religious or nonreligious.  See P. Peterson, W. Howell, &amp; J. Greene, An Evaluation of the Cleveland Voucher Program after Two Years 6, Table 4 (June 1999) (hereinafter Peterson).  This is particularly impressive given that a Harvard University study found that the Hope Academy schools attracted the poorest and most educationally disadvantaged students.  J. Greene, W. Howell, P. Peterson, Lessons from the Cleveland Scholarship Program 22, 24 (Oct. 15, 1997).  Moreover, 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				s evaluation of the Hope Academy schools assumes that the only relevant measure of school quality is academic performance.  It is reasonable to suppose, however, that parents in the inner city also choose schools that provide discipline and a safe environment for their children.  On these dimensions some of the schools that 
				<span class="smallcaps">

				Ultimately, 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter 
				</span>
				relies on very narrow data to draw rather broad conclusions.  One year of poor test scores at four community schools targeted at the most challenged students from the inner city says little about the value of those schools, let alone the quality of the 6 other community schools and 24 magnet schools in Cleveland.  
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				s use of statistics confirms the Courts wisdom in refusing to consider them when assessing the Cleveland programs constitutionality.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 17.  What appears to motivate 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				s analysis is a desire for a limiting principle to rule out certain nonreligious schools as alternatives to religious schools in the voucher program.  See 
				<em>
					post, 
				</em>
				at 16, 1718, n. 9 (dissenting opinion).  But the goal of the Courts
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				Establishment Clause jurisprudence is to determine whether, after the Cleveland voucher program was enacted, parents were free to direct state educational aid in either a nonreligious or religious direction.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 14.  That inquiry requires an evaluation of all reasonable educational options Ohio provides the Cleveland school system, regardless of whether they are formally made available in the same section of the Ohio Code as the voucher program.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Based on the reasoning in the Courts opinion, which is consistent with the realities of the Cleveland educational system, I am persuaded that the Cleveland voucher program affords parents of eligible children genuine nonreligious options and is consistent with the Establishment Clause.

				The Court holds that Ohios Pilot Project Scholarship Program, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §§3313.9743313.979 (Anderson 1999 and Supp. 2000) (voucher program), survives respondents Establishment Clause challenge.  While I join the Courts opinion, I write separately for two reasons.  First, although the Court takes an important step, I do not believe that todays decision, when considered in light of other longstanding government programs that impact religious organizations and our prior Establishment Clause jurisprudence, marks a dramatic break from the past.  Second, given the emphasis the Court places on verifying that parents of voucher students in religious schools have exercised true private choice, I think it is worth elaborating on the Courts conclusion that this inquiry should consider all reasonable educational alternatives to religious schools that are available to parents.  To do otherwise is to ignore how the educational system in Cleveland actually functions.

				These cases are different from prior indirect aid cases in part because a significant portion of the funds appropriated for the voucher program reach religious schools without restrictions on the use of these funds.  The share of public resources that reach religious schools is not, however, as significant as respondents suggest.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, Brief for Respondents Simmons-Harris et al. 12.  Data from the 19992000 school year indicate that 82 percent of schools participating in the voucher program were religious and that 96 percent of participating students enrolled in religious schools, see App. in Nos. 003055, etc. (CA6), p. 1679 (46 of 56 private schools in the program are
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				religiously-affiliated; 3,637 of 3,765 voucher students attend religious private schools), but these data are incomplete.  These statistics do not take into account all of the reasonable educational choices that may be available to students in Cleveland public schools.  When one considers the option to attend community schools, the percentage of students enrolled in religious schools falls to 62.1 percent.  If magnet schools are included in the mix, this percentage falls to 16.5 percent.  See J. Greene, The Racial, Economic, and Religious Context of Parental Choice in Cleveland 11, Table 4 (Oct. 8, 1999), App. 217a (reporting 2,087 students in community schools and 16,184 students in magnet schools).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Even these numbers do not paint a complete picture.  The Cleveland program provides voucher applicants from low-income families with up to $2,250 in tuition assistance and provides the remaining applicants with up to $1,875 in tuition assistance.  §§3313.976(A)(8), 3313.978(A) and (C)(1).  In contrast, the State provides community schools $4,518 per pupil and magnet schools, on average, $7,097 per pupil.  Affidavit of Caroline M. Hoxby ¶¶4b, 4c, App. 56a.  Even if one assumes that all voucher students came from low-income families and that each voucher student used up the entire $2,250 voucher, at most $8.2 million of public funds flowed to religious schools under the voucher program in 19992000.  Although just over one-half as many students attended community schools as religious private schools on the state fisc, the State spent over $1 million more$9.4 millionon students in community schools than on students in religious private schools because per-pupil aid to community schools is more than double the per-pupil aid to private schools under the voucher program.  Moreover, the amount spent on religious private schools is minor compared to the $114.8 million the State spent on students in the Cleveland magnet schools.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Although $8.2 million is no small sum, it pales in comparison to the amount of funds that federal, state, and local governments already provide religious institutions.  Religious organizations may qualify for exemptions from the federal corporate income tax, see

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/26/1402.html#a_8" class="subref" title="subref">26 U. S. C. §1402(a)(8)</a>.  In addition, the Federal Government provides individuals, corporations, trusts, and estates a tax deduction for charitable contributions to qualified religious groups.  See §§170, 642(c).  Finally, the Federal Government and certain state governments provide tax credits for educational expenses, many of which are spent on education at religious schools.  See,

As for the Federal Government, the tax deduction for charitable contributions reduces federal tax revenues by nearly $25 billion annually, see U. S.

				A significant portion of the funds appropriated for these programs reach religiously affiliated institutions, typically without restrictions on its subsequent use.  For example, it has been reported that religious hospitals, which account for 18 percent of all hospital beds nationwide, rely on Medicare funds for 36 percent of their revenue.  MergerWatch, New Study Details Public Funding of Religious Hospitals (Jan. 2002), http://www.mergerwatch.org/
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				inthenews/publicfunding.html.  Moreover, taking into account both Medicare and Medicaid, religious hospitals received nearly $45 billion from the federal fisc in 1998.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  Federal aid to religious schools is also substantial.  Although data for all States is not available, data from Minnesota, for example, suggest that a substantial share of Pell Grant and other federal funds for college tuition reach religious schools.  Roughly one-third or $27.1 million of the federal tuition dollars spent on students at schools in Minnesota were used at private 4-year colleges.  Minnesota Higher Education Services Office, Financial Aid Awarded, Fiscal Year 1999: Grants, Loans, and Student Earning from Institution Jobs (Jan. 24, 2001).  The vast majority of these funds$23.5 millionflowed to religiously affiliated institutions.

Courts are instructed to consider two factors: first, whether the program administers aid in a neutral fashion, without differentiation based on the religious status of beneficiaries or providers of services; second, and more importantly, whether beneficiaries of indirect aid have a genuine choice among religious and nonreligious organizations when determining the organization to which they will direct that aid.  If the answer to either query is no, the program should be struck down under the Establishment Clause.  See

				I do not agree that the nonreligious schools have failed to provide Cleveland parents reasonable alternatives to religious schools in the voucher program.  For nonreligious schools to qualify as genuine options for parents, they need not be superior to religious schools in every respect.  They need only be adequate substitutes for religious schools in the eyes of parents.  The District Court record demonstrates that nonreligious schools were able to compete effectively with Catholic and other religious schools in the Cleveland voucher program.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1415, n. 4.  The best evidence of this is that many parents with vouchers selected nonreligious private schools over religious alternatives and an even larger number of parents send their children to community and magnet schools rather than seeking vouchers at all.

				<span class="smallcaps">

				 ignores evidence which suggests that, at a national level, nonreligious private schools may target a market for different, if not higher, quality of education.  For example, nonreligious private schools are smaller, see U. S.

				Additionally,

				In my view the more significant finding in these cases is that Cleveland parents who use vouchers to send their children to religious private schools do so as a result of true private choice.  The Court rejects, correctly, the notion that the high percentage of voucher recipients who enroll in religious private schools necessarily demonstrates that parents do not actually have the option to send their children to nonreligious schools.  
				<em>
					Ante, 
				</em>
				at 1419.  Likewise, the mere fact that some parents enrolled their children in religious schools associated with a different faith than their own, see 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Souter, J
				</span>

				<em>

				, at 10.  This is impressive given evidence in the record that the present litigation has discouraged the entry of some nonreligious private schools into the voucher program.  Declaration of David P. Zanotti ¶¶5, 10, App. 225a, 227a.  Finally, as demonstrated above, the Cleveland program does not establish financial incentives to undertake a religious education.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I find the Courts answer to the question whether parents of students eligible for vouchers have a genuine choice between religious and nonreligious schools persuasive.  In looking at the voucher program, all the choices available to potential beneficiaries of the government program should be considered.  In these cases, parents who were eligible to apply for a voucher also had the option, at a minimum, to send their children to community schools.  Yet the Court of Appeals chose not to look at community schools, let alone magnet schools, when evaluating the Cleveland voucher program.  See 234 F. 3d, at 958.  That decision was incorrect.  Focusing in these cases only on the program challenged by respondents ignores how the educational system in Cleveland actually functions.  The record indicates that, in 1999, two nonreligious private schools that had previously served 15 percent of the students in the voucher program were prompted to convert to community schools because parents were concerned about the litigation surrounding the program, and because a new community schools program provided more per-pupil financial aid.  Many of the students that enrolled in the two schools under the voucher program transferred to the community schools program and continued to attend these schools.  See Affidavit of David L. Brennan ¶¶3, 10, App. 145a, 147a; Declaration of David P. Zanotti ¶¶410, 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 225a227a.  This incident provides strong evidence that both parents and nonreligious schools view the voucher program and the community schools program as reasonable alternatives.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Considering all the educational options available to parents whose children are eligible for vouchers, including community and magnet schools, the Court finds that parents in the Cleveland schools have an array of nonreligious options.  
				<em>
					Ante,

				 at 1314.  Not surprisingly, respondents present no evidence that any students who were candidates for a voucher were denied slots in a community school or a magnet school.

See 
				<em>

But a community school need not offer primary school classes to be an alternative to religious middle schools, and catering to impoverished or otherwise challenged students may make a school more attractive to certain inner-city parents.  Moreover, the one community school that was
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				closed in 19992000 was merely looking for a new loca-

				Of the six community schools that 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>

				<em>
					after
				</em>
				 the District Courts grant of summary judgment to respondents, according to report cards prepared by the Ohio Department of Education.  See 
				<em>
					post, 
				</em>
				at 1819, n. 10 (dissenting opinion).  (One, Old Brooklyn Montessori School, performed better than public schools.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.; see also Ohio Department of Education, 2001 Community School Report Card, Old Brooklyn Montessori School 5 (community school scored higher than public schools in four of five subjects in 19992000).)  These report cards underestimate the value of the four Hope Academy schools.  Before they entered the community school program, two of them participated in the voucher program.  Although they received far less state funding in that capacity, they had among the highest rates of parental satisfaction of all voucher schools, religious or nonreligious.  See P. Peterson, W. Howell, &amp; J. Greene, An Evaluation of the Cleveland Voucher Program after Two Years 6, Table 4 (June 1999) (hereinafter Peterson).  This is particularly impressive given that a Harvard University study found that the Hope Academy schools attracted the poorest and most educationally disadvantaged students.  J. Greene, W. Howell, P. Peterson, Lessons from the Cleveland Scholarship Program 22, 24 (Oct. 15, 1997).  Moreover, 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				s evaluation of the Hope Academy schools assumes that the only relevant measure of school quality is academic performance.  It is reasonable to suppose, however, that parents in the inner city also choose schools that provide discipline and a safe environment for their children.  On these dimensions some of the schools that 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				 derides have performed quite ably.  See  Peterson, Table 7.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Ultimately, 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter 
				</span>
				relies on very narrow data to draw rather broad conclusions.  One year of poor test scores at four community schools targeted at the most challenged students from the inner city says little about the value of those schools, let alone the quality of the 6 other community schools and 24 magnet schools in Cleveland.  
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				s use of statistics confirms the Courts wisdom in refusing to consider them when assessing the Cleveland programs constitutionality.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 17.  What appears to motivate 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				s analysis is a desire for a limiting principle to rule out certain nonreligious schools as alternatives to religious schools in the voucher program.  See 
				<em>
					post, 
				</em>
				at 16, 1718, n. 9 (dissenting opinion).  But the goal of the Courts
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				Establishment Clause jurisprudence is to determine whether, after the Cleveland voucher program was enacted, parents were free to direct state educational aid in either a nonreligious or religious direction.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 14.  That inquiry requires an evaluation of all reasonable educational options Ohio provides the Cleveland school system, regardless of whether they are formally made available in the same section of the Ohio Code as the voucher program.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Based on the reasoning in the Courts opinion, which is consistent with the realities of the Cleveland educational system, I am persuaded that the Cleveland voucher program affords parents of eligible children genuine nonreligious options and is consistent with the Establishment Clause.

				The Court holds that Ohios Pilot Project Scholarship Program, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §§3313.9743313.979 (Anderson 1999 and Supp. 2000) (voucher program), survives respondents Establishment Clause challenge.  While I join the Courts opinion, I write separately for two reasons.  First, although the Court takes an important step, I do not believe that todays decision, when considered in light of other longstanding government programs that impact religious organizations and our prior Establishment Clause jurisprudence, marks a dramatic break from the past.  Second, given the emphasis the Court places on verifying that parents of voucher students in religious schools have exercised true private choice, I think it is worth elaborating on the Courts conclusion that this inquiry should consider all reasonable educational alternatives to religious schools that are available to parents.  To do otherwise is to ignore how the educational system in Cleveland actually functions.

				These cases are different from prior indirect aid cases in part because a significant portion of the funds appropriated for the voucher program reach religious schools without restrictions on the use of these funds.  The share of public resources that reach religious schools is not, however, as significant as respondents suggest.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, Brief for Respondents Simmons-Harris et al. 12.  Data from the 19992000 school year indicate that 82 percent of schools participating in the voucher program were religious and that 96 percent of participating students enrolled in religious schools, see App. in Nos. 003055, etc. (CA6), p. 1679 (46 of 56 private schools in the program are
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				religiously-affiliated; 3,637 of 3,765 voucher students attend religious private schools), but these data are incomplete.  These statistics do not take into account all of the reasonable educational choices that may be available to students in Cleveland public schools.  When one considers the option to attend community schools, the percentage of students enrolled in religious schools falls to 62.1 percent.  If magnet schools are included in the mix, this percentage falls to 16.5 percent.  See J. Greene, The Racial, Economic, and Religious Context of Parental Choice in Cleveland 11, Table 4 (Oct. 8, 1999), App. 217a (reporting 2,087 students in community schools and 16,184 students in magnet schools).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Even these numbers do not paint a complete picture.  The Cleveland program provides voucher applicants from low-income families with up to $2,250 in tuition assistance and provides the remaining applicants with up to $1,875 in tuition assistance.  §§3313.976(A)(8), 3313.978(A) and (C)(1).  In contrast, the State provides community schools $4,518 per pupil and magnet schools, on average, $7,097 per pupil.  Affidavit of Caroline M. Hoxby ¶¶4b, 4c, App. 56a.  Even if one assumes that all voucher students came from low-income families and that each voucher student used up the entire $2,250 voucher, at most $8.2 million of public funds flowed to religious schools under the voucher program in 19992000.  Although just over one-half as many students attended community schools as religious private schools on the state fisc, the State spent over $1 million more$9.4 millionon students in community schools than on students in religious private schools because per-pupil aid to community schools is more than double the per-pupil aid to private schools under the voucher program.  Moreover, the amount spent on religious private schools is minor compared to the $114.8 million the State spent on students in the Cleveland magnet schools.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Although $8.2 million is no small sum, it pales in comparison to the amount of funds that federal, state, and local governments already provide religious institutions.  Religious organizations may qualify for exemptions from the federal corporate income tax, see

In addition, the Federal Government provides individuals, corporations, trusts, and estates a tax deduction for charitable contributions to qualified religious groups.  See §§170, 642(c).  Finally, the Federal Government and certain state governments provide tax credits for educational expenses, many of which are spent on education at religious schools.  See,

				A significant portion of the funds appropriated for these programs reach religiously affiliated institutions, typically without restrictions on its subsequent use.  For example, it has been reported that religious hospitals, which account for 18 percent of all hospital beds nationwide, rely on Medicare funds for 36 percent of their revenue.

				.  Federal aid to religious schools is also substantial.  Although data for all States is not available, data from Minnesota, for example, suggest that a substantial share of Pell Grant and other federal funds for college tuition reach religious schools.  Roughly one-third or $27.1 million of the federal tuition dollars spent on students at schools in Minnesota were used at private 4-year colleges.  Minnesota Higher Education Services Office, Financial Aid Awarded, Fiscal Year 1999: Grants, Loans, and Student Earning from Institution Jobs (Jan. 24, 2001).

Courts are instructed to consider two factors: first, whether the program administers aid in a neutral fashion, without differentiation based on the religious status of beneficiaries or providers of services; second, and more importantly, whether beneficiaries of indirect aid have a genuine choice among religious and nonreligious organizations when determining the organization to which they will direct that aid.

				I do not agree that the nonreligious schools have failed to provide Cleveland parents reasonable alternatives to religious schools in the voucher program.  For nonreligious schools to qualify as genuine options for parents, they need not be superior to religious schools in every respect.  They need only be adequate substitutes for religious schools in the eyes of parents.  The District Court record demonstrates that nonreligious schools were able to compete effectively with Catholic and other religious schools in the Cleveland voucher program.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1415, n. 4.  The best evidence of this is that many parents with vouchers selected nonreligious private schools over religious alternatives and an even larger number of parents send their children to community and magnet schools rather than seeking vouchers at all.  
				<em>
					Supra
				</em>
				, at 2.  More-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				over, there is no record evidence that any voucher-eligible student was turned away from a nonreligious private school in the voucher program, let alone a community or magnet school.

				To support his hunch about the effect of the cap on tuition under the voucher program,

				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				 ignores evidence which suggests that, at a national level, nonreligious private schools may target a market for different, if not higher, quality of education.  For example, nonreligious private schools are smaller, see U. S. Dept. of Ed., National Center for Education Statistics, Private Universe School Survey, 19971998, (Oct. 1999) (Table 60) (87 and 269 students per private nonreligious and Catholic elementary school, re-

				<em>
					ibid
				</em>
				. (9.4 and
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				18.8 students per teacher at private nonreligious and Catholic elementary schools, respectively); have more highly educated teachers, see U. S. Dept. of Ed., National Center for Education Statistics, Private Schools in the United States: A Statistical Profile, 19931994, (NCES 97459, July 1997) (Table 3.4) (37.9 percent of non-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>

				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				of Catholic school teachers have Masters degrees); and have principals with longer job tenure than Catholic schools, see

				Additionally, 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				s theory that the Cleveland voucher programs cap on the tuition encourages low-income student to attend religious schools ignores that these students receive nearly double the amount of tuition assistance under the community schools program than under the voucher program and that none of the community schools is religious.

				In my view the more significant finding in these cases is that Cleveland parents who use vouchers to send their children to religious private schools do so as a result of true private choice.  The Court rejects, correctly, the notion that the high percentage of voucher recipients who enroll in religious private schools necessarily demonstrates that parents do not actually have the option to send their children to nonreligious schools.  
				<em>
					Ante, 
				</em>
				at 1419.  Likewise, the mere fact that some parents enrolled their children in religious schools associated with a different faith than their own, see 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Souter, J
				</span>
				., dissenting), at 2021, says little about whether these parents had reasonable nonreligious options.  Indeed, no voucher student has been known to be turned away from a nonreligious private school participating in the voucher program.

				, at 10.  This is impressive given evidence in the record that the present litigation has discouraged the entry of some nonreligious private schools into the voucher program.  Declaration of David P. Zanotti ¶¶5, 10, App. 225a, 227a.  Finally, as demonstrated above, the Cleveland program does not establish financial incentives to undertake a religious education.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I find the Courts answer to the question whether parents of students eligible for vouchers have a genuine choice between religious and nonreligious schools persuasive.  In looking at the voucher program, all the choices available to potential beneficiaries of the government program should be considered.  In these cases, parents who were eligible to apply for a voucher also had the option, at a minimum, to send their children to community schools.  Yet the Court of Appeals chose not to look at community schools, let alone magnet schools, when evaluating the Cleveland voucher program.  See 234 F. 3d, at 958.  That decision was incorrect.  Focusing in these cases only on the program challenged by respondents ignores how the educational system in Cleveland actually functions.  The record indicates that, in 1999, two nonreligious private schools that had previously served 15 percent of the students in the voucher program were prompted to convert to community schools because parents were concerned about the litigation surrounding the program, and because a new community schools program provided more per-pupil financial aid.  Many of the students that enrolled in the two schools under the voucher program transferred to the community schools program and continued to attend these schools.  See Affidavit of David L. Brennan ¶¶3, 10, App. 145a, 147a; Declaration of David P. Zanotti ¶¶410, 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 225a227a.  This incident provides strong evidence that both parents and nonreligious schools view the voucher program and the community schools program as reasonable alternatives.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Considering all the educational options available to parents whose children are eligible for vouchers, including community and magnet schools, the Court finds that parents in the Cleveland schools have an array of nonreligious options.  
				<em>
					Ante,

				 at 1314.  Not surprisingly, respondents present no evidence that any students who were candidates for a voucher were denied slots in a community school or a magnet school.

See 
				<em>

But a community school need not offer primary school classes to be an alternative to religious middle schools, and catering to impoverished or otherwise challenged students may make a school more attractive to certain inner-city parents.

				.; see also Ohio Department of Education, 2001 Community School Report Card, Old Brooklyn Montessori School 5 (community school scored higher than public schools in four of five subjects in 19992000).)  These report cards underestimate the value of the four Hope Academy schools.  Before they entered the community school program, two of them participated in the voucher program.  Although they received far less state funding in that capacity, they had among the highest rates of parental satisfaction of all voucher schools, religious or nonreligious.  See P. Peterson, W. Howell, &amp; J. Greene, An Evaluation of the Cleveland Voucher Program after Two Years 6, Table 4 (June 1999) (hereinafter Peterson).  This is particularly impressive given that a Harvard University study found that the Hope Academy schools attracted the poorest and most educationally disadvantaged students.  J. Greene, W. Howell, P. Peterson, Lessons from the Cleveland Scholarship Program 22, 24 (Oct. 15, 1997).  Moreover, 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				s evaluation of the Hope Academy schools assumes that the only relevant measure of school quality is academic performance.  It is reasonable to suppose, however, that parents in the inner city also choose schools that provide discipline and a safe environment for their children.  On these dimensions some of the schools that 
				<span class="smallcaps">

				Ultimately, 
				<span class="smallcaps">

				relies on very narrow data to draw rather broad conclusions.  One year of poor test scores at four community schools targeted at the most challenged students from the inner city says little about the value of those schools, let alone the quality of the 6 other community schools and 24 magnet schools in Cleveland.

				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				s analysis is a desire for a limiting principle to rule out certain nonreligious schools as alternatives to religious schools in the voucher program.  See 
				<em>
					post, 
				</em>
				at 16, 1718, n. 9 (dissenting opinion).  But the goal of the Courts
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				Establishment Clause jurisprudence is to determine whether, after the Cleveland voucher program was enacted, parents were free to direct state educational aid in either a nonreligious or religious direction.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 14.  That inquiry requires an evaluation of all reasonable educational options Ohio provides the Cleveland school system, regardless of whether they are formally made available in the same section of the Ohio Code as the voucher program.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Based on the reasoning in the Courts opinion, which is consistent with the realities of the Cleveland educational system, I am persuaded that the Cleveland voucher program affords parents of eligible children genuine nonreligious options and is consistent with the Establishment Clause.

				The Court holds that Ohios Pilot Project Scholarship Program, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §§3313.9743313.979 (Anderson 1999 and Supp. 2000) (voucher program), survives respondents Establishment Clause challenge.  While I join the Courts opinion, I write separately for two reasons.  First, although the Court takes an important step, I do not believe that todays decision, when considered in light of other longstanding government programs that impact religious organizations and our prior Establishment Clause jurisprudence, marks a dramatic break from the past.  Second, given the emphasis the Court places on verifying that parents of voucher students in religious schools have exercised true private choice, I think it is worth elaborating on the Courts conclusion that this inquiry should consider all reasonable educational alternatives to religious schools that are available to parents.  To do otherwise is to ignore how the educational system in Cleveland actually functions.

				These cases are different from prior indirect aid cases in part because a significant portion of the funds appropriated for the voucher program reach religious schools without restrictions on the use of these funds.  The share of public resources that reach religious schools is not, however, as significant as respondents suggest.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, Brief for Respondents Simmons-Harris et al. 12.  Data from the 19992000 school year indicate that 82 percent of schools participating in the voucher program were religious and that 96 percent of participating students enrolled in religious schools, see App. in Nos. 003055, etc. (CA6), p. 1679 (46 of 56 private schools in the program are
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				religiously-affiliated; 3,637 of 3,765 voucher students attend religious private schools), but these data are incomplete.  These statistics do not take into account all of the reasonable educational choices that may be available to students in Cleveland public schools.  When one considers the option to attend community schools, the percentage of students enrolled in religious schools falls to 62.1 percent.  If magnet schools are included in the mix, this percentage falls to 16.5 percent.  See J. Greene, The Racial, Economic, and Religious Context of Parental Choice in Cleveland 11, Table 4 (Oct. 8, 1999), App. 217a (reporting 2,087 students in community schools and 16,184 students in magnet schools).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Even these numbers do not paint a complete picture.  The Cleveland program provides voucher applicants from low-income families with up to $2,250 in tuition assistance and provides the remaining applicants with up to $1,875 in tuition assistance.  §§3313.976(A)(8), 3313.978(A) and (C)(1).  In contrast, the State provides community schools $4,518 per pupil and magnet schools, on average, $7,097 per pupil.  Affidavit of Caroline M. Hoxby ¶¶4b, 4c, App. 56a.  Even if one assumes that all voucher students came from low-income families and that each voucher student used up the entire $2,250 voucher, at most $8.2 million of public funds flowed to religious schools under the voucher program in 19992000.  Although just over one-half as many students attended community schools as religious private schools on the state fisc, the State spent over $1 million more$9.4 millionon students in community schools than on students in religious private schools because per-pupil aid to community schools is more than double the per-pupil aid to private schools under the voucher program.  Moreover, the amount spent on religious private schools is minor compared to the $114.8 million the State spent on students in the Cleveland magnet schools.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Although $8.2 million is no small sum, it pales in comparison to the amount of funds that federal, state, and local governments already provide religious institutions.  Religious organizations may qualify for exemptions from the federal corporate income tax, see

In addition, the Federal Government provides individuals, corporations, trusts, and estates a tax deduction for charitable contributions to qualified religious groups.  See §§170, 642(c).  Finally, the Federal Government and certain state governments provide tax credits for educational expenses, many of which are spent on education at religious schools.  See,

As for the Federal Government, the tax deduction for charitable contributions reduces federal tax revenues by nearly $25 billion annually, see U. S.

				A significant portion of the funds appropriated for these programs reach religiously affiliated institutions, typically without restrictions on its subsequent use.  For example, it has been reported that religious hospitals, which account for 18 percent of all hospital beds nationwide, rely on Medicare funds for 36 percent of their revenue.  MergerWatch, New Study Details Public Funding of Religious Hospitals (Jan. 2002), http://www.mergerwatch.org/
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				inthenews/publicfunding.html.  Moreover, taking into account both Medicare and Medicaid, religious hospitals received nearly $45 billion from the federal fisc in 1998.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  Federal aid to religious schools is also substantial.  Although data for all States is not available, data from Minnesota, for example, suggest that a substantial share of Pell Grant and other federal funds for college tuition reach religious schools.  Roughly one-third or $27.1 million of the federal tuition dollars spent on students at schools in Minnesota were used at private 4-year colleges.  Minnesota Higher Education Services Office, Financial Aid Awarded, Fiscal Year 1999: Grants, Loans, and Student Earning from Institution Jobs (Jan. 24, 2001).  The vast majority of these funds$23.5 millionflowed to religiously affiliated institutions.

Courts are instructed to consider two factors: first, whether the program administers aid in a neutral fashion, without differentiation based on the religious status of beneficiaries or providers of services; second, and more importantly, whether beneficiaries of indirect aid have a genuine choice among religious and nonreligious organizations when determining the organization to which they will direct that aid.  If the answer to either query is no, the program should be struck down under the Establishment Clause.  See

				I do not agree that the nonreligious schools have failed to provide Cleveland parents reasonable alternatives to religious schools in the voucher program.  For nonreligious schools to qualify as genuine options for parents, they need not be superior to religious schools in every respect.  They need only be adequate substitutes for religious schools in the eyes of parents.  The District Court record demonstrates that nonreligious schools were able to compete effectively with Catholic and other religious schools in the Cleveland voucher program.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1415, n. 4.  The best evidence of this is that many parents with vouchers selected nonreligious private schools over religious alternatives and an even larger number of parents send their children to community and magnet schools rather than seeking vouchers at all.

				<span class="smallcaps">

				 ignores evidence which suggests that, at a national level, nonreligious private schools may target a market for different, if not higher, quality of education.

				In my view the more significant finding in these cases is that Cleveland parents who use vouchers to send their children to religious private schools do so as a result of true private choice.  The Court rejects, correctly, the notion that the high percentage of voucher recipients who enroll in religious private schools necessarily demonstrates that parents do not actually have the option to send their children to nonreligious schools.  
				<em>
					Ante, 
				</em>
				at 1419.  Likewise, the mere fact that some parents enrolled their children in religious schools associated with a different faith than their own, see 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Souter, J

Declaration of David P. Zanotti ¶¶5, 10, App. 225a, 227a.  Finally, as demonstrated above, the Cleveland program does not establish financial incentives to undertake a religious education.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I find the Courts answer to the question whether parents of students eligible for vouchers have a genuine choice between religious and nonreligious schools persuasive.  In looking at the voucher program, all the choices available to potential beneficiaries of the government program should be considered.  In these cases, parents who were eligible to apply for a voucher also had the option, at a minimum, to send their children to community schools.  Yet the Court of Appeals chose not to look at community schools, let alone magnet schools, when evaluating the Cleveland voucher program.  See 234 F. 3d, at 958.  That decision was incorrect.  Focusing in these cases only on the program challenged by respondents ignores how the educational system in Cleveland actually functions.  The record indicates that, in 1999, two nonreligious private schools that had previously served 15 percent of the students in the voucher program were prompted to convert to community schools because parents were concerned about the litigation surrounding the program, and because a new community schools program provided more per-pupil financial aid.  Many of the students that enrolled in the two schools under the voucher program transferred to the community schools program and continued to attend these schools.  See Affidavit of David L. Brennan ¶¶3, 10, App. 145a, 147a; Declaration of David P. Zanotti ¶¶410, 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 225a227a.  This incident provides strong evidence that both parents and nonreligious schools view the voucher program and the community schools program as reasonable alternatives.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Considering all the educational options available to parents whose children are eligible for vouchers, including community and magnet schools, the Court finds that parents in the Cleveland schools have an array of nonreligious options.  
				<em>
					Ante,

				 at 1314.  Not surprisingly, respondents present no evidence that any students who were candidates for a voucher were denied slots in a community school or a magnet school.

See 
				<em>

But a community school need not offer primary school classes to be an alternative to religious middle schools, and catering to impoverished or otherwise challenged students may make a school more attractive to certain inner-city parents.  Moreover, the one community school that was

				Of the six community schools that 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>

				<em>
					after
				</em>
				 the District Courts grant of summary judgment to respondents, according to report cards prepared by the Ohio Department of Education.  See 
				<em>
					post, 
				</em>
				at 1819, n. 10 (dissenting opinion).  (One, Old Brooklyn Montessori School, performed better than public schools.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.; see also Ohio Department of Education, 2001 Community School Report Card, Old Brooklyn Montessori School 5 (community school scored higher than public schools in four of five subjects in 19992000).)  These report cards underestimate the value of the four Hope Academy schools.  Before they entered the community school program, two of them participated in the voucher program.  Although they received far less state funding in that capacity, they had among the highest rates of parental satisfaction of all voucher schools, religious or nonreligious.  See P. Peterson, W. Howell, &amp; J. Greene, An Evaluation of the Cleveland Voucher Program after Two Years 6, Table 4 (June 1999) (hereinafter Peterson).  This is particularly impressive given that a Harvard University study found that the Hope Academy schools attracted the poorest and most educationally disadvantaged students.  J. Greene, W. Howell, P. Peterson, Lessons from the Cleveland Scholarship Program 22, 24 (Oct. 15, 1997).  Moreover, 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				s evaluation of the Hope Academy schools assumes that the only relevant measure of school quality is academic performance.  It is reasonable to suppose, however, that parents in the inner city also choose schools that provide discipline and a safe environment for their children.  On these dimensions some of the schools that 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				 derides have performed quite ably.  See  Peterson, Table 7.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Ultimately, 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter 
				</span>
				relies on very narrow data to draw rather broad conclusions.  One year of poor test scores at four community schools targeted at the most challenged students from the inner city says little about the value of those schools, let alone the quality of the 6 other community schools and 24 magnet schools in Cleveland.  
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				s use of statistics confirms the Courts wisdom in refusing to consider them when assessing the Cleveland programs constitutionality.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 17.  What appears to motivate 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				s analysis is a desire for a limiting principle to rule out certain nonreligious schools as alternatives to religious schools in the voucher program.  See 
				<em>
					post, 
				</em>
				at 16, 1718, n. 9 (dissenting opinion).  But the goal of the Courts
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				Establishment Clause jurisprudence is to determine whether, after the Cleveland voucher program was enacted, parents were free to direct state educational aid in either a nonreligious or religious direction.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 14.  That inquiry requires an evaluation of all reasonable educational options Ohio provides the Cleveland school system, regardless of whether they are formally made available in the same section of the Ohio Code as the voucher program.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Based on the reasoning in the Courts opinion, which is consistent with the realities of the Cleveland educational system, I am persuaded that the Cleveland voucher program affords parents of eligible children genuine nonreligious options and is consistent with the Establishment Clause.

				The Court holds that Ohios Pilot Project Scholarship Program, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §§3313.9743313.979 (Anderson 1999 and Supp. 2000) (voucher program), survives respondents Establishment Clause challenge.  While I join the Courts opinion, I write separately for two reasons.  First, although the Court takes an important step, I do not believe that todays decision, when considered in light of other longstanding government programs that impact religious organizations and our prior Establishment Clause jurisprudence, marks a dramatic break from the past.  Second, given the emphasis the Court places on verifying that parents of voucher students in religious schools have exercised true private choice, I think it is worth elaborating on the Courts conclusion that this inquiry should consider all reasonable educational alternatives to religious schools that are available to parents.  To do otherwise is to ignore how the educational system in Cleveland actually functions.

				These cases are different from prior indirect aid cases in part because a significant portion of the funds appropriated for the voucher program reach religious schools without restrictions on the use of these funds.  The share of public resources that reach religious schools is not, however, as significant as respondents suggest.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, Brief for Respondents Simmons-Harris et al. 12.  Data from the 19992000 school year indicate that 82 percent of schools participating in the voucher program were religious and that 96 percent of participating students enrolled in religious schools, see App. in Nos. 003055, etc. (CA6), p. 1679 (46 of 56 private schools in the program are
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				religiously-affiliated; 3,637 of 3,765 voucher students attend religious private schools), but these data are incomplete.  These statistics do not take into account all of the reasonable educational choices that may be available to students in Cleveland public schools.  When one considers the option to attend community schools, the percentage of students enrolled in religious schools falls to 62.1 percent.  If magnet schools are included in the mix, this percentage falls to 16.5 percent.  See J. Greene, The Racial, Economic, and Religious Context of Parental Choice in Cleveland 11, Table 4 (Oct. 8, 1999), App. 217a (reporting 2,087 students in community schools and 16,184 students in magnet schools).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Even these numbers do not paint a complete picture.  The Cleveland program provides voucher applicants from low-income families with up to $2,250 in tuition assistance and provides the remaining applicants with up to $1,875 in tuition assistance.  §§3313.976(A)(8), 3313.978(A) and (C)(1).  In contrast, the State provides community schools $4,518 per pupil and magnet schools, on average, $7,097 per pupil.  Affidavit of Caroline M. Hoxby ¶¶4b, 4c, App. 56a.  Even if one assumes that all voucher students came from low-income families and that each voucher student used up the entire $2,250 voucher, at most $8.2 million of public funds flowed to religious schools under the voucher program in 19992000.  Although just over one-half as many students attended community schools as religious private schools on the state fisc, the State spent over $1 million more$9.4 millionon students in community schools than on students in religious private schools because per-pupil aid to community schools is more than double the per-pupil aid to private schools under the voucher program.  Moreover, the amount spent on religious private schools is minor compared to the $114.8 million the State spent on students in the Cleveland magnet schools.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Although $8.2 million is no small sum, it pales in comparison to the amount of funds that federal, state, and local governments already provide religious institutions.  Religious organizations may qualify for exemptions from the federal corporate income tax, see

In addition, the Federal Government provides individuals, corporations, trusts, and estates a tax deduction for charitable contributions to qualified religious groups.  See §§170, 642(c).  Finally, the Federal Government and certain state governments provide tax credits for educational expenses, many of which are spent on education at religious schools.  See,

				A significant portion of the funds appropriated for these programs reach religiously affiliated institutions, typically without restrictions on its subsequent use.  For example, it has been reported that religious hospitals, which account for 18 percent of all hospital beds nationwide, rely on Medicare funds for 36 percent of their revenue.

Although data for all States is not available, data from Minnesota, for example, suggest that a substantial share of Pell Grant and other federal funds for college tuition reach religious schools.  Roughly one-third or $27.1 million of the federal tuition dollars spent on students at schools in Minnesota were used at private 4-year colleges.  Minnesota Higher Education Services Office, Financial Aid Awarded, Fiscal Year 1999: Grants, Loans, and Student Earning from Institution Jobs (Jan. 24, 2001).  The vast majority of these funds$23.5 millionflowed to religiously affiliated institutions.

Courts are instructed to consider two factors: first, whether the program administers aid in a neutral fashion, without differentiation based on the religious status of beneficiaries or providers of services; second, and more importantly, whether beneficiaries of indirect aid have a genuine choice among religious and nonreligious organizations when determining the organization to which they will direct that aid.  If the answer to either query is no, the program should be struck down under the Establishment Clause.  See

				I do not agree that the nonreligious schools have failed to provide Cleveland parents reasonable alternatives to religious schools in the voucher program.  For nonreligious schools to qualify as genuine options for parents, they need not be superior to religious schools in every respect.  They need only be adequate substitutes for religious schools in the eyes of parents.  The District Court record demonstrates that nonreligious schools were able to compete effectively with Catholic and other religious schools in the Cleveland voucher program.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 1415, n. 4.  The best evidence of this is that many parents with vouchers selected nonreligious private schools over religious alternatives and an even larger number of parents send their children to community and magnet schools rather than seeking vouchers at all.  
				<em>
					Supra
				</em>

				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				over, there is no record evidence that any voucher-eligible student was turned away from a nonreligious private school in the voucher program, let alone a community or magnet school.

				To support his hunch about the effect of the cap on tuition under the voucher program, 
				<span class="smallcaps">

				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				 ignores evidence which suggests that, at a national level, nonreligious private schools may target a market for different, if not higher, quality of education.  For example, nonreligious private schools are smaller, see U. S. Dept. of Ed., National Center for Education Statistics, Private Universe School Survey, 19971998, (Oct. 1999) (Table 60) (87 and 269 students per private nonreligious and Catholic elementary school, re-

				<em>
					ibid
				</em>
				. (9.4 and
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				18.8 students per teacher at private nonreligious and Catholic elementary schools, respectively); have more highly educated teachers, see U. S. Dept. of Ed., National Center for Education Statistics, Private Schools in the United States: A Statistical Profile, 19931994, (NCES 97459, July 1997) (Table 3.4) (37.9 percent of non-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>

				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				of Catholic school teachers have Masters degrees); and have principals with longer job tenure than Catholic schools, see

				Additionally, 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter

				s theory that the Cleveland voucher programs cap on the tuition encourages low-income student to attend religious schools ignores that these students receive nearly double the amount of tuition assistance under the community schools program than under the voucher program and that none of the community schools is religious.

				In my view the more significant finding in these cases is that Cleveland parents who use vouchers to send their children to religious private schools do so as a result of true private choice.  The Court rejects, correctly, the notion that the high percentage of voucher recipients who enroll in religious private schools necessarily demonstrates that parents do not actually have the option to send their children to nonreligious schools.  
				<em>
					Ante, 
				</em>
				at 1419.  Likewise, the mere fact that some parents enrolled their children in religious schools associated with a different faith than their own, see 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Souter, J
				</span>
				., dissenting), at 2021, says little about whether these parents had reasonable nonreligious options.  Indeed, no voucher student has been known to be turned away from a nonreligious private school participating in the voucher program.  
				<em>

				, at 10.  This is impressive given evidence in the record that the present litigation has discouraged the entry of some nonreligious private schools into the voucher program.  Declaration of David P. Zanotti ¶¶5, 10, App. 225a, 227a.  Finally, as demonstrated above, the Cleveland program does not establish financial incentives to undertake a religious education.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I find the Courts answer to the question whether parents of students eligible for vouchers have a genuine choice between religious and nonreligious schools persuasive.  In looking at the voucher program, all the choices available to potential beneficiaries of the government program should be considered.  In these cases, parents who were eligible to apply for a voucher also had the option, at a minimum, to send their children to community schools.  Yet the Court of Appeals chose not to look at community schools, let alone magnet schools, when evaluating the Cleveland voucher program.  See 234 F. 3d, at 958.  That decision was incorrect.  Focusing in these cases only on the program challenged by respondents ignores how the educational system in Cleveland actually functions.  The record indicates that, in 1999, two nonreligious private schools that had previously served 15 percent of the students in the voucher program were prompted to convert to community schools because parents were concerned about the litigation surrounding the program, and because a new community schools program provided more per-pupil financial aid.  Many of the students that enrolled in the two schools under the voucher program transferred to the community schools program and continued to attend these schools.  See Affidavit of David L. Brennan ¶¶3, 10, App. 145a, 147a; Declaration of David P. Zanotti ¶¶410, 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 225a227a.  This incident provides strong evidence that both parents and nonreligious schools view the voucher program and the community schools program as reasonable alternatives.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Considering all the educational options available to parents whose children are eligible for vouchers, including community and magnet schools, the Court finds that parents in the Cleveland schools have an array of nonreligious options.  
				<em>
					Ante,
				</em>
				 at 1314.  Not surprisingly, respondents present no evidence that any students who were candidates for a voucher were denied slots in a community school or a magnet school.

				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter

				rejects the three other community schools (Horizon Science Academy, Cleveland Alternative Learning, and International Preparatory School) because they did not offer primary school classes, were targeted towards poor students or students with disciplinary or academic problems, or were not in operation for a year.  See 
				<em>
					post, 
				</em>
				at 1819, n. 10.  But a community school need not offer primary school classes to be an alternative to religious middle schools, and catering to impoverished or otherwise challenged students may make a school more attractive to certain inner-city parents.  Moreover, the one community school that was
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				closed in 19992000 was merely looking for a new loca-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>

				<span class="softbreak"></span>

				Of the six community schools that 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				 admits as alternatives to the voucher program in 19992000, he notes that four (the Broadway, Cathedral, Chapelside, and Lincoln Park campuses of the Hope Academy) reported lower test scores than public schools during the school year 
				<em>
					after
				</em>
				 the District Courts grant of summary judgment to respondents, according to report cards prepared by the Ohio Department of Education.  See 
				<em>
					post, 
				</em>
				at 1819, n. 10 (dissenting opinion).  (One, Old Brooklyn Montessori School, performed better than public schools.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.; see also Ohio Department of Education, 2001 Community School Report Card, Old Brooklyn Montessori School 5 (community school scored higher than public schools in four of five subjects in 19992000).)  These report cards underestimate the value of the four Hope Academy schools.  Before they entered the community school program, two of them participated in the voucher program.  Although they received far less state funding in that capacity, they had among the highest rates of parental satisfaction of all voucher schools, religious or nonreligious.  See P. Peterson, W. Howell, &amp; J. Greene, An Evaluation of the Cleveland Voucher Program after Two Years 6, Table 4 (June 1999) (hereinafter Peterson).  This is particularly impressive given that a Harvard University study found that the Hope Academy schools attracted the poorest and most educationally disadvantaged students.  J. Greene, W. Howell, P. Peterson, Lessons from the Cleveland Scholarship Program 22, 24 (Oct. 15, 1997).  Moreover, 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				s evaluation of the Hope Academy schools assumes that the only relevant measure of school quality is academic performance.  It is reasonable to suppose, however, that parents in the inner city also choose schools that provide discipline and a safe environment for their children.  On these dimensions some of the schools that 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				 derides have performed quite ably.  See  Peterson, Table 7.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Ultimately, 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter 
				</span>
				relies on very narrow data to draw rather broad conclusions.  One year of poor test scores at four community schools targeted at the most challenged students from the inner city says little about the value of those schools, let alone the quality of the 6 other community schools and 24 magnet schools in Cleveland.  
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				s use of statistics confirms the Courts wisdom in refusing to consider them when assessing the Cleveland programs constitutionality.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 17.  What appears to motivate 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Souter
				</span>
				s analysis is a desire for a limiting principle to rule out certain nonreligious schools as alternatives to religious schools in the voucher program.  See 
				<em>
					post, 
				</em>
				at 16, 1718, n. 9 (dissenting opinion).  But the goal of the Courts
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				Establishment Clause jurisprudence is to determine whether, after the Cleveland voucher program was enacted, parents were free to direct state educational aid in either a nonreligious or religious direction.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 14.  That inquiry requires an evaluation of all reasonable educational options Ohio provides the Cleveland school system, regardless of whether they are formally made available in the same section of the Ohio Code as the voucher program.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Based on the reasoning in the Courts opinion, which is consistent with the realities of the Cleveland educational system, I am persuaded that the Cleveland voucher program affords parents of eligible children genuine nonreligious options and is consistent with the Establishment Clause.

				First, the severe educational crisis that confronted the Cleveland City School District when Ohio enacted its voucher program is not a matter that should affect our appraisal of its constitutionality.

				First, the severe educational crisis that confronted the Cleveland City School District when Ohio enacted its voucher program is not a matter that should affect our appraisal of its constitutionality.  In the 19992000 school year, that program provided relief to less than five percent of the students enrolled in the districts schools.  The solution to the disastrous conditions that prevented over 90 percent of the student body from meeting basic proficiency standards obviously required massive improvements unrelated to the voucher program.

				Second, the wide range of choices that have been made available to students 
				<em>

				 has no bearing on the question whether the State may pay the tuition for students who wish to reject public education entirely and attend private schools that will provide them with a sectarian education.  The fact that the vast majority of the voucher recipients who have entirely rejected public education receive religious indoctrination at state expense does, however, support the claim that the law is one respecting an establishment of religion.  The State may choose to divide up its public schools into a dozen different options and label them magnet schools, community schools, or whatever else it decides to call them, but the State is still required to provide a public education and it is the States decision to fund private school education over and above its traditional obligation that is at issue in these cases.

				Second, the wide range of choices that have been made available to students 
				<em>
					within the public school system
				</em>
				 has no bearing on the question whether the State may pay the tuition for students who wish to reject public education entirely and attend private schools that will provide them with a sectarian education.  The fact that the vast majority of the voucher recipients who have entirely rejected public education receive religious indoctrination at state expense does, however, support the claim that the law is one respecting an establishment of religion.  The State may choose to divide up its public schools into a dozen different options and label them magnet schools, community schools, or whatever else it decides to call them, but the State is still required to provide a public education and it is the States decision to fund private school education over and above its traditional obligation that is at issue in these cases.

				Third, the voluntary character of the private choice to prefer a parochial education over an education in the public school system seems to me quite irrelevant to the question whether the governments choice to pay for religious indoctrination is constitutionally permissible.  Today, however, the Court seems to have decided that the mere fact that a family that cannot afford a private education wants its children educated in a parochial school is a sufficient justification for this use of public funds.

				For the reasons stated by

				, I am convinced that the Courts decision is profoundly misguided.  Admittedly, in reaching that conclusion I have been influenced by my understanding of the impact of religious strife on the decisions of our forbears to migrate to this continent, and on the decisions of neighbors in the Balkans, Northern Ireland, and the Middle East to mistrust one another.  Whenever we remove a brick from the wall that was designed to separate religion and government, we increase the risk of religious strife and weaken the foundation of our democracy.

						 Ohio is currently undergoing a major overhaul of its public school financing pursuant to an order of the Ohio Supreme Court in DeRolph v. State, 93 Ohio St. 3d 309, 754 N. E. 2d 1184 (2001).  The Court ought, at least, to allow that reform effort and the districts experimenta-tion with alternative public schools to take effect before relying on Clevelands educational crisis as a reason for state financed religious education.

						 The Court suggests that an education at one of the districts community or magnet schools is provided largely at state expense.  Ante, at 19, n. 6.  But a public education at either of these schools is provided entirely at State expenseas the State is required to do.

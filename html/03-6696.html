				At this difficult time in our Nations history, we are called upon to consider the legality of the Governments detention of a United States citizen on United States soil as an enemy combatant and to address the process that is constitutionally owed to one who seeks to challenge his classification as such.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that petitioners detention was legally authorized and that he was entitled to no further opportunity to challenge his enemy-combatant label.  We now vacate and remand.  We hold that although Congress authorized the detention of combatants in the narrow circumstances alleged here, due process demands that a citizen held in the United States as an enemy combatant be given a meaningful opportunity to contest the factual basis for that detention before a neutral decisionmaker.

				On September 11, 2001, the al Qaeda terrorist network used hijacked commercial airliners to attack prominent targets in the United States.  Approximately 3,000 people were killed in those attacks.  One week later, in response to these acts of treacherous violence, Congress passed a resolution authorizing the President to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks or harbored such organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons.  Authorization for Use of Military Force (the AUMF),

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				This case arises out of the detention of a man whom the Government alleges took up arms with the Taliban during this conflict.  His name is Yaser Esam Hamdi.  Born an American citizen in Louisiana in 1980, Hamdi moved with his family to Saudi Arabia as a child.  By 2001, the parties agree, he resided in Afghanistan.  At some point that year, he was seized by members of the Northern Alliance, a coalition of military groups opposed to the Taliban government, and eventually was turned over to the United States military.  The Government asserts that it initially detained and interrogated Hamdi in Afghanistan before transferring him to the United States Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay in January 2002.  In April 2002, upon learning that Hamdi is an American citizen, authorities transferred him to a naval brig in Norfolk, Virginia, where he remained until a recent transfer to a brig in Charleston, South Carolina.  The Government contends that Hamdi is an enemy combatant, and that this status justifies holding him in the United States indefinitelywithout formal charges or proceedingsunless and until it makes the determination that access to counsel or further process is warranted.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In June 2002, Hamdis father, Esam Fouad Hamdi, filed the present petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2241.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2241</a> in the Eastern District of Virginia, naming as petitioners his son and himself as next friend.  The elder Hamdi alleges in the petition that he has had no contact with his son since the Government took custody of him in 2001, and that the Government has held his son without access to legal counsel or notice of any charges pending against him.  App. 103, 104.  The petition contends that Hamdis detention was not legally authorized.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 105.  It argues that, [a]s an American citizen, … Hamdi enjoys the full protections of the Constitution, and that Hamdis detention in the United States without charges, access to an impartial tribunal, or assistance of counsel violated and continue[s] to violate the Fifth and 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>s to the United States Constitution.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 107.  The habeas petition asks that the court, among other things, (1) appoint counsel for Hamdi; (2) order respondents to cease interrogating him; (3) declare that he is being held in violation of the Fifth and 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>s; (4) [t]o the extent Respondents contest any material factual allegations in this Petition, schedule an evidentiary hearing, at which Petitioners may adduce proof in support of their allegations; and (5) order that Hamdi be released from his unlawful custody.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 108109.  Although his habeas petition provides no details with regard to the factual circumstances surrounding his sons capture and detention, Hamdis father has asserted in documents found elsewhere in the record that his son went to Afghanistan to do relief work, and that he had been in that country less than two months before September 11, 2001, and could not have received military training.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 188189.  The 20-year-old was traveling on his own for the first time, his father says, and [b]ecause of his lack of experience, he was trapped in Afghanistan once that military campaign began.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 188189.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The District Court found that Hamdis father was a proper next friend, appointed the federal public defender as counsel for the petitioners, and ordered that counsel be given access to Hamdi.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 113116.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed that order, holding that the District Court had failed to extend appropriate deference to the Governments security and intelligence interests.  296 F. 3d 278, 279, 283 (2002).  It directed the District Court to consider the most cautious procedures first, 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 284, and to conduct a deferential inquiry into Hamdis status, 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 283.  It opined that if Hamdi is indeed an enemy combatant who was captured during hostilities in Afghanistan, the governments present detention of him is a lawful one.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				On remand, the Government filed a response and a motion to dismiss the petition.  It attached to its response a declaration from one Michael Mobbs (hereinafter Mobbs Declaration), who identified himself as Special Advisor to the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy.  Mobbs indicated that in this position, he has been substantially involved with matters related to the detention of enemy combatants in the current war against the al Qaeda terrorists and those who support and harbor them (including the Taliban).  App. 148.  He expressed his familiar[ity] with Department of Defense and United States military policies and procedures applicable to the detention, control, and transfer of al Qaeda and Taliban personnel, and declared that [b]ased upon my review of relevant records and reports, I am also familiar with the facts and circumstances related to the capture of … Hamdi and his detention by U. S. military forces.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Mobbs then set forth what remains the sole evidentiary support that the Government has provided to the courts for Hamdis detention.  The declaration states that Hamdi traveled to Afghanistan in July or August 2001, and that he thereafter affiliated with a Taliban military unit and received weapons training.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  It asserts that Hamdi remained with his Taliban unit following the attacks of September 11 and that, during the time when Northern Alliance forces were engaged in battle with the Taliban, Hamdis Taliban unit surrendered to those forces, after which he surrender[ed] his Kalishnikov assault rifle to them.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 148149.  The Mobbs Declaration also states that, because al Qaeda and the Taliban were and are hostile forces engaged in armed conflict with the armed forces of the United States, individuals associated with those groups were and continue to be enemy combatants.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 149.  Mobbs states that Hamdi was labeled an enemy combatant [b]ased upon his interviews and in light of his association with the Taliban.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  According to the declaration, a series of U. S. military screening team[s] determined that Hamdi met the criteria for enemy combatants, and a subsequent interview of Hamdi has confirmed that he surrendered and gave his firearm to Northern Alliance forces, which supports his classification as an enemy combatant.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 149150.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				After the Government submitted this declaration, the Fourth Circuit directed the District Court to proceed in accordance with its earlier ruling and, specifically, to  consider the sufficiency of the Mobbs Declaration as an independent matter before proceeding further.   316 F. 3d at 450, 462 (2003)
				.  
				The District Court found that the Mobbs Declaration fell far short of supporting Hamdis detention.  App. 292.  It criticized the generic and hearsay nature of the affidavit, calling it little more than the governments say-so.   
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 298.  It ordered the Government to turn over numerous materials for 
				<em>
					in camera 
				</em>
				review, including copies of all of Hamdis statements and the notes taken from interviews with him that related to his reasons for going to Afghanistan and his activities therein; a list of all interrogators who had questioned Hamdi and their names and addresses; statements by members of the Northern Alliance regarding Hamdis surrender and capture; a list of the dates and locations of his capture and subsequent detentions; and the names and titles of the United States Government officials who made the determinations that Hamdi was an enemy combatant and that he should be moved to a naval brig.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 185186.  The court indicated that all of these materials were necessary for meaningful judicial review of whether Hamdis detention was legally authorized and whether Hamdi had received sufficient process to satisfy the Due Process Clause of the Constitution and relevant treaties or military regulations.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 291292.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Government sought to appeal the production order, and the District Court certified the question of whether the Mobbs Declaration,  standing alone, is sufficient as a matter of law to allow meaningful judicial review of [Hamdis] classification as an enemy combatant.  316 F. 3d, at 462.  The Fourth Circuit reversed, but did not squarely answer the certified question.  It instead stressed that, because it was undisputed that Hamdi was captured in a zone of active combat in a foreign theater of conflict, no factual inquiry or evidentiary hearing allowing Hamdi to be heard or to rebut the Governments assertions was necessary or proper.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 459.  Concluding that the factual averments in the Mobbs Declaration, if accurate, provided a sufficient basis upon which to conclude that the President had constitutionally detained Hamdi pursuant to the Presidents war powers, it ordered the habeas petition dismissed.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 473.  The Fourth Circuit emphasized that the vital purposes of the detention of uncharged enemy combatantspreventing those combatants from rejoining the enemy while relieving the military of the burden of litigating the circumstances of wartime captures halfway around the globewere interests directly derived from the war powers of Articles I and II.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 465466.  In that courts view, because Article III contains nothing analogous to the specific powers of war so carefully enumerated in Articles I and II, 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 463, separation of powers principles prohibited a federal court from delv[ing] further into Hamdis status and capture,  
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 473.  Accordingly, the District Courts more vigorous inquiry went far beyond the acceptable scope of review.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				On the more global question of whether legal authorization exists for the detention of citizen enemy combatants at all, the Fourth Circuit rejected Hamdis arguments that 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/4001.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. §4001(a)</a> and Article 5 of the Geneva Convention rendered any such detentions unlawful.  The court expressed doubt as to Hamdis argument that §4001(a), which provides that [n]o citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained by the United States except pursuant to an Act of Congress, required express congressional authorization of detentions of this sort.  But it held that, in any event, such authorization was found in the post-September 11 Authorization for Use of Military Force.  316 F. 3d, at 467.  Because capturing and detaining enemy combatants is an inherent part of warfare, the court held, the necessary and appropriate force referenced in the congressional resolution necessarily includes the capture and detention of any and all hostile forces arrayed against our troops.  
				<em>

				<em>
;

				 see also
				<em>

				, at 467468 (noting that Congress, in 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/956.html#5" class="subref" title="subref">10 U. S. C. §956(5)</a>, had specifically authorized the expenditure of funds for keeping prisoners of war and persons whose status was determined to be similar to prisoners of war, and concluding that this appropriation measure also demonstrated that Congress had authorized [these individuals] detention in the first instance).  The court likewise rejected Hamdis Geneva Convention claim, concluding that the convention is not self-executing and that, even if it were, it would not preclude the Executive from detaining Hamdi until the cessation of hostilities.  316 F. 3d, at 468469.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Finally, the Fourth Circuit rejected Hamdis contention that its legal analyses with regard to the authorization for the detention scheme and the process to which he was constitutionally entitled should be altered by the fact that he is an American citizen detained on American soil.  Relying on

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/317/1" class="subref" title="subref">317 U. S. 1</a> (1942)
, the court emphasized that [o]ne who takes up arms against the United States in a foreign theater of war, regardless of his citizenship, may properly be designated an enemy combatant and treated as such.  316 F.3d, at 475.  The privilege of citizenship, the court held, entitles Hamdi to a limited judicial inquiry into his detention, but only to determine its legality under the war powers of the political branches.  At least where it is undisputed that he was present in a zone of active combat operations, we are satisfied that the Constitution does not entitle him to a searching review of the factual determinations underlying his seizure there.

				The Fourth Circuit denied rehearing en banc, 337 F. 3d 335 (2003), and we granted certiorari.  540 U. S. __ (2004).  We now vacate the judgment below and remand.
			</p>
        <p class="opcentered">
				II
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				The threshold question before us is whether the Executive has the authority to detain citizens who qualify as enemy combatants.  There is some debate as to the proper scope of this term, and the Government has never provided any court with the full criteria that it uses in classifying individuals as such.  It has made clear, however, that, for purposes of this case, the enemy combatant that it is seeking to detain is an individual who, it alleges, was  part of or supporting forces hostile to the United States or coalition partners  in Afghanistan and who  engaged in an armed conflict against the United States  there.  Brief for Respondents 3.  We therefore answer only the narrow question before us: whether the detention of citizens falling within that definition is authorized.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The Government maintains that no explicit congressional authorization is required, because the Executive possesses plenary authority to detain pursuant to Article II of the Constitution.  We do not reach the question whether Article II provides such authority, however, because we agree with the Governments alternative position, that Congress has in fact authorized Hamdis detention, through the AUMF.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Our analysis on that point, set forth below, substantially overlaps with our analysis of Hamdis principal argument for the illegality of his detention.  He posits that his detention is forbidden by 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/4001.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. §4001(a)</a>.  Section 4001(a) states that [n]o citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained by the United States except pursuant to an Act of Congress.  Congress passed §4001(a) in 1971 as part of a bill to repeal the Emergency Detention Act of 1950, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/50/811.html" class="subref" title="subref">50 U. S. C. §811</a>
            <em>
					et seq
				</em>
				., which provided procedures for executive detention, during times of emergency, of individuals deemed likely to engage in espionage or sabotage.  Congress was particularly concerned about the possibility that the Act could be used to reprise the Japanese internment camps of World War II.  H. R. Rep. No. 92116 (1971); 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 4 (The concentration camp implications of the legislation render it abhorrent).
				    
				The Government again presses two alternative positions.  First, it argues that §4001(a), in light of its legislative history and its location in Title 18, applies only to the control of civilian prisons and related detentions, not to military detentions.  Brief for Respondents 21.  Second, it maintains that §4001(a) is satisfied, because Hamdi is being detained pursuant to an Act of Congressthe AUMF.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 2122.  Again, because we conclude that the Governments second assertion is correct, we do not address the first.  In other words, for the reasons that follow, we conclude that the AUMF is explicit congressional authorization for the detention of individuals in the narrow category we describe (assuming, without deciding, that such authorization is required), and that the AUMF satisfied §4001(a)s requirement that a detention be pursuant to an Act of Congress (assuming, without deciding, that §4001(a) applies to military detentions).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The AUMF authorizes the President to use all necessary and appropriate force against nations, organizations, or persons associated with the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.  
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">115</a>Stat.
224.  There can be no doubt that individuals who fought against the United States in Afghanistan as part of the Taliban, an organization known to have supported the al Qaeda terrorist network responsible for those attacks, are individuals Congress sought to target in passing the AUMF.  We conclude that detention of individuals falling into the limited category we are considering, for the duration of the particular conflict in which they were captured, is so fundamental and accepted an incident to war as to be an exercise of the necessary and appropriate force Congress has authorized the President to use.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The capture and detention of lawful combatants and the capture, detention, and trial of unlawful combatants, by universal agreement and practice, are important incident[s] of war.

				 317 U. S., at 28.  The purpose of detention is to prevent captured individuals from returning to the field of battle and taking up arms once again.  Naqvi, Doubtful Prisoner-of-War Status, 84 Intl Rev. Red Cross 571, 572 (2002) ([C]aptivity in war is neither revenge, nor punishment, but solely protective custody, the only purpose of which is to prevent the prisoners of war from further participation in the war  (quoting decision of Nuremberg Military Tribunal, reprinted in 41 Am.

				There is no bar to this Nations holding one of its own citizens as an enemy combatant.  In

				, one of the detainees, Haupt, alleged that he was a naturalized United States citizen.  317 U. S., at 20.

				</em>
				 at 3738.   While Haupt was tried for violations of the law of war, nothing in

Order No. 100 (1863), reprinted in 2 Lieber, Miscellaneous Writings, p. 273 (contemplating, in code binding the Union Army during the Civil War, that captured rebels would be treated as prisoners of war).  Nor can we see any reason for drawing such a line here.  A citizen, no less than an alien, can be part of or supporting forces hostile to the United States or coalition partners and engaged in an armed conflict against the United States, Brief for Respondents 3; such a citizen, if released, would pose the same threat of returning to the front during the ongoing conflict.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In light of these principles, it is of no moment that the AUMF does not use specific language of detention.  Because detention to prevent a combatants return to the battlefield is a fundamental incident of waging war, in permitting the use of necessary and appropriate force, Congress has clearly and unmistakably authorized detention in the narrow circumstances considered here.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Hamdi objects, nevertheless, that Congress has not authorized the 
				<em>
					indefinite
				</em>
				 detention to which he is now subject.  The Government responds that the detention of enemy combatants during World War II was just as indefinite while that war was being fought.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 16.  We take Hamdis objection to be not to the lack of certainty regarding the date on which the conflict will end, but to the substantial prospect of perpetual detention.  We recognize that the national security underpinnings of the war on terror, although crucially important, are broad and malleable.  As the Government concedes, given its unconventional nature, the current conflict is unlikely to end with a formal cease-fire agreement.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  The prospect Hamdi raises is therefore not far-fetched.  If the Government does not consider this unconventional war won for two generations, and if it maintains during that time that Hamdi might, if released, rejoin forces fighting against the United States, then the position it has taken throughout the litigation of this case suggests that Hamdis detention could last for the rest of his life.

				It is a clearly established principle of the law of war that detention may last no longer than active hostilities.

				Hamdi contends that the AUMF does not authorize indefinite or perpetual detention.  Certainly, we agree that indefinite detention for the purpose of interrogation is not authorized.  Further, we understand Congress grant of authority for the use of necessary and appropriate force to include the authority to detain for the duration of the relevant conflict, and our understanding is based on longstanding law-of-war principles.  If the practical circumstances of a given conflict are entirely unlike those of the conflicts that informed the development of the law of war, that understanding may unravel.  But that is not the situation we face as of this date.  Active combat operations against Taliban fighters apparently are ongoing in Afghanistan.  See,

The United States may detain, for the duration of these hostilities, individuals legitimately determined to be Taliban combatants who engaged in an armed conflict against the United States.  If the record establishes that United States troops are still involved in active combat in Afghanistan, those detentions are part of the exercise of necessary and appropriate force, and therefore are authorized by the AUMF.

He does not explain how his historical analysis supports the addition of a third optiondetention under some other process after concession of enemy-combatant statusor why a concession should carry any different effect than proof of enemy-combatant status in a proceeding that comports with due process.  To be clear, our opinion only finds legislative authority to detain under the AUMF once it is sufficiently clear that the individual is, in fact, an enemy combatant; whether that is established by concession or by some other process that verifies this fact with sufficient certainty seems beside the point.

Military authorities faced with the stark choice of submitting to the full-blown criminal process or releasing a suspected enemy combatant captured on the battlefield will simply keep citizen-detainees abroad.  Indeed, the Government transferred Hamdi from Guantanamo Bay to the United States naval brig only after it learned that he might be an American citizen.  It is not at all clear why that should make a determinative constitutional difference.

				Even in cases in which the detention of enemy combatants is legally authorized, there remains the question of what process is constitutionally due to a citizen who disputes his enemy-combatant status.  Hamdi argues that he is owed a meaningful and timely hearing and that extra-judicial detention [that] begins and ends with the submission of an affidavit based on third-hand hearsay does not comport with the Fifth and 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>s.  Brief for Petitioners 16.  The Government counters that any more process than was provided below would be both unworkable and constitutionally intolerable.  Brief for Respondents 46.  Our resolution of this dispute requires a careful examination both of the writ of habeas corpus, which Hamdi now seeks to employ as a mechanism of judicial review, and of the Due Process Clause, which informs the procedural contours of that mechanism in this instance.

				Though they reach radically different conclusions on the process that ought to attend the present proceeding, the parties begin on common ground.  All agree that, absent suspension, the writ of habeas corpus remains available to every individual detained within the United States.  U. S. Const., Art. I, §9, cl. 2 (The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it).  Only in the rarest of circumstances has Congress seen fit to suspend the writ.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, Act of Mar. 3, 1863, ch. 81, §1, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">12</a>Stat.
755; Act of April 20, 1871, ch. 22, §4, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">17</a>Stat.
14.  At all other times, it has remained a critical check on the Executive, ensuring that it does not detain individuals except in accordance with law.  See
				<em>
					 INS
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					St. Cyr, 
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/533/289" class="subref" title="subref">533 U. S. 289</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">301</a> (2001)
.  All agree suspension of the writ has not occurred here.  Thus, it is undisputed that Hamdi was properly before an Article III court to challenge his detention under 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2241.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2241</a>.  Brief for Respondents 12.  Further, all agree that §2241 and its companion provisions provide at least a skeletal outline of the procedures to be afforded a petitioner in federal habeas review.  Most notably, §2243 provides that the person detained may, under oath, deny any of the facts set forth in the return or allege any other material facts, and §2246 allows the taking of evidence in habeas proceedings by deposition, affidavit, or interrogatories.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The simple outline of §2241 makes clear both that Congress envisioned that habeas petitioners would have some opportunity to present and rebut facts and that courts in cases like this retain some ability to vary the ways in which they do so as mandated by due process.  The Government recognizes the basic procedural protections required by the habeas statute, 
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 3738, but asks us to hold that, given both the flexibility of the habeas mechanism and the circumstances presented in this case, the presentation of the Mobbs Declaration to the habeas court completed the required factual development.  It suggests two separate reasons for its position that no further process is due.
			</p>
        <p class="opcentered">
				B
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				First, the Government urges the adoption of the Fourth Circuits holding belowthat because it is undisputed that Hamdis seizure took place in a combat zone, the habeas determination can be made purely as a matter of law, with no further hearing or factfinding necessary.  This argument is easily rejected.  As the dissenters from the denial of rehearing en banc noted, the circumstances surrounding Hamdis seizure cannot in any way be characterized as undisputed, as those circumstances are neither conceded in fact, nor susceptible to concession in law, because Hamdi has not been permitted to speak for himself or even through counsel as to those circumstances.  337 F. 3d 335, 357 (CA4 2003) (Luttig, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc); see also
				<em>
					 id
				</em>
				., at 371372 (Motz, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).  Further, the facts that constitute the alleged concession are insufficient to support Hamdis detention.  Under the definition of enemy combatant that we accept today as falling within the scope of Congress authorization, Hamdi would need to be part of or supporting forces hostile to the United States or coalition partners and engaged in an armed conflict against the United States to justify his detention in the United States for the duration of the relevant conflict.  Brief for Respondents 3.  The habeas petition states only that [w]hen seized by the United States Government, Mr. Hamdi resided in Afghanistan.  App. 104.  An assertion that one 
				<em>
					resided
				</em>
				 in a country in which combat operations are taking place is not a concession that one was 
				<em>
					captured
				</em>
				 in a zone of active combat operations in a foreign theater of war, 316 F. 3d, at 459 (emphasis added), and certainly is not a concession that one was part of or supporting forces hostile to the United States or coalition partners and engaged in an armed conflict against the United States.  Accordingly, we reject any argument that Hamdi has made concessions that eliminate any right to further process.

        <p class="opcentered">
				C
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				The Governments second argument requires closer consideration.  This is the argument that further factual exploration is unwarranted and inappropriate in light of the extraordinary constitutional interests at stake.  Under the Governments most extreme rendition of this argument, [r]espect for separation of powers and the limited institutional capabilities of courts in matters of military decision-making in connection with an ongoing conflict ought to eliminate entirely any individual process, restricting the courts to investigating only whether legal authorization exists for the broader detention scheme.  Brief for Respondents 26.  At most, the Government argues, courts should review its determination that a citizen is an enemy combatant under a very deferential some evidence standard.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 34 (Under the some evidence standard, the focus is exclusively on the factual basis supplied by the Executive to support its own determination (citing

<em>
					 
				</em>
				(explaining that the some evidence standard does not require a weighing of the evidence, but rather calls for assessing whether there is any evidence in the record that could support the conclusion)).  Under this review, a court would assume the accuracy of the Governments articulated basis for Hamdis detention, as set forth in the Mobbs Declaration, and assess only whether that articulated basis was a legitimate one.  Brief for Respondents 36; see also
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				316 F. 3d, at 473474 (declining to address whether the some evidence standard should govern the adjudication of such claims, but noting that [t]he factual averments in the [Mobbs] affidavit, if accurate, are sufficient to confirm the legality of Hamdis detention).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In response, Hamdi emphasizes that this Court consistently has recognized that an individual challenging his detention may not be held at the will of the Executive without recourse to some proceeding before a neutral tribunal to determine whether the Executives asserted justifications for that detention have basis in fact and warrant in law.  See,

.  He argues that the Fourth Circuit inappropriately ceded power to the Executive during wartime to define the conduct for which a citizen may be detained, judge whether that citizen has engaged in the proscribed conduct, and imprison that citizen indefinitely, Brief for Petitioners 21, and that due process demands that he receive a hearing in which he may challenge the Mobbs Declaration and adduce his own counter evidence.  The District Court, agreeing with Hamdi, apparently believed that the appropriate process would approach the process that accompanies a criminal trial.  It therefore disapproved of the hearsay nature of the Mobbs Declaration and anticipated quite extensive discovery of various military affairs.  Anything less, it concluded, would not be meaningful judicial review.  App. 291.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Both of these positions highlight legitimate concerns.  And both emphasize the tension that often exists between the autonomy that the Government asserts is necessary in order to pursue effectively a particular goal and the process that a citizen contends he is due before he is deprived of a constitutional right.  The ordinary mechanism that we use for balancing such serious competing interests, and for determining the procedures that are necessary to ensure that a citizen is not deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law, U.

				The Government also argues at some length that its interests in reducing the process available to alleged enemy combatants are heightened by the practical difficulties that would accompany a system of trial-like process.  In its view, military officers who are engaged in the serious work of waging battle would be unnecessarily and dangerously distracted by litigation half a world away, and discovery into military operations would both intrude on the sensitive secrets of national defense and result in a futile search for evidence buried under the rubble of war.

				Striking the proper constitutional balance here is of great importance to the Nation during this period of ongoing combat.  But it is equally vital that our calculus not give short shrift to the values that this country holds dear or to the privilege that is American citizenship.

				With due recognition of these competing concerns, we believe that neither the process proposed by the Government nor the process apparently envisioned by the District Court below strikes the proper constitutional balance when a United States citizen is detained in the United States as an enemy combatant.  That is, the risk of erroneous deprivation of a detainees liberty interest is unacceptably high under the Governments proposed rule, while some of the additional or substitute procedural safeguards suggested by the District Court are unwarranted in light of their limited probable value and the burdens they may impose on the military in such cases.

				At the same time, the exigencies of the circumstances may demand that, aside from these core elements, enemy combatant proceedings may be tailored to alleviate their uncommon potential to burden the Executive at a time of ongoing military conflict.  Hearsay, for example, may need to be accepted as the most reliable available evidence from the Government in such a proceeding.  Likewise, the Constitution would not be offended by a presumption in favor of the Governments evidence, so long as that presumption remained a rebuttable one and fair opportunity for rebuttal were provided.  Thus, once the Government puts forth credible evidence that the habeas petitioner meets the enemy-combatant criteria, the onus could shift to the petitioner to rebut that evidence with more persuasive evidence that he falls outside the criteria.   A burden-shifting scheme of this sort would meet the goal of ensuring that the errant tourist, embedded journalist, or local aid worker has a chance to prove military error while giving due regard to the Executive once it has put forth meaningful support for its conclusion that the detainee is in fact an enemy combatant.  In the words of 
				<em>
					Mathews
				</em>
				, process of this sort would sufficiently address the risk of erroneous deprivation of a detainees liberty interest while eliminating certain procedures that have questionable additional value in light of the burden on the Government.  424 U. S., at 335.

				We think it unlikely that this basic process will have the dire impact on the central functions of warmaking that the Government forecasts.  The parties agree that initial captures on the battlefield need not receive the process we have discussed here; that process is due only when the determination is made to 
				<em>
					continue
				</em>
				 to hold those who have been seized.  The Government has made clear in its briefing that documentation regarding battlefield detainees already is kept in the ordinary course of military affairs.  Brief for Respondents 34.  Any factfinding imposition created by requiring a knowledgeable affiant to summarize these records to an independent tribunal is a minimal one.  Likewise, arguments that military officers ought not have to wage war under the threat of litigation lose much of their steam when factual disputes at enemy-combatant hearings are limited to the alleged combatants acts.  This focus meddles little, if at all, in the strategy or conduct of war, inquiring only into the appropriateness of continuing to detain an individual claimed to have taken up arms against the United States.  While we accord the greatest respect and consideration to the judgments of military authorities in matters relating to the actual prosecution of a war, and recognize that the scope of that discretion necessarily is wide, it does not infringe on the core role of the military for the courts to exercise their own time-honored and constitutionally mandated roles of reviewing and resolving claims like those presented here.

				In sum, while the full protections that accompany challenges to detentions in other settings may prove unworkable and inappropriate in the enemy-combatant setting, the threats to military operations posed by a basic system of independent review are not so weighty as to trump a citizens core rights to challenge meaningfully the

				In so holding, we necessarily reject the Governments assertion that separation of powers principles mandate a heavily circumscribed role for the courts in such circumstances.  Indeed, the position that the courts must forgo any examination of the individual case and focus exclusively on the legality of the broader detention scheme cannot be mandated by any reasonable view of separation of powers, as this approach serves only to

 (The war power is a power to wage war successfully, and thus it permits the harnessing of the entire energies of the people in a supreme cooperative effort to preserve the nation.  But even the war power does not remove constitutional limitations safeguarding essential liberties).  Likewise, we have made clear that, unless Congress acts to suspend it, the Great Writ of habeas corpus allows the Judicial Branch to play a necessary role in maintaining this delicate balance of governance, serving as an important judicial check on the Executives discretion in the realm of detentions.  See
				<em>
					 St. Cyr
				</em>
				, 533 U. S., at 301 (At its historical core, the writ of habeas corpus has served as a means of reviewing the legality of Executive detention, and it is in that context that its protections have been strongest).  Thus, while we do not question that our due process assessment must pay keen attention to the particular burdens faced by the Executive in the context of military action, it would turn our system of checks and balances on its head to suggest that a citizen could not make his way to court with a challenge to the factual basis for his detention by his government, simply because the Executive opposes making available such a challenge.  Absent suspension of the writ by Congress, a citizen detained as an enemy combatant is entitled to this process.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Because we conclude that due process demands some system for a citizen detainee to refute his classification, the proposed some evidence standard is inadequate.  Any process in which the Executives factual assertions go wholly unchallenged or are simply presumed correct without any opportunity for the alleged combatant to demonstrate otherwise falls constitutionally short.  As the Government itself has recognized, we have utilized the some evidence standard in the past as a standard of review, not as a standard of proof.  Brief for Respondents 35.  That is, it primarily has been employed by courts in examining an administrative record developed after an adversarial proceedingone with process at least of the sort that we today hold is constitutionally mandated in the citizen enemy-combatant setting.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				There remains the possibility that the standards we have articulated could be met by an appropriately authorized and properly constituted military tribunal.  Indeed, it is notable that military regulations already provide for such process in related instances, dictating that tribunals be made available to determine the status of enemy detainees who assert prisoner-of-war status under the Geneva Convention.  See Enemy Prisoners of War, Retained Personnel, Civilian Internees and Other Detainees, Army Regulation 1908, §16 (1997).  In the absence of such process, however, a court that receives a petition for a writ of habeas corpus from an alleged enemy combatant must itself ensure that the minimum requirements of due process are achieved.  Both courts below recognized as much, focusing their energies on the question of whether Hamdi was due an opportunity to rebut the Governments case against him.  The Government, too, proceeded on this assumption, presenting its affidavit and then seeking that it be evaluated under a deferential standard of review based on burdens that it alleged would accompany any greater process.  As we have discussed, a habeas court in a case such as this may accept affidavit evidence like that contained in the Mobbs Declaration, so long as it also permits the alleged combatant to present his own factual case to rebut the Governments return.  We anticipate that a District Court would proceed with the caution that we have indicated is necessary in this setting, engaging in a factfinding process that is both prudent and incremental.  We have no reason to doubt that courts faced with these sensitive matters will pay proper heed both to the matters of national security that might arise in an individual case and to the constitutional limitations safeguarding essential liberties that remain vibrant even in times of security concerns.

				At this difficult time in our Nations history, we are called upon to consider the legality of the Governments detention of a United States citizen on United States soil as an enemy combatant and to address the process that is constitutionally owed to one who seeks to challenge his classification as such.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that petitioners detention was legally authorized and that he was entitled to no further opportunity to challenge his enemy-combatant label.  We now vacate and remand.  We hold that although Congress authorized the detention of combatants in the narrow circumstances alleged here, due process demands that a citizen held in the United States as an enemy combatant be given a meaningful opportunity to contest the factual basis for that detention before a neutral decisionmaker.

Approximately 3,000 people were killed in those attacks.  One week later, in response to these acts of treacherous violence, Congress passed a resolution authorizing the President to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks or harbored such organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons.  Authorization for Use of Military Force (the AUMF),

At some point that year, he was seized by members of the Northern Alliance, a coalition of military groups opposed to the Taliban government, and eventually was turned over to the United States military.  The Government asserts that it initially detained and interrogated Hamdi in Afghanistan before transferring him to the United States Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay in January 2002.  In April 2002, upon learning that Hamdi is an American citizen, authorities transferred him to a naval brig in Norfolk, Virginia, where he remained until a recent transfer to a brig in Charleston, South Carolina.  The Government contends that Hamdi is an enemy combatant, and that this status justifies holding him in the United States indefinitelywithout formal charges or proceedingsunless and until it makes the determination that access to counsel or further process is warranted.

				In June 2002, Hamdis father, Esam Fouad Hamdi, filed the present petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2241.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2241</a> in the Eastern District of Virginia, naming as petitioners his son and himself as next friend.  The elder Hamdi alleges in the petition that he has had no contact with his son since the Government took custody of him in 2001, and that the Government has held his son without access to legal counsel or notice of any charges pending against him.  App. 103, 104.  The petition contends that Hamdis detention was not legally authorized.  
				<em>

				., at 105.  It argues that, [a]s an American citizen, … Hamdi enjoys the full protections of the Constitution, and that Hamdis detention in the United States without charges, access to an impartial tribunal, or assistance of counsel violated and continue[s] to violate the Fifth and

				<em>
					Id

				., at 107.  The habeas petition asks that the court, among other things, (1) appoint counsel for Hamdi; (2) order respondents to cease interrogating him; (3) declare that he is being held in violation of the Fifth and 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>s; (4) [t]o the extent Respondents contest any material factual allegations in this Petition, schedule an evidentiary hearing, at which Petitioners may adduce proof in support of their allegations; and (5) order that Hamdi be released from his unlawful custody.  
				<em>

				., at 108109.  Although his habeas petition provides no details with regard to the factual circumstances surrounding his sons capture and detention, Hamdis father has asserted in documents found elsewhere in the record that his son went to Afghanistan to do relief work, and that he had been in that country less than two months before September 11, 2001, and could not have received military training.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed that order, holding that the District Court had failed to extend appropriate deference to the Governments security and intelligence interests.  296 F. 3d 278, 279, 283 (2002).

				On remand, the Government filed a response and a motion to dismiss the petition.  It attached to its response a declaration from one Michael Mobbs (hereinafter Mobbs Declaration), who identified himself as Special Advisor to the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy.  Mobbs indicated that in this position, he has been substantially involved with matters related to the detention of enemy combatants in the current war against the al Qaeda terrorists and those who support and harbor them (including the Taliban).  App. 148.  He expressed his familiar[ity] with Department of Defense and United States military policies and procedures applicable to the detention, control, and transfer of al Qaeda and Taliban personnel, and declared that [b]ased upon my review of relevant records and reports, I am also familiar with the facts and circumstances related to the capture of … Hamdi and his detention by U. S. military forces.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Mobbs then set forth what remains the sole evidentiary support that the Government has provided to the courts for Hamdis detention.  The declaration states that Hamdi traveled to Afghanistan in July or August 2001, and that he thereafter affiliated with a Taliban military unit and received weapons training.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  It asserts that Hamdi remained with his Taliban unit following the attacks of September 11 and that, during the time when Northern Alliance forces were engaged in battle with the Taliban, Hamdis Taliban unit surrendered to those forces, after which he surrender[ed] his Kalishnikov assault rifle to them.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 148149.  The Mobbs Declaration also states that, because al Qaeda and the Taliban were and are hostile forces engaged in armed conflict with the armed forces of the United States, individuals associated with those groups were and continue to be enemy combatants.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 149.  Mobbs states that Hamdi was labeled an enemy combatant [b]ased upon his interviews and in light of his association with the Taliban.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  According to the declaration, a series of U. S. military screening team[s] determined that Hamdi met the criteria for enemy combatants, and a subsequent interview of Hamdi has confirmed that he surrendered and gave his firearm to Northern Alliance forces, which supports his classification as an enemy combatant.

				., at 149150.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				After the Government submitted this declaration, the Fourth Circuit directed the District Court to proceed in accordance with its earlier ruling and, specifically, to  consider the sufficiency of the Mobbs Declaration as an independent matter before proceeding further.   316 F. 3d at 450, 462 (2003)
				.  
				The District Court found that the Mobbs Declaration fell far short of supporting Hamdis detention.  App. 292.  It criticized the generic and hearsay nature of the affidavit, calling it little more than the governments say-so.   
				<em>
					Id

				<em>

				review, including copies of all of Hamdis statements and the notes taken from interviews with him that related to his reasons for going to Afghanistan and his activities therein; a list of all interrogators who had questioned Hamdi and their names and addresses; statements by members of the Northern Alliance regarding Hamdis surrender and capture; a list of the dates and locations of his capture and subsequent detentions; and the names and titles of the United States Government officials who made the determinations that Hamdi was an enemy combatant and that he should be moved to a naval brig.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 185186.  The court indicated that all of these materials were necessary for meaningful judicial review of whether Hamdis detention was legally authorized and whether Hamdi had received sufficient process to satisfy the Due Process Clause of the Constitution and relevant treaties or military regulations.

				The Government sought to appeal the production order, and the District Court certified the question of whether the Mobbs Declaration,  standing alone, is sufficient as a matter of law to allow meaningful judicial review of [Hamdis] classification as an enemy combatant.  316 F. 3d, at 462.  The Fourth Circuit reversed, but did not squarely answer the certified question.  It instead stressed that, because it was undisputed that Hamdi was captured in a zone of active combat in a foreign theater of conflict, no factual inquiry or evidentiary hearing allowing Hamdi to be heard or to rebut the Governments assertions was necessary or proper.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 459.  Concluding that the factual averments in the Mobbs Declaration, if accurate, provided a sufficient basis upon which to conclude that the President had constitutionally detained Hamdi pursuant to the Presidents war powers, it ordered the habeas petition dismissed.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 473.  The Fourth Circuit emphasized that the vital purposes of the detention of uncharged enemy combatantspreventing those combatants from rejoining the enemy while relieving the military of the burden of litigating the circumstances of wartime captures halfway around the globewere interests directly derived from the war powers of Articles I and II.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 465466.  In that courts view, because Article III contains nothing analogous to the specific powers of war so carefully enumerated in Articles I and II, 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 463, separation of powers principles prohibited a federal court from delv[ing] further into Hamdis status and capture,

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				On the more global question of whether legal authorization exists for the detention of citizen enemy combatants at all, the Fourth Circuit rejected Hamdis arguments that 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/4001.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. §4001(a)</a> and Article 5 of the Geneva Convention rendered any such detentions unlawful.  The court expressed doubt as to Hamdis argument that §4001(a), which provides that [n]o citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained by the United States except pursuant to an Act of Congress, required express congressional authorization of detentions of this sort.  But it held that, in any event, such authorization was found in the post-September 11 Authorization for Use of Military Force.  316 F. 3d, at 467.  Because capturing and detaining enemy combatants is an inherent part of warfare, the court held, the necessary and appropriate force referenced in the congressional resolution necessarily includes the capture and detention of any and all hostile forces arrayed against our troops.  
				<em>

The court likewise rejected Hamdis Geneva Convention claim, concluding that the convention is not self-executing and that, even if it were, it would not preclude the Executive from detaining Hamdi until the cessation of hostilities.  316 F. 3d, at 468469.

				Finally, the Fourth Circuit rejected Hamdis contention that its legal analyses with regard to the authorization for the detention scheme and the process to which he was constitutionally entitled should be altered by the fact that he is an American citizen detained on American soil.  Relying on

At least where it is undisputed that he was present in a zone of active combat operations, we are satisfied that the Constitution does not entitle him to a searching review of the factual determinations underlying his seizure there.

        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				The threshold question before us is whether the Executive has the authority to detain citizens who qualify as enemy combatants.  There is some debate as to the proper scope of this term, and the Government has never provided any court with the full criteria that it uses in classifying individuals as such.  It has made clear, however, that, for purposes of this case, the enemy combatant that it is seeking to detain is an individual who, it alleges, was  part of or supporting forces hostile to the United States or coalition partners  in Afghanistan and who  engaged in an armed conflict against the United States  there.  Brief for Respondents 3.  We therefore answer only the narrow question before us: whether the detention of citizens falling within that definition is authorized.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The Government maintains that no explicit congressional authorization is required, because the Executive possesses plenary authority to detain pursuant to Article II of the Constitution.  We do not reach the question whether Article II provides such authority, however, because we agree with the Governments alternative position, that Congress has in fact authorized Hamdis detention, through the AUMF.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Our analysis on that point, set forth below, substantially overlaps with our analysis of Hamdis principal argument for the illegality of his detention.  He posits that his detention is forbidden by 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/4001.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. §4001(a)</a>.  Section 4001(a) states that [n]o citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained by the United States except pursuant to an Act of Congress.  Congress passed §4001(a) in 1971 as part of a bill to repeal the Emergency Detention Act of 1950, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/50/811.html" class="subref" title="subref">50 U. S. C. §811</a>
            <em>

				., which provided procedures for executive detention, during times of emergency, of individuals deemed likely to engage in espionage or sabotage.  Congress was particularly concerned about the possibility that the Act could be used to reprise the Japanese internment camps of World War II.  H. R. Rep. No. 92116 (1971); 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 4 (The concentration camp implications of the legislation render it abhorrent).
				    
				The Government again presses two alternative positions.  First, it argues that §4001(a), in light of its legislative history and its location in Title 18, applies only to the control of civilian prisons and related detentions, not to military detentions.  Brief for Respondents 21.  Second, it maintains that §4001(a) is satisfied, because Hamdi is being detained pursuant to an Act of Congressthe AUMF.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 2122.  Again, because we conclude that the Governments second assertion is correct, we do not address the first.  In other words, for the reasons that follow, we conclude that the AUMF is explicit congressional authorization for the detention of individuals in the narrow category we describe (assuming, without deciding, that such authorization is required), and that the AUMF satisfied §4001(a)s requirement that a detention be pursuant to an Act of Congress (assuming, without deciding, that §4001(a) applies to military detentions).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The AUMF authorizes the President to use all necessary and appropriate force against nations, organizations, or persons associated with the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.  
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">115</a>Stat.
224.  There can be no doubt that individuals who fought against the United States in Afghanistan as part of the Taliban, an organization known to have supported the al Qaeda terrorist network responsible for those attacks, are individuals Congress sought to target in passing the AUMF.  We conclude that detention of individuals falling into the limited category we are considering, for the duration of the particular conflict in which they were captured, is so fundamental and accepted an incident to war as to be an exercise of the necessary and appropriate force Congress has authorized the President to use.

Nor can we see any reason for drawing such a line here.  A citizen, no less than an alien, can be part of or supporting forces hostile to the United States or coalition partners and engaged in an armed conflict against the United States, Brief for Respondents 3; such a citizen, if released, would pose the same threat of returning to the front during the ongoing conflict.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In light of these principles, it is of no moment that the AUMF does not use specific language of detention.  Because detention to prevent a combatants return to the battlefield is a fundamental incident of waging war, in permitting the use of necessary and appropriate force, Congress has clearly and unmistakably authorized detention in the narrow circumstances considered here.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Hamdi objects, nevertheless, that Congress has not authorized the 
				<em>
					indefinite
				</em>
				 detention to which he is now subject.  The Government responds that the detention of enemy combatants during World War II was just as indefinite while that war was being fought.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 16.  We take Hamdis objection to be not to the lack of certainty regarding the date on which the conflict will end, but to the substantial prospect of perpetual detention.  We recognize that the national security underpinnings of the war on terror, although crucially important, are broad and malleable.  As the Government concedes, given its unconventional nature, the current conflict is unlikely to end with a formal cease-fire agreement.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  The prospect Hamdi raises is therefore not far-fetched.  If the Government does not consider this unconventional war won for two generations, and if it maintains during that time that Hamdi might, if released, rejoin forces fighting against the United States, then the position it has taken throughout the litigation of this case suggests that Hamdis detention could last for the rest of his life.

				It is a clearly established principle of the law of war that detention may last no longer than active hostilities.

				Hamdi contends that the AUMF does not authorize indefinite or perpetual detention.  Certainly, we agree that indefinite detention for the purpose of interrogation is not authorized.  Further, we understand Congress grant of authority for the use of necessary and appropriate force to include the authority to detain for the duration of the relevant conflict, and our understanding is based on longstanding law-of-war principles.  If the practical circumstances of a given conflict are entirely unlike those of the conflicts that informed the development of the law of war, that understanding may unravel.  But that is not the situation we face as of this date.  Active combat operations against Taliban fighters apparently are ongoing in Afghanistan.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,

The United States may detain, for the duration of these hostilities, individuals legitimately determined to be Taliban combatants who engaged in an armed conflict against the United States.  If the record establishes that United States troops are still involved in active combat in Afghanistan, those detentions are part of the exercise of necessary and appropriate force, and therefore are authorized by the AUMF.

				 4 Wall. 2, 125 (1866), does not undermine our holding about the Governments authority to seize enemy combatants, as we define that term today.

He does not explain how his historical analysis supports the addition of a third optiondetention under some other process after concession of enemy-combatant statusor why a concession should carry any different effect than proof of enemy-combatant status in a proceeding that comports with due process.  To be clear, our opinion only finds legislative authority to detain under the AUMF once it is sufficiently clear that the individual is, in fact, an enemy combatant; whether that is established by concession or by some other process that verifies this fact with sufficient certainty seems beside the point.

Military authorities faced with the stark choice of submitting to the full-blown criminal process or releasing a suspected enemy combatant captured on the battlefield will simply keep citizen-detainees abroad.  Indeed, the Government transferred Hamdi from Guantanamo Bay to the United States naval brig only after it learned that he might be an American citizen.  It is not at all clear why that should make a determinative constitutional difference.

				Even in cases in which the detention of enemy combatants is legally authorized, there remains the question of what process is constitutionally due to a citizen who disputes his enemy-combatant status.  Hamdi argues that he is owed a meaningful and timely hearing and that extra-judicial detention [that] begins and ends with the submission of an affidavit based on third-hand hearsay does not comport with the Fifth and 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>s.  Brief for Petitioners 16.  The Government counters that any more process than was provided below would be both unworkable and constitutionally intolerable.  Brief for Respondents 46.  Our resolution of this dispute requires a careful examination both of the writ of habeas corpus, which Hamdi now seeks to employ as a mechanism of judicial review, and of the Due Process Clause, which informs the procedural contours of that mechanism in this instance.

				Though they reach radically different conclusions on the process that ought to attend the present proceeding, the parties begin on common ground.  All agree that, absent suspension, the writ of habeas corpus remains available to every individual detained within the United States.  U. S. Const., Art. I, §9, cl. 2 (The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it).  Only in the rarest of circumstances has Congress seen fit to suspend the writ.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, Act of Mar. 3, 1863, ch. 81, §1, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">12</a>Stat.
755; Act of April 20, 1871, ch. 22, §4, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">17</a>Stat.
14.  At all other times, it has remained a critical check on the Executive, ensuring that it does not detain individuals except in accordance with law.  See
				<em>
					 INS
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					St. Cyr, 
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/533/289" class="subref" title="subref">533 U. S. 289</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">301</a> (2001)
.  All agree suspension of the writ has not occurred here.  Thus, it is undisputed that Hamdi was properly before an Article III court to challenge his detention under 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2241.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2241</a>.  Brief for Respondents 12.  Further, all agree that §2241 and its companion provisions provide at least a skeletal outline of the procedures to be afforded a petitioner in federal habeas review.  Most notably, §2243 provides that the person detained may, under oath, deny any of the facts set forth in the return or allege any other material facts, and §2246 allows the taking of evidence in habeas proceedings by deposition, affidavit, or interrogatories.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The simple outline of §2241 makes clear both that Congress envisioned that habeas petitioners would have some opportunity to present and rebut facts and that courts in cases like this retain some ability to vary the ways in which they do so as mandated by due process.  The Government recognizes the basic procedural protections required by the habeas statute, 
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 3738, but asks us to hold that, given both the flexibility of the habeas mechanism and the circumstances presented in this case, the presentation of the Mobbs Declaration to the habeas court completed the required factual development.  It suggests two separate reasons for its position that no further process is due.
			</p>
        <p class="opcentered">
				B
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				First, the Government urges the adoption of the Fourth Circuits holding belowthat because it is undisputed that Hamdis seizure took place in a combat zone, the habeas determination can be made purely as a matter of law, with no further hearing or factfinding necessary.  This argument is easily rejected.  As the dissenters from the denial of rehearing en banc noted, the circumstances surrounding Hamdis seizure cannot in any way be characterized as undisputed, as those circumstances are neither conceded in fact, nor susceptible to concession in law, because Hamdi has not been permitted to speak for himself or even through counsel as to those circumstances.  337 F. 3d 335, 357 (CA4 2003) (Luttig, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc); see also
				<em>
					 id
				</em>
				., at 371372 (Motz, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).  Further, the facts that constitute the alleged concession are insufficient to support Hamdis detention.  Under the definition of enemy combatant that we accept today as falling within the scope of Congress authorization, Hamdi would need to be part of or supporting forces hostile to the United States or coalition partners and engaged in an armed conflict against the United States to justify his detention in the United States for the duration of the relevant conflict.  Brief for Respondents 3.  The habeas petition states only that [w]hen seized by the United States Government, Mr. Hamdi resided in Afghanistan.  App. 104.  An assertion that one 
				<em>
					resided
				</em>
				 in a country in which combat operations are taking place is not a concession that one was 
				<em>
					captured
				</em>
				 in a zone of active combat operations in a foreign theater of war, 316 F. 3d, at 459 (emphasis added), and certainly is not a concession that one was part of or supporting forces hostile to the United States or coalition partners and engaged in an armed conflict against the United States.  Accordingly, we reject any argument that Hamdi has made concessions that eliminate any right to further process.

        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				The Governments second argument requires closer consideration.  This is the argument that further factual exploration is unwarranted and inappropriate in light of the extraordinary constitutional interests at stake.  Under the Governments most extreme rendition of this argument, [r]espect for separation of powers and the limited institutional capabilities of courts in matters of military decision-making in connection with an ongoing conflict ought to eliminate entirely any individual process, restricting the courts to investigating only whether legal authorization exists for the broader detention scheme.  Brief for Respondents 26.  At most, the Government argues, courts should review its determination that a citizen is an enemy combatant under a very deferential some evidence standard.

				., at 34 (Under the some evidence standard, the focus is exclusively on the factual basis supplied by the Executive to support its own determination (citing

				</em>
				(explaining that the some evidence standard does not require a weighing of the evidence, but rather calls for assessing whether there is any evidence in the record that could support the conclusion)).  Under this review, a court would assume the accuracy of the Governments articulated basis for Hamdis detention, as set forth in the Mobbs Declaration, and assess only whether that articulated basis was a legitimate one.  Brief for Respondents 36; see also
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				316 F. 3d, at 473474 (declining to address whether the some evidence standard should govern the adjudication of such claims, but noting that [t]he factual averments in the [Mobbs] affidavit, if accurate, are sufficient to confirm the legality of Hamdis detention).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In response, Hamdi emphasizes that this Court consistently has recognized that an individual challenging his detention may not be held at the will of the Executive without recourse to some proceeding before a neutral tribunal to determine whether the Executives asserted justifications for that detention have basis in fact and warrant in law.  See,

.  He argues that the Fourth Circuit inappropriately ceded power to the Executive during wartime to define the conduct for which a citizen may be detained, judge whether that citizen has engaged in the proscribed conduct, and imprison that citizen indefinitely, Brief for Petitioners 21, and that due process demands that he receive a hearing in which he may challenge the Mobbs Declaration and adduce his own counter evidence.  The District Court, agreeing with Hamdi, apparently believed that the appropriate process would approach the process that accompanies a criminal trial.  It therefore disapproved of the hearsay nature of the Mobbs Declaration and anticipated quite extensive discovery of various military affairs.  Anything less, it concluded, would not be meaningful judicial review.  App. 291.

				Both of these positions highlight legitimate concerns.  And both emphasize the tension that often exists between the autonomy that the Government asserts is necessary in order to pursue effectively a particular goal and the process that a citizen contends he is due before he is deprived of a constitutional right.  The ordinary mechanism that we use for balancing such serious competing interests, and for determining the procedures that are necessary to ensure that a citizen is not deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law, U. S. Const., Amdt. 5, is the test that we articulated in

In its view, military officers who are engaged in the serious work of waging battle would be unnecessarily and dangerously distracted by litigation half a world away, and discovery into military operations would both intrude on the sensitive secrets of national defense and result in a futile search for evidence buried under the rubble of war.  Brief for Respondents 4649.  To the extent that these burdens are triggered by heightened procedures, they are properly taken into account in our due process analysis.

				Striking the proper constitutional balance here is of great importance to the Nation during this period of ongoing combat.  But it is equally vital that our calculus not give short shrift to the values that this country holds dear or to the privilege that is American citizenship.  It is during our most challenging and uncertain moments that our Nations commitment to due process is most severely tested; and it is in those times that we must preserve our commitment at home to the principles for which we fight abroad.

				With due recognition of these competing concerns, we believe that neither the process proposed by the Government nor the process apparently envisioned by the District Court below strikes the proper constitutional balance when a United States citizen is detained in the United States as an enemy combatant.  That is, the risk of erroneous deprivation of a detainees liberty interest is unacceptably high under the Governments proposed rule, while some of the additional or substitute procedural safeguards suggested by the District Court are unwarranted in light of their limited probable value and the burdens they may impose on the military in such cases.

				At the same time, the exigencies of the circumstances may demand that, aside from these core elements, enemy combatant proceedings may be tailored to alleviate their uncommon potential to burden the Executive at a time of ongoing military conflict.  Hearsay, for example, may need to be accepted as the most reliable available evidence from the Government in such a proceeding.  Likewise, the Constitution would not be offended by a presumption in favor of the Governments evidence, so long as that presumption remained a rebuttable one and fair opportunity for rebuttal were provided.  Thus, once the Government puts forth credible evidence that the habeas petitioner meets the enemy-combatant criteria, the onus could shift to the petitioner to rebut that evidence with more persuasive evidence that he falls outside the criteria.   A burden-shifting scheme of this sort would meet the goal of ensuring that the errant tourist, embedded journalist, or local aid worker has a chance to prove military error while giving due regard to the Executive once it has put forth meaningful support for its conclusion that the detainee is in fact an enemy combatant.  In the words of 
				<em>
					Mathews
				</em>
				, process of this sort would sufficiently address the risk of erroneous deprivation of a detainees liberty interest while eliminating certain procedures that have questionable additional value in light of the burden on the Government.  424 U. S., at 335.

				We think it unlikely that this basic process will have the dire impact on the central functions of warmaking that the Government forecasts.  The parties agree that initial captures on the battlefield need not receive the process we have discussed here; that process is due only when the determination is made to 
				<em>
					continue
				</em>
				 to hold those who have been seized.  The Government has made clear in its briefing that documentation regarding battlefield detainees already is kept in the ordinary course of military affairs.  Brief for Respondents 34.  Any factfinding imposition created by requiring a knowledgeable affiant to summarize these records to an independent tribunal is a minimal one.  Likewise, arguments that military officers ought not have to wage war under the threat of litigation lose much of their steam when factual disputes at enemy-combatant hearings are limited to the alleged combatants acts.  This focus meddles little, if at all, in the strategy or conduct of war, inquiring only into the appropriateness of continuing to detain an individual claimed to have taken up arms against the United States.  While we accord the greatest respect and consideration to the judgments of military authorities in matters relating to the actual prosecution of a war, and recognize that the scope of that discretion necessarily is wide, it does not infringe on the core role of the military for the courts to exercise their own time-honored and constitutionally mandated roles of reviewing and resolving claims like those presented here.

				In sum, while the full protections that accompany challenges to detentions in other settings may prove unworkable and inappropriate in the enemy-combatant setting, the threats to military operations posed by a basic system of independent review are not so weighty as to trump a citizens core rights to challenge meaningfully the

				In so holding, we necessarily reject the Governments assertion that separation of powers principles mandate a heavily circumscribed role for the courts in such circumstances.  Indeed, the position that the courts must forgo any examination of the individual case and focus exclusively on the legality of the broader detention scheme cannot be mandated by any reasonable view of separation of powers, as this approach serves only to 
				<em>
					condense

				 power into a single branch of government.  We have long since made clear that a state of war is not a blank check for the President when it comes to the rights of the Nations citizens.

 (The war power is a power to wage war successfully, and thus it permits the harnessing of the entire energies of the people in a supreme cooperative effort to preserve the nation.  But even the war power does not remove constitutional limitations safeguarding essential liberties).  Likewise, we have made clear that, unless Congress acts to suspend it, the Great Writ of habeas corpus allows the Judicial Branch to play a necessary role in maintaining this delicate balance of governance, serving as an important judicial check on the Executives discretion in the realm of detentions.  See
				<em>
					 St. Cyr
				</em>
				, 533 U. S., at 301 (At its historical core, the writ of habeas corpus has served as a means of reviewing the legality of Executive detention, and it is in that context that its protections have been strongest).  Thus, while we do not question that our due process assessment must pay keen attention to the particular burdens faced by the Executive in the context of military action, it would turn our system of checks and balances on its head to suggest that a citizen could not make his way to court with a challenge to the factual basis for his detention by his government, simply because the Executive opposes making available such a challenge.  Absent suspension of the writ by Congress, a citizen detained as an enemy combatant is entitled to this process.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Because we conclude that due process demands some system for a citizen detainee to refute his classification, the proposed some evidence standard is inadequate.  Any process in which the Executives factual assertions go wholly unchallenged or are simply presumed correct without any opportunity for the alleged combatant to demonstrate otherwise falls constitutionally short.  As the Government itself has recognized, we have utilized the some evidence standard in the past as a standard of review, not as a standard of proof.  Brief for Respondents 35.  That is, it primarily has been employed by courts in examining an administrative record developed after an adversarial proceedingone with process at least of the sort that we today hold is constitutionally mandated in the citizen enemy-combatant setting.

				Today we are faced only with such a case.  Aside from unspecified screening processes, Brief for Respondents 34, and military interrogations in which the Government suggests Hamdi could have contested his classification, Tr. of Oral Arg. 40, 42, Hamdi has received no process.  An interrogation by ones captor, however effective an intelligence-gathering tool, hardly constitutes a constitutionally adequate factfinding before a neutral decisionmaker.  Compare Brief for Respondents 4243 (discussing the secure interrogation environment, and noting that military interrogations require a controlled interrogation dynamic and a relationship of trust and dependency and are a critical source of timely and effective intelligence) with

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				There remains the possibility that the standards we have articulated could be met by an appropriately authorized and properly constituted military tribunal.  Indeed, it is notable that military regulations already provide for such process in related instances, dictating that tribunals be made available to determine the status of enemy detainees who assert prisoner-of-war status under the Geneva Convention.  See Enemy Prisoners of War, Retained Personnel, Civilian Internees and Other Detainees, Army Regulation 1908, §16 (1997).  In the absence of such process, however, a court that receives a petition for a writ of habeas corpus from an alleged enemy combatant must itself ensure that the minimum requirements of due process are achieved.  Both courts below recognized as much, focusing their energies on the question of whether Hamdi was due an opportunity to rebut the Governments case against him.  The Government, too, proceeded on this assumption, presenting its affidavit and then seeking that it be evaluated under a deferential standard of review based on burdens that it alleged would accompany any greater process.  As we have discussed, a habeas court in a case such as this may accept affidavit evidence like that contained in the Mobbs Declaration, so long as it also permits the alleged combatant to present his own factual case to rebut the Governments return.  We anticipate that a District Court would proceed with the caution that we have indicated is necessary in this setting, engaging in a factfinding process that is both prudent and incremental.  We have no reason to doubt that courts faced with these sensitive matters will pay proper heed both to the matters of national security that might arise in an individual case and to the constitutional limitations safeguarding essential liberties that remain vibrant even in times of security concerns.

				At this difficult time in our Nations history, we are called upon to consider the legality of the Governments detention of a United States citizen on United States soil as an enemy combatant and to address the process that is constitutionally owed to one who seeks to challenge his classification as such.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that petitioners detention was legally authorized and that he was entitled to no further opportunity to challenge his enemy-combatant label.  We now vacate and remand.  We hold that although Congress authorized the detention of combatants in the narrow circumstances alleged here, due process demands that a citizen held in the United States as an enemy combatant be given a meaningful opportunity to contest the factual basis for that detention before a neutral decisionmaker.

				On September 11, 2001, the al Qaeda terrorist network used hijacked commercial airliners to attack prominent targets in the United States.  Approximately 3,000 people were killed in those attacks.  One week later, in response to these acts of treacherous violence, Congress passed a resolution authorizing the President to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks or harbored such organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons.  Authorization for Use of Military Force (the AUMF),

224.  Soon thereafter, the President ordered United States Armed Forces to Afghanistan, with a mission to subdue al Qaeda and quell the Taliban regime that was known to support it.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				This case arises out of the detention of a man whom the Government alleges took up arms with the Taliban during this conflict.  His name is Yaser Esam Hamdi.  Born an American citizen in Louisiana in 1980, Hamdi moved with his family to Saudi Arabia as a child.  By 2001, the parties agree, he resided in Afghanistan.  At some point that year, he was seized by members of the Northern Alliance, a coalition of military groups opposed to the Taliban government, and eventually was turned over to the United States military.  The Government asserts that it initially detained and interrogated Hamdi in Afghanistan before transferring him to the United States Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay in January 2002.  In April 2002, upon learning that Hamdi is an American citizen, authorities transferred him to a naval brig in Norfolk, Virginia, where he remained until a recent transfer to a brig in Charleston, South Carolina.  The Government contends that Hamdi is an enemy combatant, and that this status justifies holding him in the United States indefinitelywithout formal charges or proceedingsunless and until it makes the determination that access to counsel or further process is warranted.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In June 2002, Hamdis father, Esam Fouad Hamdi, filed the present petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2241.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2241</a> in the Eastern District of Virginia, naming as petitioners his son and himself as next friend.  The elder Hamdi alleges in the petition that he has had no contact with his son since the Government took custody of him in 2001, and that the Government has held his son without access to legal counsel or notice of any charges pending against him.  App. 103, 104.  The petition contends that Hamdis detention was not legally authorized.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 105.  It argues that, [a]s an American citizen, … Hamdi enjoys the full protections of the Constitution, and that Hamdis detention in the United States without charges, access to an impartial tribunal, or assistance of counsel violated and continue[s] to violate the Fifth and 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>s to the United States Constitution.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 107.  The habeas petition asks that the court, among other things, (1) appoint counsel for Hamdi; (2) order respondents to cease interrogating him; (3) declare that he is being held in violation of the Fifth and 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>s; (4) [t]o the extent Respondents contest any material factual allegations in this Petition, schedule an evidentiary hearing, at which Petitioners may adduce proof in support of their allegations; and (5) order that Hamdi be released from his unlawful custody.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 108109.  Although his habeas petition provides no details with regard to the factual circumstances surrounding his sons capture and detention, Hamdis father has asserted in documents found elsewhere in the record that his son went to Afghanistan to do relief work, and that he had been in that country less than two months before September 11, 2001, and could not have received military training.

				On remand, the Government filed a response and a motion to dismiss the petition.  It attached to its response a declaration from one Michael Mobbs (hereinafter Mobbs Declaration), who identified himself as Special Advisor to the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy.  Mobbs indicated that in this position, he has been substantially involved with matters related to the detention of enemy combatants in the current war against the al Qaeda terrorists and those who support and harbor them (including the Taliban).  App. 148.  He expressed his familiar[ity] with Department of Defense and United States military policies and procedures applicable to the detention, control, and transfer of al Qaeda and Taliban personnel, and declared that [b]ased upon my review of relevant records and reports, I am also familiar with the facts and circumstances related to the capture of … Hamdi and his detention by U. S. military forces.

				Mobbs then set forth what remains the sole evidentiary support that the Government has provided to the courts for Hamdis detention.  The declaration states that Hamdi traveled to Afghanistan in July or August 2001, and that he thereafter affiliated with a Taliban military unit and received weapons training.  
				<em>
					Ibid

				.  It asserts that Hamdi remained with his Taliban unit following the attacks of September 11 and that, during the time when Northern Alliance forces were engaged in battle with the Taliban, Hamdis Taliban unit surrendered to those forces, after which he surrender[ed] his Kalishnikov assault rifle to them.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 148149.  The Mobbs Declaration also states that, because al Qaeda and the Taliban were and are hostile forces engaged in armed conflict with the armed forces of the United States, individuals associated with those groups were and continue to be enemy combatants.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 149.  Mobbs states that Hamdi was labeled an enemy combatant [b]ased upon his interviews and in light of his association with the Taliban.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  According to the declaration, a series of U. S. military screening team[s] determined that Hamdi met the criteria for enemy combatants, and a subsequent interview of Hamdi has confirmed that he surrendered and gave his firearm to Northern Alliance forces, which supports his classification as an enemy combatant.

				After the Government submitted this declaration, the Fourth Circuit directed the District Court to proceed in accordance with its earlier ruling and, specifically, to  consider the sufficiency of the Mobbs Declaration as an independent matter before proceeding further.   316 F. 3d at 450, 462 (2003)

				The District Court found that the Mobbs Declaration fell far short of supporting Hamdis detention.  App. 292.  It criticized the generic and hearsay nature of the affidavit, calling it little more than the governments say-so. 

				The Government sought to appeal the production order, and the District Court certified the question of whether the Mobbs Declaration,  standing alone, is sufficient as a matter of law to allow meaningful judicial review of [Hamdis] classification as an enemy combatant.  316 F. 3d, at 462.  The Fourth Circuit reversed, but did not squarely answer the certified question.  It instead stressed that, because it was undisputed that Hamdi was captured in a zone of active combat in a foreign theater of conflict, no factual inquiry or evidentiary hearing allowing Hamdi to be heard or to rebut the Governments assertions was necessary or proper.  
				<em>
					Id

				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 473.  The Fourth Circuit emphasized that the vital purposes of the detention of uncharged enemy combatantspreventing those combatants from rejoining the enemy while relieving the military of the burden of litigating the circumstances of wartime captures halfway around the globewere interests directly derived from the war powers of Articles I and II.  
				<em>
					Id

				., at 465466.  In that courts view, because Article III contains nothing analogous to the specific powers of war so carefully enumerated in Articles I and II,

				On the more global question of whether legal authorization exists for the detention of citizen enemy combatants at all, the Fourth Circuit rejected Hamdis arguments that 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/4001.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. §4001(a)</a> and Article 5 of the Geneva Convention rendered any such detentions unlawful.  The court expressed doubt as to Hamdis argument that §4001(a), which provides that [n]o citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained by the United States except pursuant to an Act of Congress, required express congressional authorization of detentions of this sort.  But it held that, in any event, such authorization was found in the post-September 11 Authorization for Use of Military Force.  316 F. 3d, at 467.  Because capturing and detaining enemy combatants is an inherent part of warfare, the court held, the necessary and appropriate force referenced in the congressional resolution necessarily includes the capture and detention of any and all hostile forces arrayed against our troops.

The court likewise rejected Hamdis Geneva Convention claim, concluding that the convention is not self-executing and that, even if it were, it would not preclude the Executive from detaining Hamdi until the cessation of hostilities.  316 F. 3d, at 468469.

        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				The threshold question before us is whether the Executive has the authority to detain citizens who qualify as enemy combatants.  There is some debate as to the proper scope of this term, and the Government has never provided any court with the full criteria that it uses in classifying individuals as such.  It has made clear, however, that, for purposes of this case, the enemy combatant that it is seeking to detain is an individual who, it alleges, was  part of or supporting forces hostile to the United States or coalition partners  in Afghanistan and who  engaged in an armed conflict against the United States  there.  Brief for Respondents 3.  We therefore answer only the narrow question before us: whether the detention of citizens falling within that definition is authorized.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The Government maintains that no explicit congressional authorization is required, because the Executive possesses plenary authority to detain pursuant to Article II of the Constitution.  We do not reach the question whether Article II provides such authority, however, because we agree with the Governments alternative position, that Congress has in fact authorized Hamdis detention, through the AUMF.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Our analysis on that point, set forth below, substantially overlaps with our analysis of Hamdis principal argument for the illegality of his detention.  He posits that his detention is forbidden by 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/4001.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. §4001(a)</a>.  Section 4001(a) states that [n]o citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained by the United States except pursuant to an Act of Congress.  Congress passed §4001(a) in 1971 as part of a bill to repeal the Emergency Detention Act of 1950, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/50/811.html" class="subref" title="subref">50 U. S. C. §811</a>
            <em>

				., which provided procedures for executive detention, during times of emergency, of individuals deemed likely to engage in espionage or sabotage.  Congress was particularly concerned about the possibility that the Act could be used to reprise the Japanese internment camps of World War II.  H. R. Rep. No. 92116 (1971); 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 4 (The concentration camp implications of the legislation render it abhorrent).
				    
				The Government again presses two alternative positions.  First, it argues that §4001(a), in light of its legislative history and its location in Title 18, applies only to the control of civilian prisons and related detentions, not to military detentions.  Brief for Respondents 21.  Second, it maintains that §4001(a) is satisfied, because Hamdi is being detained pursuant to an Act of Congressthe AUMF.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 2122.  Again, because we conclude that the Governments second assertion is correct, we do not address the first.  In other words, for the reasons that follow, we conclude that the AUMF is explicit congressional authorization for the detention of individuals in the narrow category we describe (assuming, without deciding, that such authorization is required), and that the AUMF satisfied §4001(a)s requirement that a detention be pursuant to an Act of Congress (assuming, without deciding, that §4001(a) applies to military detentions).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The AUMF authorizes the President to use all necessary and appropriate force against nations, organizations, or persons associated with the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.  
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">115</a>Stat.
224.  There can be no doubt that individuals who fought against the United States in Afghanistan as part of the Taliban, an organization known to have supported the al Qaeda terrorist network responsible for those attacks, are individuals Congress sought to target in passing the AUMF.  We conclude that detention of individuals falling into the limited category we are considering, for the duration of the particular conflict in which they were captured, is so fundamental and accepted an incident to war as to be an exercise of the necessary and appropriate force Congress has authorized the President to use.

Nor can we see any reason for drawing such a line here.  A citizen, no less than an alien, can be part of or supporting forces hostile to the United States or coalition partners and engaged in an armed conflict against the United States, Brief for Respondents 3; such a citizen, if released, would pose the same threat of returning to the front during the ongoing conflict.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In light of these principles, it is of no moment that the AUMF does not use specific language of detention.  Because detention to prevent a combatants return to the battlefield is a fundamental incident of waging war, in permitting the use of necessary and appropriate force, Congress has clearly and unmistakably authorized detention in the narrow circumstances considered here.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Hamdi objects, nevertheless, that Congress has not authorized the 
				<em>
					indefinite
				</em>
				 detention to which he is now subject.  The Government responds that the detention of enemy combatants during World War II was just as indefinite while that war was being fought.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 16.  We take Hamdis objection to be not to the lack of certainty regarding the date on which the conflict will end, but to the substantial prospect of perpetual detention.  We recognize that the national security underpinnings of the war on terror, although crucially important, are broad and malleable.  As the Government concedes, given its unconventional nature, the current conflict is unlikely to end with a formal cease-fire agreement.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  The prospect Hamdi raises is therefore not far-fetched.  If the Government does not consider this unconventional war won for two generations, and if it maintains during that time that Hamdi might, if released, rejoin forces fighting against the United States, then the position it has taken throughout the litigation of this case suggests that Hamdis detention could last for the rest of his life.

				It is a clearly established principle of the law of war that detention may last no longer than active hostilities.

				Hamdi contends that the AUMF does not authorize indefinite or perpetual detention.  Certainly, we agree that indefinite detention for the purpose of interrogation is not authorized.  Further, we understand Congress grant of authority for the use of necessary and appropriate force to include the authority to detain for the duration of the relevant conflict, and our understanding is based on longstanding law-of-war principles.  If the practical circumstances of a given conflict are entirely unlike those of the conflicts that informed the development of the law of war, that understanding may unravel.  But that is not the situation we face as of this date.  Active combat operations against Taliban fighters apparently are ongoing in Afghanistan.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 Constable, U. S. Launches New Operation in Afghanistan, Washington Post, Mar. 14, 2004, p.

The United States may detain, for the duration of these hostilities, individuals legitimately determined to be Taliban combatants who engaged in an armed conflict against the United States.  If the record establishes that United States troops are still involved in active combat in Afghanistan, those detentions are part of the exercise of necessary and appropriate force, and therefore are authorized by the AUMF.

To be clear, our opinion only finds legislative authority to detain under the AUMF once it is sufficiently clear that the individual is, in fact, an enemy combatant; whether that is established by concession or by some other process that verifies this fact with sufficient certainty seems beside the point.

Military authorities faced with the stark choice of submitting to the full-blown criminal process or releasing a suspected enemy combatant captured on the battlefield will simply keep citizen-detainees abroad.  Indeed, the Government transferred Hamdi from Guantanamo Bay to the United States naval brig only after it learned that he might be an American citizen.  It is not at all clear why that should make a determinative constitutional difference.

				Even in cases in which the detention of enemy combatants is legally authorized, there remains the question of what process is constitutionally due to a citizen who disputes his enemy-combatant status.  Hamdi argues that he is owed a meaningful and timely hearing and that extra-judicial detention [that] begins and ends with the submission of an affidavit based on third-hand hearsay does not comport with the Fifth and 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>s.  Brief for Petitioners 16.  The Government counters that any more process than was provided below would be both unworkable and constitutionally intolerable.  Brief for Respondents 46.  Our resolution of this dispute requires a careful examination both of the writ of habeas corpus, which Hamdi now seeks to employ as a mechanism of judicial review, and of the Due Process Clause, which informs the procedural contours of that mechanism in this instance.

				Though they reach radically different conclusions on the process that ought to attend the present proceeding, the parties begin on common ground.  All agree that, absent suspension, the writ of habeas corpus remains available to every individual detained within the United States.  U. S. Const., Art. I, §9, cl. 2 (The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it).  Only in the rarest of circumstances has Congress seen fit to suspend the writ.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, Act of Mar. 3, 1863, ch. 81, §1, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">12</a>Stat.
755; Act of April 20, 1871, ch. 22, §4, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">17</a>Stat.
14.  At all other times, it has remained a critical check on the Executive, ensuring that it does not detain individuals except in accordance with law.  See
				<em>
					 INS
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					St. Cyr, 
				</em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">301</a> (2001)
.  All agree suspension of the writ has not occurred here.  Thus, it is undisputed that Hamdi was properly before an Article III court to challenge his detention under 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2241.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2241</a>.  Brief for Respondents 12.  Further, all agree that §2241 and its companion provisions provide at least a skeletal outline of the procedures to be afforded a petitioner in federal habeas review.  Most notably, §2243 provides that the person detained may, under oath, deny any of the facts set forth in the return or allege any other material facts, and §2246 allows the taking of evidence in habeas proceedings by deposition, affidavit, or interrogatories.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The simple outline of §2241 makes clear both that Congress envisioned that habeas petitioners would have some opportunity to present and rebut facts and that courts in cases like this retain some ability to vary the ways in which they do so as mandated by due process.  The Government recognizes the basic procedural protections required by the habeas statute, 
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 3738, but asks us to hold that, given both the flexibility of the habeas mechanism and the circumstances presented in this case, the presentation of the Mobbs Declaration to the habeas court completed the required factual development.  It suggests two separate reasons for its position that no further process is due.
			</p>
        <p class="opcentered">

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				First, the Government urges the adoption of the Fourth Circuits holding belowthat because it is undisputed that Hamdis seizure took place in a combat zone, the habeas determination can be made purely as a matter of law, with no further hearing or factfinding necessary.  This argument is easily rejected.  As the dissenters from the denial of rehearing en banc noted, the circumstances surrounding Hamdis seizure cannot in any way be characterized as undisputed, as those circumstances are neither conceded in fact, nor susceptible to concession in law, because Hamdi has not been permitted to speak for himself or even through counsel as to those circumstances.  337 F. 3d 335, 357 (CA4 2003) (Luttig, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc); see also
				<em>
					 id
				</em>
				., at 371372 (Motz, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).  Further, the facts that constitute the alleged concession are insufficient to support Hamdis detention.  Under the definition of enemy combatant that we accept today as falling within the scope of Congress authorization, Hamdi would need to be part of or supporting forces hostile to the United States or coalition partners and engaged in an armed conflict against the United States to justify his detention in the United States for the duration of the relevant conflict.  Brief for Respondents 3.  The habeas petition states only that [w]hen seized by the United States Government, Mr. Hamdi resided in Afghanistan.  App. 104.  An assertion that one 
				<em>
					resided
				</em>
				 in a country in which combat operations are taking place is not a concession that one was 
				<em>
					captured
				</em>
				 in a zone of active combat operations in a foreign theater of war, 316 F. 3d, at 459 (emphasis added), and certainly is not a concession that one was part of or supporting forces hostile to the United States or coalition partners and engaged in an armed conflict against the United States.  Accordingly, we reject any argument that Hamdi has made concessions that eliminate any right to further process.

        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				The Governments second argument requires closer consideration.  This is the argument that further factual exploration is unwarranted and inappropriate in light of the extraordinary constitutional interests at stake.  Under the Governments most extreme rendition of this argument, [r]espect for separation of powers and the limited institutional capabilities of courts in matters of military decision-making in connection with an ongoing conflict ought to eliminate entirely any individual process, restricting the courts to investigating only whether legal authorization exists for the broader detention scheme.  Brief for Respondents 26.  At most, the Government argues, courts should review its determination that a citizen is an enemy combatant under a very deferential some evidence standard.

				(explaining that the some evidence standard does not require a weighing of the evidence, but rather calls for assessing whether there is any evidence in the record that could support the conclusion)).  Under this review, a court would assume the accuracy of the Governments articulated basis for Hamdis detention, as set forth in the Mobbs Declaration, and assess only whether that articulated basis was a legitimate one.  Brief for Respondents 36; see also
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				316 F. 3d, at 473474 (declining to address whether the some evidence standard should govern the adjudication of such claims, but noting that [t]he factual averments in the [Mobbs] affidavit, if accurate, are sufficient to confirm the legality of Hamdis detention).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In response, Hamdi emphasizes that this Court consistently has recognized that an individual challenging his detention may not be held at the will of the Executive without recourse to some proceeding before a neutral tribunal to determine whether the Executives asserted justifications for that detention have basis in fact and warrant in law.

.  He argues that the Fourth Circuit inappropriately ceded power to the Executive during wartime to define the conduct for which a citizen may be detained, judge whether that citizen has engaged in the proscribed conduct, and imprison that citizen indefinitely, Brief for Petitioners 21, and that due process demands that he receive a hearing in which he may challenge the Mobbs Declaration and adduce his own counter evidence.  The District Court, agreeing with Hamdi, apparently believed that the appropriate process would approach the process that accompanies a criminal trial.  It therefore disapproved of the hearsay nature of the Mobbs Declaration and anticipated quite extensive discovery of various military affairs.  Anything less, it concluded, would not be meaningful judicial review.  App. 291.

				Both of these positions highlight legitimate concerns.  And both emphasize the tension that often exists between the autonomy that the Government asserts is necessary in order to pursue effectively a particular goal and the process that a citizen contends he is due before he is deprived of a constitutional right.  The ordinary mechanism that we use for balancing such serious competing interests, and for determining the procedures that are necessary to ensure that a citizen is not deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law, U.

				With due recognition of these competing concerns, we believe that neither the process proposed by the Government nor the process apparently envisioned by the District Court below strikes the proper constitutional balance when a United States citizen is detained in the United States as an enemy combatant.  That is, the risk of erroneous deprivation of a detainees liberty interest is unacceptably high under the Governments proposed rule, while some of the additional or substitute procedural safeguards suggested by the District Court are unwarranted in light of their limited probable value and the burdens they may impose on the military in such cases.

				At the same time, the exigencies of the circumstances may demand that, aside from these core elements, enemy combatant proceedings may be tailored to alleviate their uncommon potential to burden the Executive at a time of ongoing military conflict.  Hearsay, for example, may need to be accepted as the most reliable available evidence from the Government in such a proceeding.  Likewise, the Constitution would not be offended by a presumption in favor of the Governments evidence, so long as that presumption remained a rebuttable one and fair opportunity for rebuttal were provided.  Thus, once the Government puts forth credible evidence that the habeas petitioner meets the enemy-combatant criteria, the onus could shift to the petitioner to rebut that evidence with more persuasive evidence that he falls outside the criteria.   A burden-shifting scheme of this sort would meet the goal of ensuring that the errant tourist, embedded journalist, or local aid worker has a chance to prove military error while giving due regard to the Executive once it has put forth meaningful support for its conclusion that the detainee is in fact an enemy combatant.  In the words of 
				<em>
					Mathews
				</em>
				, process of this sort would sufficiently address the risk of erroneous deprivation of a detainees liberty interest while eliminating certain procedures that have questionable additional value in light of the burden on the Government.  424 U. S., at 335.

				We think it unlikely that this basic process will have the dire impact on the central functions of warmaking that the Government forecasts.  The parties agree that initial captures on the battlefield need not receive the process we have discussed here; that process is due only when the determination is made to 
				<em>
					continue
				</em>
				 to hold those who have been seized.  The Government has made clear in its briefing that documentation regarding battlefield detainees already is kept in the ordinary course of military affairs.  Brief for Respondents 34.  Any factfinding imposition created by requiring a knowledgeable affiant to summarize these records to an independent tribunal is a minimal one.  Likewise, arguments that military officers ought not have to wage war under the threat of litigation lose much of their steam when factual disputes at enemy-combatant hearings are limited to the alleged combatants acts.  This focus meddles little, if at all, in the strategy or conduct of war, inquiring only into the appropriateness of continuing to detain an individual claimed to have taken up arms against the United States.  While we accord the greatest respect and consideration to the judgments of military authorities in matters relating to the actual prosecution of a war, and recognize that the scope of that discretion necessarily is wide, it does not infringe on the core role of the military for the courts to exercise their own time-honored and constitutionally mandated roles of reviewing and resolving claims like those presented here.

				In sum, while the full protections that accompany challenges to detentions in other settings may prove unworkable and inappropriate in the enemy-combatant setting, the threats to military operations posed by a basic system of independent review are not so weighty as to trump a citizens core rights to challenge meaningfully the

				In so holding, we necessarily reject the Governments assertion that separation of powers principles mandate a heavily circumscribed role for the courts in such circumstances.  Indeed, the position that the courts must forgo any examination of the individual case and focus exclusively on the legality of the broader detention scheme cannot be mandated by any reasonable view of separation of powers, as this approach serves only to 
				<em>

 (The war power is a power to wage war successfully, and thus it permits the harnessing of the entire energies of the people in a supreme cooperative effort to preserve the nation.  But even the war power does not remove constitutional limitations safeguarding essential liberties).  Likewise, we have made clear that, unless Congress acts to suspend it, the Great Writ of habeas corpus allows the Judicial Branch to play a necessary role in maintaining this delicate balance of governance, serving as an important judicial check on the Executives discretion in the realm of detentions.  See
				<em>
					 St. Cyr
				</em>
				, 533 U. S., at 301 (At its historical core, the writ of habeas corpus has served as a means of reviewing the legality of Executive detention, and it is in that context that its protections have been strongest).  Thus, while we do not question that our due process assessment must pay keen attention to the particular burdens faced by the Executive in the context of military action, it would turn our system of checks and balances on its head to suggest that a citizen could not make his way to court with a challenge to the factual basis for his detention by his government, simply because the Executive opposes making available such a challenge.  Absent suspension of the writ by Congress, a citizen detained as an enemy combatant is entitled to this process.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Because we conclude that due process demands some system for a citizen detainee to refute his classification, the proposed some evidence standard is inadequate.  Any process in which the Executives factual assertions go wholly unchallenged or are simply presumed correct without any opportunity for the alleged combatant to demonstrate otherwise falls constitutionally short.  As the Government itself has recognized, we have utilized the some evidence standard in the past as a standard of review, not as a standard of proof.  Brief for Respondents 35.  That is, it primarily has been employed by courts in examining an administrative record developed after an adversarial proceedingone with process at least of the sort that we today hold is constitutionally mandated in the citizen enemy-combatant setting.  See,

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Today we are faced only with such a case.  Aside from unspecified screening processes, Brief for Respondents 34, and military interrogations in which the Government suggests Hamdi could have contested his classification, Tr. of Oral Arg. 40, 42, Hamdi has received no process.  An interrogation by ones captor, however effective an intelligence-gathering tool, hardly constitutes a constitutionally adequate factfinding before a neutral decisionmaker.  Compare Brief for Respondents 4243 (discussing the secure interrogation environment, and noting that military interrogations require a controlled interrogation dynamic and a relationship of trust and dependency and are a critical source of timely and effective intelligence) with

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				There remains the possibility that the standards we have articulated could be met by an appropriately authorized and properly constituted military tribunal.  Indeed, it is notable that military regulations already provide for such process in related instances, dictating that tribunals be made available to determine the status of enemy detainees who assert prisoner-of-war status under the Geneva Convention.  See Enemy Prisoners of War, Retained Personnel, Civilian Internees and Other Detainees, Army Regulation 1908, §16 (1997).  In the absence of such process, however, a court that receives a petition for a writ of habeas corpus from an alleged enemy combatant must itself ensure that the minimum requirements of due process are achieved.  Both courts below recognized as much, focusing their energies on the question of whether Hamdi was due an opportunity to rebut the Governments case against him.  The Government, too, proceeded on this assumption, presenting its affidavit and then seeking that it be evaluated under a deferential standard of review based on burdens that it alleged would accompany any greater process.  As we have discussed, a habeas court in a case such as this may accept affidavit evidence like that contained in the Mobbs Declaration, so long as it also permits the alleged combatant to present his own factual case to rebut the Governments return.  We anticipate that a District Court would proceed with the caution that we have indicated is necessary in this setting, engaging in a factfinding process that is both prudent and incremental.  We have no reason to doubt that courts faced with these sensitive matters will pay proper heed both to the matters of national security that might arise in an individual case and to the constitutional limitations safeguarding essential liberties that remain vibrant even in times of security concerns.

				At this difficult time in our Nations history, we are called upon to consider the legality of the Governments detention of a United States citizen on United States soil as an enemy combatant and to address the process that is constitutionally owed to one who seeks to challenge his classification as such.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that petitioners detention was legally authorized and that he was entitled to no further opportunity to challenge his enemy-combatant label.  We now vacate and remand.  We hold that although Congress authorized the detention of combatants in the narrow circumstances alleged here, due process demands that a citizen held in the United States as an enemy combatant be given a meaningful opportunity to contest the factual basis for that detention before a neutral decisionmaker.

				On September 11, 2001, the al Qaeda terrorist network used hijacked commercial airliners to attack prominent targets in the United States.  Approximately 3,000 people were killed in those attacks.  One week later, in response to these acts of treacherous violence, Congress passed a resolution authorizing the President to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks or harbored such organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons.  Authorization for Use of Military Force (the AUMF),

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				This case arises out of the detention of a man whom the Government alleges took up arms with the Taliban during this conflict.  His name is Yaser Esam Hamdi.  Born an American citizen in Louisiana in 1980, Hamdi moved with his family to Saudi Arabia as a child.  By 2001, the parties agree, he resided in Afghanistan.  At some point that year, he was seized by members of the Northern Alliance, a coalition of military groups opposed to the Taliban government, and eventually was turned over to the United States military.  The Government asserts that it initially detained and interrogated Hamdi in Afghanistan before transferring him to the United States Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay in January 2002.  In April 2002, upon learning that Hamdi is an American citizen, authorities transferred him to a naval brig in Norfolk, Virginia, where he remained until a recent transfer to a brig in Charleston, South Carolina.  The Government contends that Hamdi is an enemy combatant, and that this status justifies holding him in the United States indefinitelywithout formal charges or proceedingsunless and until it makes the determination that access to counsel or further process is warranted.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In June 2002, Hamdis father, Esam Fouad Hamdi, filed the present petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2241.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2241</a> in the Eastern District of Virginia, naming as petitioners his son and himself as next friend.  The elder Hamdi alleges in the petition that he has had no contact with his son since the Government took custody of him in 2001, and that the Government has held his son without access to legal counsel or notice of any charges pending against him.  App. 103, 104.  The petition contends that Hamdis detention was not legally authorized.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 105.  It argues that, [a]s an American citizen, … Hamdi enjoys the full protections of the Constitution, and that Hamdis detention in the United States without charges, access to an impartial tribunal, or assistance of counsel violated and continue[s] to violate the Fifth and 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>s to the United States Constitution.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 107.  The habeas petition asks that the court, among other things, (1) appoint counsel for Hamdi; (2) order respondents to cease interrogating him; (3) declare that he is being held in violation of the Fifth and 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>s; (4) [t]o the extent Respondents contest any material factual allegations in this Petition, schedule an evidentiary hearing, at which Petitioners may adduce proof in support of their allegations; and (5) order that Hamdi be released from his unlawful custody.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 108109.  Although his habeas petition provides no details with regard to the factual circumstances surrounding his sons capture and detention, Hamdis father has asserted in documents found elsewhere in the record that his son went to Afghanistan to do relief work, and that he had been in that country less than two months before September 11, 2001, and could not have received military training.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 188189.  The 20-year-old was traveling on his own for the first time, his father says, and [b]ecause of his lack of experience, he was trapped in Afghanistan once that military campaign began.

				</em>
				., at 188189.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The District Court found that Hamdis father was a proper next friend, appointed the federal public defender as counsel for the petitioners, and ordered that counsel be given access to Hamdi.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 113116.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed that order, holding that the District Court had failed to extend appropriate deference to the Governments security and intelligence interests.  296 F. 3d 278, 279, 283 (2002).  It directed the District Court to consider the most cautious procedures first,

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				On remand, the Government filed a response and a motion to dismiss the petition.  It attached to its response a declaration from one Michael Mobbs (hereinafter Mobbs Declaration), who identified himself as Special Advisor to the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy.  Mobbs indicated that in this position, he has been substantially involved with matters related to the detention of enemy combatants in the current war against the al Qaeda terrorists and those who support and harbor them (including the Taliban).  App. 148.  He expressed his familiar[ity] with Department of Defense and United States military policies and procedures applicable to the detention, control, and transfer of al Qaeda and Taliban personnel, and declared that [b]ased upon my review of relevant records and reports, I am also familiar with the facts and circumstances related to the capture of … Hamdi and his detention by U. S. military forces.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Mobbs then set forth what remains the sole evidentiary support that the Government has provided to the courts for Hamdis detention.  The declaration states that Hamdi traveled to Afghanistan in July or August 2001, and that he thereafter affiliated with a Taliban military unit and received weapons training.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  It asserts that Hamdi remained with his Taliban unit following the attacks of September 11 and that, during the time when Northern Alliance forces were engaged in battle with the Taliban, Hamdis Taliban unit surrendered to those forces, after which he surrender[ed] his Kalishnikov assault rifle to them.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 148149.  The Mobbs Declaration also states that, because al Qaeda and the Taliban were and are hostile forces engaged in armed conflict with the armed forces of the United States, individuals associated with those groups were and continue to be enemy combatants.  
				<em>
					Id

				., at 149.  Mobbs states that Hamdi was labeled an enemy combatant [b]ased upon his interviews and in light of his association with the Taliban.  
				<em>

				.  According to the declaration, a series of U.

				The Government sought to appeal the production order, and the District Court certified the question of whether the Mobbs Declaration,  standing alone, is sufficient as a matter of law to allow meaningful judicial review of [Hamdis] classification as an enemy combatant.  316 F. 3d, at 462.  The Fourth Circuit reversed, but did not squarely answer the certified question.  It instead stressed that, because it was undisputed that Hamdi was captured in a zone of active combat in a foreign theater of conflict, no factual inquiry or evidentiary hearing allowing Hamdi to be heard or to rebut the Governments assertions was necessary or proper.

The Fourth Circuit emphasized that the vital purposes of the detention of uncharged enemy combatantspreventing those combatants from rejoining the enemy while relieving the military of the burden of litigating the circumstances of wartime captures halfway around the globewere interests directly derived from the war powers of Articles I and II.

				On the more global question of whether legal authorization exists for the detention of citizen enemy combatants at all, the Fourth Circuit rejected Hamdis arguments that 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/4001.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. §4001(a)</a> and Article 5 of the Geneva Convention rendered any such detentions unlawful.  The court expressed doubt as to Hamdis argument that §4001(a), which provides that [n]o citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained by the United States except pursuant to an Act of Congress, required express congressional authorization of detentions of this sort.  But it held that, in any event, such authorization was found in the post-September 11 Authorization for Use of Military Force.  316 F. 3d, at 467.  Because capturing and detaining enemy combatants is an inherent part of warfare, the court held, the necessary and appropriate force referenced in the congressional resolution necessarily includes the capture and detention of any and all hostile forces arrayed against our troops.

The court likewise rejected Hamdis Geneva Convention claim, concluding that the convention is not self-executing and that, even if it were, it would not preclude the Executive from detaining Hamdi until the cessation of hostilities.  316 F. 3d, at 468469.

				The threshold question before us is whether the Executive has the authority to detain citizens who qualify as enemy combatants.  There is some debate as to the proper scope of this term, and the Government has never provided any court with the full criteria that it uses in classifying individuals as such.  It has made clear, however, that, for purposes of this case, the enemy combatant that it is seeking to detain is an individual who, it alleges, was  part of or supporting forces hostile to the United States or coalition partners  in Afghanistan and who  engaged in an armed conflict against the United States  there.  Brief for Respondents 3.  We therefore answer only the narrow question before us: whether the detention of citizens falling within that definition is authorized.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The Government maintains that no explicit congressional authorization is required, because the Executive possesses plenary authority to detain pursuant to Article II of the Constitution.  We do not reach the question whether Article II provides such authority, however, because we agree with the Governments alternative position, that Congress has in fact authorized Hamdis detention, through the AUMF.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Our analysis on that point, set forth below, substantially overlaps with our analysis of Hamdis principal argument for the illegality of his detention.  He posits that his detention is forbidden by 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/4001.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. §4001(a)</a>.  Section 4001(a) states that [n]o citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained by the United States except pursuant to an Act of Congress.  Congress passed §4001(a) in 1971 as part of a bill to repeal the Emergency Detention Act of 1950, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/50/811.html" class="subref" title="subref">50 U. S. C. §811</a>

				., which provided procedures for executive detention, during times of emergency, of individuals deemed likely to engage in espionage or sabotage.  Congress was particularly concerned about the possibility that the Act could be used to reprise the Japanese internment camps of World War II.  H. R. Rep. No. 92116 (1971); 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 4 (The concentration camp implications of the legislation render it abhorrent).
				    
				The Government again presses two alternative positions.  First, it argues that §4001(a), in light of its legislative history and its location in Title 18, applies only to the control of civilian prisons and related detentions, not to military detentions.  Brief for Respondents 21.  Second, it maintains that §4001(a) is satisfied, because Hamdi is being detained pursuant to an Act of Congressthe AUMF.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 2122.  Again, because we conclude that the Governments second assertion is correct, we do not address the first.  In other words, for the reasons that follow, we conclude that the AUMF is explicit congressional authorization for the detention of individuals in the narrow category we describe (assuming, without deciding, that such authorization is required), and that the AUMF satisfied §4001(a)s requirement that a detention be pursuant to an Act of Congress (assuming, without deciding, that §4001(a) applies to military detentions).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The AUMF authorizes the President to use all necessary and appropriate force against nations, organizations, or persons associated with the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.  
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">115</a>Stat.
224.  There can be no doubt that individuals who fought against the United States in Afghanistan as part of the Taliban, an organization known to have supported the al Qaeda terrorist network responsible for those attacks, are individuals Congress sought to target in passing the AUMF.  We conclude that detention of individuals falling into the limited category we are considering, for the duration of the particular conflict in which they were captured, is so fundamental and accepted an incident to war as to be an exercise of the necessary and appropriate force Congress has authorized the President to use.

Nor can we see any reason for drawing such a line here.  A citizen, no less than an alien, can be part of or supporting forces hostile to the United States or coalition partners and engaged in an armed conflict against the United States, Brief for Respondents 3; such a citizen, if released, would pose the same threat of returning to the front during the ongoing conflict.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In light of these principles, it is of no moment that the AUMF does not use specific language of detention.  Because detention to prevent a combatants return to the battlefield is a fundamental incident of waging war, in permitting the use of necessary and appropriate force, Congress has clearly and unmistakably authorized detention in the narrow circumstances considered here.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Hamdi objects, nevertheless, that Congress has not authorized the 
				<em>
					indefinite
				</em>
				 detention to which he is now subject.  The Government responds that the detention of enemy combatants during World War II was just as indefinite while that war was being fought.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 16.  We take Hamdis objection to be not to the lack of certainty regarding the date on which the conflict will end, but to the substantial prospect of perpetual detention.  We recognize that the national security underpinnings of the war on terror, although crucially important, are broad and malleable.  As the Government concedes, given its unconventional nature, the current conflict is unlikely to end with a formal cease-fire agreement.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  The prospect Hamdi raises is therefore not far-fetched.  If the Government does not consider this unconventional war won for two generations, and if it maintains during that time that Hamdi might, if released, rejoin forces fighting against the United States, then the position it has taken throughout the litigation of this case suggests that Hamdis detention could last for the rest of his life.

				Hamdi contends that the AUMF does not authorize indefinite or perpetual detention.  Certainly, we agree that indefinite detention for the purpose of interrogation is not authorized.  Further, we understand Congress grant of authority for the use of necessary and appropriate force to include the authority to detain for the duration of the relevant conflict, and our understanding is based on longstanding law-of-war principles.  If the practical circumstances of a given conflict are entirely unlike those of the conflicts that informed the development of the law of war, that understanding may unravel.  But that is not the situation we face as of this date.  Active combat operations against Taliban fighters apparently are ongoing in Afghanistan.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,

The United States may detain, for the duration of these hostilities, individuals legitimately determined to be Taliban combatants who engaged in an armed conflict against the United States.  If the record establishes that United States troops are still involved in active combat in Afghanistan, those detentions are part of the exercise of necessary and appropriate force, and therefore are authorized by the AUMF.

To be clear, our opinion only finds legislative authority to detain under the AUMF once it is sufficiently clear that the individual is, in fact, an enemy combatant; whether that is established by concession or by some other process that verifies this fact with sufficient certainty seems beside the point.

				Even in cases in which the detention of enemy combatants is legally authorized, there remains the question of what process is constitutionally due to a citizen who disputes his enemy-combatant status.  Hamdi argues that he is owed a meaningful and timely hearing and that extra-judicial detention [that] begins and ends with the submission of an affidavit based on third-hand hearsay does not comport with the Fifth and

I, §9, cl. 2 (The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it).  Only in the rarest of circumstances has Congress seen fit to suspend the writ.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, Act of Mar. 3, 1863, ch. 81, §1, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">12</a>Stat.
755; Act of April 20, 1871, ch. 22, §4, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">17</a>Stat.
14.  At all other times, it has remained a critical check on the Executive, ensuring that it does not detain individuals except in accordance with law.  See

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">301</a> (2001)
.  All agree suspension of the writ has not occurred here.  Thus, it is undisputed that Hamdi was properly before an Article III court to challenge his detention under 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2241.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2241</a>.  Brief for Respondents 12.  Further, all agree that §2241 and its companion provisions provide at least a skeletal outline of the procedures to be afforded a petitioner in federal habeas review.  Most notably, §2243 provides that the person detained may, under oath, deny any of the facts set forth in the return or allege any other material facts, and §2246 allows the taking of evidence in habeas proceedings by deposition, affidavit, or interrogatories.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The simple outline of §2241 makes clear both that Congress envisioned that habeas petitioners would have some opportunity to present and rebut facts and that courts in cases like this retain some ability to vary the ways in which they do so as mandated by due process.  The Government recognizes the basic procedural protections required by the habeas statute, 
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 3738, but asks us to hold that, given both the flexibility of the habeas mechanism and the circumstances presented in this case, the presentation of the Mobbs Declaration to the habeas court completed the required factual development.  It suggests two separate reasons for its position that no further process is due.

        <p class="opcentered">

        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				First, the Government urges the adoption of the Fourth Circuits holding belowthat because it is undisputed that Hamdis seizure took place in a combat zone, the habeas determination can be made purely as a matter of law, with no further hearing or factfinding necessary.  This argument is easily rejected.  As the dissenters from the denial of rehearing en banc noted, the circumstances surrounding Hamdis seizure cannot in any way be characterized as undisputed, as those circumstances are neither conceded in fact, nor susceptible to concession in law, because Hamdi has not been permitted to speak for himself or even through counsel as to those circumstances.  337 F. 3d 335, 357 (CA4 2003) (Luttig, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc); see also
				<em>
					 id
				</em>
				., at 371372 (Motz, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).  Further, the facts that constitute the alleged concession are insufficient to support Hamdis detention.  Under the definition of enemy combatant that we accept today as falling within the scope of Congress authorization, Hamdi would need to be part of or supporting forces hostile to the United States or coalition partners and engaged in an armed conflict against the United States to justify his detention in the United States for the duration of the relevant conflict.  Brief for Respondents 3.  The habeas petition states only that [w]hen seized by the United States Government, Mr. Hamdi resided in Afghanistan.  App. 104.  An assertion that one 
				<em>
					resided
				</em>
				 in a country in which combat operations are taking place is not a concession that one was 
				<em>
					captured
				</em>
				 in a zone of active combat operations in a foreign theater of war, 316 F. 3d, at 459 (emphasis added), and certainly is not a concession that one was part of or supporting forces hostile to the United States or coalition partners and engaged in an armed conflict against the United States.  Accordingly, we reject any argument that Hamdi has made concessions that eliminate any right to further process.

				The Governments second argument requires closer consideration.  This is the argument that further factual exploration is unwarranted and inappropriate in light of the extraordinary constitutional interests at stake.  Under the Governments most extreme rendition of this argument, [r]espect for separation of powers and the limited institutional capabilities of courts in matters of military decision-making in connection with an ongoing conflict ought to eliminate entirely any individual process, restricting the courts to investigating only whether legal authorization exists for the broader detention scheme.  Brief for Respondents 26.  At most, the Government argues, courts should review its determination that a citizen is an enemy combatant under a very deferential some evidence standard.

				(explaining that the some evidence standard does not require a weighing of the evidence, but rather calls for assessing whether there is any evidence in the record that could support the conclusion)).  Under this review, a court would assume the accuracy of the Governments articulated basis for Hamdis detention, as set forth in the Mobbs Declaration, and assess only whether that articulated basis was a legitimate one.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In response, Hamdi emphasizes that this Court consistently has recognized that an individual challenging his detention may not be held at the will of the Executive without recourse to some proceeding before a neutral tribunal to determine whether the Executives asserted justifications for that detention have basis in fact and warrant in law.

He argues that the Fourth Circuit inappropriately ceded power to the Executive during wartime to define the conduct for which a citizen may be detained, judge whether that citizen has engaged in the proscribed conduct, and imprison that citizen indefinitely, Brief for Petitioners 21, and that due process demands that he receive a hearing in which he may challenge the Mobbs Declaration and adduce his own counter evidence.  The District Court, agreeing with Hamdi, apparently believed that the appropriate process would approach the process that accompanies a criminal trial.  It therefore disapproved of the hearsay nature of the Mobbs Declaration and anticipated quite extensive discovery of various military affairs.  Anything less, it concluded, would not be meaningful judicial review.  App. 291.

				Both of these positions highlight legitimate concerns.  And both emphasize the tension that often exists between the autonomy that the Government asserts is necessary in order to pursue effectively a particular goal and the process that a citizen contends he is due before he is deprived of a constitutional right.  The ordinary mechanism that we use for balancing such serious competing interests, and for determining the procedures that are necessary to ensure that a citizen is not deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law, U.

				With due recognition of these competing concerns, we believe that neither the process proposed by the Government nor the process apparently envisioned by the District Court below strikes the proper constitutional balance when a United States citizen is detained in the United States as an enemy combatant.  That is, the risk of erroneous deprivation of a detainees liberty interest is unacceptably high under the Governments proposed rule, while some of the additional or substitute procedural safeguards suggested by the District Court are unwarranted in light of their limited probable value and the burdens they may impose on the military in such cases.

				At the same time, the exigencies of the circumstances may demand that, aside from these core elements, enemy combatant proceedings may be tailored to alleviate their uncommon potential to burden the Executive at a time of ongoing military conflict.  Hearsay, for example, may need to be accepted as the most reliable available evidence from the Government in such a proceeding.  Likewise, the Constitution would not be offended by a presumption in favor of the Governments evidence, so long as that presumption remained a rebuttable one and fair opportunity for rebuttal were provided.  Thus, once the Government puts forth credible evidence that the habeas petitioner meets the enemy-combatant criteria, the onus could shift to the petitioner to rebut that evidence with more persuasive evidence that he falls outside the criteria.   A burden-shifting scheme of this sort would meet the goal of ensuring that the errant tourist, embedded journalist, or local aid worker has a chance to prove military error while giving due regard to the Executive once it has put forth meaningful support for its conclusion that the detainee is in fact an enemy combatant.  In the words of 
				<em>
					Mathews

				We think it unlikely that this basic process will have the dire impact on the central functions of warmaking that the Government forecasts.  The parties agree that initial captures on the battlefield need not receive the process we have discussed here; that process is due only when the determination is made to 
				<em>

				</em>
				 to hold those who have been seized.  The Government has made clear in its briefing that documentation regarding battlefield detainees already is kept in the ordinary course of military affairs.  Brief for Respondents 34.  Any factfinding imposition created by requiring a knowledgeable affiant to summarize these records to an independent tribunal is a minimal one.  Likewise, arguments that military officers ought not have to wage war under the threat of litigation lose much of their steam when factual disputes at enemy-combatant hearings are limited to the alleged combatants acts.  This focus meddles little, if at all, in the strategy or conduct of war, inquiring only into the appropriateness of continuing to detain an individual claimed to have taken up arms against the United States.  While we accord the greatest respect and consideration to the judgments of military authorities in matters relating to the actual prosecution of a war, and recognize that the scope of that discretion necessarily is wide, it does not infringe on the core role of the military for the courts to exercise their own time-honored and constitutionally mandated roles of reviewing and resolving claims like those presented here.

				In sum, while the full protections that accompany challenges to detentions in other settings may prove unworkable and inappropriate in the enemy-combatant setting, the threats to military operations posed by a basic system of independent review are not so weighty as to trump a citizens core rights to challenge meaningfully the

				In so holding, we necessarily reject the Governments assertion that separation of powers principles mandate a heavily circumscribed role for the courts in such circumstances.  Indeed, the position that the courts must forgo any examination of the individual case and focus exclusively on the legality of the broader detention scheme cannot be mandated by any reasonable view of separation of powers, as this approach serves only to 
				<em>

				 power into a single branch of government.  We have long since made clear that a state of war is not a blank check for the President when it comes to the rights of the Nations citizens.

 (The war power is a power to wage war successfully, and thus it permits the harnessing of the entire energies of the people in a supreme cooperative effort to preserve the nation.  But even the war power does not remove constitutional limitations safeguarding essential liberties).  Likewise, we have made clear that, unless Congress acts to suspend it, the Great Writ of habeas corpus allows the Judicial Branch to play a necessary role in maintaining this delicate balance of governance, serving as an important judicial check on the Executives discretion in the realm of detentions.  See
				<em>
					 St. Cyr
				</em>
				, 533 U. S., at 301 (At its historical core, the writ of habeas corpus has served as a means of reviewing the legality of Executive detention, and it is in that context that its protections have been strongest).  Thus, while we do not question that our due process assessment must pay keen attention to the particular burdens faced by the Executive in the context of military action, it would turn our system of checks and balances on its head to suggest that a citizen could not make his way to court with a challenge to the factual basis for his detention by his government, simply because the Executive opposes making available such a challenge.  Absent suspension of the writ by Congress, a citizen detained as an enemy combatant is entitled to this process.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Because we conclude that due process demands some system for a citizen detainee to refute his classification, the proposed some evidence standard is inadequate.  Any process in which the Executives factual assertions go wholly unchallenged or are simply presumed correct without any opportunity for the alleged combatant to demonstrate otherwise falls constitutionally short.  As the Government itself has recognized, we have utilized the some evidence standard in the past as a standard of review, not as a standard of proof.  Brief for Respondents 35.  That is, it primarily has been employed by courts in examining an administrative record developed after an adversarial proceedingone with process at least of the sort that we today hold is constitutionally mandated in the citizen enemy-combatant setting.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Today we are faced only with such a case.  Aside from unspecified screening processes, Brief for Respondents 34, and military interrogations in which the Government suggests Hamdi could have contested his classification, Tr. of Oral Arg. 40, 42, Hamdi has received no process.  An interrogation by ones captor, however effective an intelligence-gathering tool, hardly constitutes a constitutionally adequate factfinding before a neutral decisionmaker.  Compare Brief for Respondents 4243 (discussing the secure interrogation environment, and noting that military interrogations require a controlled interrogation dynamic and a relationship of trust and dependency and are a critical source of timely and effective intelligence) with

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				There remains the possibility that the standards we have articulated could be met by an appropriately authorized and properly constituted military tribunal.  Indeed, it is notable that military regulations already provide for such process in related instances, dictating that tribunals be made available to determine the status of enemy detainees who assert prisoner-of-war status under the Geneva Convention.  See Enemy Prisoners of War, Retained Personnel, Civilian Internees and Other Detainees, Army Regulation 1908, §16 (1997).  In the absence of such process, however, a court that receives a petition for a writ of habeas corpus from an alleged enemy combatant must itself ensure that the minimum requirements of due process are achieved.  Both courts below recognized as much, focusing their energies on the question of whether Hamdi was due an opportunity to rebut the Governments case against him.  The Government, too, proceeded on this assumption, presenting its affidavit and then seeking that it be evaluated under a deferential standard of review based on burdens that it alleged would accompany any greater process.  As we have discussed, a habeas court in a case such as this may accept affidavit evidence like that contained in the Mobbs Declaration, so long as it also permits the alleged combatant to present his own factual case to rebut the Governments return.  We anticipate that a District Court would proceed with the caution that we have indicated is necessary in this setting, engaging in a factfinding process that is both prudent and incremental.  We have no reason to doubt that courts faced with these sensitive matters will pay proper heed both to the matters of national security that might arise in an individual case and to the constitutional limitations safeguarding essential liberties that remain vibrant even in times of security concerns.

				At this difficult time in our Nations history, we are called upon to consider the legality of the Governments detention of a United States citizen on United States soil as an enemy combatant and to address the process that is constitutionally owed to one who seeks to challenge his classification as such.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that petitioners detention was legally authorized and that he was entitled to no further opportunity to challenge his enemy-combatant label.  We now vacate and remand.  We hold that although Congress authorized the detention of combatants in the narrow circumstances alleged here, due process demands that a citizen held in the United States as an enemy combatant be given a meaningful opportunity to contest the factual basis for that detention before a neutral decisionmaker.

				On September 11, 2001, the al Qaeda terrorist network used hijacked commercial airliners to attack prominent targets in the United States.  Approximately 3,000 people were killed in those attacks.  One week later, in response to these acts of treacherous violence, Congress passed a resolution authorizing the President to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks or harbored such organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons.  Authorization for Use of Military Force (the AUMF),

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				This case arises out of the detention of a man whom the Government alleges took up arms with the Taliban during this conflict.  His name is Yaser Esam Hamdi.  Born an American citizen in Louisiana in 1980, Hamdi moved with his family to Saudi Arabia as a child.  By 2001, the parties agree, he resided in Afghanistan.  At some point that year, he was seized by members of the Northern Alliance, a coalition of military groups opposed to the Taliban government, and eventually was turned over to the United States military.  The Government asserts that it initially detained and interrogated Hamdi in Afghanistan before transferring him to the United States Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay in January 2002.  In April 2002, upon learning that Hamdi is an American citizen, authorities transferred him to a naval brig in Norfolk, Virginia, where he remained until a recent transfer to a brig in Charleston, South Carolina.  The Government contends that Hamdi is an enemy combatant, and that this status justifies holding him in the United States indefinitelywithout formal charges or proceedingsunless and until it makes the determination that access to counsel or further process is warranted.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In June 2002, Hamdis father, Esam Fouad Hamdi, filed the present petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2241.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2241</a> in the Eastern District of Virginia, naming as petitioners his son and himself as next friend.  The elder Hamdi alleges in the petition that he has had no contact with his son since the Government took custody of him in 2001, and that the Government has held his son without access to legal counsel or notice of any charges pending against him.  App. 103, 104.  The petition contends that Hamdis detention was not legally authorized.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 105.  It argues that, [a]s an American citizen, … Hamdi enjoys the full protections of the Constitution, and that Hamdis detention in the United States without charges, access to an impartial tribunal, or assistance of counsel violated and continue[s] to violate the Fifth and 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>s to the United States Constitution.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 107.  The habeas petition asks that the court, among other things, (1) appoint counsel for Hamdi; (2) order respondents to cease interrogating him; (3) declare that he is being held in violation of the Fifth and 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>s; (4) [t]o the extent Respondents contest any material factual allegations in this Petition, schedule an evidentiary hearing, at which Petitioners may adduce proof in support of their allegations; and (5) order that Hamdi be released from his unlawful custody.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 108109.  Although his habeas petition provides no details with regard to the factual circumstances surrounding his sons capture and detention, Hamdis father has asserted in documents found elsewhere in the record that his son went to Afghanistan to do relief work, and that he had been in that country less than two months before September 11, 2001, and could not have received military training.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 188189.  The 20-year-old was traveling on his own for the first time, his father says, and [b]ecause of his lack of experience, he was trapped in Afghanistan once that military campaign began.

					Id
				</em>
				., at 188189.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The District Court found that Hamdis father was a proper next friend, appointed the federal public defender as counsel for the petitioners, and ordered that counsel be given access to Hamdi.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 113116.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed that order, holding that the District Court had failed to extend appropriate deference to the Governments security and intelligence interests.  296 F. 3d 278, 279, 283 (2002).  It directed the District Court to consider the most cautious procedures first, 
				<em>

				<em>

				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				On remand, the Government filed a response and a motion to dismiss the petition.  It attached to its response a declaration from one Michael Mobbs (hereinafter Mobbs Declaration), who identified himself as Special Advisor to the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy.  Mobbs indicated that in this position, he has been substantially involved with matters related to the detention of enemy combatants in the current war against the al Qaeda terrorists and those who support and harbor them (including the Taliban).  App. 148.  He expressed his familiar[ity] with Department of Defense and United States military policies and procedures applicable to the detention, control, and transfer of al Qaeda and Taliban personnel, and declared that [b]ased upon my review of relevant records and reports, I am also familiar with the facts and circumstances related to the capture of … Hamdi and his detention by U. S. military forces.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Mobbs then set forth what remains the sole evidentiary support that the Government has provided to the courts for Hamdis detention.  The declaration states that Hamdi traveled to Afghanistan in July or August 2001, and that he thereafter affiliated with a Taliban military unit and received weapons training.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  It asserts that Hamdi remained with his Taliban unit following the attacks of September 11 and that, during the time when Northern Alliance forces were engaged in battle with the Taliban, Hamdis Taliban unit surrendered to those forces, after which he surrender[ed] his Kalishnikov assault rifle to them.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 148149.  The Mobbs Declaration also states that, because al Qaeda and the Taliban were and are hostile forces engaged in armed conflict with the armed forces of the United States, individuals associated with those groups were and continue to be enemy combatants.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 149.  Mobbs states that Hamdi was labeled an enemy combatant [b]ased upon his interviews and in light of his association with the Taliban.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  According to the declaration, a series of U. S. military screening team[s] determined that Hamdi met the criteria for enemy combatants, and a subsequent interview of Hamdi has confirmed that he surrendered and gave his firearm to Northern Alliance forces, which supports his classification as an enemy combatant.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 149150.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				After the Government submitted this declaration, the Fourth Circuit directed the District Court to proceed in accordance with its earlier ruling and, specifically, to  consider the sufficiency of the Mobbs Declaration as an independent matter before proceeding further.   316 F. 3d at 450, 462 (2003)
				.  
				The District Court found that the Mobbs Declaration fell far short of supporting Hamdis detention.  App. 292.  It criticized the generic and hearsay nature of the affidavit, calling it little more than the governments say-so.   
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 298.  It ordered the Government to turn over numerous materials for 
				<em>
					in camera 
				</em>
				review, including copies of all of Hamdis statements and the notes taken from interviews with him that related to his reasons for going to Afghanistan and his activities therein; a list of all interrogators who had questioned Hamdi and their names and addresses; statements by members of the Northern Alliance regarding Hamdis surrender and capture; a list of the dates and locations of his capture and subsequent detentions; and the names and titles of the United States Government officials who made the determinations that Hamdi was an enemy combatant and that he should be moved to a naval brig.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 185186.  The court indicated that all of these materials were necessary for meaningful judicial review of whether Hamdis detention was legally authorized and whether Hamdi had received sufficient process to satisfy the Due Process Clause of the Constitution and relevant treaties or military regulations.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 291292.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Government sought to appeal the production order, and the District Court certified the question of whether the Mobbs Declaration,  standing alone, is sufficient as a matter of law to allow meaningful judicial review of [Hamdis] classification as an enemy combatant.  316 F. 3d, at 462.  The Fourth Circuit reversed, but did not squarely answer the certified question.  It instead stressed that, because it was undisputed that Hamdi was captured in a zone of active combat in a foreign theater of conflict, no factual inquiry or evidentiary hearing allowing Hamdi to be heard or to rebut the Governments assertions was necessary or proper.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 459.  Concluding that the factual averments in the Mobbs Declaration, if accurate, provided a sufficient basis upon which to conclude that the President had constitutionally detained Hamdi pursuant to the Presidents war powers, it ordered the habeas petition dismissed.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 473.  The Fourth Circuit emphasized that the vital purposes of the detention of uncharged enemy combatantspreventing those combatants from rejoining the enemy while relieving the military of the burden of litigating the circumstances of wartime captures halfway around the globewere interests directly derived from the war powers of Articles I and II.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 465466.  In that courts view, because Article III contains nothing analogous to the specific powers of war so carefully enumerated in Articles I and II, 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 463, separation of powers principles prohibited a federal court from delv[ing] further into Hamdis status and capture,  
				<em>
					id

				., at 473.  Accordingly, the District Courts more vigorous inquiry went far beyond the acceptable scope of review.  
				<em>

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				On the more global question of whether legal authorization exists for the detention of citizen enemy combatants at all, the Fourth Circuit rejected Hamdis arguments that 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/4001.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. §4001(a)</a> and Article 5 of the Geneva Convention rendered any such detentions unlawful.  The court expressed doubt as to Hamdis argument that §4001(a), which provides that [n]o citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained by the United States except pursuant to an Act of Congress, required express congressional authorization of detentions of this sort.  But it held that, in any event, such authorization was found in the post-September 11 Authorization for Use of Military Force.  316 F. 3d, at 467.  Because capturing and detaining enemy combatants is an inherent part of warfare, the court held, the necessary and appropriate force referenced in the congressional resolution necessarily includes the capture and detention of any and all hostile forces arrayed against our troops.

				The threshold question before us is whether the Executive has the authority to detain citizens who qualify as enemy combatants.  There is some debate as to the proper scope of this term, and the Government has never provided any court with the full criteria that it uses in classifying individuals as such.  It has made clear, however, that, for purposes of this case, the enemy combatant that it is seeking to detain is an individual who, it alleges, was  part of or supporting forces hostile to the United States or coalition partners  in Afghanistan and who  engaged in an armed conflict against the United States  there.  Brief for Respondents 3.  We therefore answer only the narrow question before us: whether the detention of citizens falling within that definition is authorized.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The Government maintains that no explicit congressional authorization is required, because the Executive possesses plenary authority to detain pursuant to Article II of the Constitution.  We do not reach the question whether Article II provides such authority, however, because we agree with the Governments alternative position, that Congress has in fact authorized Hamdis detention, through the AUMF.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Our analysis on that point, set forth below, substantially overlaps with our analysis of Hamdis principal argument for the illegality of his detention.  He posits that his detention is forbidden by 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/4001.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. §4001(a)</a>.  Section 4001(a) states that [n]o citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained by the United States except pursuant to an Act of Congress.  Congress passed §4001(a) in 1971 as part of a bill to repeal the Emergency Detention Act of 1950, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/50/811.html" class="subref" title="subref">50 U. S. C. §811</a>

				., which provided procedures for executive detention, during times of emergency, of individuals deemed likely to engage in espionage or sabotage.  Congress was particularly concerned about the possibility that the Act could be used to reprise the Japanese internment camps of World War II.  H. R. Rep. No. 92116 (1971); 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 4 (The concentration camp implications of the legislation render it abhorrent).
				    
				The Government again presses two alternative positions.  First, it argues that §4001(a), in light of its legislative history and its location in Title 18, applies only to the control of civilian prisons and related detentions, not to military detentions.  Brief for Respondents 21.  Second, it maintains that §4001(a) is satisfied, because Hamdi is being detained pursuant to an Act of Congressthe AUMF.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 2122.  Again, because we conclude that the Governments second assertion is correct, we do not address the first.  In other words, for the reasons that follow, we conclude that the AUMF is explicit congressional authorization for the detention of individuals in the narrow category we describe (assuming, without deciding, that such authorization is required), and that the AUMF satisfied §4001(a)s requirement that a detention be pursuant to an Act of Congress (assuming, without deciding, that §4001(a) applies to military detentions).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The AUMF authorizes the President to use all necessary and appropriate force against nations, organizations, or persons associated with the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

224.  There can be no doubt that individuals who fought against the United States in Afghanistan as part of the Taliban, an organization known to have supported the al Qaeda terrorist network responsible for those attacks, are individuals Congress sought to target in passing the AUMF.  We conclude that detention of individuals falling into the limited category we are considering, for the duration of the particular conflict in which they were captured, is so fundamental and accepted an incident to war as to be an exercise of the necessary and appropriate force Congress has authorized the President to use.

Nor can we see any reason for drawing such a line here.  A citizen, no less than an alien, can be part of or supporting forces hostile to the United States or coalition partners and engaged in an armed conflict against the United States, Brief for Respondents 3; such a citizen, if released, would pose the same threat of returning to the front during the ongoing conflict.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In light of these principles, it is of no moment that the AUMF does not use specific language of detention.  Because detention to prevent a combatants return to the battlefield is a fundamental incident of waging war, in permitting the use of necessary and appropriate force, Congress has clearly and unmistakably authorized detention in the narrow circumstances considered here.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Hamdi objects, nevertheless, that Congress has not authorized the 
				<em>
					indefinite
				</em>
				 detention to which he is now subject.  The Government responds that the detention of enemy combatants during World War II was just as indefinite while that war was being fought.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 16.  We take Hamdis objection to be not to the lack of certainty regarding the date on which the conflict will end, but to the substantial prospect of perpetual detention.  We recognize that the national security underpinnings of the war on terror, although crucially important, are broad and malleable.  As the Government concedes, given its unconventional nature, the current conflict is unlikely to end with a formal cease-fire agreement.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  The prospect Hamdi raises is therefore not far-fetched.  If the Government does not consider this unconventional war won for two generations, and if it maintains during that time that Hamdi might, if released, rejoin forces fighting against the United States, then the position it has taken throughout the litigation of this case suggests that Hamdis detention could last for the rest of his life.

				Hamdi contends that the AUMF does not authorize indefinite or perpetual detention.  Certainly, we agree that indefinite detention for the purpose of interrogation is not authorized.  Further, we understand Congress grant of authority for the use of necessary and appropriate force to include the authority to detain for the duration of the relevant conflict, and our understanding is based on longstanding law-of-war principles.  If the practical circumstances of a given conflict are entirely unlike those of the conflicts that informed the development of the law of war, that understanding may unravel.  But that is not the situation we face as of this date.  Active combat operations against Taliban fighters apparently are ongoing in Afghanistan.  See, 
				<em>

The United States may detain, for the duration of these hostilities, individuals legitimately determined to be Taliban combatants who engaged in an armed conflict against the United States.  If the record establishes that United States troops are still involved in active combat in Afghanistan, those detentions are part of the exercise of necessary and appropriate force, and therefore are authorized by the AUMF.

He does not explain how his historical analysis supports the addition of a third optiondetention under some other process after concession of enemy-combatant statusor why a concession should carry any different effect than proof of enemy-combatant status in a proceeding that comports with due process.  To be clear, our opinion only finds legislative authority to detain under the AUMF once it is sufficiently clear that the individual is, in fact, an enemy combatant; whether that is established by concession or by some other process that verifies this fact with sufficient certainty seems beside the point.

Indeed, the Government transferred Hamdi from Guantanamo Bay to the United States naval brig only after it learned that he might be an American citizen.

				Even in cases in which the detention of enemy combatants is legally authorized, there remains the question of what process is constitutionally due to a citizen who disputes his enemy-combatant status.  Hamdi argues that he is owed a meaningful and timely hearing and that extra-judicial detention [that] begins and ends with the submission of an affidavit based on third-hand hearsay does not comport with the Fifth and

The Government counters that any more process than was provided below would be both unworkable and constitutionally intolerable.  Brief for Respondents 46.  Our resolution of this dispute requires a careful examination both of the writ of habeas corpus, which Hamdi now seeks to employ as a mechanism of judicial review, and of the Due Process Clause, which informs the procedural contours of that mechanism in this instance.

				Though they reach radically different conclusions on the process that ought to attend the present proceeding, the parties begin on common ground.  All agree that, absent suspension, the writ of habeas corpus remains available to every individual detained within the United States.  U. S. Const., Art. I, §9, cl. 2 (The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it).  Only in the rarest of circumstances has Congress seen fit to suspend the writ.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, Act of Mar. 3, 1863, ch. 81, §1, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">12</a>Stat.
755; Act of April 20, 1871, ch. 22, §4, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">17</a>Stat.
14.  At all other times, it has remained a critical check on the Executive, ensuring that it does not detain individuals except in accordance with law.  See
				<em>
					 INS
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					St. Cyr,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">301</a> (2001)
.  All agree suspension of the writ has not occurred here.  Thus, it is undisputed that Hamdi was properly before an Article III court to challenge his detention under 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2241.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. §2241</a>.  Brief for Respondents 12.  Further, all agree that §2241 and its companion provisions provide at least a skeletal outline of the procedures to be afforded a petitioner in federal habeas review.  Most notably, §2243 provides that the person detained may, under oath, deny any of the facts set forth in the return or allege any other material facts, and §2246 allows the taking of evidence in habeas proceedings by deposition, affidavit, or interrogatories.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The simple outline of §2241 makes clear both that Congress envisioned that habeas petitioners would have some opportunity to present and rebut facts and that courts in cases like this retain some ability to vary the ways in which they do so as mandated by due process.  The Government recognizes the basic procedural protections required by the habeas statute, 
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 3738, but asks us to hold that, given both the flexibility of the habeas mechanism and the circumstances presented in this case, the presentation of the Mobbs Declaration to the habeas court completed the required factual development.

        <p class="opcentered">

        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				First, the Government urges the adoption of the Fourth Circuits holding belowthat because it is undisputed that Hamdis seizure took place in a combat zone, the habeas determination can be made purely as a matter of law, with no further hearing or factfinding necessary.  This argument is easily rejected.  As the dissenters from the denial of rehearing en banc noted, the circumstances surrounding Hamdis seizure cannot in any way be characterized as undisputed, as those circumstances are neither conceded in fact, nor susceptible to concession in law, because Hamdi has not been permitted to speak for himself or even through counsel as to those circumstances.  337 F. 3d 335, 357 (CA4 2003) (Luttig, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc); see also
				<em>
					 id
				</em>
				., at 371372 (Motz, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).  Further, the facts that constitute the alleged concession are insufficient to support Hamdis detention.  Under the definition of enemy combatant that we accept today as falling within the scope of Congress authorization, Hamdi would need to be part of or supporting forces hostile to the United States or coalition partners and engaged in an armed conflict against the United States to justify his detention in the United States for the duration of the relevant conflict.  Brief for Respondents 3.  The habeas petition states only that [w]hen seized by the United States Government, Mr. Hamdi resided in Afghanistan.  App. 104.  An assertion that one 
				<em>
					resided
				</em>
				 in a country in which combat operations are taking place is not a concession that one was 
				<em>
					captured
				</em>
				 in a zone of active combat operations in a foreign theater of war, 316 F. 3d, at 459 (emphasis added), and certainly is not a concession that one was part of or supporting forces hostile to the United States or coalition partners and engaged in an armed conflict against the United States.  Accordingly, we reject any argument that Hamdi has made concessions that eliminate any right to further process.

				The Governments second argument requires closer consideration.  This is the argument that further factual exploration is unwarranted and inappropriate in light of the extraordinary constitutional interests at stake.  Under the Governments most extreme rendition of this argument, [r]espect for separation of powers and the limited institutional capabilities of courts in matters of military decision-making in connection with an ongoing conflict ought to eliminate entirely any individual process, restricting the courts to investigating only whether legal authorization exists for the broader detention scheme.  Brief for Respondents 26.  At most, the Government argues, courts should review its determination that a citizen is an enemy combatant under a very deferential some evidence standard.

				With due recognition of these competing concerns, we believe that neither the process proposed by the Government nor the process apparently envisioned by the District Court below strikes the proper constitutional balance when a United States citizen is detained in the United States as an enemy combatant.  That is, the risk of erroneous deprivation of a detainees liberty interest is unacceptably high under the Governments proposed rule, while some of the additional or substitute procedural safeguards suggested by the District Court are unwarranted in light of their limited probable value and the burdens they may impose on the military in such cases.

				At the same time, the exigencies of the circumstances may demand that, aside from these core elements, enemy combatant proceedings may be tailored to alleviate their uncommon potential to burden the Executive at a time of ongoing military conflict.  Hearsay, for example, may need to be accepted as the most reliable available evidence from the Government in such a proceeding.  Likewise, the Constitution would not be offended by a presumption in favor of the Governments evidence, so long as that presumption remained a rebuttable one and fair opportunity for rebuttal were provided.  Thus, once the Government puts forth credible evidence that the habeas petitioner meets the enemy-combatant criteria, the onus could shift to the petitioner to rebut that evidence with more persuasive evidence that he falls outside the criteria.   A burden-shifting scheme of this sort would meet the goal of ensuring that the errant tourist, embedded journalist, or local aid worker has a chance to prove military error while giving due regard to the Executive once it has put forth meaningful support for its conclusion that the detainee is in fact an enemy combatant.  In the words of 
				<em>
					Mathews
				</em>
				, process of this sort would sufficiently address the risk of erroneous deprivation of a detainees liberty interest while eliminating certain procedures that have questionable additional value in light of the burden on the Government.  424 U. S., at 335.

				We think it unlikely that this basic process will have the dire impact on the central functions of warmaking that the Government forecasts.  The parties agree that initial captures on the battlefield need not receive the process we have discussed here; that process is due only when the determination is made to 
				<em>
					continue
				</em>
				 to hold those who have been seized.  The Government has made clear in its briefing that documentation regarding battlefield detainees already is kept in the ordinary course of military affairs.  Brief for Respondents 34.  Any factfinding imposition created by requiring a knowledgeable affiant to summarize these records to an independent tribunal is a minimal one.  Likewise, arguments that military officers ought not have to wage war under the threat of litigation lose much of their steam when factual disputes at enemy-combatant hearings are limited to the alleged combatants acts.  This focus meddles little, if at all, in the strategy or conduct of war, inquiring only into the appropriateness of continuing to detain an individual claimed to have taken up arms against the United States.  While we accord the greatest respect and consideration to the judgments of military authorities in matters relating to the actual prosecution of a war, and recognize that the scope of that discretion necessarily is wide, it does not infringe on the core role of the military for the courts to exercise their own time-honored and constitutionally mandated roles of reviewing and resolving claims like those presented here.

Indeed, the position that the courts must forgo any examination of the individual case and focus exclusively on the legality of the broader detention scheme cannot be mandated by any reasonable view of separation of powers, as this approach serves only to

But even the war power does not remove constitutional limitations safeguarding essential liberties).  Likewise, we have made clear that, unless Congress acts to suspend it, the Great Writ of habeas corpus allows the Judicial Branch to play a necessary role in maintaining this delicate balance of governance, serving as an important judicial check on the Executives discretion in the realm of detentions.  See
				<em>
					 St. Cyr
				</em>
				, 533 U. S., at 301 (At its historical core, the writ of habeas corpus has served as a means of reviewing the legality of Executive detention, and it is in that context that its protections have been strongest).  Thus, while we do not question that our due process assessment must pay keen attention to the particular burdens faced by the Executive in the context of military action, it would turn our system of checks and balances on its head to suggest that a citizen could not make his way to court with a challenge to the factual basis for his detention by his government, simply because the Executive opposes making available such a challenge.  Absent suspension of the writ by Congress, a citizen detained as an enemy combatant is entitled to this process.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Because we conclude that due process demands some system for a citizen detainee to refute his classification, the proposed some evidence standard is inadequate.  Any process in which the Executives factual assertions go wholly unchallenged or are simply presumed correct without any opportunity for the alleged combatant to demonstrate otherwise falls constitutionally short.  As the Government itself has recognized, we have utilized the some evidence standard in the past as a standard of review, not as a standard of proof.  Brief for Respondents 35.  That is, it primarily has been employed by courts in examining an administrative record developed after an adversarial proceedingone with process at least of the sort that we today hold is constitutionally mandated in the citizen enemy-combatant setting.

Aside from unspecified screening processes, Brief for Respondents 34, and military interrogations in which the Government suggests Hamdi could have contested his classification, Tr. of Oral Arg. 40, 42, Hamdi has received no process.  An interrogation by ones captor, however effective an intelligence-gathering tool, hardly constitutes a constitutionally adequate factfinding before a neutral decisionmaker.  Compare Brief for Respondents 4243 (discussing the secure interrogation environment, and noting that military interrogations require a controlled interrogation dynamic and a relationship of trust and dependency and are a critical source of timely and effective intelligence) with

				There remains the possibility that the standards we have articulated could be met by an appropriately authorized and properly constituted military tribunal.  Indeed, it is notable that military regulations already provide for such process in related instances, dictating that tribunals be made available to determine the status of enemy detainees who assert prisoner-of-war status under the Geneva Convention.  See Enemy Prisoners of War, Retained Personnel, Civilian Internees and Other Detainees, Army Regulation 1908, §16 (1997).  In the absence of such process, however, a court that receives a petition for a writ of habeas corpus from an alleged enemy combatant must itself ensure that the minimum requirements of due process are achieved.  Both courts below recognized as much, focusing their energies on the question of whether Hamdi was due an opportunity to rebut the Governments case against him.  The Government, too, proceeded on this assumption, presenting its affidavit and then seeking that it be evaluated under a deferential standard of review based on burdens that it alleged would accompany any greater process.  As we have discussed, a habeas court in a case such as this may accept affidavit evidence like that contained in the Mobbs Declaration, so long as it also permits the alleged combatant to present his own factual case to rebut the Governments return.  We anticipate that a District Court would proceed with the caution that we have indicated is necessary in this setting, engaging in a factfinding process that is both prudent and incremental.  We have no reason to doubt that courts faced with these sensitive matters will pay proper heed both to the matters of national security that might arise in an individual case and to the constitutional limitations safeguarding essential liberties that remain vibrant even in times of security concerns.

				According to Yaser Hamdis petition for writ of habeas corpus, brought on his behalf by his father, the Government of the United States is detaining him, an American citizen on American soil, with the explanation that he was seized on the field of battle in Afghanistan, having been on the enemy side.  It is undisputed that the Government has not charged him with espionage, treason, or any other crime under domestic law.  It is likewise undisputed that for one year and nine months, on the basis of an Executive designation of Hamdi as an enemy combatant, the Government denied him the right to send or receive any communication beyond the prison where he was held and, in particular, denied him access to counsel to represent him.

            </a>
				  The Government asserts a right to hold Hamdi under these conditions indefinitely, that is, until the Government determines that the United States is no longer threatened by the terrorism exemplified in the attacks of September 11, 2001.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In these proceedings on Hamdis petition, he seeks to challenge the facts claimed by the Government as the basis for holding him as an enemy combatant.  And in this Court he presses the distinct argument that the Governments claim, even if true, would not implicate any authority for holding him that would satisfy 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/4001.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. §4001(a)</a> (Non-Detention Act), which bars imprisonment
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				or detention of a citizen except pursuant to an Act of Congress.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Government responds that Hamdis incommunicado imprisonment as an enemy combatant seized on the field of battle falls within the Presidents power as Commander in Chief under the laws and usages of war, and is in any event authorized by two statutes.  Accordingly, the Government contends that Hamdi has no basis for any challenge by petition for habeas except to his own status as an enemy combatant; and even that challenge may go no further than to enquire whether some evidence supports Hamdis designation, see Brief for Respondents 3436; if there is some evidence, Hamdi should remain locked up at the discretion of the Executive.  At the argument of this case, in fact, the Government went further and suggested that as long as a prisoner could challenge his enemy combatant designation when responding to interrogation during incommunicado detention he was accorded sufficient process to support his designation as an enemy combatant.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 40; 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 42 ([H]e has an opportunity to explain it in his own words [d]uring interrogation).  Since on either view judicial enquiry so limited would be virtually worthless as a way to contest detention, the Governments concession of jurisdiction to hear Hamdis habeas claim is more theoretical than practical, leaving the assertion of Executive authority close to unconditional.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The plurality rejects any such limit on the exercise of habeas jurisdiction and so far I agree with its opinion.  The plurality does, however, accept the Governments position that if Hamdis designation as an enemy combatant is correct, his detention (at least as to some period) is authorized by an Act of Congress as required by §4001(a), that is, by the Authorization for Use of Military Force,

				<em>

				, at 914.  Here, I disagree and respectfully dissent.  The Government has failed to demonstrate that the Force Resolution authorizes the detention complained of here even on the facts the Government claims.  If the Government raises nothing further than the record now shows, the Non-Detention Act entitles Hamdi to be released.

				The Governments first response to Hamdis claim that holding him violates §4001(a), prohibiting detention of citizens except pursuant to an Act of Congress, is that the statute does not even apply to military wartime detentions, being beyond the sphere of domestic criminal law.  Next, the Government says that even if that statute does apply, two Acts of Congress provide the authority §4001(a) demands: a general authorization to the Department of Defense to pay for detaining prisoners of war and similar persons, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/956.html#5" class="subref" title="subref">10 U. S. C. §956(5)</a>, and the Force Resolution, passed after the attacks of 2001.  At the same time, the Government argues that in detaining Hamdi in the manner described, the President is in any event acting as Commander in Chief under Article II of the Constitution, which brings with it the right to invoke authority under the accepted customary rules for waging war.  On the record in front of us, the Government has not made out a case on any theory.

        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				The threshold issue is how broadly or narrowly to read the Non-Detention Act, the tone of which is severe: No citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained by the United States except pursuant to an Act of Congress.  Should the severity of the Act be relieved when the Governments stated factual justification for incommunicado detention is a war on terrorism, so that the Government may be said to act pursuant to congressional terms that fall short of explicit authority to imprison individuals?  With one possible though important qualification, see 
				<em>
					infra
				</em>
				, at 1011, the answer has to be no.  For a number of reasons, the prohibition within §4001(a) has to be read broadly to accord the statute a long reach and to impose a burden of justification on the Government.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				First, the circumstances in which the Act was adopted point the way to this interpretation.  The provision superseded a cold-war statute, the Emergency Detention Act of 1950 (formerly 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/50/811.html" class="subref" title="subref">50 U. S. C. §811</a>
            <em>
					et seq.
				</em>
				 (1970 ed.)), which had authorized the Attorney General, in time of emergency, to detain anyone reasonably thought likely to engage in espionage or sabotage.  That statute was repealed in 1971 out of fear that it could authorize a repetition of the World War II internment of citizens of Japanese ancestry; Congress meant to preclude another episode like the one described in 
				<em>
					Korematsu
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/323/214" class="subref" title="subref">323 U. S. 214</a> (1944)
.  See H. R. Rep. No. 92116, pp. 2, 45 (1971).  While Congress might simply have struck the 1950 statute, in considering the repealer the point was made that the existing statute provided some express procedural protection, without which the Executive would seem to be subject to no statutory limits protecting individual liberty.  See 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 5 (mere repeal might leave citizens subject to arbitrary executive action, with no clear demarcation of the limits of executive authority); 117 Cong. Rec. 31544 (1971) (Emergency Detention Act remains as the only existing barrier against the future exercise of executive power which resulted in the Japanese internment); cf. 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 31548 (in the absence of further procedural provisions, even §4001(a) will virtually leave us stripped naked against the great power … which the President has).  It was in these circumstances that a proposed limit on Executive action was expanded to the inclusive scope of §4001(a) as enacted.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The fact that Congress intended to guard against a repetition of the World War II internments when it repealed the 1950 statute and gave us §4001(a) provides a powerful reason to think that §4001(a) was meant to require clear congressional authorization before any citizen can be placed in a cell.  It is not merely that the legislative history shows that §4001(a) was thought necessary in anticipation of times just like the present, in which the safety of the country is threatened.  To appreciate what is most significant, one must only recall that the internments of the 1940s were accomplished by Executive action.  Although an Act of Congress ratified and confirmed an Executive order authorizing the military to exclude individuals from defined areas and to accommodate those it might remove, see 
				<em>
					Ex parte Endo
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/323/283" class="subref" title="subref">323 U. S. 283</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">285</a>288 (1944)
, the statute said nothing whatever about the detention of those who might be removed, 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 300301; internment camps were creatures of the Executive, and confinement in them rested on assertion of Executive authority, see 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 287293.  When, therefore, Congress repealed the 1950 Act and adopted §4001(a) for the purpose of avoiding another 
				<em>
					Korematsu
				</em>
				, it intended to preclude reliance on vague congressional authority (for example, providing accommodations for those subject to removal) as authority for detention or imprisonment at the discretion of the Executive (maintaining detention camps of American citizens, for example).  In requiring that any Executive detention be pursuant to an Act of Congress, then, Congress necessarily meant to require a congressional enactment that clearly authorized detention or imprisonment.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, when Congress passed §4001(a) it was acting in light of an interpretive regime that subjected enactments limiting liberty in wartime to the requirement of a clear statement and it presumably intended §4001(a) to be read accordingly.  This need for clarity was unmistakably expressed in 
				<em>
					Ex parte
				</em>
            <em>
					Endo
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, decided the same day as 
				<em>
					Korematsu
				</em>
				.  
				<em>
					Endo
				</em>
				 began with a petition for habeas corpus by an interned citizen claiming to be loyal and law-abiding and thus unlawfully detained.  323 U. S., at 294.  The petitioner was held entitled to habeas relief in an opinion that set out this principle for scrutinizing wartime statutes in derogation of customary liberty:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				In interpreting a wartime measure we must assume that [its] purpose was to allow for the greatest possible accommodation between … liberties and the exigencies of war.  We must assume, when asked to find implied powers in a grant of legislative or executive authority, that the law makers intended to place no greater restraint on the citizen than was clearly and unmistakably indicated by the language they used.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 300.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
Congresss understanding of the need for clear authority before citizens are kept detained is itself therefore clear, and §4001(a) must be read to have teeth in its demand for congressional authorization.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Finally, even if history had spared us the cautionary example of the internments in World War II, even if there had been no 
				<em>
					Korematsu
				</em>
				, and 
				<em>
					Endo
				</em>
				 had set out no principle of statutory interpretation, there would be a compelling reason to read §4001(a) to demand manifest authority to detain before detention is authorized.  The defining character of American constitutional government is its constant tension between security and liberty, serving both by partial helpings of each.  In a government of separated powers, deciding finally on what is a reasonable degree of guaranteed liberty whether in peace or war (or some condition in between) is not well entrusted to the Executive Branch of Government, whose particular responsibility is to maintain security.  For reasons of inescapable human nature, the branch of the Government asked to counter a serious threat is not the branch on which to rest the Nations entire reliance in striking the balance between the will to win and the cost in liberty on the way to victory; the responsibility for security will naturally amplify the claim that security legitimately raises.  A reasonable balance is more likely to be reached on the judgment of a different branch, just as Madison said in remarking that the constant aim is to divide and arrange the several offices in such a manner as that each may be a check on the otherthat the private interest of every individual may be a sentinel over the public rights.  The Federalist No. 51, p. 349 (J. Cooke ed. 1961).  Hence the need for an assessment by Congress before citizens are subject to lockup, and likewise the need for a clearly expressed congressional resolution of the competing claims.

        <p class="opcentered">
				III
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				Under this principle of reading §4001(a) robustly to require a clear statement of authorization to detain, none of the Governments arguments suffices to justify Hamdis detention.
			</p>
        <p class="opcentered">
				A
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				First, there is the argument that §4001(a) does not even apply to wartime military detentions, a position resting on the placement of §4001(a) in Title 18 of the United States Code, the gathering of federal criminal law.  The text of the statute does not, however, so limit its reach, and the legislative history of the provision shows its placement in Title 18 was not meant to render the statute more restricted than its terms.  The draft of what is now §4001(a) as contained in the original bill prohibited only imprisonment unauthorized by Title 18.  See H. R. Rep. No. 92
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				116, at 4.  In response to the Department of Justices objection that the original draft seemed to assume wrongly that all provisions for the detention of convicted persons would be contained in Title 18, the provision was amended by replacing a reference to that title with the reference to an Act of Congress.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 3.  The Committee on the Judiciary, discussing this change, stated that [limiting] detention of citizens … to situations in which … an Act of Congres[s] exists would assure that no detention camps can be established without at least the acquiescence of the Congress.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 5.  See also 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 46.  This understanding, that the amended bill would sweep beyond imprisonment for crime and apply to Executive detention in furtherance of wartime security, was emphasized in an extended debate.  Representative Ichord, chairman of the House Internal Security Committee and an opponent of the bill, feared that the redrafted statute would deprive the President of his emergency powers and his most effective means of coping with sabotage and espionage agents in war-related crises.  117 Cong. Rec., at 31542.  Representative Railsback, the bills sponsor, spoke of the bill in absolute terms: [I]n order to prohibit arbitrary executive action, [the bill] assures that no detention of citizens can be undertaken by the Executive without the prior consent of Congress.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 31551.  This legislative history indicates that Congress was aware that §4001(a) would limit the Executives power to detain citizens in wartime to protect national security, and it is fair to say that the prohibition was thus intended to extend not only to the exercise of power to vindicate the interests underlying domestic criminal law, but to statutorily unauthorized detention by the Executive for reasons of security in wartime, just as Hamdi claims.

Since the Force Resolution was adopted one week after the attacks of September 11, 2001, it naturally speaks with some generality, but its focus is clear, and that is on the use of military power.  It is fairly read to authorize the use of armies and weapons, whether against other armies or individual terrorists.  But, like the statute discussed in 
				<em>
					Endo
				</em>
				, it never so much as uses the word detention, and there is no reason to think Congress might have perceived any need to augment Executive power to deal with dangerous citizens within the United States, given the well-stocked statutory arsenal of defined criminal offenses covering the gamut of actions that a citizen sympathetic to terrorists might commit.

				Even so, there is one argument for treating the Force Resolution as sufficiently clear to authorize detention of a citizen consistently with §4001(a).  Assuming the argument to be sound, however, the Government is in no position to claim its advantage.

				Because the Force Resolution authorizes the use of military force in acts of war by the United States, the argument goes, it is reasonably clear that the military and its Commander in Chief are authorized to deal with enemy belligerents according to the treaties and customs known collectively as the laws of war.

				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 31, 3738.  Thus, the Government here repeatedly argues that Hamdis detention amounts to nothing more than customary detention of a captive taken on the field of battle: if the usages of war are fairly authorized by the Force Resolution, Hamdis detention is authorized for purposes of §4001(a).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				There is no need, however, to address the merits of such an argument in all possible circumstances.  For now it is enough to recognize that the Governments stated legal position in its campaign against the Taliban (among whom Hamdi was allegedly captured) is apparently at odds with
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				its claim here to be acting in accordance with custo-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				mary law of war and hence to be within the terms of
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				the Force Resolution in its detention of Hamdi.  In a statement of its legal position cited in its brief, the
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				Government says that the Geneva Convention applies
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				to the Taliban detainees.  Office of the White House Press Secretary, Fact Sheet, Status of Detainees at Guantanamo (Feb. 7, 2002), www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/

Hamdi presumably is such a detainee, since according to the Governments own account, he was taken bearing arms on the Taliban side of a field of battle in Afghanistan.  He would therefore seem to qualify for treatment as a prisoner of war under the Third Geneva Convention, to which the United States is a party.  Article 4 of the Geneva Convention (III) Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug. 12, 1949, [1955] 6 U. S. T. 3316, 3320, T. I. A. S. No. 3364.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				By holding him incommunicado, however, the Government obviously has not been treating him as a prisoner of war, and in fact the Government claims that no Taliban detainee is entitled to prisoner of war status.  See Brief for Respondents 24; White House Press Release.  This treatment appears to be a violation of the Geneva Convention provision that even in cases of doubt, captives are entitled to be treated as prisoners of war until such time as their status has been determined by a competent tribunal.  Art. 5, 6 U. S. T., at 3324.  The Government answers that the Presidents determination that Taliban detainees do not qualify as prisoners of war is conclusive as to Hamdis status and removes any doubt that would trigger application of the Conventions tribunal requirement.  See Brief for Respondents 24.  But reliance on this categorical pronouncement to settle doubt is apparently at odds with the military regulation, Enemy Prisoners of War, Retained Personnel, Civilian Internees and Other Detainees, Army Reg. 1908, §§15, 16 (1997),
				 
				adopted to implement the Geneva Convention, and setting out a detailed procedure for a military tribunal to determine an individuals status.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 id
				</em>
				., §16
				 
				(A competent tribunal shall be composed of three commissioned officers; a written record shall be made of proceedings; [p]roceedings shall be open with certain exceptions; [p]ersons whose status is to be determined shall be advised of their rights at the beginning of their hearings, allowed to attend all open sessions, allowed to call witnesses if reasonably available, and to question those witnesses called by the Tribunal, and to have a right to testify; and a tribunal shall determine status by a [p]reponderance of evidence).  One of the types of doubt these tribunals are meant to settle is whether a given individual may be, as Hamdi says he is, an [i]nnocent civilian who should be immediately returned to his home or released.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, 16
				<em>
					e
				</em>
				(10)(
				<em>

				</em>
				).  The regulation, jointly promulgated by the Headquarters of the Departments of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps, provides that [p]ersons who have been determined by a competent tribunal not to be entitled to prisoner of war status may not be executed, imprisoned, or otherwise penalized without further proceedings to determine what acts they have committed and what penalty should be imposed.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, §16
				<em>

				.  The regulation also incorporates the Geneva Conventions presumption that in cases of doubt, persons shall enjoy the protection of the … Convention until such time as their status has been determined by a competent tribunal.  
				<em>

				</em>
				., §16
				<em>

				</em>
				.  Thus, there is reason to question whether the United States is acting in accordance with the laws of war it claims as authority.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Whether, or to what degree, the Government is in fact violating the Geneva Convention and is thus acting outside the customary usages of war are not matters I can resolve at this point.  What I can say, though, is that the Government has not made out its claim that in detaining Hamdi in the manner described, it is acting in accord with the laws of war authorized to be applied against citizens by the Force Resolution.  I conclude accordingly that the Government has failed to support the position that the Force Resolution authorizes the described detention of Hamdi for purposes of §4001(a).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It is worth adding a further reason for requiring the Government to bear the burden of clearly justifying its claim to be exercising recognized war powers before declaring §4001(a) satisfied.  Thirty-eight days after adopting the Force Resolution, Congress passed the statute entitled Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA PATRIOT ACT), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">115</a>Stat.
272; that Act authorized the detention of alien terrorists for no more than seven days in the absence of criminal charges or deportation proceedings, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/8/1226a.html#a_5" class="subref" title="subref">8 U. S. C. §1226a(a)(5)</a> (2000 ed., Supp. I).  It is very difficult to believe that the same Congress that carefully circumscribed Executive power over alien terrorists on home soil would not have meant to require the Government to justify clearly
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				its detention of an American citizen held on home soil incommunicado.
			</p>
        <p class="opcentered">
				D
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				Since the Government has given no reason either to deflect the application of §4001(a) or to hold it to be satisfied, I need to go no further; the Government hints of a constitutional challenge to the statute, but it presents none here.  I will, however, stray across the line between statutory and constitutional territory just far enough to note the weakness of the Governments mixed claim of inherent, extrastatutory authority under a combination of Article II of the Constitution and the usages of war.  It is in fact in this connection that the Government developed its argument that the exercise of war powers justifies the detention, and what I have just said about its inadequacy applies here as well.  Beyond that, it is instructive to recall Justice Jacksons observation that the President is not Commander in Chief of the country, only of the military.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				There may be room for one qualification to Justice Jacksons statement, however: in a moment of genuine emergency, when the Government must act with no time for deliberation, the Executive may be able to detain a citizen if there is reason to fear he is an imminent threat to the safety of the Nation and its people (though I doubt there is any want of statutory authority, see 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 910).  This case, however, does not present that question, because an emergency power of necessity must at least be limited by the emergency; Hamdi has been locked up for over two years.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Ex parte Milligan,
				</em>
				 4 Wall. 2, 127 (1866) (martial law justified only by actual and present necessity as in a genuine invasion that closes civilian courts).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Whether insisting on the careful scrutiny of emergency claims or on a vigorous reading of §4001(a), we are heirs to a tradition given voice 800 years ago by Magna Carta, which, on the barons insistence, confined executive power by the law of the land.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Because I find Hamdis detention forbidden by §4001(a) and unauthorized by the Force Resolution, I would not reach any questions of what process he may be due in litigating disputed issues in a proceeding under the habeas statute or prior to the habeas enquiry itself.  For me, it suffices that the Government has failed to justify holding him in the absence of a further Act of Congress, criminal charges, a showing that the detention conforms to the laws of war, or a demonstration that §4001(a) is unconstitutional.  I would therefore vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand for proceedings consistent with this view.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Since this disposition does not command a majority of the Court, however, the need to give practical effect to the conclusions of eight members of the Court rejecting the Governments position calls for me to join with the plurality in ordering remand on terms closest to those I would impose.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">134</a> (1945)
 (Rutledge, J., concurring in result).  Although I think litigation of Hamdis status as an enemy combatant is unnecessary, the terms of the pluralitys remand will allow Hamdi to offer evidence that he is not an enemy combatant, and he should at the least have the benefit of that opportunity.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It should go without saying that in joining with the plurality to produce a judgment, I do not adopt the pluralitys resolution of constitutional issues that I would not reach.  It is not that I could disagree with the pluralitys determinations (given the pluralitys view of the Force Resolution) that someone in Hamdis position is entitled at a minimum to notice of the Governments claimed factual basis for holding him, and to a fair chance to rebut it before a neutral decision maker, see

				, at 26; nor, of course, could I disagree with the pluralitys affirmation of Hamdis right to counsel, see

				According to Yaser Hamdis petition for writ of habeas corpus, brought on his behalf by his father, the Government of the United States is detaining him, an American citizen on American soil, with the explanation that he was seized on the field of battle in Afghanistan, having been on the enemy side.  It is undisputed that the Government has not charged him with espionage, treason, or any other crime under domestic law.  It is likewise undisputed that for one year and nine months, on the basis of an Executive designation of Hamdi as an enemy combatant, the Government denied him the right to send or receive any communication beyond the prison where he was held and, in particular, denied him access to counsel to represent him.

                </sup>
            </a>
				  The Government asserts a right to hold Hamdi under these conditions indefinitely, that is, until the Government determines that the United States is no longer threatened by the terrorism exemplified in the attacks of September 11, 2001.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In these proceedings on Hamdis petition, he seeks to challenge the facts claimed by the Government as the basis for holding him as an enemy combatant.  And in this Court he presses the distinct argument that the Governments claim, even if true, would not implicate any authority for holding him that would satisfy 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/4001.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. §4001(a)</a> (Non-Detention Act), which bars imprisonment
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				or detention of a citizen except pursuant to an Act of Congress.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Government responds that Hamdis incommunicado imprisonment as an enemy combatant seized on the field of battle falls within the Presidents power as Commander in Chief under the laws and usages of war, and is in any event authorized by two statutes.  Accordingly, the Government contends that Hamdi has no basis for any challenge by petition for habeas except to his own status as an enemy combatant; and even that challenge may go no further than to enquire whether some evidence supports Hamdis designation, see Brief for Respondents 3436; if there is some evidence, Hamdi should remain locked up at the discretion of the Executive.  At the argument of this case, in fact, the Government went further and suggested that as long as a prisoner could challenge his enemy combatant designation when responding to interrogation during incommunicado detention he was accorded sufficient process to support his designation as an enemy combatant.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 40; 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 42 ([H]e has an opportunity to explain it in his own words [d]uring interrogation).  Since on either view judicial enquiry so limited would be virtually worthless as a way to contest detention, the Governments concession of jurisdiction to hear Hamdis habeas claim is more theoretical than practical, leaving the assertion of Executive authority close to unconditional.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The plurality rejects any such limit on the exercise of habeas jurisdiction and so far I agree with its opinion.  The plurality does, however, accept the Governments position that if Hamdis designation as an enemy combatant is correct, his detention (at least as to some period) is authorized by an Act of Congress as required by §4001(a), that is, by the Authorization for Use of Military Force, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">115</a>Stat.
224 (hereinafter Force Resolution).  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 914.  Here, I disagree and respectfully dissent.  The Government has failed to demonstrate that the Force Resolution authorizes the detention complained of here even on the facts the Government claims.  If the Government raises nothing further than the record now shows, the Non-Detention Act entitles Hamdi to be released.
			</p>
        <p class="opcentered">
				I
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				The Governments first response to Hamdis claim that holding him violates §4001(a), prohibiting detention of citizens except pursuant to an Act of Congress, is that the statute does not even apply to military wartime detentions, being beyond the sphere of domestic criminal law.  Next, the Government says that even if that statute does apply, two Acts of Congress provide the authority §4001(a) demands: a general authorization to the Department of Defense to pay for detaining prisoners of war and similar persons, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/956.html#5" class="subref" title="subref">10 U. S. C. §956(5)</a>, and the Force Resolution, passed after the attacks of 2001.  At the same time, the Government argues that in detaining Hamdi in the manner described, the President is in any event acting as Commander in Chief under Article II of the Constitution, which brings with it the right to invoke authority under the accepted customary rules for waging war.  On the record in front of us, the Government has not made out a case on any theory.

        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				The threshold issue is how broadly or narrowly to read the Non-Detention Act, the tone of which is severe: No citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained by the United States except pursuant to an Act of Congress.  Should the severity of the Act be relieved when the Governments stated factual justification for incommunicado detention is a war on terrorism, so that the Government may be said to act pursuant to congressional terms that fall short of explicit authority to imprison individuals?  With one possible though important qualification, see 
				<em>
					infra
				</em>
				, at 1011, the answer has to be no.  For a number of reasons, the prohibition within §4001(a) has to be read broadly to accord the statute a long reach and to impose a burden of justification on the Government.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				First, the circumstances in which the Act was adopted point the way to this interpretation.  The provision superseded a cold-war statute, the Emergency Detention Act of 1950 (formerly

				 (1970 ed.)), which had authorized the Attorney General, in time of emergency, to detain anyone reasonably thought likely to engage in espionage or sabotage.  That statute was repealed in 1971 out of fear that it could authorize a repetition of the World War II internment of citizens of Japanese ancestry; Congress meant to preclude another episode like the one described in

.  See H. R. Rep. No. 92116, pp. 2, 45 (1971).  While Congress might simply have struck the 1950 statute, in considering the repealer the point was made that the existing statute provided some express procedural protection, without which the Executive would seem to be subject to no statutory limits protecting individual liberty.  See 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 5 (mere repeal might leave citizens subject to arbitrary executive action, with no clear demarcation of the limits of executive authority); 117 Cong. Rec. 31544 (1971) (Emergency Detention Act remains as the only existing barrier against the future exercise of executive power which resulted in the Japanese internment); cf. 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 31548 (in the absence of further procedural provisions, even §4001(a) will virtually leave us stripped naked against the great power … which the President has).  It was in these circumstances that a proposed limit on Executive action was expanded to the inclusive scope of §4001(a) as enacted.

				The fact that Congress intended to guard against a repetition of the World War II internments when it repealed the 1950 statute and gave us §4001(a) provides a powerful reason to think that §4001(a) was meant to require clear congressional authorization before any citizen can be placed in a cell.  It is not merely that the legislative history shows that §4001(a) was thought necessary in anticipation of times just like the present, in which the safety of the country is threatened.  To appreciate what is most significant, one must only recall that the internments of the 1940s were accomplished by Executive action.  Although an Act of Congress ratified and confirmed an Executive order authorizing the military to exclude individuals from defined areas and to accommodate those it might remove, see 
				<em>
					Ex parte Endo
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/323/283" class="subref" title="subref">323 U. S. 283</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">285</a>288 (1944)
, the statute said nothing whatever about the detention of those who might be removed, 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 300301; internment camps were creatures of the Executive, and confinement in them rested on assertion of Executive authority, see 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 287293.  When, therefore, Congress repealed the 1950 Act and adopted §4001(a) for the purpose of avoiding another 
				<em>
					Korematsu
				</em>
				, it intended to preclude reliance on vague congressional authority (for example, providing accommodations for those subject to removal) as authority for detention or imprisonment at the discretion of the Executive (maintaining detention camps of American citizens, for example).  In requiring that any Executive detention be pursuant to an Act of Congress, then, Congress necessarily meant to require a congressional enactment that clearly authorized detention or imprisonment.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, when Congress passed §4001(a) it was acting in light of an interpretive regime that subjected enactments limiting liberty in wartime to the requirement of a clear statement and it presumably intended §4001(a) to be read accordingly.  This need for clarity was unmistakably expressed in 
				<em>
					Ex parte
				</em>
            <em>
					Endo
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, decided the same day as 
				<em>
					Korematsu
				</em>
				.  
				<em>
					Endo
				</em>
				 began with a petition for habeas corpus by an interned citizen claiming to be loyal and law-abiding and thus unlawfully detained.  323 U. S., at 294.  The petitioner was held entitled to habeas relief in an opinion that set out this principle for scrutinizing wartime statutes in derogation of customary liberty:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				In interpreting a wartime measure we must assume that [its] purpose was to allow for the greatest possible accommodation between … liberties and the exigencies of war.  We must assume, when asked to find implied powers in a grant of legislative or executive authority, that the law makers intended to place no greater restraint on the citizen than was clearly and unmistakably indicated by the language they used.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 300.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
Congresss understanding of the need for clear authority before citizens are kept detained is itself therefore clear, and §4001(a) must be read to have teeth in its demand for congressional authorization.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Finally, even if history had spared us the cautionary example of the internments in World War II, even if there had been no 
				<em>
					Korematsu
				</em>
				, and 
				<em>
					Endo
				</em>
				 had set out no principle of statutory interpretation, there would be a compelling reason to read §4001(a) to demand manifest authority to detain before detention is authorized.  The defining character of American constitutional government is its constant tension between security and liberty, serving both by partial helpings of each.  In a government of separated powers, deciding finally on what is a reasonable degree of guaranteed liberty whether in peace or war (or some condition in between) is not well entrusted to the Executive Branch of Government, whose particular responsibility is to maintain security.  For reasons of inescapable human nature, the branch of the Government asked to counter a serious threat is not the branch on which to rest the Nations entire reliance in striking the balance between the will to win and the cost in liberty on the way to victory; the responsibility for security will naturally amplify the claim that security legitimately raises.  A reasonable balance is more likely to be reached on the judgment of a different branch, just as Madison said in remarking that the constant aim is to divide and arrange the several offices in such a manner as that each may be a check on the otherthat the private interest of every individual may be a sentinel over the public rights.  The Federalist No. 51, p. 349 (J. Cooke ed. 1961).  Hence the need for an assessment by Congress before citizens are subject to lockup, and likewise the need for a clearly expressed congressional resolution of the competing claims.

        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				Under this principle of reading §4001(a) robustly to require a clear statement of authorization to detain, none of the Governments arguments suffices to justify Hamdis detention.

				First, there is the argument that §4001(a) does not even apply to wartime military detentions, a position resting on the placement of §4001(a) in Title 18 of the United States Code, the gathering of federal criminal law.  The text of the statute does not, however, so limit its reach, and the legislative history of the provision shows its placement in Title 18 was not meant to render the statute more restricted than its terms.  The draft of what is now §4001(a) as contained in the original bill prohibited only imprisonment unauthorized by Title 18.  See H. R. Rep. No. 92
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				116, at 4.  In response to the Department of Justices objection that the original draft seemed to assume wrongly that all provisions for the detention of convicted persons would be contained in Title 18, the provision was amended by replacing a reference to that title with the reference to an Act of Congress.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 3.  The Committee on the Judiciary, discussing this change, stated that [limiting] detention of citizens … to situations in which … an Act of Congres[s] exists would assure that no detention camps can be established without at least the acquiescence of the Congress.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 5.  See also 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 46.  This understanding, that the amended bill would sweep beyond imprisonment for crime and apply to Executive detention in furtherance of wartime security, was emphasized in an extended debate.  Representative Ichord, chairman of the House Internal Security Committee and an opponent of the bill, feared that the redrafted statute would deprive the President of his emergency powers and his most effective means of coping with sabotage and espionage agents in war-related crises.  117 Cong. Rec., at 31542.  Representative Railsback, the bills sponsor, spoke of the bill in absolute terms: [I]n order to prohibit arbitrary executive action, [the bill] assures that no detention of citizens can be undertaken by the Executive without the prior consent of Congress.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 31551.  This legislative history indicates that Congress was aware that §4001(a) would limit the Executives power to detain citizens in wartime to protect national security, and it is fair to say that the prohibition was thus intended to extend not only to the exercise of power to vindicate the interests underlying domestic criminal law, but to statutorily unauthorized detention by the Executive for reasons of security in wartime, just as Hamdi claims.

				Next, there is the Governments claim, accepted by the Court, that the terms of the Force Resolution are adequate to authorize detention of an enemy combatant under the circumstances described,
				<a name="ZX-3ref" href="#ZX-3" class="">

            </a>
				 a claim the Government fails to support sufficiently to satisfy §4001(a) as read to require a clear statement of authority to detain.  Since the Force Resolution was adopted one week after the attacks of September 11, 2001, it naturally speaks with some generality, but its focus is clear, and that is on the use of military power.  It is fairly read to authorize the use of armies and weapons, whether against other armies or individual terrorists.  But, like the statute discussed in 
				<em>
					Endo
				</em>
				, it never so much as uses the word detention, and there is no reason to think Congress might have perceived any need to augment Executive power to deal with dangerous citizens within the United States, given the well-stocked statutory arsenal of defined criminal offenses covering the gamut of actions that a citizen sympathetic to terrorists might commit.

				Even so, there is one argument for treating the Force Resolution as sufficiently clear to authorize detention of a citizen consistently with §4001(a).  Assuming the argument to be sound, however, the Government is in no position to claim its advantage.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Because the Force Resolution authorizes the use of military force in acts of war by the United States, the argument goes, it is reasonably clear that the military and its Commander in Chief are authorized to deal with enemy belligerents according to the treaties and customs known collectively as the laws of war.  Brief for Respondents 20

, may perhaps be claimed for the proposition that the American citizenship of such a captive does not as such limit the Governments power to deal with him under the usages of war.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 31, 3738.  Thus, the Government here repeatedly argues that Hamdis detention amounts to nothing more than customary detention of a captive taken on the field of battle: if the usages of war are fairly authorized by the Force Resolution, Hamdis detention is authorized for purposes of §4001(a).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				There is no need, however, to address the merits of such an argument in all possible circumstances.  For now it is enough to recognize that the Governments stated legal position in its campaign against the Taliban (among whom Hamdi was allegedly captured) is apparently at odds with
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				its claim here to be acting in accordance with custo-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				mary law of war and hence to be within the terms of
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				the Force Resolution in its detention of Hamdi.  In a statement of its legal position cited in its brief, the
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				Government says that the Geneva Convention applies
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				to the Taliban detainees.  Office of the White House Press Secretary, Fact Sheet, Status of Detainees at Guantanamo (Feb. 7, 2002), www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				02/2002020713.html (as visited June 18, 2004, and available in Clerk of Courts case file) (hereinafter White House Press Release) (cited in Brief for Respondents 24, n. 9).  Hamdi presumably is such a detainee, since according to the Governments own account, he was taken bearing arms on the Taliban side of a field of battle in Afghanistan.  He would therefore seem to qualify for treatment as a prisoner of war under the Third Geneva Convention, to which the United States is a party.  Article 4 of the Geneva Convention (III) Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug. 12, 1949, [1955] 6 U. S. T. 3316, 3320, T. I. A. S. No. 3364.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				By holding him incommunicado, however, the Government obviously has not been treating him as a prisoner of war, and in fact the Government claims that no Taliban detainee is entitled to prisoner of war status.  See Brief for Respondents 24; White House Press Release.  This treatment appears to be a violation of the Geneva Convention provision that even in cases of doubt, captives are entitled to be treated as prisoners of war until such time as their status has been determined by a competent tribunal.  Art. 5, 6 U. S. T., at 3324.  The Government answers that the Presidents determination that Taliban detainees do not qualify as prisoners of war is conclusive as to Hamdis status and removes any doubt that would trigger application of the Conventions tribunal requirement.  See Brief for Respondents 24.  But reliance on this categorical pronouncement to settle doubt is apparently at odds with the military regulation, Enemy Prisoners of War, Retained Personnel, Civilian Internees and Other Detainees, Army Reg. 1908, §§15, 16 (1997),
				 
				adopted to implement the Geneva Convention, and setting out a detailed procedure for a military tribunal to determine an individuals status.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 id
				</em>
				., §16
				 
				(A competent tribunal shall be composed of three commissioned officers; a written record shall be made of proceedings; [p]roceedings shall be open with certain exceptions; [p]ersons whose status is to be determined shall be advised of their rights at the beginning of their hearings, allowed to attend all open sessions, allowed to call witnesses if reasonably available, and to question those witnesses called by the Tribunal, and to have a right to testify; and a tribunal shall determine status by a [p]reponderance of evidence).  One of the types of doubt these tribunals are meant to settle is whether a given individual may be, as Hamdi says he is, an [i]nnocent civilian who should be immediately returned to his home or released.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, 16
				<em>
					e
				</em>
				(10)(
				<em>
					c
				</em>
				).  The regulation, jointly promulgated by the Headquarters of the Departments of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps, provides that [p]ersons who have been determined by a competent tribunal not to be entitled to prisoner of war status may not be executed, imprisoned, or otherwise penalized without further proceedings to determine what acts they have committed and what penalty should be imposed.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, §16
				<em>

				</em>
				.  The regulation also incorporates the Geneva Conventions presumption that in cases of doubt, persons shall enjoy the protection of the … Convention until such time as their status has been determined by a competent tribunal.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., §16
				<em>
					a
				</em>
				.  Thus, there is reason to question whether the United States is acting in accordance with the laws of war it claims as authority.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Whether, or to what degree, the Government is in fact violating the Geneva Convention and is thus acting outside the customary usages of war are not matters I can resolve at this point.  What I can say, though, is that the Government has not made out its claim that in detaining Hamdi in the manner described, it is acting in accord with the laws of war authorized to be applied against citizens by the Force Resolution.  I conclude accordingly that the Government has failed to support the position that the Force Resolution authorizes the described detention of Hamdi for purposes of §4001(a).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It is worth adding a further reason for requiring the Government to bear the burden of clearly justifying its claim to be exercising recognized war powers before declaring §4001(a) satisfied.  Thirty-eight days after adopting the Force Resolution, Congress passed the statute entitled Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA PATRIOT ACT), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">115</a>Stat.
272; that Act authorized the detention of alien terrorists for no more than seven days in the absence of criminal charges or deportation proceedings, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/8/1226a.html#a_5" class="subref" title="subref">8 U. S. C. §1226a(a)(5)</a> (2000 ed., Supp. I).  It is very difficult to believe that the same Congress that carefully circumscribed Executive power over alien terrorists on home soil would not have meant to require the Government to justify clearly
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				its detention of an American citizen held on home soil incommunicado.
			</p>
        <p class="opcentered">
				D
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				Since the Government has given no reason either to deflect the application of §4001(a) or to hold it to be satisfied, I need to go no further; the Government hints of a constitutional challenge to the statute, but it presents none here.  I will, however, stray across the line between statutory and constitutional territory just far enough to note the weakness of the Governments mixed claim of inherent, extrastatutory authority under a combination of Article II of the Constitution and the usages of war.  It is in fact in this connection that the Government developed its argument that the exercise of war powers justifies the detention, and what I have just said about its inadequacy applies here as well.  Beyond that, it is instructive to recall Justice Jacksons observation that the President is not Commander in Chief of the country, only of the military.

				There may be room for one qualification to Justice Jacksons statement, however: in a moment of genuine emergency, when the Government must act with no time for deliberation, the Executive may be able to detain a citizen if there is reason to fear he is an imminent threat to the safety of the Nation and its people (though I doubt there is any want of statutory authority, see 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 910).  This case, however, does not present that question, because an emergency power of necessity must at least be limited by the emergency; Hamdi has been locked up for over two years.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Ex parte Milligan,
				</em>
				 4 Wall. 2, 127 (1866) (martial law justified only by actual and present necessity as in a genuine invasion that closes civilian courts).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Whether insisting on the careful scrutiny of emergency claims or on a vigorous reading of §4001(a), we are heirs to a tradition given voice 800 years ago by Magna Carta, which, on the barons insistence, confined executive power by the law of the land.

				Because I find Hamdis detention forbidden by §4001(a) and unauthorized by the Force Resolution, I would not reach any questions of what process he may be due in litigating disputed issues in a proceeding under the habeas statute or prior to the habeas enquiry itself.  For me, it suffices that the Government has failed to justify holding him in the absence of a further Act of Congress, criminal charges, a showing that the detention conforms to the laws of war, or a demonstration that §4001(a) is unconstitutional.  I would therefore vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand for proceedings consistent with this view.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Since this disposition does not command a majority of the Court, however, the need to give practical effect to the conclusions of eight members of the Court rejecting the Governments position calls for me to join with the plurality in ordering remand on terms closest to those I would impose.

 (Rutledge, J., concurring in result).  Although I think litigation of Hamdis status as an enemy combatant is unnecessary, the terms of the pluralitys remand will allow Hamdi to offer evidence that he is not an enemy combatant, and he should at the least have the benefit of that opportunity.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It should go without saying that in joining with the plurality to produce a judgment, I do not adopt the pluralitys resolution of constitutional issues that I would not reach.  It is not that I could disagree with the pluralitys determinations (given the pluralitys view of the Force Resolution) that someone in Hamdis position is entitled at a minimum to notice of the Governments claimed factual basis for holding him, and to a fair chance to rebut it before a neutral decision maker, see

				, at 26; nor, of course, could I disagree with the pluralitys affirmation of Hamdis right to counsel, see

						 As noted, supra, at 3, the Government argues that a required Act of Congress is to be found in a statutory authorization to spend money appropriated for the care of prisoners of war and of other, similar prisoners, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/956.html#5" class="subref" title="subref">10 U. S. C. §956(5)</a>.  It is enough to say that this statute is an authorization to spend money if there are prisoners, not an authorization to imprison anyone to provide the occasion for spending money.

				According to Yaser Hamdis petition for writ of habeas corpus, brought on his behalf by his father, the Government of the United States is detaining him, an American citizen on American soil, with the explanation that he was seized on the field of battle in Afghanistan, having been on the enemy side.  It is undisputed that the Government has not charged him with espionage, treason, or any other crime under domestic law.  It is likewise undisputed that for one year and nine months, on the basis of an Executive designation of Hamdi as an enemy combatant, the Government denied him the right to send or receive any communication beyond the prison where he was held and, in particular, denied him access to counsel to represent him.

            </a>
				  The Government asserts a right to hold Hamdi under these conditions indefinitely, that is, until the Government determines that the United States is no longer threatened by the terrorism exemplified in the attacks of September 11, 2001.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In these proceedings on Hamdis petition, he seeks to challenge the facts claimed by the Government as the basis for holding him as an enemy combatant.  And in this Court he presses the distinct argument that the Governments claim, even if true, would not implicate any authority for holding him that would satisfy 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/4001.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. §4001(a)</a> (Non-Detention Act), which bars imprisonment
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				or detention of a citizen except pursuant to an Act of Congress.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Government responds that Hamdis incommunicado imprisonment as an enemy combatant seized on the field of battle falls within the Presidents power as Commander in Chief under the laws and usages of war, and is in any event authorized by two statutes.  Accordingly, the Government contends that Hamdi has no basis for any challenge by petition for habeas except to his own status as an enemy combatant; and even that challenge may go no further than to enquire whether some evidence supports Hamdis designation, see Brief for Respondents 3436; if there is some evidence, Hamdi should remain locked up at the discretion of the Executive.  At the argument of this case, in fact, the Government went further and suggested that as long as a prisoner could challenge his enemy combatant designation when responding to interrogation during incommunicado detention he was accorded sufficient process to support his designation as an enemy combatant.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 40; 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 42 ([H]e has an opportunity to explain it in his own words [d]uring interrogation).  Since on either view judicial enquiry so limited would be virtually worthless as a way to contest detention, the Governments concession of jurisdiction to hear Hamdis habeas claim is more theoretical than practical, leaving the assertion of Executive authority close to unconditional.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The plurality rejects any such limit on the exercise of habeas jurisdiction and so far I agree with its opinion.  The plurality does, however, accept the Governments position that if Hamdis designation as an enemy combatant is correct, his detention (at least as to some period) is authorized by an Act of Congress as required by §4001(a), that is, by the Authorization for Use of Military Force,

				<em>

				, at 914.  Here, I disagree and respectfully dissent.  The Government has failed to demonstrate that the Force Resolution authorizes the detention complained of here even on the facts the Government claims.  If the Government raises nothing further than the record now shows, the Non-Detention Act entitles Hamdi to be released.

				The Governments first response to Hamdis claim that holding him violates §4001(a), prohibiting detention of citizens except pursuant to an Act of Congress, is that the statute does not even apply to military wartime detentions, being beyond the sphere of domestic criminal law.  Next, the Government says that even if that statute does apply, two Acts of Congress provide the authority §4001(a) demands: a general authorization to the Department of Defense to pay for detaining prisoners of war and similar persons, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/956.html#5" class="subref" title="subref">10 U. S. C. §956(5)</a>, and the Force Resolution, passed after the attacks of 2001.  At the same time, the Government argues that in detaining Hamdi in the manner described, the President is in any event acting as Commander in Chief under Article II of the Constitution, which brings with it the right to invoke authority under the accepted customary rules for waging war.  On the record in front of us, the Government has not made out a case on any theory.

				The threshold issue is how broadly or narrowly to read the Non-Detention Act, the tone of which is severe: No citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained by the United States except pursuant to an Act of Congress.  Should the severity of the Act be relieved when the Governments stated factual justification for incommunicado detention is a war on terrorism, so that the Government may be said to act pursuant to congressional terms that fall short of explicit authority to imprison individuals?  With one possible though important qualification, see 
				<em>
					infra
				</em>
				, at 1011, the answer has to be no.  For a number of reasons, the prohibition within §4001(a) has to be read broadly to accord the statute a long reach and to impose a burden of justification on the Government.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				First, the circumstances in which the Act was adopted point the way to this interpretation.  The provision superseded a cold-war statute, the Emergency Detention Act of 1950 (formerly 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/50/811.html" class="subref" title="subref">50 U. S. C. §811</a>
            <em>
					et seq.
				</em>
				 (1970 ed.)), which had authorized the Attorney General, in time of emergency, to detain anyone reasonably thought likely to engage in espionage or sabotage.  That statute was repealed in 1971 out of fear that it could authorize a repetition of the World War II internment of citizens of Japanese ancestry; Congress meant to preclude another episode like the one described in 
				<em>
					Korematsu
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/323/214" class="subref" title="subref">323 U. S. 214</a> (1944)
.  See H. R. Rep. No. 92116, pp. 2, 45 (1971).  While Congress might simply have struck the 1950 statute, in considering the repealer the point was made that the existing statute provided some express procedural protection, without which the Executive would seem to be subject to no statutory limits protecting individual liberty.  See 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 5 (mere repeal might leave citizens subject to arbitrary executive action, with no clear demarcation of the limits of executive authority); 117 Cong. Rec. 31544 (1971) (Emergency Detention Act remains as the only existing barrier against the future exercise of executive power which resulted in the Japanese internment); cf. 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 31548 (in the absence of further procedural provisions, even §4001(a) will virtually leave us stripped naked against the great power … which the President has).  It was in these circumstances that a proposed limit on Executive action was expanded to the inclusive scope of §4001(a) as enacted.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The fact that Congress intended to guard against a repetition of the World War II internments when it repealed the 1950 statute and gave us §4001(a) provides a powerful reason to think that §4001(a) was meant to require clear congressional authorization before any citizen can be placed in a cell.  It is not merely that the legislative history shows that §4001(a) was thought necessary in anticipation of times just like the present, in which the safety of the country is threatened.  To appreciate what is most significant, one must only recall that the internments of the 1940s were accomplished by Executive action.  Although an Act of Congress ratified and confirmed an Executive order authorizing the military to exclude individuals from defined areas and to accommodate those it might remove, see 
				<em>
					Ex parte Endo
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/323/283" class="subref" title="subref">323 U. S. 283</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">285</a>288 (1944)
, the statute said nothing whatever about the detention of those who might be removed, 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 300301; internment camps were creatures of the Executive, and confinement in them rested on assertion of Executive authority, see 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 287293.  When, therefore, Congress repealed the 1950 Act and adopted §4001(a) for the purpose of avoiding another 
				<em>
					Korematsu
				</em>
				, it intended to preclude reliance on vague congressional authority (for example, providing accommodations for those subject to removal) as authority for detention or imprisonment at the discretion of the Executive (maintaining detention camps of American citizens, for example).  In requiring that any Executive detention be pursuant to an Act of Congress, then, Congress necessarily meant to require a congressional enactment that clearly authorized detention or imprisonment.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, when Congress passed §4001(a) it was acting in light of an interpretive regime that subjected enactments limiting liberty in wartime to the requirement of a clear statement and it presumably intended §4001(a) to be read accordingly.  This need for clarity was unmistakably expressed in 
				<em>
					Ex parte
				</em>
            <em>
					Endo
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, decided the same day as 
				<em>
					Korematsu
				</em>
				.  
				<em>
					Endo
				</em>
				 began with a petition for habeas corpus by an interned citizen claiming to be loyal and law-abiding and thus unlawfully detained.  323 U. S., at 294.  The petitioner was held entitled to habeas relief in an opinion that set out this principle for scrutinizing wartime statutes in derogation of customary liberty:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				In interpreting a wartime measure we must assume that [its] purpose was to allow for the greatest possible accommodation between … liberties and the exigencies of war.  We must assume, when asked to find implied powers in a grant of legislative or executive authority, that the law makers intended to place no greater restraint on the citizen than was clearly and unmistakably indicated by the language they used.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 300.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
Congresss understanding of the need for clear authority before citizens are kept detained is itself therefore clear, and §4001(a) must be read to have teeth in its demand for congressional authorization.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Finally, even if history had spared us the cautionary example of the internments in World War II, even if there had been no 
				<em>
					Korematsu
				</em>
				, and 
				<em>
					Endo
				</em>
				 had set out no principle of statutory interpretation, there would be a compelling reason to read §4001(a) to demand manifest authority to detain before detention is authorized.  The defining character of American constitutional government is its constant tension between security and liberty, serving both by partial helpings of each.  In a government of separated powers, deciding finally on what is a reasonable degree of guaranteed liberty whether in peace or war (or some condition in between) is not well entrusted to the Executive Branch of Government, whose particular responsibility is to maintain security.  For reasons of inescapable human nature, the branch of the Government asked to counter a serious threat is not the branch on which to rest the Nations entire reliance in striking the balance between the will to win and the cost in liberty on the way to victory; the responsibility for security will naturally amplify the claim that security legitimately raises.  A reasonable balance is more likely to be reached on the judgment of a different branch, just as Madison said in remarking that the constant aim is to divide and arrange the several offices in such a manner as that each may be a check on the otherthat the private interest of every individual may be a sentinel over the public rights.  The Federalist No. 51, p. 349 (J. Cooke ed. 1961).  Hence the need for an assessment by Congress before citizens are subject to lockup, and likewise the need for a clearly expressed congressional resolution of the competing claims.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				Under this principle of reading §4001(a) robustly to require a clear statement of authorization to detain, none of the Governments arguments suffices to justify Hamdis detention.
			</p>
        <p class="opcentered">
				A
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				First, there is the argument that §4001(a) does not even apply to wartime military detentions, a position resting on the placement of §4001(a) in Title 18 of the United States Code, the gathering of federal criminal law.  The text of the statute does not, however, so limit its reach, and the legislative history of the provision shows its placement in Title 18 was not meant to render the statute more restricted than its terms.  The draft of what is now §4001(a) as contained in the original bill prohibited only imprisonment unauthorized by Title 18.  See H. R. Rep. No. 92
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				116, at 4.  In response to the Department of Justices objection that the original draft seemed to assume wrongly that all provisions for the detention of convicted persons would be contained in Title 18, the provision was amended by replacing a reference to that title with the reference to an Act of Congress.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 3.  The Committee on the Judiciary, discussing this change, stated that [limiting] detention of citizens … to situations in which … an Act of Congres[s] exists would assure that no detention camps can be established without at least the acquiescence of the Congress.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 5.  See also 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 46.  This understanding, that the amended bill would sweep beyond imprisonment for crime and apply to Executive detention in furtherance of wartime security, was emphasized in an extended debate.  Representative Ichord, chairman of the House Internal Security Committee and an opponent of the bill, feared that the redrafted statute would deprive the President of his emergency powers and his most effective means of coping with sabotage and espionage agents in war-related crises.  117 Cong. Rec., at 31542.  Representative Railsback, the bills sponsor, spoke of the bill in absolute terms: [I]n order to prohibit arbitrary executive action, [the bill] assures that no detention of citizens can be undertaken by the Executive without the prior consent of Congress.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 31551.  This legislative history indicates that Congress was aware that §4001(a) would limit the Executives power to detain citizens in wartime to protect national security, and it is fair to say that the prohibition was thus intended to extend not only to the exercise of power to vindicate the interests underlying domestic criminal law, but to statutorily unauthorized detention by the Executive for reasons of security in wartime, just as Hamdi claims.

				Next, there is the Governments claim, accepted by the Court, that the terms of the Force Resolution are adequate to authorize detention of an enemy combatant under the circumstances described,
				<a name="ZX-3ref" href="#ZX-3" class="">
                <sup>

            </a>
				 a claim the Government fails to support sufficiently to satisfy §4001(a) as read to require a clear statement of authority to detain.  Since the Force Resolution was adopted one week after the attacks of September 11, 2001, it naturally speaks with some generality, but its focus is clear, and that is on the use of military power.  It is fairly read to authorize the use of armies and weapons, whether against other armies or individual terrorists.  But, like the statute discussed in 
				<em>
					Endo
				</em>
				, it never so much as uses the word detention, and there is no reason to think Congress might have perceived any need to augment Executive power to deal with dangerous citizens within the United States, given the well-stocked statutory arsenal of defined criminal offenses covering the gamut of actions that a citizen sympathetic to terrorists might commit.

				Even so, there is one argument for treating the Force Resolution as sufficiently clear to authorize detention of a citizen consistently with §4001(a).  Assuming the argument to be sound, however, the Government is in no position to claim its advantage.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Because the Force Resolution authorizes the use of military force in acts of war by the United States, the argument goes, it is reasonably clear that the military and its Commander in Chief are authorized to deal with enemy belligerents according to the treaties and customs known collectively as the laws of war.  Brief for Respondents 20
				<span class="softbreak"></span>

, may perhaps be claimed for the proposition that the American citizenship of such a captive does not as such limit the Governments power to deal with him under the usages of war.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 31, 3738.  Thus, the Government here repeatedly argues that Hamdis detention amounts to nothing more than customary detention of a captive taken on the field of battle: if the usages of war are fairly authorized by the Force Resolution, Hamdis detention is authorized for purposes of §4001(a).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				There is no need, however, to address the merits of such an argument in all possible circumstances.  For now it is enough to recognize that the Governments stated legal position in its campaign against the Taliban (among whom Hamdi was allegedly captured) is apparently at odds with
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				its claim here to be acting in accordance with custo-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				mary law of war and hence to be within the terms of
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				the Force Resolution in its detention of Hamdi.  In a statement of its legal position cited in its brief, the
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				Government says that the Geneva Convention applies
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				to the Taliban detainees.  Office of the White House Press Secretary, Fact Sheet, Status of Detainees at Guantanamo (Feb. 7, 2002), www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				02/2002020713.html (as visited June 18, 2004, and available in Clerk of Courts case file) (hereinafter White House Press Release) (cited in Brief for Respondents 24, n. 9).  Hamdi presumably is such a detainee, since according to the Governments own account, he was taken bearing arms on the Taliban side of a field of battle in Afghanistan.  He would therefore seem to qualify for treatment as a prisoner of war under the Third Geneva Convention, to which the United States is a party.  Article 4 of the Geneva Convention (III) Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug. 12, 1949, [1955] 6 U. S. T. 3316, 3320, T. I. A. S. No. 3364.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				By holding him incommunicado, however, the Government obviously has not been treating him as a prisoner of war, and in fact the Government claims that no Taliban detainee is entitled to prisoner of war status.  See Brief for Respondents 24; White House Press Release.  This treatment appears to be a violation of the Geneva Convention provision that even in cases of doubt, captives are entitled to be treated as prisoners of war until such time as their status has been determined by a competent tribunal.  Art. 5, 6 U. S. T., at 3324.  The Government answers that the Presidents determination that Taliban detainees do not qualify as prisoners of war is conclusive as to Hamdis status and removes any doubt that would trigger application of the Conventions tribunal requirement.  See Brief for Respondents 24.  But reliance on this categorical pronouncement to settle doubt is apparently at odds with the military regulation, Enemy Prisoners of War, Retained Personnel, Civilian Internees and Other Detainees, Army Reg. 1908, §§15, 16 (1997),
				 
				adopted to implement the Geneva Convention, and setting out a detailed procedure for a military tribunal to determine an individuals status.  See,

The regulation, jointly promulgated by the Headquarters of the Departments of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps, provides that [p]ersons who have been determined by a competent tribunal not to be entitled to prisoner of war status may not be executed, imprisoned, or otherwise penalized without further proceedings to determine what acts they have committed and what penalty should be imposed.

				Whether, or to what degree, the Government is in fact violating the Geneva Convention and is thus acting outside the customary usages of war are not matters I can resolve at this point.  What I can say, though, is that the Government has not made out its claim that in detaining Hamdi in the manner described, it is acting in accord with the laws of war authorized to be applied against citizens by the Force Resolution.  I conclude accordingly that the Government has failed to support the position that the Force Resolution authorizes the described detention of Hamdi for purposes of §4001(a).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It is worth adding a further reason for requiring the Government to bear the burden of clearly justifying its claim to be exercising recognized war powers before declaring §4001(a) satisfied.  Thirty-eight days after adopting the Force Resolution, Congress passed the statute entitled Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA PATRIOT ACT), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">115</a>Stat.
272; that Act authorized the detention of alien terrorists for no more than seven days in the absence of criminal charges or deportation proceedings,

It is very difficult to believe that the same Congress that carefully circumscribed Executive power over alien terrorists on home soil would not have meant to require the Government to justify clearly
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				its detention of an American citizen held on home soil incommunicado.

				Since the Government has given no reason either to deflect the application of §4001(a) or to hold it to be satisfied, I need to go no further; the Government hints of a constitutional challenge to the statute, but it presents none here.  I will, however, stray across the line between statutory and constitutional territory just far enough to note the weakness of the Governments mixed claim of inherent, extrastatutory authority under a combination of Article II of the Constitution and the usages of war.  It is in fact in this connection that the Government developed its argument that the exercise of war powers justifies the detention, and what I have just said about its inadequacy applies here as well.  Beyond that, it is instructive to recall Justice Jacksons observation that the President is not Commander in Chief of the country, only of the military.

				There may be room for one qualification to Justice Jacksons statement, however: in a moment of genuine emergency, when the Government must act with no time for deliberation, the Executive may be able to detain a citizen if there is reason to fear he is an imminent threat to the safety of the Nation and its people (though I doubt there is any want of statutory authority, see 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 910).  This case, however, does not present that question, because an emergency power of necessity must at least be limited by the emergency; Hamdi has been locked up for over two years.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Ex parte Milligan,
				</em>
				 4 Wall. 2, 127 (1866) (martial law justified only by actual and present necessity as in a genuine invasion that closes civilian courts).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Whether insisting on the careful scrutiny of emergency claims or on a vigorous reading of §4001(a), we are heirs to a tradition given voice 800 years ago by Magna Carta, which, on the barons insistence, confined executive power by the law of the land.

				Because I find Hamdis detention forbidden by §4001(a) and unauthorized by the Force Resolution, I would not reach any questions of what process he may be due in litigating disputed issues in a proceeding under the habeas statute or prior to the habeas enquiry itself.  For me, it suffices that the Government has failed to justify holding him in the absence of a further Act of Congress, criminal charges, a showing that the detention conforms to the laws of war, or a demonstration that §4001(a) is unconstitutional.  I would therefore vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand for proceedings consistent with this view.

        <p class="bodytext">

 (Rutledge, J., concurring in result).  Although I think litigation of Hamdis status as an enemy combatant is unnecessary, the terms of the pluralitys remand will allow Hamdi to offer evidence that he is not an enemy combatant, and he should at the least have the benefit of that opportunity.

				It should go without saying that in joining with the plurality to produce a judgment, I do not adopt the pluralitys resolution of constitutional issues that I would not reach.  It is not that I could disagree with the pluralitys determinations (given the pluralitys view of the Force Resolution) that someone in Hamdis position is entitled at a minimum to notice of the Governments claimed factual basis for holding him, and to a fair chance to rebut it before a neutral decision maker, see

				According to Yaser Hamdis petition for writ of habeas corpus, brought on his behalf by his father, the Government of the United States is detaining him, an American citizen on American soil, with the explanation that he was seized on the field of battle in Afghanistan, having been on the enemy side.  It is undisputed that the Government has not charged him with espionage, treason, or any other crime under domestic law.  It is likewise undisputed that for one year and nine months, on the basis of an Executive designation of Hamdi as an enemy combatant, the Government denied him the right to send or receive any communication beyond the prison where he was held and, in particular, denied him access to counsel to represent him.

                </sup>
            </a>
				  The Government asserts a right to hold Hamdi under these conditions indefinitely, that is, until the Government determines that the United States is no longer threatened by the terrorism exemplified in the attacks of September 11, 2001.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In these proceedings on Hamdis petition, he seeks to challenge the facts claimed by the Government as the basis for holding him as an enemy combatant.  And in this Court he presses the distinct argument that the Governments claim, even if true, would not implicate any authority for holding him that would satisfy 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/4001.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. §4001(a)</a> (Non-Detention Act), which bars imprisonment
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				or detention of a citizen except pursuant to an Act of Congress.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Government responds that Hamdis incommunicado imprisonment as an enemy combatant seized on the field of battle falls within the Presidents power as Commander in Chief under the laws and usages of war, and is in any event authorized by two statutes.  Accordingly, the Government contends that Hamdi has no basis for any challenge by petition for habeas except to his own status as an enemy combatant; and even that challenge may go no further than to enquire whether some evidence supports Hamdis designation, see Brief for Respondents 3436; if there is some evidence, Hamdi should remain locked up at the discretion of the Executive.  At the argument of this case, in fact, the Government went further and suggested that as long as a prisoner could challenge his enemy combatant designation when responding to interrogation during incommunicado detention he was accorded sufficient process to support his designation as an enemy combatant.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 40; 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 42 ([H]e has an opportunity to explain it in his own words [d]uring interrogation).  Since on either view judicial enquiry so limited would be virtually worthless as a way to contest detention, the Governments concession of jurisdiction to hear Hamdis habeas claim is more theoretical than practical, leaving the assertion of Executive authority close to unconditional.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The plurality rejects any such limit on the exercise of habeas jurisdiction and so far I agree with its opinion.  The plurality does, however, accept the Governments position that if Hamdis designation as an enemy combatant is correct, his detention (at least as to some period) is authorized by an Act of Congress as required by §4001(a), that is, by the Authorization for Use of Military Force, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">115</a>Stat.
224 (hereinafter Force Resolution).  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 914.  Here, I disagree and respectfully dissent.  The Government has failed to demonstrate that the Force Resolution authorizes the detention complained of here even on the facts the Government claims.  If the Government raises nothing further than the record now shows, the Non-Detention Act entitles Hamdi to be released.
			</p>
        <p class="opcentered">
				I
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				The Governments first response to Hamdis claim that holding him violates §4001(a), prohibiting detention of citizens except pursuant to an Act of Congress, is that the statute does not even apply to military wartime detentions, being beyond the sphere of domestic criminal law.  Next, the Government says that even if that statute does apply, two Acts of Congress provide the authority §4001(a) demands: a general authorization to the Department of Defense to pay for detaining prisoners of war and similar persons, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/956.html#5" class="subref" title="subref">10 U. S. C. §956(5)</a>, and the Force Resolution, passed after the attacks of 2001.  At the same time, the Government argues that in detaining Hamdi in the manner described, the President is in any event acting as Commander in Chief under Article II of the Constitution, which brings with it the right to invoke authority under the accepted customary rules for waging war.  On the record in front of us, the Government has not made out a case on any theory.

        <p class="opcentered">

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				The threshold issue is how broadly or narrowly to read the Non-Detention Act, the tone of which is severe: No citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained by the United States except pursuant to an Act of Congress.  Should the severity of the Act be relieved when the Governments stated factual justification for incommunicado detention is a war on terrorism, so that the Government may be said to act pursuant to congressional terms that fall short of explicit authority to imprison individuals?  With one possible though important qualification, see 
				<em>
					infra
				</em>
				, at 1011, the answer has to be no.  For a number of reasons, the prohibition within §4001(a) has to be read broadly to accord the statute a long reach and to impose a burden of justification on the Government.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				First, the circumstances in which the Act was adopted point the way to this interpretation.  The provision superseded a cold-war statute, the Emergency Detention Act of 1950 (formerly 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/50/811.html" class="subref" title="subref">50 U. S. C. §811</a>
            <em>
					et seq.
				</em>
				 (1970 ed.)), which had authorized the Attorney General, in time of emergency, to detain anyone reasonably thought likely to engage in espionage or sabotage.  That statute was repealed in 1971 out of fear that it could authorize a repetition of the World War II internment of citizens of Japanese ancestry; Congress meant to preclude another episode like the one described in 
				<em>
					Korematsu
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/323/214" class="subref" title="subref">323 U. S. 214</a> (1944)
.  See H. R. Rep. No. 92116, pp. 2, 45 (1971).  While Congress might simply have struck the 1950 statute, in considering the repealer the point was made that the existing statute provided some express procedural protection, without which the Executive would seem to be subject to no statutory limits protecting individual liberty.  See 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 5 (mere repeal might leave citizens subject to arbitrary executive action, with no clear demarcation of the limits of executive authority); 117 Cong. Rec. 31544 (1971) (Emergency Detention Act remains as the only existing barrier against the future exercise of executive power which resulted in the Japanese internment); cf. 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 31548 (in the absence of further procedural provisions, even §4001(a) will virtually leave us stripped naked against the great power … which the President has).  It was in these circumstances that a proposed limit on Executive action was expanded to the inclusive scope of §4001(a) as enacted.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The fact that Congress intended to guard against a repetition of the World War II internments when it repealed the 1950 statute and gave us §4001(a) provides a powerful reason to think that §4001(a) was meant to require clear congressional authorization before any citizen can be placed in a cell.  It is not merely that the legislative history shows that §4001(a) was thought necessary in anticipation of times just like the present, in which the safety of the country is threatened.  To appreciate what is most significant, one must only recall that the internments of the 1940s were accomplished by Executive action.  Although an Act of Congress ratified and confirmed an Executive order authorizing the military to exclude individuals from defined areas and to accommodate those it might remove, see 
				<em>
					Ex parte Endo
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/323/283" class="subref" title="subref">323 U. S. 283</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">285</a>288 (1944)
, the statute said nothing whatever about the detention of those who might be removed, 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 300301; internment camps were creatures of the Executive, and confinement in them rested on assertion of Executive authority, see 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 287293.  When, therefore, Congress repealed the 1950 Act and adopted §4001(a) for the purpose of avoiding another 
				<em>
					Korematsu
				</em>
				, it intended to preclude reliance on vague congressional authority (for example, providing accommodations for those subject to removal) as authority for detention or imprisonment at the discretion of the Executive (maintaining detention camps of American citizens, for example).  In requiring that any Executive detention be pursuant to an Act of Congress, then, Congress necessarily meant to require a congressional enactment that clearly authorized detention or imprisonment.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, when Congress passed §4001(a) it was acting in light of an interpretive regime that subjected enactments limiting liberty in wartime to the requirement of a clear statement and it presumably intended §4001(a) to be read accordingly.  This need for clarity was unmistakably expressed in 
				<em>
					Ex parte
				</em>
            <em>
					Endo
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, decided the same day as 
				<em>
					Korematsu
				</em>
				.  
				<em>
					Endo
				</em>
				 began with a petition for habeas corpus by an interned citizen claiming to be loyal and law-abiding and thus unlawfully detained.  323 U. S., at 294.  The petitioner was held entitled to habeas relief in an opinion that set out this principle for scrutinizing wartime statutes in derogation of customary liberty:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				In interpreting a wartime measure we must assume that [its] purpose was to allow for the greatest possible accommodation between … liberties and the exigencies of war.  We must assume, when asked to find implied powers in a grant of legislative or executive authority, that the law makers intended to place no greater restraint on the citizen than was clearly and unmistakably indicated by the language they used.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 300.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
Congresss understanding of the need for clear authority before citizens are kept detained is itself therefore clear, and §4001(a) must be read to have teeth in its demand for congressional authorization.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Finally, even if history had spared us the cautionary example of the internments in World War II, even if there had been no 
				<em>
					Korematsu
				</em>
				, and 
				<em>
					Endo
				</em>
				 had set out no principle of statutory interpretation, there would be a compelling reason to read §4001(a) to demand manifest authority to detain before detention is authorized.  The defining character of American constitutional government is its constant tension between security and liberty, serving both by partial helpings of each.  In a government of separated powers, deciding finally on what is a reasonable degree of guaranteed liberty whether in peace or war (or some condition in between) is not well entrusted to the Executive Branch of Government, whose particular responsibility is to maintain security.  For reasons of inescapable human nature, the branch of the Government asked to counter a serious threat is not the branch on which to rest the Nations entire reliance in striking the balance between the will to win and the cost in liberty on the way to victory; the responsibility for security will naturally amplify the claim that security legitimately raises.  A reasonable balance is more likely to be reached on the judgment of a different branch, just as Madison said in remarking that the constant aim is to divide and arrange the several offices in such a manner as that each may be a check on the otherthat the private interest of every individual may be a sentinel over the public rights.  The Federalist No. 51, p. 349 (J. Cooke ed. 1961).  Hence the need for an assessment by Congress before citizens are subject to lockup, and likewise the need for a clearly expressed congressional resolution of the competing claims.

        <p class="opcentered">
				III
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				Under this principle of reading §4001(a) robustly to require a clear statement of authorization to detain, none of the Governments arguments suffices to justify Hamdis detention.
			</p>
        <p class="opcentered">
				A
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				First, there is the argument that §4001(a) does not even apply to wartime military detentions, a position resting on the placement of §4001(a) in Title 18 of the United States Code, the gathering of federal criminal law.  The text of the statute does not, however, so limit its reach, and the legislative history of the provision shows its placement in Title 18 was not meant to render the statute more restricted than its terms.  The draft of what is now §4001(a) as contained in the original bill prohibited only imprisonment unauthorized by Title 18.  See H. R. Rep. No. 92
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				116, at 4.  In response to the Department of Justices objection that the original draft seemed to assume wrongly that all provisions for the detention of convicted persons would be contained in Title 18, the provision was amended by replacing a reference to that title with the reference to an Act of Congress.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 3.  The Committee on the Judiciary, discussing this change, stated that [limiting] detention of citizens … to situations in which … an Act of Congres[s] exists would assure that no detention camps can be established without at least the acquiescence of the Congress.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 5.  See also 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 46.  This understanding, that the amended bill would sweep beyond imprisonment for crime and apply to Executive detention in furtherance of wartime security, was emphasized in an extended debate.  Representative Ichord, chairman of the House Internal Security Committee and an opponent of the bill, feared that the redrafted statute would deprive the President of his emergency powers and his most effective means of coping with sabotage and espionage agents in war-related crises.  117 Cong. Rec., at 31542.  Representative Railsback, the bills sponsor, spoke of the bill in absolute terms: [I]n order to prohibit arbitrary executive action, [the bill] assures that no detention of citizens can be undertaken by the Executive without the prior consent of Congress.

					Id.
				</em>
				, at 31551.  This legislative history indicates that Congress was aware that §4001(a) would limit the Executives power to detain citizens in wartime to protect national security, and it is fair to say that the prohibition was thus intended to extend not only to the exercise of power to vindicate the interests underlying domestic criminal law, but to statutorily unauthorized detention by the Executive for reasons of security in wartime, just as Hamdi claims.

				 a claim the Government fails to support sufficiently to satisfy §4001(a) as read to require a clear statement of authority to detain.  Since the Force Resolution was adopted one week after the attacks of September 11, 2001, it naturally speaks with some generality, but its focus is clear, and that is on the use of military power.  It is fairly read to authorize the use of armies and weapons, whether against other armies or individual terrorists.  But, like the statute discussed in 
				<em>
					Endo
				</em>
				, it never so much as uses the word detention, and there is no reason to think Congress might have perceived any need to augment Executive power to deal with dangerous citizens within the United States, given the well-stocked statutory arsenal of defined criminal offenses covering the gamut of actions that a citizen sympathetic to terrorists might commit.

				Even so, there is one argument for treating the Force Resolution as sufficiently clear to authorize detention of a citizen consistently with §4001(a).  Assuming the argument to be sound, however, the Government is in no position to claim its advantage.

				Because the Force Resolution authorizes the use of military force in acts of war by the United States, the argument goes, it is reasonably clear that the military and its Commander in Chief are authorized to deal with enemy belligerents according to the treaties and customs known collectively as the laws of war.  Brief for Respondents 20

, may perhaps be claimed for the proposition that the American citizenship of such a captive does not as such limit the Governments power to deal with him under the usages of war.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 31, 3738.  Thus, the Government here repeatedly argues that Hamdis detention amounts to nothing more than customary detention of a captive taken on the field of battle: if the usages of war are fairly authorized by the Force Resolution, Hamdis detention is authorized for purposes of §4001(a).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				There is no need, however, to address the merits of such an argument in all possible circumstances.  For now it is enough to recognize that the Governments stated legal position in its campaign against the Taliban (among whom Hamdi was allegedly captured) is apparently at odds with
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				its claim here to be acting in accordance with custo-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				mary law of war and hence to be within the terms of
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				the Force Resolution in its detention of Hamdi.  In a statement of its legal position cited in its brief, the
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				Government says that the Geneva Convention applies
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				to the Taliban detainees.  Office of the White House Press Secretary, Fact Sheet, Status of Detainees at Guantanamo (Feb. 7, 2002), www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				02/2002020713.html (as visited June 18, 2004, and available in Clerk of Courts case file) (hereinafter White House Press Release) (cited in Brief for Respondents 24, n. 9).  Hamdi presumably is such a detainee, since according to the Governments own account, he was taken bearing arms on the Taliban side of a field of battle in Afghanistan.  He would therefore seem to qualify for treatment as a prisoner of war under the Third Geneva Convention, to which the United States is a party.  Article 4 of the Geneva Convention (III) Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug. 12, 1949, [1955] 6 U. S. T. 3316, 3320, T. I. A. S. No. 3364.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				By holding him incommunicado, however, the Government obviously has not been treating him as a prisoner of war, and in fact the Government claims that no Taliban detainee is entitled to prisoner of war status.  See Brief for Respondents 24; White House Press Release.  This treatment appears to be a violation of the Geneva Convention provision that even in cases of doubt, captives are entitled to be treated as prisoners of war until such time as their status has been determined by a competent tribunal.  Art. 5, 6 U. S. T., at 3324.  The Government answers that the Presidents determination that Taliban detainees do not qualify as prisoners of war is conclusive as to Hamdis status and removes any doubt that would trigger application of the Conventions tribunal requirement.  See Brief for Respondents 24.  But reliance on this categorical pronouncement to settle doubt is apparently at odds with the military regulation, Enemy Prisoners of War, Retained Personnel, Civilian Internees and Other Detainees, Army Reg. 1908, §§15, 16 (1997),
				 
				adopted to implement the Geneva Convention, and setting out a detailed procedure for a military tribunal to determine an individuals status.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 id
				</em>
				., §16
				 
				(A competent tribunal shall be composed of three commissioned officers; a written record shall be made of proceedings; [p]roceedings shall be open with certain exceptions; [p]ersons whose status is to be determined shall be advised of their rights at the beginning of their hearings, allowed to attend all open sessions, allowed to call witnesses if reasonably available, and to question those witnesses called by the Tribunal, and to have a right to testify; and a tribunal shall determine status by a [p]reponderance of evidence).  One of the types of doubt these tribunals are meant to settle is whether a given individual may be, as Hamdi says he is, an [i]nnocent civilian who should be immediately returned to his home or released.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, 16
				<em>
					e
				</em>
				(10)(
				<em>

				</em>
				).  The regulation, jointly promulgated by the Headquarters of the Departments of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps, provides that [p]ersons who have been determined by a competent tribunal not to be entitled to prisoner of war status may not be executed, imprisoned, or otherwise penalized without further proceedings to determine what acts they have committed and what penalty should be imposed.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, §16
				<em>
					g
				</em>
				.  The regulation also incorporates the Geneva Conventions presumption that in cases of doubt, persons shall enjoy the protection of the … Convention until such time as their status has been determined by a competent tribunal.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., §16
				<em>
					a
				</em>
				.  Thus, there is reason to question whether the United States is acting in accordance with the laws of war it claims as authority.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Whether, or to what degree, the Government is in fact violating the Geneva Convention and is thus acting outside the customary usages of war are not matters I can resolve at this point.  What I can say, though, is that the Government has not made out its claim that in detaining Hamdi in the manner described, it is acting in accord with the laws of war authorized to be applied against citizens by the Force Resolution.  I conclude accordingly that the Government has failed to support the position that the Force Resolution authorizes the described detention of Hamdi for purposes of §4001(a).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It is worth adding a further reason for requiring the Government to bear the burden of clearly justifying its claim to be exercising recognized war powers before declaring §4001(a) satisfied.  Thirty-eight days after adopting the Force Resolution, Congress passed the statute entitled Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA PATRIOT ACT), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">115</a>Stat.
272; that Act authorized the detention of alien terrorists for no more than seven days in the absence of criminal charges or deportation proceedings, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/8/1226a.html#a_5" class="subref" title="subref">8 U. S. C. §1226a(a)(5)</a> (2000 ed., Supp. I).  It is very difficult to believe that the same Congress that carefully circumscribed Executive power over alien terrorists on home soil would not have meant to require the Government to justify clearly
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				its detention of an American citizen held on home soil incommunicado.
			</p>
        <p class="opcentered">
				D
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				Since the Government has given no reason either to deflect the application of §4001(a) or to hold it to be satisfied, I need to go no further; the Government hints of a constitutional challenge to the statute, but it presents none here.  I will, however, stray across the line between statutory and constitutional territory just far enough to note the weakness of the Governments mixed claim of inherent, extrastatutory authority under a combination of Article II of the Constitution and the usages of war.  It is in fact in this connection that the Government developed its argument that the exercise of war powers justifies the detention, and what I have just said about its inadequacy applies here as well.  Beyond that, it is instructive to recall Justice Jacksons observation that the President is not Commander in Chief of the country, only of the military.

				There may be room for one qualification to Justice Jacksons statement, however: in a moment of genuine emergency, when the Government must act with no time for deliberation, the Executive may be able to detain a citizen if there is reason to fear he is an imminent threat to the safety of the Nation and its people (though I doubt there is any want of statutory authority, see 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 910).  This case, however, does not present that question, because an emergency power of necessity must at least be limited by the emergency; Hamdi has been locked up for over two years.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Ex parte Milligan,
				</em>
				 4 Wall. 2, 127 (1866) (martial law justified only by actual and present necessity as in a genuine invasion that closes civilian courts).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Whether insisting on the careful scrutiny of emergency claims or on a vigorous reading of §4001(a), we are heirs to a tradition given voice 800 years ago by Magna Carta, which, on the barons insistence, confined executive power by the law of the land.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Because I find Hamdis detention forbidden by §4001(a) and unauthorized by the Force Resolution, I would not reach any questions of what process he may be due in litigating disputed issues in a proceeding under the habeas statute or prior to the habeas enquiry itself.  For me, it suffices that the Government has failed to justify holding him in the absence of a further Act of Congress, criminal charges, a showing that the detention conforms to the laws of war, or a demonstration that §4001(a) is unconstitutional.  I would therefore vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand for proceedings consistent with this view.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Since this disposition does not command a majority of the Court, however, the need to give practical effect to the conclusions of eight members of the Court rejecting the Governments position calls for me to join with the plurality in ordering remand on terms closest to those I would impose.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">134</a> (1945)
 (Rutledge, J., concurring in result).  Although I think litigation of Hamdis status as an enemy combatant is unnecessary, the terms of the pluralitys remand will allow Hamdi to offer evidence that he is not an enemy combatant, and he should at the least have the benefit of that opportunity.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It should go without saying that in joining with the plurality to produce a judgment, I do not adopt the pluralitys resolution of constitutional issues that I would not reach.  It is not that I could disagree with the pluralitys determinations (given the pluralitys view of the Force Resolution) that someone in Hamdis position is entitled at a minimum to notice of the Governments claimed factual basis for holding him, and to a fair chance to rebut it before a neutral decision maker, see

				</em>
				, at 26; nor, of course, could I disagree with the pluralitys affirmation of Hamdis right to counsel, see 
				<em>

				</em>
				, at 27, or that an opportunity to litigate before a military tribunal might obviate or truncate enquiry by a court on habeas, see 
				<em>

				According to Yaser Hamdis petition for writ of habeas corpus, brought on his behalf by his father, the Government of the United States is detaining him, an American citizen on American soil, with the explanation that he was seized on the field of battle in Afghanistan, having been on the enemy side.  It is undisputed that the Government has not charged him with espionage, treason, or any other crime under domestic law.  It is likewise undisputed that for one year and nine months, on the basis of an Executive designation of Hamdi as an enemy combatant, the Government denied him the right to send or receive any communication beyond the prison where he was held and, in particular, denied him access to counsel to represent him.

                </sup>
            </a>
				  The Government asserts a right to hold Hamdi under these conditions indefinitely, that is, until the Government determines that the United States is no longer threatened by the terrorism exemplified in the attacks of September 11, 2001.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In these proceedings on Hamdis petition, he seeks to challenge the facts claimed by the Government as the basis for holding him as an enemy combatant.  And in this Court he presses the distinct argument that the Governments claim, even if true, would not implicate any authority for holding him that would satisfy 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/4001.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. §4001(a)</a> (Non-Detention Act), which bars imprisonment
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				or detention of a citizen except pursuant to an Act of Congress.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Government responds that Hamdis incommunicado imprisonment as an enemy combatant seized on the field of battle falls within the Presidents power as Commander in Chief under the laws and usages of war, and is in any event authorized by two statutes.  Accordingly, the Government contends that Hamdi has no basis for any challenge by petition for habeas except to his own status as an enemy combatant; and even that challenge may go no further than to enquire whether some evidence supports Hamdis designation, see Brief for Respondents 3436; if there is some evidence, Hamdi should remain locked up at the discretion of the Executive.  At the argument of this case, in fact, the Government went further and suggested that as long as a prisoner could challenge his enemy combatant designation when responding to interrogation during incommunicado detention he was accorded sufficient process to support his designation as an enemy combatant.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 40; 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 42 ([H]e has an opportunity to explain it in his own words [d]uring interrogation).  Since on either view judicial enquiry so limited would be virtually worthless as a way to contest detention, the Governments concession of jurisdiction to hear Hamdis habeas claim is more theoretical than practical, leaving the assertion of Executive authority close to unconditional.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The plurality rejects any such limit on the exercise of habeas jurisdiction and so far I agree with its opinion.  The plurality does, however, accept the Governments position that if Hamdis designation as an enemy combatant is correct, his detention (at least as to some period) is authorized by an Act of Congress as required by §4001(a), that is, by the Authorization for Use of Military Force, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">115</a>Stat.
224 (hereinafter Force Resolution).  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 914.  Here, I disagree and respectfully dissent.  The Government has failed to demonstrate that the Force Resolution authorizes the detention complained of here even on the facts the Government claims.  If the Government raises nothing further than the record now shows, the Non-Detention Act entitles Hamdi to be released.
			</p>
        <p class="opcentered">
				I
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				The Governments first response to Hamdis claim that holding him violates §4001(a), prohibiting detention of citizens except pursuant to an Act of Congress, is that the statute does not even apply to military wartime detentions, being beyond the sphere of domestic criminal law.  Next, the Government says that even if that statute does apply, two Acts of Congress provide the authority §4001(a) demands: a general authorization to the Department of Defense to pay for detaining prisoners of war and similar persons, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/956.html#5" class="subref" title="subref">10 U. S. C. §956(5)</a>, and the Force Resolution, passed after the attacks of 2001.  At the same time, the Government argues that in detaining Hamdi in the manner described, the President is in any event acting as Commander in Chief under Article II of the Constitution, which brings with it the right to invoke authority under the accepted customary rules for waging war.  On the record in front of us, the Government has not made out a case on any theory.

				The threshold issue is how broadly or narrowly to read the Non-Detention Act, the tone of which is severe: No citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained by the United States except pursuant to an Act of Congress.  Should the severity of the Act be relieved when the Governments stated factual justification for incommunicado detention is a war on terrorism, so that the Government may be said to act pursuant to congressional terms that fall short of explicit authority to imprison individuals?  With one possible though important qualification, see 
				<em>
					infra
				</em>
				, at 1011, the answer has to be no.  For a number of reasons, the prohibition within §4001(a) has to be read broadly to accord the statute a long reach and to impose a burden of justification on the Government.

				First, the circumstances in which the Act was adopted point the way to this interpretation.  The provision superseded a cold-war statute, the Emergency Detention Act of 1950 (formerly 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/50/811.html" class="subref" title="subref">50 U. S. C. §811</a>
            <em>
					et seq.
				</em>
				 (1970 ed.)), which had authorized the Attorney General, in time of emergency, to detain anyone reasonably thought likely to engage in espionage or sabotage.  That statute was repealed in 1971 out of fear that it could authorize a repetition of the World War II internment of citizens of Japanese ancestry; Congress meant to preclude another episode like the one described in 
				<em>
					Korematsu
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/323/214" class="subref" title="subref">323 U. S. 214</a> (1944)
.  See H. R. Rep. No. 92116, pp. 2, 45 (1971).  While Congress might simply have struck the 1950 statute, in considering the repealer the point was made that the existing statute provided some express procedural protection, without which the Executive would seem to be subject to no statutory limits protecting individual liberty.  See 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 5 (mere repeal might leave citizens subject to arbitrary executive action, with no clear demarcation of the limits of executive authority); 117 Cong. Rec. 31544 (1971) (Emergency Detention Act remains as the only existing barrier against the future exercise of executive power which resulted in the Japanese internment); cf. 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 31548 (in the absence of further procedural provisions, even §4001(a) will virtually leave us stripped naked against the great power … which the President has).  It was in these circumstances that a proposed limit on Executive action was expanded to the inclusive scope of §4001(a) as enacted.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The fact that Congress intended to guard against a repetition of the World War II internments when it repealed the 1950 statute and gave us §4001(a) provides a powerful reason to think that §4001(a) was meant to require clear congressional authorization before any citizen can be placed in a cell.  It is not merely that the legislative history shows that §4001(a) was thought necessary in anticipation of times just like the present, in which the safety of the country is threatened.  To appreciate what is most significant, one must only recall that the internments of the 1940s were accomplished by Executive action.  Although an Act of Congress ratified and confirmed an Executive order authorizing the military to exclude individuals from defined areas and to accommodate those it might remove, see 
				<em>
					Ex parte Endo
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/323/283" class="subref" title="subref">323 U. S. 283</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">285</a>288 (1944)
, the statute said nothing whatever about the detention of those who might be removed, 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 300301; internment camps were creatures of the Executive, and confinement in them rested on assertion of Executive authority, see 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 287293.  When, therefore, Congress repealed the 1950 Act and adopted §4001(a) for the purpose of avoiding another 
				<em>
					Korematsu
				</em>
				, it intended to preclude reliance on vague congressional authority (for example, providing accommodations for those subject to removal) as authority for detention or imprisonment at the discretion of the Executive (maintaining detention camps of American citizens, for example).  In requiring that any Executive detention be pursuant to an Act of Congress, then, Congress necessarily meant to require a congressional enactment that clearly authorized detention or imprisonment.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, when Congress passed §4001(a) it was acting in light of an interpretive regime that subjected enactments limiting liberty in wartime to the requirement of a clear statement and it presumably intended §4001(a) to be read accordingly.  This need for clarity was unmistakably expressed in 
				<em>
					Ex parte
				</em>
            <em>
					Endo
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, decided the same day as 
				<em>
					Korematsu
				</em>
				.  
				<em>
					Endo
				</em>
				 began with a petition for habeas corpus by an interned citizen claiming to be loyal and law-abiding and thus unlawfully detained.  323 U. S., at 294.  The petitioner was held entitled to habeas relief in an opinion that set out this principle for scrutinizing wartime statutes in derogation of customary liberty:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				In interpreting a wartime measure we must assume that [its] purpose was to allow for the greatest possible accommodation between … liberties and the exigencies of war.  We must assume, when asked to find implied powers in a grant of legislative or executive authority, that the law makers intended to place no greater restraint on the citizen than was clearly and unmistakably indicated by the language they used.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 300.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
Congresss understanding of the need for clear authority before citizens are kept detained is itself therefore clear, and §4001(a) must be read to have teeth in its demand for congressional authorization.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Finally, even if history had spared us the cautionary example of the internments in World War II, even if there had been no 
				<em>
					Korematsu
				</em>
				, and 
				<em>
					Endo
				</em>
				 had set out no principle of statutory interpretation, there would be a compelling reason to read §4001(a) to demand manifest authority to detain before detention is authorized.  The defining character of American constitutional government is its constant tension between security and liberty, serving both by partial helpings of each.  In a government of separated powers, deciding finally on what is a reasonable degree of guaranteed liberty whether in peace or war (or some condition in between) is not well entrusted to the Executive Branch of Government, whose particular responsibility is to maintain security.  For reasons of inescapable human nature, the branch of the Government asked to counter a serious threat is not the branch on which to rest the Nations entire reliance in striking the balance between the will to win and the cost in liberty on the way to victory; the responsibility for security will naturally amplify the claim that security legitimately raises.  A reasonable balance is more likely to be reached on the judgment of a different branch, just as Madison said in remarking that the constant aim is to divide and arrange the several offices in such a manner as that each may be a check on the otherthat the private interest of every individual may be a sentinel over the public rights.  The Federalist No. 51, p. 349 (J. Cooke ed. 1961).  Hence the need for an assessment by Congress before citizens are subject to lockup, and likewise the need for a clearly expressed congressional resolution of the competing claims.

        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				Under this principle of reading §4001(a) robustly to require a clear statement of authorization to detain, none of the Governments arguments suffices to justify Hamdis detention.

        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				First, there is the argument that §4001(a) does not even apply to wartime military detentions, a position resting on the placement of §4001(a) in Title 18 of the United States Code, the gathering of federal criminal law.  The text of the statute does not, however, so limit its reach, and the legislative history of the provision shows its placement in Title 18 was not meant to render the statute more restricted than its terms.  The draft of what is now §4001(a) as contained in the original bill prohibited only imprisonment unauthorized by Title 18.  See H. R. Rep. No. 92
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				116, at 4.  In response to the Department of Justices objection that the original draft seemed to assume wrongly that all provisions for the detention of convicted persons would be contained in Title 18, the provision was amended by replacing a reference to that title with the reference to an Act of Congress.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 3.  The Committee on the Judiciary, discussing this change, stated that [limiting] detention of citizens … to situations in which … an Act of Congres[s] exists would assure that no detention camps can be established without at least the acquiescence of the Congress.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 5.  See also 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 46.  This understanding, that the amended bill would sweep beyond imprisonment for crime and apply to Executive detention in furtherance of wartime security, was emphasized in an extended debate.  Representative Ichord, chairman of the House Internal Security Committee and an opponent of the bill, feared that the redrafted statute would deprive the President of his emergency powers and his most effective means of coping with sabotage and espionage agents in war-related crises.  117 Cong. Rec., at 31542.  Representative Railsback, the bills sponsor, spoke of the bill in absolute terms: [I]n order to prohibit arbitrary executive action, [the bill] assures that no detention of citizens can be undertaken by the Executive without the prior consent of Congress.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 31551.  This legislative history indicates that Congress was aware that §4001(a) would limit the Executives power to detain citizens in wartime to protect national security, and it is fair to say that the prohibition was thus intended to extend not only to the exercise of power to vindicate the interests underlying domestic criminal law, but to statutorily unauthorized detention by the Executive for reasons of security in wartime, just as Hamdi claims.

				Next, there is the Governments claim, accepted by the Court, that the terms of the Force Resolution are adequate to authorize detention of an enemy combatant under the circumstances described,

            </a>
				 a claim the Government fails to support sufficiently to satisfy §4001(a) as read to require a clear statement of authority to detain.  Since the Force Resolution was adopted one week after the attacks of September 11, 2001, it naturally speaks with some generality, but its focus is clear, and that is on the use of military power.  It is fairly read to authorize the use of armies and weapons, whether against other armies or individual terrorists.  But, like the statute discussed in 
				<em>
					Endo
				</em>
				, it never so much as uses the word detention, and there is no reason to think Congress might have perceived any need to augment Executive power to deal with dangerous citizens within the United States, given the well-stocked statutory arsenal of defined criminal offenses covering the gamut of actions that a citizen sympathetic to terrorists might commit.

				Even so, there is one argument for treating the Force Resolution as sufficiently clear to authorize detention of a citizen consistently with §4001(a).  Assuming the argument to be sound, however, the Government is in no position to claim its advantage.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Because the Force Resolution authorizes the use of military force in acts of war by the United States, the argument goes, it is reasonably clear that the military and its Commander in Chief are authorized to deal with enemy belligerents according to the treaties and customs known collectively as the laws of war.

, may perhaps be claimed for the proposition that the American citizenship of such a captive does not as such limit the Governments power to deal with him under the usages of war.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 31, 3738.  Thus, the Government here repeatedly argues that Hamdis detention amounts to nothing more than customary detention of a captive taken on the field of battle: if the usages of war are fairly authorized by the Force Resolution, Hamdis detention is authorized for purposes of §4001(a).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				There is no need, however, to address the merits of such an argument in all possible circumstances.  For now it is enough to recognize that the Governments stated legal position in its campaign against the Taliban (among whom Hamdi was allegedly captured) is apparently at odds with
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				its claim here to be acting in accordance with custo-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				mary law of war and hence to be within the terms of
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				the Force Resolution in its detention of Hamdi.  In a statement of its legal position cited in its brief, the
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				Government says that the Geneva Convention applies
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				to the Taliban detainees.  Office of the White House Press Secretary, Fact Sheet, Status of Detainees at Guantanamo (Feb. 7, 2002), www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				02/2002020713.html (as visited June 18, 2004, and available in Clerk of Courts case file) (hereinafter White House Press Release) (cited in Brief for Respondents 24, n. 9).  Hamdi presumably is such a detainee, since according to the Governments own account, he was taken bearing arms on the Taliban side of a field of battle in Afghanistan.  He would therefore seem to qualify for treatment as a prisoner of war under the Third Geneva Convention, to which the United States is a party.  Article 4 of the Geneva Convention (III) Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug. 12, 1949, [1955] 6 U. S. T. 3316, 3320, T. I. A. S. No. 3364.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				By holding him incommunicado, however, the Government obviously has not been treating him as a prisoner of war, and in fact the Government claims that no Taliban detainee is entitled to prisoner of war status.  See Brief for Respondents 24; White House Press Release.  This treatment appears to be a violation of the Geneva Convention provision that even in cases of doubt, captives are entitled to be treated as prisoners of war until such time as their status has been determined by a competent tribunal.  Art. 5, 6 U. S. T., at 3324.  The Government answers that the Presidents determination that Taliban detainees do not qualify as prisoners of war is conclusive as to Hamdis status and removes any doubt that would trigger application of the Conventions tribunal requirement.  See Brief for Respondents 24.  But reliance on this categorical pronouncement to settle doubt is apparently at odds with the military regulation, Enemy Prisoners of War, Retained Personnel, Civilian Internees and Other Detainees, Army Reg. 1908, §§15, 16 (1997),
				 
				adopted to implement the Geneva Convention, and setting out a detailed procedure for a military tribunal to determine an individuals status.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 id
				</em>
				., §16
				 
				(A competent tribunal shall be composed of three commissioned officers; a written record shall be made of proceedings; [p]roceedings shall be open with certain exceptions; [p]ersons whose status is to be determined shall be advised of their rights at the beginning of their hearings, allowed to attend all open sessions, allowed to call witnesses if reasonably available, and to question those witnesses called by the Tribunal, and to have a right to testify; and a tribunal shall determine status by a [p]reponderance of evidence).  One of the types of doubt these tribunals are meant to settle is whether a given individual may be, as Hamdi says he is, an [i]nnocent civilian who should be immediately returned to his home or released.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, 16
				<em>
					e
				</em>
				(10)(
				<em>

				).  The regulation, jointly promulgated by the Headquarters of the Departments of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps, provides that [p]ersons who have been determined by a competent tribunal not to be entitled to prisoner of war status may not be executed, imprisoned, or otherwise penalized without further proceedings to determine what acts they have committed and what penalty should be imposed.  
				<em>

				, §16

				<em>

				</em>
				., §16
				<em>
					a
				</em>
				.  Thus, there is reason to question whether the United States is acting in accordance with the laws of war it claims as authority.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Whether, or to what degree, the Government is in fact violating the Geneva Convention and is thus acting outside the customary usages of war are not matters I can resolve at this point.  What I can say, though, is that the Government has not made out its claim that in detaining Hamdi in the manner described, it is acting in accord with the laws of war authorized to be applied against citizens by the Force Resolution.  I conclude accordingly that the Government has failed to support the position that the Force Resolution authorizes the described detention of Hamdi for purposes of §4001(a).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It is worth adding a further reason for requiring the Government to bear the burden of clearly justifying its claim to be exercising recognized war powers before declaring §4001(a) satisfied.  Thirty-eight days after adopting the Force Resolution, Congress passed the statute entitled Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA PATRIOT ACT), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">115</a>Stat.
272; that Act authorized the detention of alien terrorists for no more than seven days in the absence of criminal charges or deportation proceedings, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/8/1226a.html#a_5" class="subref" title="subref">8 U. S. C. §1226a(a)(5)</a> (2000 ed., Supp. I).  It is very difficult to believe that the same Congress that carefully circumscribed Executive power over alien terrorists on home soil would not have meant to require the Government to justify clearly
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				its detention of an American citizen held on home soil incommunicado.
			</p>
        <p class="opcentered">
				D
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				Since the Government has given no reason either to deflect the application of §4001(a) or to hold it to be satisfied, I need to go no further; the Government hints of a constitutional challenge to the statute, but it presents none here.  I will, however, stray across the line between statutory and constitutional territory just far enough to note the weakness of the Governments mixed claim of inherent, extrastatutory authority under a combination of Article II of the Constitution and the usages of war.  It is in fact in this connection that the Government developed its argument that the exercise of war powers justifies the detention, and what I have just said about its inadequacy applies here as well.  Beyond that, it is instructive to recall Justice Jacksons observation that the President is not Commander in Chief of the country, only of the military.

				There may be room for one qualification to Justice Jacksons statement, however: in a moment of genuine emergency, when the Government must act with no time for deliberation, the Executive may be able to detain a citizen if there is reason to fear he is an imminent threat to the safety of the Nation and its people (though I doubt there is any want of statutory authority, see 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 910).  This case, however, does not present that question, because an emergency power of necessity must at least be limited by the emergency; Hamdi has been locked up for over two years.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Ex parte Milligan,
				</em>
				 4 Wall. 2, 127 (1866) (martial law justified only by actual and present necessity as in a genuine invasion that closes civilian courts).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Whether insisting on the careful scrutiny of emergency claims or on a vigorous reading of §4001(a), we are heirs to a tradition given voice 800 years ago by Magna Carta, which, on the barons insistence, confined executive power by the law of the land.

				Because I find Hamdis detention forbidden by §4001(a) and unauthorized by the Force Resolution, I would not reach any questions of what process he may be due in litigating disputed issues in a proceeding under the habeas statute or prior to the habeas enquiry itself.  For me, it suffices that the Government has failed to justify holding him in the absence of a further Act of Congress, criminal charges, a showing that the detention conforms to the laws of war, or a demonstration that §4001(a) is unconstitutional.  I would therefore vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand for proceedings consistent with this view.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Since this disposition does not command a majority of the Court, however, the need to give practical effect to the conclusions of eight members of the Court rejecting the Governments position calls for me to join with the plurality in ordering remand on terms closest to those I would impose.

 (Rutledge, J., concurring in result).  Although I think litigation of Hamdis status as an enemy combatant is unnecessary, the terms of the pluralitys remand will allow Hamdi to offer evidence that he is not an enemy combatant, and he should at the least have the benefit of that opportunity.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It should go without saying that in joining with the plurality to produce a judgment, I do not adopt the pluralitys resolution of constitutional issues that I would not reach.  It is not that I could disagree with the pluralitys determinations (given the pluralitys view of the Force Resolution) that someone in Hamdis position is entitled at a minimum to notice of the Governments claimed factual basis for holding him, and to a fair chance to rebut it before a neutral decision maker, see

						 As noted, supra, at 3, the Government argues that a required Act of Congress is to be found in a statutory authorization to spend money appropriated for the care of prisoners of war and of other, similar prisoners,

				According to Yaser Hamdis petition for writ of habeas corpus, brought on his behalf by his father, the Government of the United States is detaining him, an American citizen on American soil, with the explanation that he was seized on the field of battle in Afghanistan, having been on the enemy side.  It is undisputed that the Government has not charged him with espionage, treason, or any other crime under domestic law.  It is likewise undisputed that for one year and nine months, on the basis of an Executive designation of Hamdi as an enemy combatant, the Government denied him the right to send or receive any communication beyond the prison where he was held and, in particular, denied him access to counsel to represent him.

                </sup>
            </a>
				  The Government asserts a right to hold Hamdi under these conditions indefinitely, that is, until the Government determines that the United States is no longer threatened by the terrorism exemplified in the attacks of September 11, 2001.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In these proceedings on Hamdis petition, he seeks to challenge the facts claimed by the Government as the basis for holding him as an enemy combatant.  And in this Court he presses the distinct argument that the Governments claim, even if true, would not implicate any authority for holding him that would satisfy 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/4001.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. §4001(a)</a> (Non-Detention Act), which bars imprisonment
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				or detention of a citizen except pursuant to an Act of Congress.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Government responds that Hamdis incommunicado imprisonment as an enemy combatant seized on the field of battle falls within the Presidents power as Commander in Chief under the laws and usages of war, and is in any event authorized by two statutes.  Accordingly, the Government contends that Hamdi has no basis for any challenge by petition for habeas except to his own status as an enemy combatant; and even that challenge may go no further than to enquire whether some evidence supports Hamdis designation, see Brief for Respondents 3436; if there is some evidence, Hamdi should remain locked up at the discretion of the Executive.  At the argument of this case, in fact, the Government went further and suggested that as long as a prisoner could challenge his enemy combatant designation when responding to interrogation during incommunicado detention he was accorded sufficient process to support his designation as an enemy combatant.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 40; 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 42 ([H]e has an opportunity to explain it in his own words [d]uring interrogation).  Since on either view judicial enquiry so limited would be virtually worthless as a way to contest detention, the Governments concession of jurisdiction to hear Hamdis habeas claim is more theoretical than practical, leaving the assertion of Executive authority close to unconditional.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The plurality rejects any such limit on the exercise of habeas jurisdiction and so far I agree with its opinion.  The plurality does, however, accept the Governments position that if Hamdis designation as an enemy combatant is correct, his detention (at least as to some period) is authorized by an Act of Congress as required by §4001(a), that is, by the Authorization for Use of Military Force, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">115</a>Stat.
224 (hereinafter Force Resolution).  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 914.  Here, I disagree and respectfully dissent.  The Government has failed to demonstrate that the Force Resolution authorizes the detention complained of here even on the facts the Government claims.  If the Government raises nothing further than the record now shows, the Non-Detention Act entitles Hamdi to be released.

				The Governments first response to Hamdis claim that holding him violates §4001(a), prohibiting detention of citizens except pursuant to an Act of Congress, is that the statute does not even apply to military wartime detentions, being beyond the sphere of domestic criminal law.  Next, the Government says that even if that statute does apply, two Acts of Congress provide the authority §4001(a) demands: a general authorization to the Department of Defense to pay for detaining prisoners of war and similar persons, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/956.html#5" class="subref" title="subref">10 U. S. C. §956(5)</a>, and the Force Resolution, passed after the attacks of 2001.  At the same time, the Government argues that in detaining Hamdi in the manner described, the President is in any event acting as Commander in Chief under Article II of the Constitution, which brings with it the right to invoke authority under the accepted customary rules for waging war.  On the record in front of us, the Government has not made out a case on any theory.

				The threshold issue is how broadly or narrowly to read the Non-Detention Act, the tone of which is severe: No citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained by the United States except pursuant to an Act of Congress.  Should the severity of the Act be relieved when the Governments stated factual justification for incommunicado detention is a war on terrorism, so that the Government may be said to act pursuant to congressional terms that fall short of explicit authority to imprison individuals?  With one possible though important qualification, see 
				<em>
					infra
				</em>
				, at 1011, the answer has to be no.  For a number of reasons, the prohibition within §4001(a) has to be read broadly to accord the statute a long reach and to impose a burden of justification on the Government.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				First, the circumstances in which the Act was adopted point the way to this interpretation.  The provision superseded a cold-war statute, the Emergency Detention Act of 1950 (formerly 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/50/811.html" class="subref" title="subref">50 U. S. C. §811</a>
            <em>
					et seq.
				</em>
				 (1970 ed.)), which had authorized the Attorney General, in time of emergency, to detain anyone reasonably thought likely to engage in espionage or sabotage.  That statute was repealed in 1971 out of fear that it could authorize a repetition of the World War II internment of citizens of Japanese ancestry; Congress meant to preclude another episode like the one described in 
				<em>
					Korematsu
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/323/214" class="subref" title="subref">323 U. S. 214</a> (1944)
.  See H. R. Rep. No. 92116, pp. 2, 45 (1971).  While Congress might simply have struck the 1950 statute, in considering the repealer the point was made that the existing statute provided some express procedural protection, without which the Executive would seem to be subject to no statutory limits protecting individual liberty.  See 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 5 (mere repeal might leave citizens subject to arbitrary executive action, with no clear demarcation of the limits of executive authority); 117 Cong. Rec. 31544 (1971) (Emergency Detention Act remains as the only existing barrier against the future exercise of executive power which resulted in the Japanese internment); cf. 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 31548 (in the absence of further procedural provisions, even §4001(a) will virtually leave us stripped naked against the great power … which the President has).  It was in these circumstances that a proposed limit on Executive action was expanded to the inclusive scope of §4001(a) as enacted.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The fact that Congress intended to guard against a repetition of the World War II internments when it repealed the 1950 statute and gave us §4001(a) provides a powerful reason to think that §4001(a) was meant to require clear congressional authorization before any citizen can be placed in a cell.  It is not merely that the legislative history shows that §4001(a) was thought necessary in anticipation of times just like the present, in which the safety of the country is threatened.  To appreciate what is most significant, one must only recall that the internments of the 1940s were accomplished by Executive action.  Although an Act of Congress ratified and confirmed an Executive order authorizing the military to exclude individuals from defined areas and to accommodate those it might remove, see 
				<em>
					Ex parte Endo
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/323/283" class="subref" title="subref">323 U. S. 283</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">285</a>288 (1944)
, the statute said nothing whatever about the detention of those who might be removed, 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 300301; internment camps were creatures of the Executive, and confinement in them rested on assertion of Executive authority, see 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 287293.  When, therefore, Congress repealed the 1950 Act and adopted §4001(a) for the purpose of avoiding another 
				<em>
					Korematsu
				</em>
				, it intended to preclude reliance on vague congressional authority (for example, providing accommodations for those subject to removal) as authority for detention or imprisonment at the discretion of the Executive (maintaining detention camps of American citizens, for example).  In requiring that any Executive detention be pursuant to an Act of Congress, then, Congress necessarily meant to require a congressional enactment that clearly authorized detention or imprisonment.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, when Congress passed §4001(a) it was acting in light of an interpretive regime that subjected enactments limiting liberty in wartime to the requirement of a clear statement and it presumably intended §4001(a) to be read accordingly.  This need for clarity was unmistakably expressed in 
				<em>
					Ex parte
				</em>
            <em>
					Endo
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, decided the same day as 
				<em>
					Korematsu
				</em>
				.  
				<em>
					Endo
				</em>
				 began with a petition for habeas corpus by an interned citizen claiming to be loyal and law-abiding and thus unlawfully detained.  323 U. S., at 294.  The petitioner was held entitled to habeas relief in an opinion that set out this principle for scrutinizing wartime statutes in derogation of customary liberty:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				In interpreting a wartime measure we must assume that [its] purpose was to allow for the greatest possible accommodation between … liberties and the exigencies of war.  We must assume, when asked to find implied powers in a grant of legislative or executive authority, that the law makers intended to place no greater restraint on the citizen than was clearly and unmistakably indicated by the language they used.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 300.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
Congresss understanding of the need for clear authority before citizens are kept detained is itself therefore clear, and §4001(a) must be read to have teeth in its demand for congressional authorization.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Finally, even if history had spared us the cautionary example of the internments in World War II, even if there had been no 
				<em>
					Korematsu
				</em>
				, and 
				<em>
					Endo
				</em>
				 had set out no principle of statutory interpretation, there would be a compelling reason to read §4001(a) to demand manifest authority to detain before detention is authorized.  The defining character of American constitutional government is its constant tension between security and liberty, serving both by partial helpings of each.  In a government of separated powers, deciding finally on what is a reasonable degree of guaranteed liberty whether in peace or war (or some condition in between) is not well entrusted to the Executive Branch of Government, whose particular responsibility is to maintain security.  For reasons of inescapable human nature, the branch of the Government asked to counter a serious threat is not the branch on which to rest the Nations entire reliance in striking the balance between the will to win and the cost in liberty on the way to victory; the responsibility for security will naturally amplify the claim that security legitimately raises.  A reasonable balance is more likely to be reached on the judgment of a different branch, just as Madison said in remarking that the constant aim is to divide and arrange the several offices in such a manner as that each may be a check on the otherthat the private interest of every individual may be a sentinel over the public rights.  The Federalist No. 51, p. 349 (J. Cooke ed. 1961).  Hence the need for an assessment by Congress before citizens are subject to lockup, and likewise the need for a clearly expressed congressional resolution of the competing claims.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				Under this principle of reading §4001(a) robustly to require a clear statement of authorization to detain, none of the Governments arguments suffices to justify Hamdis detention.
			</p>
        <p class="opcentered">
				A
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				First, there is the argument that §4001(a) does not even apply to wartime military detentions, a position resting on the placement of §4001(a) in Title 18 of the United States Code, the gathering of federal criminal law.  The text of the statute does not, however, so limit its reach, and the legislative history of the provision shows its placement in Title 18 was not meant to render the statute more restricted than its terms.  The draft of what is now §4001(a) as contained in the original bill prohibited only imprisonment unauthorized by Title 18.  See H. R. Rep. No. 92
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				116, at 4.  In response to the Department of Justices objection that the original draft seemed to assume wrongly that all provisions for the detention of convicted persons would be contained in Title 18, the provision was amended by replacing a reference to that title with the reference to an Act of Congress.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 3.  The Committee on the Judiciary, discussing this change, stated that [limiting] detention of citizens … to situations in which … an Act of Congres[s] exists would assure that no detention camps can be established without at least the acquiescence of the Congress.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 5.  See also 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 46.  This understanding, that the amended bill would sweep beyond imprisonment for crime and apply to Executive detention in furtherance of wartime security, was emphasized in an extended debate.  Representative Ichord, chairman of the House Internal Security Committee and an opponent of the bill, feared that the redrafted statute would deprive the President of his emergency powers and his most effective means of coping with sabotage and espionage agents in war-related crises.  117 Cong. Rec., at 31542.  Representative Railsback, the bills sponsor, spoke of the bill in absolute terms: [I]n order to prohibit arbitrary executive action, [the bill] assures that no detention of citizens can be undertaken by the Executive without the prior consent of Congress.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 31551.  This legislative history indicates that Congress was aware that §4001(a) would limit the Executives power to detain citizens in wartime to protect national security, and it is fair to say that the prohibition was thus intended to extend not only to the exercise of power to vindicate the interests underlying domestic criminal law, but to statutorily unauthorized detention by the Executive for reasons of security in wartime, just as Hamdi claims.

        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				Next, there is the Governments claim, accepted by the Court, that the terms of the Force Resolution are adequate to authorize detention of an enemy combatant under the circumstances described,
				<a name="ZX-3ref" href="#ZX-3" class="">
                <sup>

                </sup>
            </a>
				 a claim the Government fails to support sufficiently to satisfy §4001(a) as read to require a clear statement of authority to detain.  Since the Force Resolution was adopted one week after the attacks of September 11, 2001, it naturally speaks with some generality, but its focus is clear, and that is on the use of military power.  It is fairly read to authorize the use of armies and weapons, whether against other armies or individual terrorists.  But, like the statute discussed in 
				<em>
					Endo
				</em>
				, it never so much as uses the word detention, and there is no reason to think Congress might have perceived any need to augment Executive power to deal with dangerous citizens within the United States, given the well-stocked statutory arsenal of defined criminal offenses covering the gamut of actions that a citizen sympathetic to terrorists might commit.

				Even so, there is one argument for treating the Force Resolution as sufficiently clear to authorize detention of a citizen consistently with §4001(a).  Assuming the argument to be sound, however, the Government is in no position to claim its advantage.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Because the Force Resolution authorizes the use of military force in acts of war by the United States, the argument goes, it is reasonably clear that the military and its Commander in Chief are authorized to deal with enemy belligerents according to the treaties and customs known collectively as the laws of war.  Brief for Respondents 20
				<span class="softbreak"></span>

, may perhaps be claimed for the proposition that the American citizenship of such a captive does not as such limit the Governments power to deal with him under the usages of war.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 31, 3738.  Thus, the Government here repeatedly argues that Hamdis detention amounts to nothing more than customary detention of a captive taken on the field of battle: if the usages of war are fairly authorized by the Force Resolution, Hamdis detention is authorized for purposes of §4001(a).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				There is no need, however, to address the merits of such an argument in all possible circumstances.  For now it is enough to recognize that the Governments stated legal position in its campaign against the Taliban (among whom Hamdi was allegedly captured) is apparently at odds with
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				its claim here to be acting in accordance with custo-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				mary law of war and hence to be within the terms of
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				the Force Resolution in its detention of Hamdi.  In a statement of its legal position cited in its brief, the
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				Government says that the Geneva Convention applies
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				to the Taliban detainees.  Office of the White House Press Secretary, Fact Sheet, Status of Detainees at Guantanamo (Feb. 7, 2002), www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/

Hamdi presumably is such a detainee, since according to the Governments own account, he was taken bearing arms on the Taliban side of a field of battle in Afghanistan.  He would therefore seem to qualify for treatment as a prisoner of war under the Third Geneva Convention, to which the United States is a party.

				By holding him incommunicado, however, the Government obviously has not been treating him as a prisoner of war, and in fact the Government claims that no Taliban detainee is entitled to prisoner of war status.

This treatment appears to be a violation of the Geneva Convention provision that even in cases of doubt, captives are entitled to be treated as prisoners of war until such time as their status has been determined by a competent tribunal.  Art. 5, 6 U. S. T., at 3324.  The Government answers that the Presidents determination that Taliban detainees do not qualify as prisoners of war is conclusive as to Hamdis status and removes any doubt that would trigger application of the Conventions tribunal requirement.  See Brief for Respondents 24.  But reliance on this categorical pronouncement to settle doubt is apparently at odds with the military regulation, Enemy Prisoners of War, Retained Personnel, Civilian Internees and Other Detainees, Army Reg. 1908, §§15, 16 (1997),
				 
				adopted to implement the Geneva Convention, and setting out a detailed procedure for a military tribunal to determine an individuals status.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 id
				</em>
				., §16
				 
				(A competent tribunal shall be composed of three commissioned officers; a written record shall be made of proceedings; [p]roceedings shall be open with certain exceptions; [p]ersons whose status is to be determined shall be advised of their rights at the beginning of their hearings, allowed to attend all open sessions, allowed to call witnesses if reasonably available, and to question those witnesses called by the Tribunal, and to have a right to testify; and a tribunal shall determine status by a [p]reponderance of evidence).  One of the types of doubt these tribunals are meant to settle is whether a given individual may be, as Hamdi says he is, an [i]nnocent civilian who should be immediately returned to his home or released.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, 16
				<em>

				(10)(

				).  The regulation, jointly promulgated by the Headquarters of the Departments of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps, provides that [p]ersons who have been determined by a competent tribunal not to be entitled to prisoner of war status may not be executed, imprisoned, or otherwise penalized without further proceedings to determine what acts they have committed and what penalty should be imposed.  
				<em>

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Whether, or to what degree, the Government is in fact violating the Geneva Convention and is thus acting outside the customary usages of war are not matters I can resolve at this point.  What I can say, though, is that the Government has not made out its claim that in detaining Hamdi in the manner described, it is acting in accord with the laws of war authorized to be applied against citizens by the Force Resolution.  I conclude accordingly that the Government has failed to support the position that the Force Resolution authorizes the described detention of Hamdi for purposes of §4001(a).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It is worth adding a further reason for requiring the Government to bear the burden of clearly justifying its claim to be exercising recognized war powers before declaring §4001(a) satisfied.  Thirty-eight days after adopting the Force Resolution, Congress passed the statute entitled Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA PATRIOT ACT), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">115</a>Stat.
272; that Act authorized the detention of alien terrorists for no more than seven days in the absence of criminal charges or deportation proceedings, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/8/1226a.html#a_5" class="subref" title="subref">8 U. S. C. §1226a(a)(5)</a> (2000 ed., Supp. I).  It is very difficult to believe that the same Congress that carefully circumscribed Executive power over alien terrorists on home soil would not have meant to require the Government to justify clearly
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				its detention of an American citizen held on home soil incommunicado.

        <p class="opcentered">

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				Since the Government has given no reason either to deflect the application of §4001(a) or to hold it to be satisfied, I need to go no further; the Government hints of a constitutional challenge to the statute, but it presents none here.  I will, however, stray across the line between statutory and constitutional territory just far enough to note the weakness of the Governments mixed claim of inherent, extrastatutory authority under a combination of Article II of the Constitution and the usages of war.  It is in fact in this connection that the Government developed its argument that the exercise of war powers justifies the detention, and what I have just said about its inadequacy applies here as well.  Beyond that, it is instructive to recall Justice Jacksons observation that the President is not Commander in Chief of the country, only of the military.

				There may be room for one qualification to Justice Jacksons statement, however: in a moment of genuine emergency, when the Government must act with no time for deliberation, the Executive may be able to detain a citizen if there is reason to fear he is an imminent threat to the safety of the Nation and its people (though I doubt there is any want of statutory authority, see 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 910).  This case, however, does not present that question, because an emergency power of necessity must at least be limited by the emergency; Hamdi has been locked up for over two years.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Ex parte Milligan,
				</em>
				 4 Wall. 2, 127 (1866) (martial law justified only by actual and present necessity as in a genuine invasion that closes civilian courts).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Whether insisting on the careful scrutiny of emergency claims or on a vigorous reading of §4001(a), we are heirs to a tradition given voice 800 years ago by Magna Carta, which, on the barons insistence, confined executive power by the law of the land.

				Because I find Hamdis detention forbidden by §4001(a) and unauthorized by the Force Resolution, I would not reach any questions of what process he may be due in litigating disputed issues in a proceeding under the habeas statute or prior to the habeas enquiry itself.  For me, it suffices that the Government has failed to justify holding him in the absence of a further Act of Congress, criminal charges, a showing that the detention conforms to the laws of war, or a demonstration that §4001(a) is unconstitutional.  I would therefore vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand for proceedings consistent with this view.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Since this disposition does not command a majority of the Court, however, the need to give practical effect to the conclusions of eight members of the Court rejecting the Governments position calls for me to join with the plurality in ordering remand on terms closest to those I would impose.

 (Rutledge, J., concurring in result).  Although I think litigation of Hamdis status as an enemy combatant is unnecessary, the terms of the pluralitys remand will allow Hamdi to offer evidence that he is not an enemy combatant, and he should at the least have the benefit of that opportunity.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It should go without saying that in joining with the plurality to produce a judgment, I do not adopt the pluralitys resolution of constitutional issues that I would not reach.  It is not that I could disagree with the pluralitys determinations (given the pluralitys view of the Force Resolution) that someone in Hamdis position is entitled at a minimum to notice of the Governments claimed factual basis for holding him, and to a fair chance to rebut it before a neutral decision maker, see

				According to Yaser Hamdis petition for writ of habeas corpus, brought on his behalf by his father, the Government of the United States is detaining him, an American citizen on American soil, with the explanation that he was seized on the field of battle in Afghanistan, having been on the enemy side.  It is undisputed that the Government has not charged him with espionage, treason, or any other crime under domestic law.  It is likewise undisputed that for one year and nine months, on the basis of an Executive designation of Hamdi as an enemy combatant, the Government denied him the right to send or receive any communication beyond the prison where he was held and, in particular, denied him access to counsel to represent him.
				<a name="ZX-1ref" href="#ZX-1" class="">

				</b>
                </sup>
            </a>
				  The Government asserts a right to hold Hamdi under these conditions indefinitely, that is, until the Government determines that the United States is no longer threatened by the terrorism exemplified in the attacks of September 11, 2001.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In these proceedings on Hamdis petition, he seeks to challenge the facts claimed by the Government as the basis for holding him as an enemy combatant.  And in this Court he presses the distinct argument that the Governments claim, even if true, would not implicate any authority for holding him that would satisfy 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/4001.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. §4001(a)</a> (Non-Detention Act), which bars imprisonment
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				or detention of a citizen except pursuant to an Act of Congress.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Government responds that Hamdis incommunicado imprisonment as an enemy combatant seized on the field of battle falls within the Presidents power as Commander in Chief under the laws and usages of war, and is in any event authorized by two statutes.  Accordingly, the Government contends that Hamdi has no basis for any challenge by petition for habeas except to his own status as an enemy combatant; and even that challenge may go no further than to enquire whether some evidence supports Hamdis designation, see Brief for Respondents 3436; if there is some evidence, Hamdi should remain locked up at the discretion of the Executive.  At the argument of this case, in fact, the Government went further and suggested that as long as a prisoner could challenge his enemy combatant designation when responding to interrogation during incommunicado detention he was accorded sufficient process to support his designation as an enemy combatant.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 40; 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 42 ([H]e has an opportunity to explain it in his own words [d]uring interrogation).  Since on either view judicial enquiry so limited would be virtually worthless as a way to contest detention, the Governments concession of jurisdiction to hear Hamdis habeas claim is more theoretical than practical, leaving the assertion of Executive authority close to unconditional.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The plurality rejects any such limit on the exercise of habeas jurisdiction and so far I agree with its opinion.  The plurality does, however, accept the Governments position that if Hamdis designation as an enemy combatant is correct, his detention (at least as to some period) is authorized by an Act of Congress as required by §4001(a), that is, by the Authorization for Use of Military Force, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">115</a>Stat.
224 (hereinafter Force Resolution).  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 914.  Here, I disagree and respectfully dissent.  The Government has failed to demonstrate that the Force Resolution authorizes the detention complained of here even on the facts the Government claims.  If the Government raises nothing further than the record now shows, the Non-Detention Act entitles Hamdi to be released.
			</p>
        <p class="opcentered">
				I
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				The Governments first response to Hamdis claim that holding him violates §4001(a), prohibiting detention of citizens except pursuant to an Act of Congress, is that the statute does not even apply to military wartime detentions, being beyond the sphere of domestic criminal law.  Next, the Government says that even if that statute does apply, two Acts of Congress provide the authority §4001(a) demands: a general authorization to the Department of Defense to pay for detaining prisoners of war and similar persons, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/956.html#5" class="subref" title="subref">10 U. S. C. §956(5)</a>, and the Force Resolution, passed after the attacks of 2001.  At the same time, the Government argues that in detaining Hamdi in the manner described, the President is in any event acting as Commander in Chief under Article II of the Constitution, which brings with it the right to invoke authority under the accepted customary rules for waging war.  On the record in front of us, the Government has not made out a case on any theory.

        <p class="opcentered">
				II
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				The threshold issue is how broadly or narrowly to read the Non-Detention Act, the tone of which is severe: No citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained by the United States except pursuant to an Act of Congress.  Should the severity of the Act be relieved when the Governments stated factual justification for incommunicado detention is a war on terrorism, so that the Government may be said to act pursuant to congressional terms that fall short of explicit authority to imprison individuals?  With one possible though important qualification, see 
				<em>
					infra
				</em>
				, at 1011, the answer has to be no.  For a number of reasons, the prohibition within §4001(a) has to be read broadly to accord the statute a long reach and to impose a burden of justification on the Government.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				First, the circumstances in which the Act was adopted point the way to this interpretation.  The provision superseded a cold-war statute, the Emergency Detention Act of 1950 (formerly 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/50/811.html" class="subref" title="subref">50 U. S. C. §811</a>
            <em>
					et seq.
				</em>
				 (1970 ed.)), which had authorized the Attorney General, in time of emergency, to detain anyone reasonably thought likely to engage in espionage or sabotage.  That statute was repealed in 1971 out of fear that it could authorize a repetition of the World War II internment of citizens of Japanese ancestry; Congress meant to preclude another episode like the one described in 
				<em>
					Korematsu
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/323/214" class="subref" title="subref">323 U. S. 214</a> (1944)
.  See H. R. Rep. No. 92116, pp. 2, 45 (1971).  While Congress might simply have struck the 1950 statute, in considering the repealer the point was made that the existing statute provided some express procedural protection, without which the Executive would seem to be subject to no statutory limits protecting individual liberty.  See 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 5 (mere repeal might leave citizens subject to arbitrary executive action, with no clear demarcation of the limits of executive authority); 117 Cong. Rec. 31544 (1971) (Emergency Detention Act remains as the only existing barrier against the future exercise of executive power which resulted in the Japanese internment); cf. 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 31548 (in the absence of further procedural provisions, even §4001(a) will virtually leave us stripped naked against the great power … which the President has).  It was in these circumstances that a proposed limit on Executive action was expanded to the inclusive scope of §4001(a) as enacted.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The fact that Congress intended to guard against a repetition of the World War II internments when it repealed the 1950 statute and gave us §4001(a) provides a powerful reason to think that §4001(a) was meant to require clear congressional authorization before any citizen can be placed in a cell.  It is not merely that the legislative history shows that §4001(a) was thought necessary in anticipation of times just like the present, in which the safety of the country is threatened.  To appreciate what is most significant, one must only recall that the internments of the 1940s were accomplished by Executive action.  Although an Act of Congress ratified and confirmed an Executive order authorizing the military to exclude individuals from defined areas and to accommodate those it might remove, see 
				<em>
					Ex parte Endo
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/323/283" class="subref" title="subref">323 U. S. 283</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">285</a>288 (1944)
, the statute said nothing whatever about the detention of those who might be removed, 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 300301; internment camps were creatures of the Executive, and confinement in them rested on assertion of Executive authority, see 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 287293.  When, therefore, Congress repealed the 1950 Act and adopted §4001(a) for the purpose of avoiding another 
				<em>
					Korematsu
				</em>
				, it intended to preclude reliance on vague congressional authority (for example, providing accommodations for those subject to removal) as authority for detention or imprisonment at the discretion of the Executive (maintaining detention camps of American citizens, for example).  In requiring that any Executive detention be pursuant to an Act of Congress, then, Congress necessarily meant to require a congressional enactment that clearly authorized detention or imprisonment.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, when Congress passed §4001(a) it was acting in light of an interpretive regime that subjected enactments limiting liberty in wartime to the requirement of a clear statement and it presumably intended §4001(a) to be read accordingly.  This need for clarity was unmistakably expressed in 
				<em>
					Ex parte
				</em>
            <em>
					Endo
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, decided the same day as 
				<em>
					Korematsu
				</em>
				.  
				<em>
					Endo
				</em>
				 began with a petition for habeas corpus by an interned citizen claiming to be loyal and law-abiding and thus unlawfully detained.  323 U. S., at 294.  The petitioner was held entitled to habeas relief in an opinion that set out this principle for scrutinizing wartime statutes in derogation of customary liberty:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				In interpreting a wartime measure we must assume that [its] purpose was to allow for the greatest possible accommodation between … liberties and the exigencies of war.  We must assume, when asked to find implied powers in a grant of legislative or executive authority, that the law makers intended to place no greater restraint on the citizen than was clearly and unmistakably indicated by the language they used.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 300.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
Congresss understanding of the need for clear authority before citizens are kept detained is itself therefore clear, and §4001(a) must be read to have teeth in its demand for congressional authorization.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Finally, even if history had spared us the cautionary example of the internments in World War II, even if there had been no 
				<em>
					Korematsu
				</em>
				, and 
				<em>
					Endo
				</em>
				 had set out no principle of statutory interpretation, there would be a compelling reason to read §4001(a) to demand manifest authority to detain before detention is authorized.  The defining character of American constitutional government is its constant tension between security and liberty, serving both by partial helpings of each.  In a government of separated powers, deciding finally on what is a reasonable degree of guaranteed liberty whether in peace or war (or some condition in between) is not well entrusted to the Executive Branch of Government, whose particular responsibility is to maintain security.  For reasons of inescapable human nature, the branch of the Government asked to counter a serious threat is not the branch on which to rest the Nations entire reliance in striking the balance between the will to win and the cost in liberty on the way to victory; the responsibility for security will naturally amplify the claim that security legitimately raises.  A reasonable balance is more likely to be reached on the judgment of a different branch, just as Madison said in remarking that the constant aim is to divide and arrange the several offices in such a manner as that each may be a check on the otherthat the private interest of every individual may be a sentinel over the public rights.  The Federalist No. 51, p. 349 (J. Cooke ed. 1961).  Hence the need for an assessment by Congress before citizens are subject to lockup, and likewise the need for a clearly expressed congressional resolution of the competing claims.

        <p class="opcentered">
				III
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				Under this principle of reading §4001(a) robustly to require a clear statement of authorization to detain, none of the Governments arguments suffices to justify Hamdis detention.

				First, there is the argument that §4001(a) does not even apply to wartime military detentions, a position resting on the placement of §4001(a) in Title 18 of the United States Code, the gathering of federal criminal law.  The text of the statute does not, however, so limit its reach, and the legislative history of the provision shows its placement in Title 18 was not meant to render the statute more restricted than its terms.  The draft of what is now §4001(a) as contained in the original bill prohibited only imprisonment unauthorized by Title 18.  See H. R. Rep. No. 92
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				116, at 4.  In response to the Department of Justices objection that the original draft seemed to assume wrongly that all provisions for the detention of convicted persons would be contained in Title 18, the provision was amended by replacing a reference to that title with the reference to an Act of Congress.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 3.  The Committee on the Judiciary, discussing this change, stated that [limiting] detention of citizens … to situations in which … an Act of Congres[s] exists would assure that no detention camps can be established without at least the acquiescence of the Congress.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 5.  See also 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 46.  This understanding, that the amended bill would sweep beyond imprisonment for crime and apply to Executive detention in furtherance of wartime security, was emphasized in an extended debate.  Representative Ichord, chairman of the House Internal Security Committee and an opponent of the bill, feared that the redrafted statute would deprive the President of his emergency powers and his most effective means of coping with sabotage and espionage agents in war-related crises.  117 Cong. Rec., at 31542.  Representative Railsback, the bills sponsor, spoke of the bill in absolute terms: [I]n order to prohibit arbitrary executive action, [the bill] assures that no detention of citizens can be undertaken by the Executive without the prior consent of Congress.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 31551.  This legislative history indicates that Congress was aware that §4001(a) would limit the Executives power to detain citizens in wartime to protect national security, and it is fair to say that the prohibition was thus intended to extend not only to the exercise of power to vindicate the interests underlying domestic criminal law, but to statutorily unauthorized detention by the Executive for reasons of security in wartime, just as Hamdi claims.

				Next, there is the Governments claim, accepted by the Court, that the terms of the Force Resolution are adequate to authorize detention of an enemy combatant under the circumstances described,

            </a>
				 a claim the Government fails to support sufficiently to satisfy §4001(a) as read to require a clear statement of authority to detain.  Since the Force Resolution was adopted one week after the attacks of September 11, 2001, it naturally speaks with some generality, but its focus is clear, and that is on the use of military power.  It is fairly read to authorize the use of armies and weapons, whether against other armies or individual terrorists.  But, like the statute discussed in 
				<em>
					Endo
				</em>
				, it never so much as uses the word detention, and there is no reason to think Congress might have perceived any need to augment Executive power to deal with dangerous citizens within the United States, given the well-stocked statutory arsenal of defined criminal offenses covering the gamut of actions that a citizen sympathetic to terrorists might commit.

				Even so, there is one argument for treating the Force Resolution as sufficiently clear to authorize detention of a citizen consistently with §4001(a).  Assuming the argument to be sound, however, the Government is in no position to claim its advantage.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Because the Force Resolution authorizes the use of military force in acts of war by the United States, the argument goes, it is reasonably clear that the military and its Commander in Chief are authorized to deal with enemy belligerents according to the treaties and customs known collectively as the laws of war.  Brief for Respondents 20
				<span class="softbreak"></span>

, may perhaps be claimed for the proposition that the American citizenship of such a captive does not as such limit the Governments power to deal with him under the usages of war.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 31, 3738.  Thus, the Government here repeatedly argues that Hamdis detention amounts to nothing more than customary detention of a captive taken on the field of battle: if the usages of war are fairly authorized by the Force Resolution, Hamdis detention is authorized for purposes of §4001(a).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				There is no need, however, to address the merits of such an argument in all possible circumstances.  For now it is enough to recognize that the Governments stated legal position in its campaign against the Taliban (among whom Hamdi was allegedly captured) is apparently at odds with
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				its claim here to be acting in accordance with custo-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				mary law of war and hence to be within the terms of
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				the Force Resolution in its detention of Hamdi.  In a statement of its legal position cited in its brief, the
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				Government says that the Geneva Convention applies
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				to the Taliban detainees.  Office of the White House Press Secretary, Fact Sheet, Status of Detainees at Guantanamo (Feb. 7, 2002), www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				02/2002020713.html (as visited June 18, 2004, and available in Clerk of Courts case file) (hereinafter White House Press Release) (cited in Brief for Respondents 24, n. 9).  Hamdi presumably is such a detainee, since according to the Governments own account, he was taken bearing arms on the Taliban side of a field of battle in Afghanistan.  He would therefore seem to qualify for treatment as a prisoner of war under the Third Geneva Convention, to which the United States is a party.  Article 4 of the Geneva Convention (III) Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug. 12, 1949, [1955] 6 U. S. T. 3316, 3320, T. I. A. S. No. 3364.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				By holding him incommunicado, however, the Government obviously has not been treating him as a prisoner of war, and in fact the Government claims that no Taliban detainee is entitled to prisoner of war status.  See Brief for Respondents 24; White House Press Release.  This treatment appears to be a violation of the Geneva Convention provision that even in cases of doubt, captives are entitled to be treated as prisoners of war until such time as their status has been determined by a competent tribunal.  Art. 5, 6 U. S. T., at 3324.  The Government answers that the Presidents determination that Taliban detainees do not qualify as prisoners of war is conclusive as to Hamdis status and removes any doubt that would trigger application of the Conventions tribunal requirement.  See Brief for Respondents 24.  But reliance on this categorical pronouncement to settle doubt is apparently at odds with the military regulation, Enemy Prisoners of War, Retained Personnel, Civilian Internees and Other Detainees, Army Reg. 1908, §§15, 16 (1997),
				 
				adopted to implement the Geneva Convention, and setting out a detailed procedure for a military tribunal to determine an individuals status.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 id
				</em>
				., §16
				 
				(A competent tribunal shall be composed of three commissioned officers; a written record shall be made of proceedings; [p]roceedings shall be open with certain exceptions; [p]ersons whose status is to be determined shall be advised of their rights at the beginning of their hearings, allowed to attend all open sessions, allowed to call witnesses if reasonably available, and to question those witnesses called by the Tribunal, and to have a right to testify; and a tribunal shall determine status by a [p]reponderance of evidence).  One of the types of doubt these tribunals are meant to settle is whether a given individual may be, as Hamdi says he is, an [i]nnocent civilian who should be immediately returned to his home or released.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, 16
				<em>
					e
				</em>
				(10)(
				<em>
					c
				</em>
				).  The regulation, jointly promulgated by the Headquarters of the Departments of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps, provides that [p]ersons who have been determined by a competent tribunal not to be entitled to prisoner of war status may not be executed, imprisoned, or otherwise penalized without further proceedings to determine what acts they have committed and what penalty should be imposed.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, §16
				<em>
					g
				</em>
				.  The regulation also incorporates the Geneva Conventions presumption that in cases of doubt, persons shall enjoy the protection of the … Convention until such time as their status has been determined by a competent tribunal.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., §16
				<em>
					a
				</em>
				.  Thus, there is reason to question whether the United States is acting in accordance with the laws of war it claims as authority.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Whether, or to what degree, the Government is in fact violating the Geneva Convention and is thus acting outside the customary usages of war are not matters I can resolve at this point.  What I can say, though, is that the Government has not made out its claim that in detaining Hamdi in the manner described, it is acting in accord with the laws of war authorized to be applied against citizens by the Force Resolution.  I conclude accordingly that the Government has failed to support the position that the Force Resolution authorizes the described detention of Hamdi for purposes of §4001(a).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It is worth adding a further reason for requiring the Government to bear the burden of clearly justifying its claim to be exercising recognized war powers before declaring §4001(a) satisfied.  Thirty-eight days after adopting the Force Resolution, Congress passed the statute entitled Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA PATRIOT ACT), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">115</a>Stat.
272; that Act authorized the detention of alien terrorists for no more than seven days in the absence of criminal charges or deportation proceedings, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/8/1226a.html#a_5" class="subref" title="subref">8 U. S. C. §1226a(a)(5)</a> (2000 ed., Supp. I).  It is very difficult to believe that the same Congress that carefully circumscribed Executive power over alien terrorists on home soil would not have meant to require the Government to justify clearly
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				its detention of an American citizen held on home soil incommunicado.
			</p>
        <p class="opcentered">
				D
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				Since the Government has given no reason either to deflect the application of §4001(a) or to hold it to be satisfied, I need to go no further; the Government hints of a constitutional challenge to the statute, but it presents none here.  I will, however, stray across the line between statutory and constitutional territory just far enough to note the weakness of the Governments mixed claim of inherent, extrastatutory authority under a combination of Article II of the Constitution and the usages of war.  It is in fact in this connection that the Government developed its argument that the exercise of war powers justifies the detention, and what I have just said about its inadequacy applies here as well.  Beyond that, it is instructive to recall Justice Jacksons observation that the President is not Commander in Chief of the country, only of the military.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				There may be room for one qualification to Justice Jacksons statement, however: in a moment of genuine emergency, when the Government must act with no time for deliberation, the Executive may be able to detain a citizen if there is reason to fear he is an imminent threat to the safety of the Nation and its people (though I doubt there is any want of statutory authority, see 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 910).  This case, however, does not present that question, because an emergency power of necessity must at least be limited by the emergency; Hamdi has been locked up for over two years.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Ex parte Milligan,
				</em>
				 4 Wall. 2, 127 (1866) (martial law justified only by actual and present necessity as in a genuine invasion that closes civilian courts).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Whether insisting on the careful scrutiny of emergency claims or on a vigorous reading of §4001(a), we are heirs to a tradition given voice 800 years ago by Magna Carta, which, on the barons insistence, confined executive power by the law of the land.

        <p class="opcentered">

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Because I find Hamdis detention forbidden by §4001(a) and unauthorized by the Force Resolution, I would not reach any questions of what process he may be due in litigating disputed issues in a proceeding under the habeas statute or prior to the habeas enquiry itself.  For me, it suffices that the Government has failed to justify holding him in the absence of a further Act of Congress, criminal charges, a showing that the detention conforms to the laws of war, or a demonstration that §4001(a) is unconstitutional.  I would therefore vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand for proceedings consistent with this view.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Since this disposition does not command a majority of the Court, however, the need to give practical effect to the conclusions of eight members of the Court rejecting the Governments position calls for me to join with the plurality in ordering remand on terms closest to those I would impose.  See

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">134</a> (1945)
 (Rutledge, J., concurring in result).  Although I think litigation of Hamdis status as an enemy combatant is unnecessary, the terms of the pluralitys remand will allow Hamdi to offer evidence that he is not an enemy combatant, and he should at the least have the benefit of that opportunity.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It should go without saying that in joining with the plurality to produce a judgment, I do not adopt the pluralitys resolution of constitutional issues that I would not reach.  It is not that I could disagree with the pluralitys determinations (given the pluralitys view of the Force Resolution) that someone in Hamdis position is entitled at a minimum to notice of the Governments claimed factual basis for holding him, and to a fair chance to rebut it before a neutral decision maker, see 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 26; nor, of course, could I disagree with the pluralitys affirmation of Hamdis right to counsel, see 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 3233.  On the other hand, I do not mean to imply agreement that the Government could claim an evidentiary presumption casting the burden of rebuttal on Hamdi, see 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 27, or that an opportunity to litigate before a military tribunal might obviate or truncate enquiry by a court on habeas, see 
				<em>

				According to Yaser Hamdis petition for writ of habeas corpus, brought on his behalf by his father, the Government of the United States is detaining him, an American citizen on American soil, with the explanation that he was seized on the field of battle in Afghanistan, having been on the enemy side.  It is undisputed that the Government has not charged him with espionage, treason, or any other crime under domestic law.  It is likewise undisputed that for one year and nine months, on the basis of an Executive designation of Hamdi as an enemy combatant, the Government denied him the right to send or receive any communication beyond the prison where he was held and, in particular, denied him access to counsel to represent him.

                </sup>
            </a>
				  The Government asserts a right to hold Hamdi under these conditions indefinitely, that is, until the Government determines that the United States is no longer threatened by the terrorism exemplified in the attacks of September 11, 2001.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In these proceedings on Hamdis petition, he seeks to challenge the facts claimed by the Government as the basis for holding him as an enemy combatant.  And in this Court he presses the distinct argument that the Governments claim, even if true, would not implicate any authority for holding him that would satisfy 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/4001.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. §4001(a)</a> (Non-Detention Act), which bars imprisonment
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				or detention of a citizen except pursuant to an Act of Congress.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Government responds that Hamdis incommunicado imprisonment as an enemy combatant seized on the field of battle falls within the Presidents power as Commander in Chief under the laws and usages of war, and is in any event authorized by two statutes.  Accordingly, the Government contends that Hamdi has no basis for any challenge by petition for habeas except to his own status as an enemy combatant; and even that challenge may go no further than to enquire whether some evidence supports Hamdis designation, see Brief for Respondents 3436; if there is some evidence, Hamdi should remain locked up at the discretion of the Executive.  At the argument of this case, in fact, the Government went further and suggested that as long as a prisoner could challenge his enemy combatant designation when responding to interrogation during incommunicado detention he was accorded sufficient process to support his designation as an enemy combatant.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 40; 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 42 ([H]e has an opportunity to explain it in his own words [d]uring interrogation).  Since on either view judicial enquiry so limited would be virtually worthless as a way to contest detention, the Governments concession of jurisdiction to hear Hamdis habeas claim is more theoretical than practical, leaving the assertion of Executive authority close to unconditional.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The plurality rejects any such limit on the exercise of habeas jurisdiction and so far I agree with its opinion.  The plurality does, however, accept the Governments position that if Hamdis designation as an enemy combatant is correct, his detention (at least as to some period) is authorized by an Act of Congress as required by §4001(a), that is, by the Authorization for Use of Military Force,

				, at 914.  Here, I disagree and respectfully dissent.  The Government has failed to demonstrate that the Force Resolution authorizes the detention complained of here even on the facts the Government claims.  If the Government raises nothing further than the record now shows, the Non-Detention Act entitles Hamdi to be released.

				The Governments first response to Hamdis claim that holding him violates §4001(a), prohibiting detention of citizens except pursuant to an Act of Congress, is that the statute does not even apply to military wartime detentions, being beyond the sphere of domestic criminal law.  Next, the Government says that even if that statute does apply, two Acts of Congress provide the authority §4001(a) demands: a general authorization to the Department of Defense to pay for detaining prisoners of war and similar persons, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/956.html#5" class="subref" title="subref">10 U. S. C. §956(5)</a>, and the Force Resolution, passed after the attacks of 2001.  At the same time, the Government argues that in detaining Hamdi in the manner described, the President is in any event acting as Commander in Chief under Article II of the Constitution, which brings with it the right to invoke authority under the accepted customary rules for waging war.  On the record in front of us, the Government has not made out a case on any theory.

				The threshold issue is how broadly or narrowly to read the Non-Detention Act, the tone of which is severe: No citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained by the United States except pursuant to an Act of Congress.  Should the severity of the Act be relieved when the Governments stated factual justification for incommunicado detention is a war on terrorism, so that the Government may be said to act pursuant to congressional terms that fall short of explicit authority to imprison individuals?  With one possible though important qualification, see 
				<em>
					infra
				</em>
				, at 1011, the answer has to be no.  For a number of reasons, the prohibition within §4001(a) has to be read broadly to accord the statute a long reach and to impose a burden of justification on the Government.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				First, the circumstances in which the Act was adopted point the way to this interpretation.  The provision superseded a cold-war statute, the Emergency Detention Act of 1950 (formerly 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/50/811.html" class="subref" title="subref">50 U. S. C. §811</a>
            <em>
					et seq.
				</em>
				 (1970 ed.)), which had authorized the Attorney General, in time of emergency, to detain anyone reasonably thought likely to engage in espionage or sabotage.  That statute was repealed in 1971 out of fear that it could authorize a repetition of the World War II internment of citizens of Japanese ancestry; Congress meant to preclude another episode like the one described in 
				<em>
					Korematsu
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/323/214" class="subref" title="subref">323 U. S. 214</a> (1944)
.  See H. R. Rep. No. 92116, pp. 2, 45 (1971).  While Congress might simply have struck the 1950 statute, in considering the repealer the point was made that the existing statute provided some express procedural protection, without which the Executive would seem to be subject to no statutory limits protecting individual liberty.  See 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 5 (mere repeal might leave citizens subject to arbitrary executive action, with no clear demarcation of the limits of executive authority); 117 Cong. Rec. 31544 (1971) (Emergency Detention Act remains as the only existing barrier against the future exercise of executive power which resulted in the Japanese internment); cf. 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 31548 (in the absence of further procedural provisions, even §4001(a) will virtually leave us stripped naked against the great power … which the President has).  It was in these circumstances that a proposed limit on Executive action was expanded to the inclusive scope of §4001(a) as enacted.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The fact that Congress intended to guard against a repetition of the World War II internments when it repealed the 1950 statute and gave us §4001(a) provides a powerful reason to think that §4001(a) was meant to require clear congressional authorization before any citizen can be placed in a cell.  It is not merely that the legislative history shows that §4001(a) was thought necessary in anticipation of times just like the present, in which the safety of the country is threatened.  To appreciate what is most significant, one must only recall that the internments of the 1940s were accomplished by Executive action.  Although an Act of Congress ratified and confirmed an Executive order authorizing the military to exclude individuals from defined areas and to accommodate those it might remove, see 
				<em>
					Ex parte Endo
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/323/283" class="subref" title="subref">323 U. S. 283</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">285</a>288 (1944)
, the statute said nothing whatever about the detention of those who might be removed, 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 300301; internment camps were creatures of the Executive, and confinement in them rested on assertion of Executive authority, see 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 287293.  When, therefore, Congress repealed the 1950 Act and adopted §4001(a) for the purpose of avoiding another 
				<em>
					Korematsu
				</em>
				, it intended to preclude reliance on vague congressional authority (for example, providing accommodations for those subject to removal) as authority for detention or imprisonment at the discretion of the Executive (maintaining detention camps of American citizens, for example).  In requiring that any Executive detention be pursuant to an Act of Congress, then, Congress necessarily meant to require a congressional enactment that clearly authorized detention or imprisonment.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, when Congress passed §4001(a) it was acting in light of an interpretive regime that subjected enactments limiting liberty in wartime to the requirement of a clear statement and it presumably intended §4001(a) to be read accordingly.  This need for clarity was unmistakably expressed in 
				<em>
					Ex parte
				</em>
            <em>
					Endo
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, decided the same day as 
				<em>
					Korematsu
				</em>
				.  
				<em>
					Endo
				</em>
				 began with a petition for habeas corpus by an interned citizen claiming to be loyal and law-abiding and thus unlawfully detained.  323 U. S., at 294.  The petitioner was held entitled to habeas relief in an opinion that set out this principle for scrutinizing wartime statutes in derogation of customary liberty:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				In interpreting a wartime measure we must assume that [its] purpose was to allow for the greatest possible accommodation between … liberties and the exigencies of war.  We must assume, when asked to find implied powers in a grant of legislative or executive authority, that the law makers intended to place no greater restraint on the citizen than was clearly and unmistakably indicated by the language they used.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 300.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
Congresss understanding of the need for clear authority before citizens are kept detained is itself therefore clear, and §4001(a) must be read to have teeth in its demand for congressional authorization.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Finally, even if history had spared us the cautionary example of the internments in World War II, even if there had been no 
				<em>
					Korematsu
				</em>
				, and 
				<em>
					Endo
				</em>
				 had set out no principle of statutory interpretation, there would be a compelling reason to read §4001(a) to demand manifest authority to detain before detention is authorized.  The defining character of American constitutional government is its constant tension between security and liberty, serving both by partial helpings of each.  In a government of separated powers, deciding finally on what is a reasonable degree of guaranteed liberty whether in peace or war (or some condition in between) is not well entrusted to the Executive Branch of Government, whose particular responsibility is to maintain security.  For reasons of inescapable human nature, the branch of the Government asked to counter a serious threat is not the branch on which to rest the Nations entire reliance in striking the balance between the will to win and the cost in liberty on the way to victory; the responsibility for security will naturally amplify the claim that security legitimately raises.  A reasonable balance is more likely to be reached on the judgment of a different branch, just as Madison said in remarking that the constant aim is to divide and arrange the several offices in such a manner as that each may be a check on the otherthat the private interest of every individual may be a sentinel over the public rights.  The Federalist No. 51, p. 349 (J. Cooke ed. 1961).  Hence the need for an assessment by Congress before citizens are subject to lockup, and likewise the need for a clearly expressed congressional resolution of the competing claims.

        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				Under this principle of reading §4001(a) robustly to require a clear statement of authorization to detain, none of the Governments arguments suffices to justify Hamdis detention.

				First, there is the argument that §4001(a) does not even apply to wartime military detentions, a position resting on the placement of §4001(a) in Title 18 of the United States Code, the gathering of federal criminal law.  The text of the statute does not, however, so limit its reach, and the legislative history of the provision shows its placement in Title 18 was not meant to render the statute more restricted than its terms.  The draft of what is now §4001(a) as contained in the original bill prohibited only imprisonment unauthorized by Title 18.  See H. R. Rep. No. 92
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				116, at 4.  In response to the Department of Justices objection that the original draft seemed to assume wrongly that all provisions for the detention of convicted persons would be contained in Title 18, the provision was amended by replacing a reference to that title with the reference to an Act of Congress.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 3.  The Committee on the Judiciary, discussing this change, stated that [limiting] detention of citizens … to situations in which … an Act of Congres[s] exists would assure that no detention camps can be established without at least the acquiescence of the Congress.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 5.  See also 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 46.  This understanding, that the amended bill would sweep beyond imprisonment for crime and apply to Executive detention in furtherance of wartime security, was emphasized in an extended debate.  Representative Ichord, chairman of the House Internal Security Committee and an opponent of the bill, feared that the redrafted statute would deprive the President of his emergency powers and his most effective means of coping with sabotage and espionage agents in war-related crises.  117 Cong. Rec., at 31542.  Representative Railsback, the bills sponsor, spoke of the bill in absolute terms: [I]n order to prohibit arbitrary executive action, [the bill] assures that no detention of citizens can be undertaken by the Executive without the prior consent of Congress.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 31551.  This legislative history indicates that Congress was aware that §4001(a) would limit the Executives power to detain citizens in wartime to protect national security, and it is fair to say that the prohibition was thus intended to extend not only to the exercise of power to vindicate the interests underlying domestic criminal law, but to statutorily unauthorized detention by the Executive for reasons of security in wartime, just as Hamdi claims.

				 a claim the Government fails to support sufficiently to satisfy §4001(a) as read to require a clear statement of authority to detain.  Since the Force Resolution was adopted one week after the attacks of September 11, 2001, it naturally speaks with some generality, but its focus is clear, and that is on the use of military power.  It is fairly read to authorize the use of armies and weapons, whether against other armies or individual terrorists.  But, like the statute discussed in 
				<em>
					Endo
				</em>
				, it never so much as uses the word detention, and there is no reason to think Congress might have perceived any need to augment Executive power to deal with dangerous citizens within the United States, given the well-stocked statutory arsenal of defined criminal offenses covering the gamut of actions that a citizen sympathetic to terrorists might commit.

				Even so, there is one argument for treating the Force Resolution as sufficiently clear to authorize detention of a citizen consistently with §4001(a).  Assuming the argument to be sound, however, the Government is in no position to claim its advantage.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Because the Force Resolution authorizes the use of military force in acts of war by the United States, the argument goes, it is reasonably clear that the military and its Commander in Chief are authorized to deal with enemy belligerents according to the treaties and customs known collectively as the laws of war.

, may perhaps be claimed for the proposition that the American citizenship of such a captive does not as such limit the Governments power to deal with him under the usages of war.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 31, 3738.  Thus, the Government here repeatedly argues that Hamdis detention amounts to nothing more than customary detention of a captive taken on the field of battle: if the usages of war are fairly authorized by the Force Resolution, Hamdis detention is authorized for purposes of §4001(a).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				There is no need, however, to address the merits of such an argument in all possible circumstances.  For now it is enough to recognize that the Governments stated legal position in its campaign against the Taliban (among whom Hamdi was allegedly captured) is apparently at odds with
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				its claim here to be acting in accordance with custo-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				mary law of war and hence to be within the terms of
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				the Force Resolution in its detention of Hamdi.  In a statement of its legal position cited in its brief, the
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				Government says that the Geneva Convention applies
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				to the Taliban detainees.  Office of the White House Press Secretary, Fact Sheet, Status of Detainees at Guantanamo (Feb. 7, 2002), www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/

Hamdi presumably is such a detainee, since according to the Governments own account, he was taken bearing arms on the Taliban side of a field of battle in Afghanistan.  He would therefore seem to qualify for treatment as a prisoner of war under the Third Geneva Convention, to which the United States is a party.  Article 4 of the Geneva Convention (III) Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug. 12, 1949, [1955] 6 U. S. T. 3316, 3320, T. I. A. S. No. 3364.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				By holding him incommunicado, however, the Government obviously has not been treating him as a prisoner of war, and in fact the Government claims that no Taliban detainee is entitled to prisoner of war status.  See Brief for Respondents 24; White House Press Release.  This treatment appears to be a violation of the Geneva Convention provision that even in cases of doubt, captives are entitled to be treated as prisoners of war until such time as their status has been determined by a competent tribunal.  Art. 5, 6 U. S. T., at 3324.  The Government answers that the Presidents determination that Taliban detainees do not qualify as prisoners of war is conclusive as to Hamdis status and removes any doubt that would trigger application of the Conventions tribunal requirement.  See Brief for Respondents 24.  But reliance on this categorical pronouncement to settle doubt is apparently at odds with the military regulation, Enemy Prisoners of War, Retained Personnel, Civilian Internees and Other Detainees, Army Reg. 1908, §§15, 16 (1997),
				 
				adopted to implement the Geneva Convention, and setting out a detailed procedure for a military tribunal to determine an individuals status.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 id
				</em>
				., §16
				 
				(A competent tribunal shall be composed of three commissioned officers; a written record shall be made of proceedings; [p]roceedings shall be open with certain exceptions; [p]ersons whose status is to be determined shall be advised of their rights at the beginning of their hearings, allowed to attend all open sessions, allowed to call witnesses if reasonably available, and to question those witnesses called by the Tribunal, and to have a right to testify; and a tribunal shall determine status by a [p]reponderance of evidence).  One of the types of doubt these tribunals are meant to settle is whether a given individual may be, as Hamdi says he is, an [i]nnocent civilian who should be immediately returned to his home or released.  
				<em>

				, 16
				<em>

				(10)(

The regulation, jointly promulgated by the Headquarters of the Departments of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps, provides that [p]ersons who have been determined by a competent tribunal not to be entitled to prisoner of war status may not be executed, imprisoned, or otherwise penalized without further proceedings to determine what acts they have committed and what penalty should be imposed.

				.  Thus, there is reason to question whether the United States is acting in accordance with the laws of war it claims as authority.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Whether, or to what degree, the Government is in fact violating the Geneva Convention and is thus acting outside the customary usages of war are not matters I can resolve at this point.  What I can say, though, is that the Government has not made out its claim that in detaining Hamdi in the manner described, it is acting in accord with the laws of war authorized to be applied against citizens by the Force Resolution.  I conclude accordingly that the Government has failed to support the position that the Force Resolution authorizes the described detention of Hamdi for purposes of §4001(a).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It is worth adding a further reason for requiring the Government to bear the burden of clearly justifying its claim to be exercising recognized war powers before declaring §4001(a) satisfied.  Thirty-eight days after adopting the Force Resolution, Congress passed the statute entitled Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA PATRIOT ACT), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">115</a>Stat.
272; that Act authorized the detention of alien terrorists for no more than seven days in the absence of criminal charges or deportation proceedings, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/8/1226a.html#a_5" class="subref" title="subref">8 U. S. C. §1226a(a)(5)</a> (2000 ed., Supp. I).  It is very difficult to believe that the same Congress that carefully circumscribed Executive power over alien terrorists on home soil would not have meant to require the Government to justify clearly
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				its detention of an American citizen held on home soil incommunicado.

				Since the Government has given no reason either to deflect the application of §4001(a) or to hold it to be satisfied, I need to go no further; the Government hints of a constitutional challenge to the statute, but it presents none here.  I will, however, stray across the line between statutory and constitutional territory just far enough to note the weakness of the Governments mixed claim of inherent, extrastatutory authority under a combination of Article II of the Constitution and the usages of war.  It is in fact in this connection that the Government developed its argument that the exercise of war powers justifies the detention, and what I have just said about its inadequacy applies here as well.  Beyond that, it is instructive to recall Justice Jacksons observation that the President is not Commander in Chief of the country, only of the military.

				There may be room for one qualification to Justice Jacksons statement, however: in a moment of genuine emergency, when the Government must act with no time for deliberation, the Executive may be able to detain a citizen if there is reason to fear he is an imminent threat to the safety of the Nation and its people (though I doubt there is any want of statutory authority, see 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 910).  This case, however, does not present that question, because an emergency power of necessity must at least be limited by the emergency; Hamdi has been locked up for over two years.  Cf.

				Whether insisting on the careful scrutiny of emergency claims or on a vigorous reading of §4001(a), we are heirs to a tradition given voice 800 years ago by Magna Carta, which, on the barons insistence, confined executive power by the law of the land.

				Because I find Hamdis detention forbidden by §4001(a) and unauthorized by the Force Resolution, I would not reach any questions of what process he may be due in litigating disputed issues in a proceeding under the habeas statute or prior to the habeas enquiry itself.  For me, it suffices that the Government has failed to justify holding him in the absence of a further Act of Congress, criminal charges, a showing that the detention conforms to the laws of war, or a demonstration that §4001(a) is unconstitutional.  I would therefore vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand for proceedings consistent with this view.

				According to Yaser Hamdis petition for writ of habeas corpus, brought on his behalf by his father, the Government of the United States is detaining him, an American citizen on American soil, with the explanation that he was seized on the field of battle in Afghanistan, having been on the enemy side.  It is undisputed that the Government has not charged him with espionage, treason, or any other crime under domestic law.  It is likewise undisputed that for one year and nine months, on the basis of an Executive designation of Hamdi as an enemy combatant, the Government denied him the right to send or receive any communication beyond the prison where he was held and, in particular, denied him access to counsel to represent him.

                </sup>
            </a>
				  The Government asserts a right to hold Hamdi under these conditions indefinitely, that is, until the Government determines that the United States is no longer threatened by the terrorism exemplified in the attacks of September 11, 2001.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In these proceedings on Hamdis petition, he seeks to challenge the facts claimed by the Government as the basis for holding him as an enemy combatant.  And in this Court he presses the distinct argument that the Governments claim, even if true, would not implicate any authority for holding him that would satisfy 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/4001.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. §4001(a)</a> (Non-Detention Act), which bars imprisonment
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				or detention of a citizen except pursuant to an Act of Congress.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Government responds that Hamdis incommunicado imprisonment as an enemy combatant seized on the field of battle falls within the Presidents power as Commander in Chief under the laws and usages of war, and is in any event authorized by two statutes.  Accordingly, the Government contends that Hamdi has no basis for any challenge by petition for habeas except to his own status as an enemy combatant; and even that challenge may go no further than to enquire whether some evidence supports Hamdis designation, see Brief for Respondents 3436; if there is some evidence, Hamdi should remain locked up at the discretion of the Executive.  At the argument of this case, in fact, the Government went further and suggested that as long as a prisoner could challenge his enemy combatant designation when responding to interrogation during incommunicado detention he was accorded sufficient process to support his designation as an enemy combatant.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 40; 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 42 ([H]e has an opportunity to explain it in his own words [d]uring interrogation).  Since on either view judicial enquiry so limited would be virtually worthless as a way to contest detention, the Governments concession of jurisdiction to hear Hamdis habeas claim is more theoretical than practical, leaving the assertion of Executive authority close to unconditional.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The plurality rejects any such limit on the exercise of habeas jurisdiction and so far I agree with its opinion.  The plurality does, however, accept the Governments position that if Hamdis designation as an enemy combatant is correct, his detention (at least as to some period) is authorized by an Act of Congress as required by §4001(a), that is, by the Authorization for Use of Military Force, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">115</a>Stat.
224 (hereinafter Force Resolution).  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 914.  Here, I disagree and respectfully dissent.  The Government has failed to demonstrate that the Force Resolution authorizes the detention complained of here even on the facts the Government claims.  If the Government raises nothing further than the record now shows, the Non-Detention Act entitles Hamdi to be released.

        <p class="opcentered">

        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				The Governments first response to Hamdis claim that holding him violates §4001(a), prohibiting detention of citizens except pursuant to an Act of Congress, is that the statute does not even apply to military wartime detentions, being beyond the sphere of domestic criminal law.  Next, the Government says that even if that statute does apply, two Acts of Congress provide the authority §4001(a) demands: a general authorization to the Department of Defense to pay for detaining prisoners of war and similar persons, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/956.html#5" class="subref" title="subref">10 U. S. C. §956(5)</a>, and the Force Resolution, passed after the attacks of 2001.  At the same time, the Government argues that in detaining Hamdi in the manner described, the President is in any event acting as Commander in Chief under Article II of the Constitution, which brings with it the right to invoke authority under the accepted customary rules for waging war.  On the record in front of us, the Government has not made out a case on any theory.

				The threshold issue is how broadly or narrowly to read the Non-Detention Act, the tone of which is severe: No citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained by the United States except pursuant to an Act of Congress.  Should the severity of the Act be relieved when the Governments stated factual justification for incommunicado detention is a war on terrorism, so that the Government may be said to act pursuant to congressional terms that fall short of explicit authority to imprison individuals?  With one possible though important qualification, see 
				<em>
					infra
				</em>
				, at 1011, the answer has to be no.  For a number of reasons, the prohibition within §4001(a) has to be read broadly to accord the statute a long reach and to impose a burden of justification on the Government.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				First, the circumstances in which the Act was adopted point the way to this interpretation.  The provision superseded a cold-war statute, the Emergency Detention Act of 1950 (formerly 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/50/811.html" class="subref" title="subref">50 U. S. C. §811</a>
            <em>
					et seq.
				</em>
				 (1970 ed.)), which had authorized the Attorney General, in time of emergency, to detain anyone reasonably thought likely to engage in espionage or sabotage.  That statute was repealed in 1971 out of fear that it could authorize a repetition of the World War II internment of citizens of Japanese ancestry; Congress meant to preclude another episode like the one described in 
				<em>
					Korematsu
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/323/214" class="subref" title="subref">323 U. S. 214</a> (1944)
.  See H. R. Rep. No. 92116, pp. 2, 45 (1971).  While Congress might simply have struck the 1950 statute, in considering the repealer the point was made that the existing statute provided some express procedural protection, without which the Executive would seem to be subject to no statutory limits protecting individual liberty.  See 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 5 (mere repeal might leave citizens subject to arbitrary executive action, with no clear demarcation of the limits of executive authority); 117 Cong. Rec. 31544 (1971) (Emergency Detention Act remains as the only existing barrier against the future exercise of executive power which resulted in the Japanese internment); cf. 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 31548 (in the absence of further procedural provisions, even §4001(a) will virtually leave us stripped naked against the great power … which the President has).  It was in these circumstances that a proposed limit on Executive action was expanded to the inclusive scope of §4001(a) as enacted.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The fact that Congress intended to guard against a repetition of the World War II internments when it repealed the 1950 statute and gave us §4001(a) provides a powerful reason to think that §4001(a) was meant to require clear congressional authorization before any citizen can be placed in a cell.  It is not merely that the legislative history shows that §4001(a) was thought necessary in anticipation of times just like the present, in which the safety of the country is threatened.  To appreciate what is most significant, one must only recall that the internments of the 1940s were accomplished by Executive action.  Although an Act of Congress ratified and confirmed an Executive order authorizing the military to exclude individuals from defined areas and to accommodate those it might remove, see 
				<em>
					Ex parte Endo
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/323/283" class="subref" title="subref">323 U. S. 283</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">285</a>288 (1944)
, the statute said nothing whatever about the detention of those who might be removed, 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 300301; internment camps were creatures of the Executive, and confinement in them rested on assertion of Executive authority, see 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 287293.  When, therefore, Congress repealed the 1950 Act and adopted §4001(a) for the purpose of avoiding another 
				<em>
					Korematsu
				</em>
				, it intended to preclude reliance on vague congressional authority (for example, providing accommodations for those subject to removal) as authority for detention or imprisonment at the discretion of the Executive (maintaining detention camps of American citizens, for example).  In requiring that any Executive detention be pursuant to an Act of Congress, then, Congress necessarily meant to require a congressional enactment that clearly authorized detention or imprisonment.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, when Congress passed §4001(a) it was acting in light of an interpretive regime that subjected enactments limiting liberty in wartime to the requirement of a clear statement and it presumably intended §4001(a) to be read accordingly.  This need for clarity was unmistakably expressed in 
				<em>
					Ex parte
				</em>
            <em>
					Endo
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, decided the same day as 
				<em>
					Korematsu
				</em>
				.  
				<em>
					Endo
				</em>
				 began with a petition for habeas corpus by an interned citizen claiming to be loyal and law-abiding and thus unlawfully detained.  323 U. S., at 294.  The petitioner was held entitled to habeas relief in an opinion that set out this principle for scrutinizing wartime statutes in derogation of customary liberty:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				In interpreting a wartime measure we must assume that [its] purpose was to allow for the greatest possible accommodation between … liberties and the exigencies of war.  We must assume, when asked to find implied powers in a grant of legislative or executive authority, that the law makers intended to place no greater restraint on the citizen than was clearly and unmistakably indicated by the language they used.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 300.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
Congresss understanding of the need for clear authority before citizens are kept detained is itself therefore clear, and §4001(a) must be read to have teeth in its demand for congressional authorization.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Finally, even if history had spared us the cautionary example of the internments in World War II, even if there had been no 
				<em>
					Korematsu
				</em>
				, and 
				<em>
					Endo
				</em>
				 had set out no principle of statutory interpretation, there would be a compelling reason to read §4001(a) to demand manifest authority to detain before detention is authorized.  The defining character of American constitutional government is its constant tension between security and liberty, serving both by partial helpings of each.  In a government of separated powers, deciding finally on what is a reasonable degree of guaranteed liberty whether in peace or war (or some condition in between) is not well entrusted to the Executive Branch of Government, whose particular responsibility is to maintain security.  For reasons of inescapable human nature, the branch of the Government asked to counter a serious threat is not the branch on which to rest the Nations entire reliance in striking the balance between the will to win and the cost in liberty on the way to victory; the responsibility for security will naturally amplify the claim that security legitimately raises.  A reasonable balance is more likely to be reached on the judgment of a different branch, just as Madison said in remarking that the constant aim is to divide and arrange the several offices in such a manner as that each may be a check on the otherthat the private interest of every individual may be a sentinel over the public rights.  The Federalist No. 51, p. 349 (J. Cooke ed. 1961).  Hence the need for an assessment by Congress before citizens are subject to lockup, and likewise the need for a clearly expressed congressional resolution of the competing claims.

        <p class="opcentered">
				III
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				Under this principle of reading §4001(a) robustly to require a clear statement of authorization to detain, none of the Governments arguments suffices to justify Hamdis detention.
			</p>
        <p class="opcentered">
				A
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				First, there is the argument that §4001(a) does not even apply to wartime military detentions, a position resting on the placement of §4001(a) in Title 18 of the United States Code, the gathering of federal criminal law.  The text of the statute does not, however, so limit its reach, and the legislative history of the provision shows its placement in Title 18 was not meant to render the statute more restricted than its terms.  The draft of what is now §4001(a) as contained in the original bill prohibited only imprisonment unauthorized by Title 18.  See H. R. Rep. No. 92
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				116, at 4.  In response to the Department of Justices objection that the original draft seemed to assume wrongly that all provisions for the detention of convicted persons would be contained in Title 18, the provision was amended by replacing a reference to that title with the reference to an Act of Congress.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 3.  The Committee on the Judiciary, discussing this change, stated that [limiting] detention of citizens … to situations in which … an Act of Congres[s] exists would assure that no detention camps can be established without at least the acquiescence of the Congress.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 5.  See also 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 46.  This understanding, that the amended bill would sweep beyond imprisonment for crime and apply to Executive detention in furtherance of wartime security, was emphasized in an extended debate.  Representative Ichord, chairman of the House Internal Security Committee and an opponent of the bill, feared that the redrafted statute would deprive the President of his emergency powers and his most effective means of coping with sabotage and espionage agents in war-related crises.  117 Cong. Rec., at 31542.  Representative Railsback, the bills sponsor, spoke of the bill in absolute terms: [I]n order to prohibit arbitrary executive action, [the bill] assures that no detention of citizens can be undertaken by the Executive without the prior consent of Congress.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 31551.  This legislative history indicates that Congress was aware that §4001(a) would limit the Executives power to detain citizens in wartime to protect national security, and it is fair to say that the prohibition was thus intended to extend not only to the exercise of power to vindicate the interests underlying domestic criminal law, but to statutorily unauthorized detention by the Executive for reasons of security in wartime, just as Hamdi claims.

				Next, there is the Governments claim, accepted by the Court, that the terms of the Force Resolution are adequate to authorize detention of an enemy combatant under the circumstances described,
				<a name="ZX-3ref" href="#ZX-3" class="">
                <sup>

            </a>
				 a claim the Government fails to support sufficiently to satisfy §4001(a) as read to require a clear statement of authority to detain.  Since the Force Resolution was adopted one week after the attacks of September 11, 2001, it naturally speaks with some generality, but its focus is clear, and that is on the use of military power.  It is fairly read to authorize the use of armies and weapons, whether against other armies or individual terrorists.  But, like the statute discussed in 
				<em>
					Endo
				</em>
				, it never so much as uses the word detention, and there is no reason to think Congress might have perceived any need to augment Executive power to deal with dangerous citizens within the United States, given the well-stocked statutory arsenal of defined criminal offenses covering the gamut of actions that a citizen sympathetic to terrorists might commit.

				Even so, there is one argument for treating the Force Resolution as sufficiently clear to authorize detention of a citizen consistently with §4001(a).  Assuming the argument to be sound, however, the Government is in no position to claim its advantage.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Because the Force Resolution authorizes the use of military force in acts of war by the United States, the argument goes, it is reasonably clear that the military and its Commander in Chief are authorized to deal with enemy belligerents according to the treaties and customs known collectively as the laws of war.

Thus, the Government here repeatedly argues that Hamdis detention amounts to nothing more than customary detention of a captive taken on the field of battle: if the usages of war are fairly authorized by the Force Resolution, Hamdis detention is authorized for purposes of §4001(a).

				There is no need, however, to address the merits of such an argument in all possible circumstances.  For now it is enough to recognize that the Governments stated legal position in its campaign against the Taliban (among whom Hamdi was allegedly captured) is apparently at odds with
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				its claim here to be acting in accordance with custo-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				mary law of war and hence to be within the terms of
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				the Force Resolution in its detention of Hamdi.  In a statement of its legal position cited in its brief, the
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				Government says that the Geneva Convention applies
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				to the Taliban detainees.  Office of the White House Press Secretary, Fact Sheet, Status of Detainees at Guantanamo (Feb. 7, 2002), www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				02/2002020713.html (as visited June 18, 2004, and available in Clerk of Courts case file) (hereinafter White House Press Release) (cited in Brief for Respondents 24, n. 9).  Hamdi presumably is such a detainee, since according to the Governments own account, he was taken bearing arms on the Taliban side of a field of battle in Afghanistan.  He would therefore seem to qualify for treatment as a prisoner of war under the Third Geneva Convention, to which the United States is a party.  Article 4 of the Geneva Convention (III) Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug. 12, 1949, [1955] 6 U. S. T. 3316, 3320, T. I. A. S. No. 3364.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				By holding him incommunicado, however, the Government obviously has not been treating him as a prisoner of war, and in fact the Government claims that no Taliban detainee is entitled to prisoner of war status.  See Brief for Respondents 24; White House Press Release.  This treatment appears to be a violation of the Geneva Convention provision that even in cases of doubt, captives are entitled to be treated as prisoners of war until such time as their status has been determined by a competent tribunal.  Art. 5, 6 U. S. T., at 3324.  The Government answers that the Presidents determination that Taliban detainees do not qualify as prisoners of war is conclusive as to Hamdis status and removes any doubt that would trigger application of the Conventions tribunal requirement.  See Brief for Respondents 24.  But reliance on this categorical pronouncement to settle doubt is apparently at odds with the military regulation, Enemy Prisoners of War, Retained Personnel, Civilian Internees and Other Detainees, Army Reg. 1908, §§15, 16 (1997),
				 
				adopted to implement the Geneva Convention, and setting out a detailed procedure for a military tribunal to determine an individuals status.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 id
				</em>
				., §16
				 
				(A competent tribunal shall be composed of three commissioned officers; a written record shall be made of proceedings; [p]roceedings shall be open with certain exceptions; [p]ersons whose status is to be determined shall be advised of their rights at the beginning of their hearings, allowed to attend all open sessions, allowed to call witnesses if reasonably available, and to question those witnesses called by the Tribunal, and to have a right to testify; and a tribunal shall determine status by a [p]reponderance of evidence).  One of the types of doubt these tribunals are meant to settle is whether a given individual may be, as Hamdi says he is, an [i]nnocent civilian who should be immediately returned to his home or released.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, 16
				<em>
					e
				</em>
				(10)(
				<em>

				</em>
				).  The regulation, jointly promulgated by the Headquarters of the Departments of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps, provides that [p]ersons who have been determined by a competent tribunal not to be entitled to prisoner of war status may not be executed, imprisoned, or otherwise penalized without further proceedings to determine what acts they have committed and what penalty should be imposed.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, §16
				<em>
					g
				</em>
				.  The regulation also incorporates the Geneva Conventions presumption that in cases of doubt, persons shall enjoy the protection of the … Convention until such time as their status has been determined by a competent tribunal.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., §16
				<em>

				</em>
				.  Thus, there is reason to question whether the United States is acting in accordance with the laws of war it claims as authority.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Whether, or to what degree, the Government is in fact violating the Geneva Convention and is thus acting outside the customary usages of war are not matters I can resolve at this point.  What I can say, though, is that the Government has not made out its claim that in detaining Hamdi in the manner described, it is acting in accord with the laws of war authorized to be applied against citizens by the Force Resolution.  I conclude accordingly that the Government has failed to support the position that the Force Resolution authorizes the described detention of Hamdi for purposes of §4001(a).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It is worth adding a further reason for requiring the Government to bear the burden of clearly justifying its claim to be exercising recognized war powers before declaring §4001(a) satisfied.  Thirty-eight days after adopting the Force Resolution, Congress passed the statute entitled Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA PATRIOT ACT), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">115</a>Stat.
272; that Act authorized the detention of alien terrorists for no more than seven days in the absence of criminal charges or deportation proceedings, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/8/1226a.html#a_5" class="subref" title="subref">8 U. S. C. §1226a(a)(5)</a> (2000 ed., Supp. I).  It is very difficult to believe that the same Congress that carefully circumscribed Executive power over alien terrorists on home soil would not have meant to require the Government to justify clearly
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				its detention of an American citizen held on home soil incommunicado.
			</p>
        <p class="opcentered">

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				Since the Government has given no reason either to deflect the application of §4001(a) or to hold it to be satisfied, I need to go no further; the Government hints of a constitutional challenge to the statute, but it presents none here.  I will, however, stray across the line between statutory and constitutional territory just far enough to note the weakness of the Governments mixed claim of inherent, extrastatutory authority under a combination of Article II of the Constitution and the usages of war.  It is in fact in this connection that the Government developed its argument that the exercise of war powers justifies the detention, and what I have just said about its inadequacy applies here as well.  Beyond that, it is instructive to recall Justice Jacksons observation that the President is not Commander in Chief of the country, only of the military.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				There may be room for one qualification to Justice Jacksons statement, however: in a moment of genuine emergency, when the Government must act with no time for deliberation, the Executive may be able to detain a citizen if there is reason to fear he is an imminent threat to the safety of the Nation and its people (though I doubt there is any want of statutory authority, see 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 910).  This case, however, does not present that question, because an emergency power of necessity must at least be limited by the emergency; Hamdi has been locked up for over two years.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Ex parte Milligan,
				</em>
				 4 Wall. 2, 127 (1866) (martial law justified only by actual and present necessity as in a genuine invasion that closes civilian courts).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Whether insisting on the careful scrutiny of emergency claims or on a vigorous reading of §4001(a), we are heirs to a tradition given voice 800 years ago by Magna Carta, which, on the barons insistence, confined executive power by the law of the land.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Because I find Hamdis detention forbidden by §4001(a) and unauthorized by the Force Resolution, I would not reach any questions of what process he may be due in litigating disputed issues in a proceeding under the habeas statute or prior to the habeas enquiry itself.  For me, it suffices that the Government has failed to justify holding him in the absence of a further Act of Congress, criminal charges, a showing that the detention conforms to the laws of war, or a demonstration that §4001(a) is unconstitutional.  I would therefore vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand for proceedings consistent with this view.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Since this disposition does not command a majority of the Court, however, the need to give practical effect to the conclusions of eight members of the Court rejecting the Governments position calls for me to join with the plurality in ordering remand on terms closest to those I would impose.  See

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">134</a> (1945)
 (Rutledge, J., concurring in result).  Although I think litigation of Hamdis status as an enemy combatant is unnecessary, the terms of the pluralitys remand will allow Hamdi to offer evidence that he is not an enemy combatant, and he should at the least have the benefit of that opportunity.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It should go without saying that in joining with the plurality to produce a judgment, I do not adopt the pluralitys resolution of constitutional issues that I would not reach.  It is not that I could disagree with the pluralitys determinations (given the pluralitys view of the Force Resolution) that someone in Hamdis position is entitled at a minimum to notice of the Governments claimed factual basis for holding him, and to a fair chance to rebut it before a neutral decision maker, see 
				<em>

				</em>
				, at 26; nor, of course, could I disagree with the pluralitys affirmation of Hamdis right to counsel, see 
				<em>

				, at 3233.  On the other hand, I do not mean to imply agreement that the Government could claim an evidentiary presumption casting the burden of rebuttal on Hamdi, see

				</em>
				, at 27, or that an opportunity to litigate before a military tribunal might obviate or truncate enquiry by a court on habeas, see 
				<em>

				According to Yaser Hamdis petition for writ of habeas corpus, brought on his behalf by his father, the Government of the United States is detaining him, an American citizen on American soil, with the explanation that he was seized on the field of battle in Afghanistan, having been on the enemy side.  It is undisputed that the Government has not charged him with espionage, treason, or any other crime under domestic law.  It is likewise undisputed that for one year and nine months, on the basis of an Executive designation of Hamdi as an enemy combatant, the Government denied him the right to send or receive any communication beyond the prison where he was held and, in particular, denied him access to counsel to represent him.
				<a name="ZX-1ref" href="#ZX-1" class="">

				</b>
                </sup>
            </a>
				  The Government asserts a right to hold Hamdi under these conditions indefinitely, that is, until the Government determines that the United States is no longer threatened by the terrorism exemplified in the attacks of September 11, 2001.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In these proceedings on Hamdis petition, he seeks to challenge the facts claimed by the Government as the basis for holding him as an enemy combatant.  And in this Court he presses the distinct argument that the Governments claim, even if true, would not implicate any authority for holding him that would satisfy 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/4001.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. §4001(a)</a> (Non-Detention Act), which bars imprisonment
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				or detention of a citizen except pursuant to an Act of Congress.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Government responds that Hamdis incommunicado imprisonment as an enemy combatant seized on the field of battle falls within the Presidents power as Commander in Chief under the laws and usages of war, and is in any event authorized by two statutes.  Accordingly, the Government contends that Hamdi has no basis for any challenge by petition for habeas except to his own status as an enemy combatant; and even that challenge may go no further than to enquire whether some evidence supports Hamdis designation, see Brief for Respondents 3436; if there is some evidence, Hamdi should remain locked up at the discretion of the Executive.  At the argument of this case, in fact, the Government went further and suggested that as long as a prisoner could challenge his enemy combatant designation when responding to interrogation during incommunicado detention he was accorded sufficient process to support his designation as an enemy combatant.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 40; 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 42 ([H]e has an opportunity to explain it in his own words [d]uring interrogation).  Since on either view judicial enquiry so limited would be virtually worthless as a way to contest detention, the Governments concession of jurisdiction to hear Hamdis habeas claim is more theoretical than practical, leaving the assertion of Executive authority close to unconditional.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The plurality rejects any such limit on the exercise of habeas jurisdiction and so far I agree with its opinion.  The plurality does, however, accept the Governments position that if Hamdis designation as an enemy combatant is correct, his detention (at least as to some period) is authorized by an Act of Congress as required by §4001(a), that is, by the Authorization for Use of Military Force, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">115</a>Stat.
224 (hereinafter Force Resolution).  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 914.  Here, I disagree and respectfully dissent.  The Government has failed to demonstrate that the Force Resolution authorizes the detention complained of here even on the facts the Government claims.  If the Government raises nothing further than the record now shows, the Non-Detention Act entitles Hamdi to be released.
			</p>
        <p class="opcentered">
				I
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				The Governments first response to Hamdis claim that holding him violates §4001(a), prohibiting detention of citizens except pursuant to an Act of Congress, is that the statute does not even apply to military wartime detentions, being beyond the sphere of domestic criminal law.  Next, the Government says that even if that statute does apply, two Acts of Congress provide the authority §4001(a) demands: a general authorization to the Department of Defense to pay for detaining prisoners of war and similar persons, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/956.html#5" class="subref" title="subref">10 U. S. C. §956(5)</a>, and the Force Resolution, passed after the attacks of 2001.  At the same time, the Government argues that in detaining Hamdi in the manner described, the President is in any event acting as Commander in Chief under Article II of the Constitution, which brings with it the right to invoke authority under the accepted customary rules for waging war.  On the record in front of us, the Government has not made out a case on any theory.

        <p class="opcentered">
				II
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				The threshold issue is how broadly or narrowly to read the Non-Detention Act, the tone of which is severe: No citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained by the United States except pursuant to an Act of Congress.  Should the severity of the Act be relieved when the Governments stated factual justification for incommunicado detention is a war on terrorism, so that the Government may be said to act pursuant to congressional terms that fall short of explicit authority to imprison individuals?  With one possible though important qualification, see 
				<em>
					infra
				</em>
				, at 1011, the answer has to be no.  For a number of reasons, the prohibition within §4001(a) has to be read broadly to accord the statute a long reach and to impose a burden of justification on the Government.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				First, the circumstances in which the Act was adopted point the way to this interpretation.  The provision superseded a cold-war statute, the Emergency Detention Act of 1950 (formerly 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/50/811.html" class="subref" title="subref">50 U. S. C. §811</a>
            <em>
					et seq.
				</em>
				 (1970 ed.)), which had authorized the Attorney General, in time of emergency, to detain anyone reasonably thought likely to engage in espionage or sabotage.  That statute was repealed in 1971 out of fear that it could authorize a repetition of the World War II internment of citizens of Japanese ancestry; Congress meant to preclude another episode like the one described in 
				<em>
					Korematsu
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/323/214" class="subref" title="subref">323 U. S. 214</a> (1944)
.  See H. R. Rep. No. 92116, pp. 2, 45 (1971).  While Congress might simply have struck the 1950 statute, in considering the repealer the point was made that the existing statute provided some express procedural protection, without which the Executive would seem to be subject to no statutory limits protecting individual liberty.  See 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 5 (mere repeal might leave citizens subject to arbitrary executive action, with no clear demarcation of the limits of executive authority); 117 Cong. Rec. 31544 (1971) (Emergency Detention Act remains as the only existing barrier against the future exercise of executive power which resulted in the Japanese internment); cf. 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 31548 (in the absence of further procedural provisions, even §4001(a) will virtually leave us stripped naked against the great power … which the President has).  It was in these circumstances that a proposed limit on Executive action was expanded to the inclusive scope of §4001(a) as enacted.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The fact that Congress intended to guard against a repetition of the World War II internments when it repealed the 1950 statute and gave us §4001(a) provides a powerful reason to think that §4001(a) was meant to require clear congressional authorization before any citizen can be placed in a cell.  It is not merely that the legislative history shows that §4001(a) was thought necessary in anticipation of times just like the present, in which the safety of the country is threatened.  To appreciate what is most significant, one must only recall that the internments of the 1940s were accomplished by Executive action.  Although an Act of Congress ratified and confirmed an Executive order authorizing the military to exclude individuals from defined areas and to accommodate those it might remove, see 
				<em>
					Ex parte Endo
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/323/283" class="subref" title="subref">323 U. S. 283</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">285</a>288 (1944)
, the statute said nothing whatever about the detention of those who might be removed, 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 300301; internment camps were creatures of the Executive, and confinement in them rested on assertion of Executive authority, see 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 287293.  When, therefore, Congress repealed the 1950 Act and adopted §4001(a) for the purpose of avoiding another 
				<em>
					Korematsu
				</em>
				, it intended to preclude reliance on vague congressional authority (for example, providing accommodations for those subject to removal) as authority for detention or imprisonment at the discretion of the Executive (maintaining detention camps of American citizens, for example).  In requiring that any Executive detention be pursuant to an Act of Congress, then, Congress necessarily meant to require a congressional enactment that clearly authorized detention or imprisonment.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, when Congress passed §4001(a) it was acting in light of an interpretive regime that subjected enactments limiting liberty in wartime to the requirement of a clear statement and it presumably intended §4001(a) to be read accordingly.  This need for clarity was unmistakably expressed in 
				<em>
					Ex parte
				</em>
            <em>
					Endo
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, decided the same day as 
				<em>
					Korematsu
				</em>
				.  
				<em>
					Endo
				</em>
				 began with a petition for habeas corpus by an interned citizen claiming to be loyal and law-abiding and thus unlawfully detained.  323 U. S., at 294.  The petitioner was held entitled to habeas relief in an opinion that set out this principle for scrutinizing wartime statutes in derogation of customary liberty:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				In interpreting a wartime measure we must assume that [its] purpose was to allow for the greatest possible accommodation between … liberties and the exigencies of war.  We must assume, when asked to find implied powers in a grant of legislative or executive authority, that the law makers intended to place no greater restraint on the citizen than was clearly and unmistakably indicated by the language they used.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 300.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
Congresss understanding of the need for clear authority before citizens are kept detained is itself therefore clear, and §4001(a) must be read to have teeth in its demand for congressional authorization.

				<em>

				, and 
				<em>

				 had set out no principle of statutory interpretation, there would be a compelling reason to read §4001(a) to demand manifest authority to detain before detention is authorized.  The defining character of American constitutional government is its constant tension between security and liberty, serving both by partial helpings of each.  In a government of separated powers, deciding finally on what is a reasonable degree of guaranteed liberty whether in peace or war (or some condition in between) is not well entrusted to the Executive Branch of Government, whose particular responsibility is to maintain security.  For reasons of inescapable human nature, the branch of the Government asked to counter a serious threat is not the branch on which to rest the Nations entire reliance in striking the balance between the will to win and the cost in liberty on the way to victory; the responsibility for security will naturally amplify the claim that security legitimately raises.  A reasonable balance is more likely to be reached on the judgment of a different branch, just as Madison said in remarking that the constant aim is to divide and arrange the several offices in such a manner as that each may be a check on the otherthat the private interest of every individual may be a sentinel over the public rights.  The Federalist No. 51, p. 349 (J. Cooke ed. 1961).  Hence the need for an assessment by Congress before citizens are subject to lockup, and likewise the need for a clearly expressed congressional resolution of the competing claims.

				Under this principle of reading §4001(a) robustly to require a clear statement of authorization to detain, none of the Governments arguments suffices to justify Hamdis detention.

				First, there is the argument that §4001(a) does not even apply to wartime military detentions, a position resting on the placement of §4001(a) in Title 18 of the United States Code, the gathering of federal criminal law.  The text of the statute does not, however, so limit its reach, and the legislative history of the provision shows its placement in Title 18 was not meant to render the statute more restricted than its terms.  The draft of what is now §4001(a) as contained in the original bill prohibited only imprisonment unauthorized by Title 18.  See H. R. Rep. No. 92
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				116, at 4.  In response to the Department of Justices objection that the original draft seemed to assume wrongly that all provisions for the detention of convicted persons would be contained in Title 18, the provision was amended by replacing a reference to that title with the reference to an Act of Congress.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 3.  The Committee on the Judiciary, discussing this change, stated that [limiting] detention of citizens … to situations in which … an Act of Congres[s] exists would assure that no detention camps can be established without at least the acquiescence of the Congress.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 5.  See also 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 46.  This understanding, that the amended bill would sweep beyond imprisonment for crime and apply to Executive detention in furtherance of wartime security, was emphasized in an extended debate.  Representative Ichord, chairman of the House Internal Security Committee and an opponent of the bill, feared that the redrafted statute would deprive the President of his emergency powers and his most effective means of coping with sabotage and espionage agents in war-related crises.  117 Cong. Rec., at 31542.  Representative Railsback, the bills sponsor, spoke of the bill in absolute terms: [I]n order to prohibit arbitrary executive action, [the bill] assures that no detention of citizens can be undertaken by the Executive without the prior consent of Congress.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 31551.  This legislative history indicates that Congress was aware that §4001(a) would limit the Executives power to detain citizens in wartime to protect national security, and it is fair to say that the prohibition was thus intended to extend not only to the exercise of power to vindicate the interests underlying domestic criminal law, but to statutorily unauthorized detention by the Executive for reasons of security in wartime, just as Hamdi claims.

				Next, there is the Governments claim, accepted by the Court, that the terms of the Force Resolution are adequate to authorize detention of an enemy combatant under the circumstances described,

            </a>
				 a claim the Government fails to support sufficiently to satisfy §4001(a) as read to require a clear statement of authority to detain.  Since the Force Resolution was adopted one week after the attacks of September 11, 2001, it naturally speaks with some generality, but its focus is clear, and that is on the use of military power.  It is fairly read to authorize the use of armies and weapons, whether against other armies or individual terrorists.  But, like the statute discussed in 
				<em>
					Endo
				</em>
				, it never so much as uses the word detention, and there is no reason to think Congress might have perceived any need to augment Executive power to deal with dangerous citizens within the United States, given the well-stocked statutory arsenal of defined criminal offenses covering the gamut of actions that a citizen sympathetic to terrorists might commit.

				Even so, there is one argument for treating the Force Resolution as sufficiently clear to authorize detention of a citizen consistently with §4001(a).  Assuming the argument to be sound, however, the Government is in no position to claim its advantage.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Because the Force Resolution authorizes the use of military force in acts of war by the United States, the argument goes, it is reasonably clear that the military and its Commander in Chief are authorized to deal with enemy belligerents according to the treaties and customs known collectively as the laws of war.  Brief for Respondents 20

, may perhaps be claimed for the proposition that the American citizenship of such a captive does not as such limit the Governments power to deal with him under the usages of war.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 31, 3738.  Thus, the Government here repeatedly argues that Hamdis detention amounts to nothing more than customary detention of a captive taken on the field of battle: if the usages of war are fairly authorized by the Force Resolution, Hamdis detention is authorized for purposes of §4001(a).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				There is no need, however, to address the merits of such an argument in all possible circumstances.  For now it is enough to recognize that the Governments stated legal position in its campaign against the Taliban (among whom Hamdi was allegedly captured) is apparently at odds with
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				its claim here to be acting in accordance with custo-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				mary law of war and hence to be within the terms of
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				the Force Resolution in its detention of Hamdi.  In a statement of its legal position cited in its brief, the
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				Government says that the Geneva Convention applies
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				to the Taliban detainees.  Office of the White House Press Secretary, Fact Sheet, Status of Detainees at Guantanamo (Feb. 7, 2002), www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				02/2002020713.html (as visited June 18, 2004, and available in Clerk of Courts case file) (hereinafter White House Press Release) (cited in Brief for Respondents 24, n. 9).  Hamdi presumably is such a detainee, since according to the Governments own account, he was taken bearing arms on the Taliban side of a field of battle in Afghanistan.  He would therefore seem to qualify for treatment as a prisoner of war under the Third Geneva Convention, to which the United States is a party.  Article 4 of the Geneva Convention (III) Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug. 12, 1949, [1955] 6 U. S. T. 3316, 3320, T. I. A. S. No. 3364.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				By holding him incommunicado, however, the Government obviously has not been treating him as a prisoner of war, and in fact the Government claims that no Taliban detainee is entitled to prisoner of war status.  See Brief for Respondents 24; White House Press Release.  This treatment appears to be a violation of the Geneva Convention provision that even in cases of doubt, captives are entitled to be treated as prisoners of war until such time as their status has been determined by a competent tribunal.  Art. 5, 6 U. S. T., at 3324.  The Government answers that the Presidents determination that Taliban detainees do not qualify as prisoners of war is conclusive as to Hamdis status and removes any doubt that would trigger application of the Conventions tribunal requirement.  See Brief for Respondents 24.  But reliance on this categorical pronouncement to settle doubt is apparently at odds with the military regulation, Enemy Prisoners of War, Retained Personnel, Civilian Internees and Other Detainees, Army Reg. 1908, §§15, 16 (1997),
				 
				adopted to implement the Geneva Convention, and setting out a detailed procedure for a military tribunal to determine an individuals status.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 id
				</em>
				., §16
				 
				(A competent tribunal shall be composed of three commissioned officers; a written record shall be made of proceedings; [p]roceedings shall be open with certain exceptions; [p]ersons whose status is to be determined shall be advised of their rights at the beginning of their hearings, allowed to attend all open sessions, allowed to call witnesses if reasonably available, and to question those witnesses called by the Tribunal, and to have a right to testify; and a tribunal shall determine status by a [p]reponderance of evidence).  One of the types of doubt these tribunals are meant to settle is whether a given individual may be, as Hamdi says he is, an [i]nnocent civilian who should be immediately returned to his home or released.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, 16
				<em>
					e
				</em>
				(10)(
				<em>
					c
				</em>
				).  The regulation, jointly promulgated by the Headquarters of the Departments of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps, provides that [p]ersons who have been determined by a competent tribunal not to be entitled to prisoner of war status may not be executed, imprisoned, or otherwise penalized without further proceedings to determine what acts they have committed and what penalty should be imposed.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, §16
				<em>
					g
				</em>
				.  The regulation also incorporates the Geneva Conventions presumption that in cases of doubt, persons shall enjoy the protection of the … Convention until such time as their status has been determined by a competent tribunal.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., §16
				<em>
					a
				</em>
				.  Thus, there is reason to question whether the United States is acting in accordance with the laws of war it claims as authority.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Whether, or to what degree, the Government is in fact violating the Geneva Convention and is thus acting outside the customary usages of war are not matters I can resolve at this point.  What I can say, though, is that the Government has not made out its claim that in detaining Hamdi in the manner described, it is acting in accord with the laws of war authorized to be applied against citizens by the Force Resolution.  I conclude accordingly that the Government has failed to support the position that the Force Resolution authorizes the described detention of Hamdi for purposes of §4001(a).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It is worth adding a further reason for requiring the Government to bear the burden of clearly justifying its claim to be exercising recognized war powers before declaring §4001(a) satisfied.  Thirty-eight days after adopting the Force Resolution, Congress passed the statute entitled Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA PATRIOT ACT), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">115</a>Stat.
272; that Act authorized the detention of alien terrorists for no more than seven days in the absence of criminal charges or deportation proceedings, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/8/1226a.html#a_5" class="subref" title="subref">8 U. S. C. §1226a(a)(5)</a> (2000 ed., Supp. I).  It is very difficult to believe that the same Congress that carefully circumscribed Executive power over alien terrorists on home soil would not have meant to require the Government to justify clearly
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				its detention of an American citizen held on home soil incommunicado.
			</p>
        <p class="opcentered">
				D
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				Since the Government has given no reason either to deflect the application of §4001(a) or to hold it to be satisfied, I need to go no further; the Government hints of a constitutional challenge to the statute, but it presents none here.  I will, however, stray across the line between statutory and constitutional territory just far enough to note the weakness of the Governments mixed claim of inherent, extrastatutory authority under a combination of Article II of the Constitution and the usages of war.  It is in fact in this connection that the Government developed its argument that the exercise of war powers justifies the detention, and what I have just said about its inadequacy applies here as well.  Beyond that, it is instructive to recall Justice Jacksons observation that the President is not Commander in Chief of the country, only of the military.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				There may be room for one qualification to Justice Jacksons statement, however: in a moment of genuine emergency, when the Government must act with no time for deliberation, the Executive may be able to detain a citizen if there is reason to fear he is an imminent threat to the safety of the Nation and its people (though I doubt there is any want of statutory authority, see 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 910).  This case, however, does not present that question, because an emergency power of necessity must at least be limited by the emergency; Hamdi has been locked up for over two years.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Ex parte Milligan,
				</em>
				 4 Wall. 2, 127 (1866) (martial law justified only by actual and present necessity as in a genuine invasion that closes civilian courts).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Whether insisting on the careful scrutiny of emergency claims or on a vigorous reading of §4001(a), we are heirs to a tradition given voice 800 years ago by Magna Carta, which, on the barons insistence, confined executive power by the law of the land.

        <p class="opcentered">

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Because I find Hamdis detention forbidden by §4001(a) and unauthorized by the Force Resolution, I would not reach any questions of what process he may be due in litigating disputed issues in a proceeding under the habeas statute or prior to the habeas enquiry itself.  For me, it suffices that the Government has failed to justify holding him in the absence of a further Act of Congress, criminal charges, a showing that the detention conforms to the laws of war, or a demonstration that §4001(a) is unconstitutional.  I would therefore vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand for proceedings consistent with this view.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Since this disposition does not command a majority of the Court, however, the need to give practical effect to the conclusions of eight members of the Court rejecting the Governments position calls for me to join with the plurality in ordering remand on terms closest to those I would impose.  See

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">134</a> (1945)
 (Rutledge, J., concurring in result).  Although I think litigation of Hamdis status as an enemy combatant is unnecessary, the terms of the pluralitys remand will allow Hamdi to offer evidence that he is not an enemy combatant, and he should at the least have the benefit of that opportunity.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It should go without saying that in joining with the plurality to produce a judgment, I do not adopt the pluralitys resolution of constitutional issues that I would not reach.  It is not that I could disagree with the pluralitys determinations (given the pluralitys view of the Force Resolution) that someone in Hamdis position is entitled at a minimum to notice of the Governments claimed factual basis for holding him, and to a fair chance to rebut it before a neutral decision maker, see

				</em>
				, at 26; nor, of course, could I disagree with the pluralitys affirmation of Hamdis right to counsel, see 
				<em>

				, at 27, or that an opportunity to litigate before a military tribunal might obviate or truncate enquiry by a court on habeas, see

				According to Yaser Hamdis petition for writ of habeas corpus, brought on his behalf by his father, the Government of the United States is detaining him, an American citizen on American soil, with the explanation that he was seized on the field of battle in Afghanistan, having been on the enemy side.  It is undisputed that the Government has not charged him with espionage, treason, or any other crime under domestic law.  It is likewise undisputed that for one year and nine months, on the basis of an Executive designation of Hamdi as an enemy combatant, the Government denied him the right to send or receive any communication beyond the prison where he was held and, in particular, denied him access to counsel to represent him.

            </a>
				  The Government asserts a right to hold Hamdi under these conditions indefinitely, that is, until the Government determines that the United States is no longer threatened by the terrorism exemplified in the attacks of September 11, 2001.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In these proceedings on Hamdis petition, he seeks to challenge the facts claimed by the Government as the basis for holding him as an enemy combatant.  And in this Court he presses the distinct argument that the Governments claim, even if true, would not implicate any authority for holding him that would satisfy 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/4001.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. §4001(a)</a> (Non-Detention Act), which bars imprisonment
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				or detention of a citizen except pursuant to an Act of Congress.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Government responds that Hamdis incommunicado imprisonment as an enemy combatant seized on the field of battle falls within the Presidents power as Commander in Chief under the laws and usages of war, and is in any event authorized by two statutes.  Accordingly, the Government contends that Hamdi has no basis for any challenge by petition for habeas except to his own status as an enemy combatant; and even that challenge may go no further than to enquire whether some evidence supports Hamdis designation, see Brief for Respondents 3436; if there is some evidence, Hamdi should remain locked up at the discretion of the Executive.  At the argument of this case, in fact, the Government went further and suggested that as long as a prisoner could challenge his enemy combatant designation when responding to interrogation during incommunicado detention he was accorded sufficient process to support his designation as an enemy combatant.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 40; 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 42 ([H]e has an opportunity to explain it in his own words [d]uring interrogation).  Since on either view judicial enquiry so limited would be virtually worthless as a way to contest detention, the Governments concession of jurisdiction to hear Hamdis habeas claim is more theoretical than practical, leaving the assertion of Executive authority close to unconditional.

				The plurality rejects any such limit on the exercise of habeas jurisdiction and so far I agree with its opinion.  The plurality does, however, accept the Governments position that if Hamdis designation as an enemy combatant is correct, his detention (at least as to some period) is authorized by an Act of Congress as required by §4001(a), that is, by the Authorization for Use of Military Force,

The Government has failed to demonstrate that the Force Resolution authorizes the detention complained of here even on the facts the Government claims.

				The Governments first response to Hamdis claim that holding him violates §4001(a), prohibiting detention of citizens except pursuant to an Act of Congress, is that the statute does not even apply to military wartime detentions, being beyond the sphere of domestic criminal law.  Next, the Government says that even if that statute does apply, two Acts of Congress provide the authority §4001(a) demands: a general authorization to the Department of Defense to pay for detaining prisoners of war and similar persons, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/956.html#5" class="subref" title="subref">10 U. S. C. §956(5)</a>, and the Force Resolution, passed after the attacks of 2001.  At the same time, the Government argues that in detaining Hamdi in the manner described, the President is in any event acting as Commander in Chief under Article II of the Constitution, which brings with it the right to invoke authority under the accepted customary rules for waging war.  On the record in front of us, the Government has not made out a case on any theory.

				The threshold issue is how broadly or narrowly to read the Non-Detention Act, the tone of which is severe: No citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained by the United States except pursuant to an Act of Congress.  Should the severity of the Act be relieved when the Governments stated factual justification for incommunicado detention is a war on terrorism, so that the Government may be said to act pursuant to congressional terms that fall short of explicit authority to imprison individuals?  With one possible though important qualification, see 
				<em>
					infra
				</em>
				, at 1011, the answer has to be no.  For a number of reasons, the prohibition within §4001(a) has to be read broadly to accord the statute a long reach and to impose a burden of justification on the Government.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				First, the circumstances in which the Act was adopted point the way to this interpretation.  The provision superseded a cold-war statute, the Emergency Detention Act of 1950 (formerly 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/50/811.html" class="subref" title="subref">50 U. S. C. §811</a>
            <em>
					et seq.
				</em>
				 (1970 ed.)), which had authorized the Attorney General, in time of emergency, to detain anyone reasonably thought likely to engage in espionage or sabotage.  That statute was repealed in 1971 out of fear that it could authorize a repetition of the World War II internment of citizens of Japanese ancestry; Congress meant to preclude another episode like the one described in 
				<em>
					Korematsu
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/323/214" class="subref" title="subref">323 U. S. 214</a> (1944)
.  See H. R. Rep. No. 92116, pp. 2, 45 (1971).  While Congress might simply have struck the 1950 statute, in considering the repealer the point was made that the existing statute provided some express procedural protection, without which the Executive would seem to be subject to no statutory limits protecting individual liberty.  See 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 5 (mere repeal might leave citizens subject to arbitrary executive action, with no clear demarcation of the limits of executive authority); 117 Cong. Rec. 31544 (1971) (Emergency Detention Act remains as the only existing barrier against the future exercise of executive power which resulted in the Japanese internment); cf. 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 31548 (in the absence of further procedural provisions, even §4001(a) will virtually leave us stripped naked against the great power … which the President has).  It was in these circumstances that a proposed limit on Executive action was expanded to the inclusive scope of §4001(a) as enacted.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The fact that Congress intended to guard against a repetition of the World War II internments when it repealed the 1950 statute and gave us §4001(a) provides a powerful reason to think that §4001(a) was meant to require clear congressional authorization before any citizen can be placed in a cell.  It is not merely that the legislative history shows that §4001(a) was thought necessary in anticipation of times just like the present, in which the safety of the country is threatened.  To appreciate what is most significant, one must only recall that the internments of the 1940s were accomplished by Executive action.  Although an Act of Congress ratified and confirmed an Executive order authorizing the military to exclude individuals from defined areas and to accommodate those it might remove, see 
				<em>
					Ex parte Endo
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/323/283" class="subref" title="subref">323 U. S. 283</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">285</a>288 (1944)
, the statute said nothing whatever about the detention of those who might be removed, 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 300301; internment camps were creatures of the Executive, and confinement in them rested on assertion of Executive authority, see 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 287293.  When, therefore, Congress repealed the 1950 Act and adopted §4001(a) for the purpose of avoiding another 
				<em>
					Korematsu
				</em>
				, it intended to preclude reliance on vague congressional authority (for example, providing accommodations for those subject to removal) as authority for detention or imprisonment at the discretion of the Executive (maintaining detention camps of American citizens, for example).  In requiring that any Executive detention be pursuant to an Act of Congress, then, Congress necessarily meant to require a congressional enactment that clearly authorized detention or imprisonment.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, when Congress passed §4001(a) it was acting in light of an interpretive regime that subjected enactments limiting liberty in wartime to the requirement of a clear statement and it presumably intended §4001(a) to be read accordingly.  This need for clarity was unmistakably expressed in 
				<em>
					Ex parte
				</em>
            <em>
					Endo
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, decided the same day as 
				<em>
					Korematsu
				</em>
				.  
				<em>
					Endo
				</em>
				 began with a petition for habeas corpus by an interned citizen claiming to be loyal and law-abiding and thus unlawfully detained.  323 U. S., at 294.  The petitioner was held entitled to habeas relief in an opinion that set out this principle for scrutinizing wartime statutes in derogation of customary liberty:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				In interpreting a wartime measure we must assume that [its] purpose was to allow for the greatest possible accommodation between … liberties and the exigencies of war.  We must assume, when asked to find implied powers in a grant of legislative or executive authority, that the law makers intended to place no greater restraint on the citizen than was clearly and unmistakably indicated by the language they used.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 300.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
Congresss understanding of the need for clear authority before citizens are kept detained is itself therefore clear, and §4001(a) must be read to have teeth in its demand for congressional authorization.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Finally, even if history had spared us the cautionary example of the internments in World War II, even if there had been no 
				<em>
					Korematsu
				</em>
				, and 
				<em>
					Endo
				</em>
				 had set out no principle of statutory interpretation, there would be a compelling reason to read §4001(a) to demand manifest authority to detain before detention is authorized.  The defining character of American constitutional government is its constant tension between security and liberty, serving both by partial helpings of each.  In a government of separated powers, deciding finally on what is a reasonable degree of guaranteed liberty whether in peace or war (or some condition in between) is not well entrusted to the Executive Branch of Government, whose particular responsibility is to maintain security.  For reasons of inescapable human nature, the branch of the Government asked to counter a serious threat is not the branch on which to rest the Nations entire reliance in striking the balance between the will to win and the cost in liberty on the way to victory; the responsibility for security will naturally amplify the claim that security legitimately raises.  A reasonable balance is more likely to be reached on the judgment of a different branch, just as Madison said in remarking that the constant aim is to divide and arrange the several offices in such a manner as that each may be a check on the otherthat the private interest of every individual may be a sentinel over the public rights.  The Federalist No. 51, p. 349 (J. Cooke ed. 1961).  Hence the need for an assessment by Congress before citizens are subject to lockup, and likewise the need for a clearly expressed congressional resolution of the competing claims.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				Under this principle of reading §4001(a) robustly to require a clear statement of authorization to detain, none of the Governments arguments suffices to justify Hamdis detention.

        <p class="opcentered">

        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				First, there is the argument that §4001(a) does not even apply to wartime military detentions, a position resting on the placement of §4001(a) in Title 18 of the United States Code, the gathering of federal criminal law.  The text of the statute does not, however, so limit its reach, and the legislative history of the provision shows its placement in Title 18 was not meant to render the statute more restricted than its terms.  The draft of what is now §4001(a) as contained in the original bill prohibited only imprisonment unauthorized by Title 18.  See H. R. Rep. No. 92
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				116, at 4.  In response to the Department of Justices objection that the original draft seemed to assume wrongly that all provisions for the detention of convicted persons would be contained in Title 18, the provision was amended by replacing a reference to that title with the reference to an Act of Congress.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 3.  The Committee on the Judiciary, discussing this change, stated that [limiting] detention of citizens … to situations in which … an Act of Congres[s] exists would assure that no detention camps can be established without at least the acquiescence of the Congress.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 5.  See also 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 46.  This understanding, that the amended bill would sweep beyond imprisonment for crime and apply to Executive detention in furtherance of wartime security, was emphasized in an extended debate.  Representative Ichord, chairman of the House Internal Security Committee and an opponent of the bill, feared that the redrafted statute would deprive the President of his emergency powers and his most effective means of coping with sabotage and espionage agents in war-related crises.  117 Cong. Rec., at 31542.  Representative Railsback, the bills sponsor, spoke of the bill in absolute terms: [I]n order to prohibit arbitrary executive action, [the bill] assures that no detention of citizens can be undertaken by the Executive without the prior consent of Congress.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 31551.  This legislative history indicates that Congress was aware that §4001(a) would limit the Executives power to detain citizens in wartime to protect national security, and it is fair to say that the prohibition was thus intended to extend not only to the exercise of power to vindicate the interests underlying domestic criminal law, but to statutorily unauthorized detention by the Executive for reasons of security in wartime, just as Hamdi claims.

				 a claim the Government fails to support sufficiently to satisfy §4001(a) as read to require a clear statement of authority to detain.  Since the Force Resolution was adopted one week after the attacks of September 11, 2001, it naturally speaks with some generality, but its focus is clear, and that is on the use of military power.  It is fairly read to authorize the use of armies and weapons, whether against other armies or individual terrorists.  But, like the statute discussed in 
				<em>
					Endo
				</em>
				, it never so much as uses the word detention, and there is no reason to think Congress might have perceived any need to augment Executive power to deal with dangerous citizens within the United States, given the well-stocked statutory arsenal of defined criminal offenses covering the gamut of actions that a citizen sympathetic to terrorists might commit.

				Even so, there is one argument for treating the Force Resolution as sufficiently clear to authorize detention of a citizen consistently with §4001(a).  Assuming the argument to be sound, however, the Government is in no position to claim its advantage.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Because the Force Resolution authorizes the use of military force in acts of war by the United States, the argument goes, it is reasonably clear that the military and its Commander in Chief are authorized to deal with enemy belligerents according to the treaties and customs known collectively as the laws of war.

, may perhaps be claimed for the proposition that the American citizenship of such a captive does not as such limit the Governments power to deal with him under the usages of war.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 31, 3738.  Thus, the Government here repeatedly argues that Hamdis detention amounts to nothing more than customary detention of a captive taken on the field of battle: if the usages of war are fairly authorized by the Force Resolution, Hamdis detention is authorized for purposes of §4001(a).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				There is no need, however, to address the merits of such an argument in all possible circumstances.  For now it is enough to recognize that the Governments stated legal position in its campaign against the Taliban (among whom Hamdi was allegedly captured) is apparently at odds with
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				its claim here to be acting in accordance with custo-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				mary law of war and hence to be within the terms of
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				the Force Resolution in its detention of Hamdi.  In a statement of its legal position cited in its brief, the
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				Government says that the Geneva Convention applies
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				to the Taliban detainees.  Office of the White House Press Secretary, Fact Sheet, Status of Detainees at Guantanamo (Feb. 7, 2002), www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/

Hamdi presumably is such a detainee, since according to the Governments own account, he was taken bearing arms on the Taliban side of a field of battle in Afghanistan.  He would therefore seem to qualify for treatment as a prisoner of war under the Third Geneva Convention, to which the United States is a party.  Article 4 of the Geneva Convention (III) Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug. 12, 1949, [1955] 6 U. S. T. 3316, 3320, T. I. A. S. No. 3364.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				By holding him incommunicado, however, the Government obviously has not been treating him as a prisoner of war, and in fact the Government claims that no Taliban detainee is entitled to prisoner of war status.  See Brief for Respondents 24; White House Press Release.  This treatment appears to be a violation of the Geneva Convention provision that even in cases of doubt, captives are entitled to be treated as prisoners of war until such time as their status has been determined by a competent tribunal.  Art. 5, 6 U. S. T., at 3324.  The Government answers that the Presidents determination that Taliban detainees do not qualify as prisoners of war is conclusive as to Hamdis status and removes any doubt that would trigger application of the Conventions tribunal requirement.  See Brief for Respondents 24.  But reliance on this categorical pronouncement to settle doubt is apparently at odds with the military regulation, Enemy Prisoners of War, Retained Personnel, Civilian Internees and Other Detainees, Army Reg. 1908, §§15, 16 (1997),
				 
				adopted to implement the Geneva Convention, and setting out a detailed procedure for a military tribunal to determine an individuals status.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				,
				<em>

				</em>
				., §16
				 
				(A competent tribunal shall be composed of three commissioned officers; a written record shall be made of proceedings; [p]roceedings shall be open with certain exceptions; [p]ersons whose status is to be determined shall be advised of their rights at the beginning of their hearings, allowed to attend all open sessions, allowed to call witnesses if reasonably available, and to question those witnesses called by the Tribunal, and to have a right to testify; and a tribunal shall determine status by a [p]reponderance of evidence).  One of the types of doubt these tribunals are meant to settle is whether a given individual may be, as Hamdi says he is, an [i]nnocent civilian who should be immediately returned to his home or released.  
				<em>

The regulation, jointly promulgated by the Headquarters of the Departments of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps, provides that [p]ersons who have been determined by a competent tribunal not to be entitled to prisoner of war status may not be executed, imprisoned, or otherwise penalized without further proceedings to determine what acts they have committed and what penalty should be imposed.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Whether, or to what degree, the Government is in fact violating the Geneva Convention and is thus acting outside the customary usages of war are not matters I can resolve at this point.  What I can say, though, is that the Government has not made out its claim that in detaining Hamdi in the manner described, it is acting in accord with the laws of war authorized to be applied against citizens by the Force Resolution.  I conclude accordingly that the Government has failed to support the position that the Force Resolution authorizes the described detention of Hamdi for purposes of §4001(a).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It is worth adding a further reason for requiring the Government to bear the burden of clearly justifying its claim to be exercising recognized war powers before declaring §4001(a) satisfied.  Thirty-eight days after adopting the Force Resolution, Congress passed the statute entitled Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA PATRIOT ACT), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">115</a>Stat.
272; that Act authorized the detention of alien terrorists for no more than seven days in the absence of criminal charges or deportation proceedings, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/8/1226a.html#a_5" class="subref" title="subref">8 U. S. C. §1226a(a)(5)</a> (2000 ed., Supp. I).  It is very difficult to believe that the same Congress that carefully circumscribed Executive power over alien terrorists on home soil would not have meant to require the Government to justify clearly
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				its detention of an American citizen held on home soil incommunicado.

				Since the Government has given no reason either to deflect the application of §4001(a) or to hold it to be satisfied, I need to go no further; the Government hints of a constitutional challenge to the statute, but it presents none here.  I will, however, stray across the line between statutory and constitutional territory just far enough to note the weakness of the Governments mixed claim of inherent, extrastatutory authority under a combination of Article II of the Constitution and the usages of war.  It is in fact in this connection that the Government developed its argument that the exercise of war powers justifies the detention, and what I have just said about its inadequacy applies here as well.  Beyond that, it is instructive to recall Justice Jacksons observation that the President is not Commander in Chief of the country, only of the military.

				, at 910).  This case, however, does not present that question, because an emergency power of necessity must at least be limited by the emergency; Hamdi has been locked up for over two years.  Cf.

				Whether insisting on the careful scrutiny of emergency claims or on a vigorous reading of §4001(a), we are heirs to a tradition given voice 800 years ago by Magna Carta, which, on the barons insistence, confined executive power by the law of the land.

				Because I find Hamdis detention forbidden by §4001(a) and unauthorized by the Force Resolution, I would not reach any questions of what process he may be due in litigating disputed issues in a proceeding under the habeas statute or prior to the habeas enquiry itself.  For me, it suffices that the Government has failed to justify holding him in the absence of a further Act of Congress, criminal charges, a showing that the detention conforms to the laws of war, or a demonstration that §4001(a) is unconstitutional.  I would therefore vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand for proceedings consistent with this view.

				It should go without saying that in joining with the plurality to produce a judgment, I do not adopt the pluralitys resolution of constitutional issues that I would not reach.

				According to Yaser Hamdis petition for writ of habeas corpus, brought on his behalf by his father, the Government of the United States is detaining him, an American citizen on American soil, with the explanation that he was seized on the field of battle in Afghanistan, having been on the enemy side.  It is undisputed that the Government has not charged him with espionage, treason, or any other crime under domestic law.  It is likewise undisputed that for one year and nine months, on the basis of an Executive designation of Hamdi as an enemy combatant, the Government denied him the right to send or receive any communication beyond the prison where he was held and, in particular, denied him access to counsel to represent him.

                </sup>
            </a>
				  The Government asserts a right to hold Hamdi under these conditions indefinitely, that is, until the Government determines that the United States is no longer threatened by the terrorism exemplified in the attacks of September 11, 2001.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In these proceedings on Hamdis petition, he seeks to challenge the facts claimed by the Government as the basis for holding him as an enemy combatant.  And in this Court he presses the distinct argument that the Governments claim, even if true, would not implicate any authority for holding him that would satisfy 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/4001.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. §4001(a)</a> (Non-Detention Act), which bars imprisonment
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				or detention of a citizen except pursuant to an Act of Congress.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Government responds that Hamdis incommunicado imprisonment as an enemy combatant seized on the field of battle falls within the Presidents power as Commander in Chief under the laws and usages of war, and is in any event authorized by two statutes.  Accordingly, the Government contends that Hamdi has no basis for any challenge by petition for habeas except to his own status as an enemy combatant; and even that challenge may go no further than to enquire whether some evidence supports Hamdis designation, see Brief for Respondents 3436; if there is some evidence, Hamdi should remain locked up at the discretion of the Executive.  At the argument of this case, in fact, the Government went further and suggested that as long as a prisoner could challenge his enemy combatant designation when responding to interrogation during incommunicado detention he was accorded sufficient process to support his designation as an enemy combatant.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 40; 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 42 ([H]e has an opportunity to explain it in his own words [d]uring interrogation).  Since on either view judicial enquiry so limited would be virtually worthless as a way to contest detention, the Governments concession of jurisdiction to hear Hamdis habeas claim is more theoretical than practical, leaving the assertion of Executive authority close to unconditional.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The plurality rejects any such limit on the exercise of habeas jurisdiction and so far I agree with its opinion.  The plurality does, however, accept the Governments position that if Hamdis designation as an enemy combatant is correct, his detention (at least as to some period) is authorized by an Act of Congress as required by §4001(a), that is, by the Authorization for Use of Military Force, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">115</a>Stat.
224 (hereinafter Force Resolution).  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 914.  Here, I disagree and respectfully dissent.  The Government has failed to demonstrate that the Force Resolution authorizes the detention complained of here even on the facts the Government claims.  If the Government raises nothing further than the record now shows, the Non-Detention Act entitles Hamdi to be released.

        <p class="opcentered">

        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				The Governments first response to Hamdis claim that holding him violates §4001(a), prohibiting detention of citizens except pursuant to an Act of Congress, is that the statute does not even apply to military wartime detentions, being beyond the sphere of domestic criminal law.  Next, the Government says that even if that statute does apply, two Acts of Congress provide the authority §4001(a) demands: a general authorization to the Department of Defense to pay for detaining prisoners of war and similar persons, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/956.html#5" class="subref" title="subref">10 U. S. C. §956(5)</a>, and the Force Resolution, passed after the attacks of 2001.  At the same time, the Government argues that in detaining Hamdi in the manner described, the President is in any event acting as Commander in Chief under Article II of the Constitution, which brings with it the right to invoke authority under the accepted customary rules for waging war.  On the record in front of us, the Government has not made out a case on any theory.

        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				The threshold issue is how broadly or narrowly to read the Non-Detention Act, the tone of which is severe: No citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained by the United States except pursuant to an Act of Congress.  Should the severity of the Act be relieved when the Governments stated factual justification for incommunicado detention is a war on terrorism, so that the Government may be said to act pursuant to congressional terms that fall short of explicit authority to imprison individuals?  With one possible though important qualification, see 
				<em>
					infra
				</em>
				, at 1011, the answer has to be no.  For a number of reasons, the prohibition within §4001(a) has to be read broadly to accord the statute a long reach and to impose a burden of justification on the Government.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				First, the circumstances in which the Act was adopted point the way to this interpretation.  The provision superseded a cold-war statute, the Emergency Detention Act of 1950 (formerly 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/50/811.html" class="subref" title="subref">50 U. S. C. §811</a>
            <em>
					et seq.
				</em>
				 (1970 ed.)), which had authorized the Attorney General, in time of emergency, to detain anyone reasonably thought likely to engage in espionage or sabotage.  That statute was repealed in 1971 out of fear that it could authorize a repetition of the World War II internment of citizens of Japanese ancestry; Congress meant to preclude another episode like the one described in 
				<em>
					Korematsu
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/323/214" class="subref" title="subref">323 U. S. 214</a> (1944)
.  See H. R. Rep. No. 92116, pp. 2, 45 (1971).  While Congress might simply have struck the 1950 statute, in considering the repealer the point was made that the existing statute provided some express procedural protection, without which the Executive would seem to be subject to no statutory limits protecting individual liberty.  See 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 5 (mere repeal might leave citizens subject to arbitrary executive action, with no clear demarcation of the limits of executive authority); 117 Cong. Rec. 31544 (1971) (Emergency Detention Act remains as the only existing barrier against the future exercise of executive power which resulted in the Japanese internment); cf. 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 31548 (in the absence of further procedural provisions, even §4001(a) will virtually leave us stripped naked against the great power … which the President has).  It was in these circumstances that a proposed limit on Executive action was expanded to the inclusive scope of §4001(a) as enacted.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The fact that Congress intended to guard against a repetition of the World War II internments when it repealed the 1950 statute and gave us §4001(a) provides a powerful reason to think that §4001(a) was meant to require clear congressional authorization before any citizen can be placed in a cell.  It is not merely that the legislative history shows that §4001(a) was thought necessary in anticipation of times just like the present, in which the safety of the country is threatened.  To appreciate what is most significant, one must only recall that the internments of the 1940s were accomplished by Executive action.  Although an Act of Congress ratified and confirmed an Executive order authorizing the military to exclude individuals from defined areas and to accommodate those it might remove, see 
				<em>
					Ex parte Endo
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/323/283" class="subref" title="subref">323 U. S. 283</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">285</a>288 (1944)
, the statute said nothing whatever about the detention of those who might be removed, 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 300301; internment camps were creatures of the Executive, and confinement in them rested on assertion of Executive authority, see 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 287293.  When, therefore, Congress repealed the 1950 Act and adopted §4001(a) for the purpose of avoiding another 
				<em>
					Korematsu
				</em>
				, it intended to preclude reliance on vague congressional authority (for example, providing accommodations for those subject to removal) as authority for detention or imprisonment at the discretion of the Executive (maintaining detention camps of American citizens, for example).  In requiring that any Executive detention be pursuant to an Act of Congress, then, Congress necessarily meant to require a congressional enactment that clearly authorized detention or imprisonment.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, when Congress passed §4001(a) it was acting in light of an interpretive regime that subjected enactments limiting liberty in wartime to the requirement of a clear statement and it presumably intended §4001(a) to be read accordingly.  This need for clarity was unmistakably expressed in 
				<em>
					Ex parte
				</em>
            <em>
					Endo
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, decided the same day as 
				<em>
					Korematsu
				</em>
				.  
				<em>
					Endo
				</em>
				 began with a petition for habeas corpus by an interned citizen claiming to be loyal and law-abiding and thus unlawfully detained.  323 U. S., at 294.  The petitioner was held entitled to habeas relief in an opinion that set out this principle for scrutinizing wartime statutes in derogation of customary liberty:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				In interpreting a wartime measure we must assume that [its] purpose was to allow for the greatest possible accommodation between … liberties and the exigencies of war.  We must assume, when asked to find implied powers in a grant of legislative or executive authority, that the law makers intended to place no greater restraint on the citizen than was clearly and unmistakably indicated by the language they used.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 300.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
Congresss understanding of the need for clear authority before citizens are kept detained is itself therefore clear, and §4001(a) must be read to have teeth in its demand for congressional authorization.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Finally, even if history had spared us the cautionary example of the internments in World War II, even if there had been no 
				<em>
					Korematsu
				</em>
				, and 
				<em>
					Endo
				</em>
				 had set out no principle of statutory interpretation, there would be a compelling reason to read §4001(a) to demand manifest authority to detain before detention is authorized.  The defining character of American constitutional government is its constant tension between security and liberty, serving both by partial helpings of each.  In a government of separated powers, deciding finally on what is a reasonable degree of guaranteed liberty whether in peace or war (or some condition in between) is not well entrusted to the Executive Branch of Government, whose particular responsibility is to maintain security.  For reasons of inescapable human nature, the branch of the Government asked to counter a serious threat is not the branch on which to rest the Nations entire reliance in striking the balance between the will to win and the cost in liberty on the way to victory; the responsibility for security will naturally amplify the claim that security legitimately raises.  A reasonable balance is more likely to be reached on the judgment of a different branch, just as Madison said in remarking that the constant aim is to divide and arrange the several offices in such a manner as that each may be a check on the otherthat the private interest of every individual may be a sentinel over the public rights.  The Federalist No. 51, p. 349 (J. Cooke ed. 1961).  Hence the need for an assessment by Congress before citizens are subject to lockup, and likewise the need for a clearly expressed congressional resolution of the competing claims.

        <p class="opcentered">
				III
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				Under this principle of reading §4001(a) robustly to require a clear statement of authorization to detain, none of the Governments arguments suffices to justify Hamdis detention.
			</p>
        <p class="opcentered">
				A
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				First, there is the argument that §4001(a) does not even apply to wartime military detentions, a position resting on the placement of §4001(a) in Title 18 of the United States Code, the gathering of federal criminal law.  The text of the statute does not, however, so limit its reach, and the legislative history of the provision shows its placement in Title 18 was not meant to render the statute more restricted than its terms.  The draft of what is now §4001(a) as contained in the original bill prohibited only imprisonment unauthorized by Title 18.  See H. R. Rep. No. 92
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				116, at 4.  In response to the Department of Justices objection that the original draft seemed to assume wrongly that all provisions for the detention of convicted persons would be contained in Title 18, the provision was amended by replacing a reference to that title with the reference to an Act of Congress.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 3.  The Committee on the Judiciary, discussing this change, stated that [limiting] detention of citizens … to situations in which … an Act of Congres[s] exists would assure that no detention camps can be established without at least the acquiescence of the Congress.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 5.  See also 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 46.  This understanding, that the amended bill would sweep beyond imprisonment for crime and apply to Executive detention in furtherance of wartime security, was emphasized in an extended debate.  Representative Ichord, chairman of the House Internal Security Committee and an opponent of the bill, feared that the redrafted statute would deprive the President of his emergency powers and his most effective means of coping with sabotage and espionage agents in war-related crises.  117 Cong. Rec., at 31542.  Representative Railsback, the bills sponsor, spoke of the bill in absolute terms: [I]n order to prohibit arbitrary executive action, [the bill] assures that no detention of citizens can be undertaken by the Executive without the prior consent of Congress.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 31551.  This legislative history indicates that Congress was aware that §4001(a) would limit the Executives power to detain citizens in wartime to protect national security, and it is fair to say that the prohibition was thus intended to extend not only to the exercise of power to vindicate the interests underlying domestic criminal law, but to statutorily unauthorized detention by the Executive for reasons of security in wartime, just as Hamdi claims.

            </a>
				 a claim the Government fails to support sufficiently to satisfy §4001(a) as read to require a clear statement of authority to detain.  Since the Force Resolution was adopted one week after the attacks of September 11, 2001, it naturally speaks with some generality, but its focus is clear, and that is on the use of military power.  It is fairly read to authorize the use of armies and weapons, whether against other armies or individual terrorists.  But, like the statute discussed in 
				<em>
					Endo
				</em>
				, it never so much as uses the word detention, and there is no reason to think Congress might have perceived any need to augment Executive power to deal with dangerous citizens within the United States, given the well-stocked statutory arsenal of defined criminal offenses covering the gamut of actions that a citizen sympathetic to terrorists might commit.

				Even so, there is one argument for treating the Force Resolution as sufficiently clear to authorize detention of a citizen consistently with §4001(a).  Assuming the argument to be sound, however, the Government is in no position to claim its advantage.

				Because the Force Resolution authorizes the use of military force in acts of war by the United States, the argument goes, it is reasonably clear that the military and its Commander in Chief are authorized to deal with enemy belligerents according to the treaties and customs known collectively as the laws of war.

				 at 31, 3738.  Thus, the Government here repeatedly argues that Hamdis detention amounts to nothing more than customary detention of a captive taken on the field of battle: if the usages of war are fairly authorized by the Force Resolution, Hamdis detention is authorized for purposes of §4001(a).

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				There is no need, however, to address the merits of such an argument in all possible circumstances.  For now it is enough to recognize that the Governments stated legal position in its campaign against the Taliban (among whom Hamdi was allegedly captured) is apparently at odds with
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				its claim here to be acting in accordance with custo-
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				mary law of war and hence to be within the terms of
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				the Force Resolution in its detention of Hamdi.  In a statement of its legal position cited in its brief, the
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				Government says that the Geneva Convention applies
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				to the Taliban detainees.  Office of the White House Press Secretary, Fact Sheet, Status of Detainees at Guantanamo (Feb. 7, 2002), www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				02/2002020713.html (as visited June 18, 2004, and available in Clerk of Courts case file) (hereinafter White House Press Release) (cited in Brief for Respondents 24, n. 9).  Hamdi presumably is such a detainee, since according to the Governments own account, he was taken bearing arms on the Taliban side of a field of battle in Afghanistan.  He would therefore seem to qualify for treatment as a prisoner of war under the Third Geneva Convention, to which the United States is a party.  Article 4 of the Geneva Convention (III) Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug. 12, 1949, [1955] 6 U. S. T. 3316, 3320, T. I. A. S. No. 3364.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				By holding him incommunicado, however, the Government obviously has not been treating him as a prisoner of war, and in fact the Government claims that no Taliban detainee is entitled to prisoner of war status.  See Brief for Respondents 24; White House Press Release.  This treatment appears to be a violation of the Geneva Convention provision that even in cases of doubt, captives are entitled to be treated as prisoners of war until such time as their status has been determined by a competent tribunal.  Art. 5, 6 U. S. T., at 3324.  The Government answers that the Presidents determination that Taliban detainees do not qualify as prisoners of war is conclusive as to Hamdis status and removes any doubt that would trigger application of the Conventions tribunal requirement.  See Brief for Respondents 24.  But reliance on this categorical pronouncement to settle doubt is apparently at odds with the military regulation, Enemy Prisoners of War, Retained Personnel, Civilian Internees and Other Detainees, Army Reg. 1908, §§15, 16 (1997),
				 
				adopted to implement the Geneva Convention, and setting out a detailed procedure for a military tribunal to determine an individuals status.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 id
				</em>
				., §16
				 
				(A competent tribunal shall be composed of three commissioned officers; a written record shall be made of proceedings; [p]roceedings shall be open with certain exceptions; [p]ersons whose status is to be determined shall be advised of their rights at the beginning of their hearings, allowed to attend all open sessions, allowed to call witnesses if reasonably available, and to question those witnesses called by the Tribunal, and to have a right to testify; and a tribunal shall determine status by a [p]reponderance of evidence).  One of the types of doubt these tribunals are meant to settle is whether a given individual may be, as Hamdi says he is, an [i]nnocent civilian who should be immediately returned to his home or released.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, 16
				<em>
					e
				</em>
				(10)(
				<em>

				</em>
				).  The regulation, jointly promulgated by the Headquarters of the Departments of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps, provides that [p]ersons who have been determined by a competent tribunal not to be entitled to prisoner of war status may not be executed, imprisoned, or otherwise penalized without further proceedings to determine what acts they have committed and what penalty should be imposed.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, §16
				<em>

				</em>
				.  The regulation also incorporates the Geneva Conventions presumption that in cases of doubt, persons shall enjoy the protection of the … Convention until such time as their status has been determined by a competent tribunal.  
				<em>

				</em>
				., §16
				<em>

				</em>
				.  Thus, there is reason to question whether the United States is acting in accordance with the laws of war it claims as authority.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Whether, or to what degree, the Government is in fact violating the Geneva Convention and is thus acting outside the customary usages of war are not matters I can resolve at this point.  What I can say, though, is that the Government has not made out its claim that in detaining Hamdi in the manner described, it is acting in accord with the laws of war authorized to be applied against citizens by the Force Resolution.  I conclude accordingly that the Government has failed to support the position that the Force Resolution authorizes the described detention of Hamdi for purposes of §4001(a).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It is worth adding a further reason for requiring the Government to bear the burden of clearly justifying its claim to be exercising recognized war powers before declaring §4001(a) satisfied.  Thirty-eight days after adopting the Force Resolution, Congress passed the statute entitled Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA PATRIOT ACT), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">115</a>Stat.
272; that Act authorized the detention of alien terrorists for no more than seven days in the absence of criminal charges or deportation proceedings, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/8/1226a.html#a_5" class="subref" title="subref">8 U. S. C. §1226a(a)(5)</a> (2000 ed., Supp. I).  It is very difficult to believe that the same Congress that carefully circumscribed Executive power over alien terrorists on home soil would not have meant to require the Government to justify clearly
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				its detention of an American citizen held on home soil incommunicado.

        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				Since the Government has given no reason either to deflect the application of §4001(a) or to hold it to be satisfied, I need to go no further; the Government hints of a constitutional challenge to the statute, but it presents none here.  I will, however, stray across the line between statutory and constitutional territory just far enough to note the weakness of the Governments mixed claim of inherent, extrastatutory authority under a combination of Article II of the Constitution and the usages of war.  It is in fact in this connection that the Government developed its argument that the exercise of war powers justifies the detention, and what I have just said about its inadequacy applies here as well.  Beyond that, it is instructive to recall Justice Jacksons observation that the President is not Commander in Chief of the country, only of the military.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				There may be room for one qualification to Justice Jacksons statement, however: in a moment of genuine emergency, when the Government must act with no time for deliberation, the Executive may be able to detain a citizen if there is reason to fear he is an imminent threat to the safety of the Nation and its people (though I doubt there is any want of statutory authority, see 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 910).  This case, however, does not present that question, because an emergency power of necessity must at least be limited by the emergency; Hamdi has been locked up for over two years.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Ex parte Milligan,
				</em>
				 4 Wall. 2, 127 (1866) (martial law justified only by actual and present necessity as in a genuine invasion that closes civilian courts).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Whether insisting on the careful scrutiny of emergency claims or on a vigorous reading of §4001(a), we are heirs to a tradition given voice 800 years ago by Magna Carta, which, on the barons insistence, confined executive power by the law of the land.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Because I find Hamdis detention forbidden by §4001(a) and unauthorized by the Force Resolution, I would not reach any questions of what process he may be due in litigating disputed issues in a proceeding under the habeas statute or prior to the habeas enquiry itself.  For me, it suffices that the Government has failed to justify holding him in the absence of a further Act of Congress, criminal charges, a showing that the detention conforms to the laws of war, or a demonstration that §4001(a) is unconstitutional.  I would therefore vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand for proceedings consistent with this view.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Since this disposition does not command a majority of the Court, however, the need to give practical effect to the conclusions of eight members of the Court rejecting the Governments position calls for me to join with the plurality in ordering remand on terms closest to those I would impose.  See 
				<em>
					Screws
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/325/91" class="subref" title="subref">325 U. S. 91</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">134</a> (1945)
 (Rutledge, J., concurring in result).  Although I think litigation of Hamdis status as an enemy combatant is unnecessary, the terms of the pluralitys remand will allow Hamdi to offer evidence that he is not an enemy combatant, and he should at the least have the benefit of that opportunity.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It should go without saying that in joining with the plurality to produce a judgment, I do not adopt the pluralitys resolution of constitutional issues that I would not reach.  It is not that I could disagree with the pluralitys determinations (given the pluralitys view of the Force Resolution) that someone in Hamdis position is entitled at a minimum to notice of the Governments claimed factual basis for holding him, and to a fair chance to rebut it before a neutral decision maker, see 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 26; nor, of course, could I disagree with the pluralitys affirmation of Hamdis right to counsel, see 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 3233.  On the other hand, I do not mean to imply agreement that the Government could claim an evidentiary presumption casting the burden of rebuttal on Hamdi, see 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 27, or that an opportunity to litigate before a military tribunal might obviate or truncate enquiry by a court on habeas, see 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 3132.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Subject to these qualifications, I join with the plurality in a judgment of the Court vacating the Fourth Circuits judgment and remanding the case.

						 Nor is it possible to distinguish between civilian and military authority to detain based on the congressional object of avoiding another Korematsu v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/323/214" class="subref" title="subref">323 U. S. 214</a> (1944)
.  See Brief for Respondents 21 (arguing that military detentions are exempt).  Although a civilian agency authorized by Executive order ran the detention camps, the relocation and detention of American citizens was ordered by the military under authority of the President as Commander in Chief.  See Ex parte Endo,

						 As noted, supra, at 3, the Government argues that a required Act of Congress is to be found in a statutory authorization to spend money appropriated for the care of prisoners of war and of other, similar prisoners,

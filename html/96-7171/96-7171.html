				An official determination that a person has committed a crime may cause two different kinds of injury.  It may result in tangible harms such as imprisonment, loss of the right to vote or to bear arms, and the risk of greater punishment if another crime is committed.  It may also severely injure the persons reputation and good name.

				Given the serious character of a finding that petitioner is guilty of forcible rape, that question must be answered affirmatively.  It may well be true that many prisoners have already caused so many self-inflicted wounds to their good names that an additional finding of guilt may have only a

						 Throughout the parole revocation proceedings, it was alleged that petitioner violated three parole conditions:  Parole Condition #1, because he allegedly was guilty of rape; Parole Condition #6, because he allegedly used or possessed crack cocaine; and Parole Condition #7, because he allegedly used or possessed a dangerous weapon (i.e., the screwdriver allegedly used during the rape).  App. 6064 (alleging violations of Conditions #1, #6, and #7); id., at 7276 (same); id., at 112114 (alleging violations of Conditions #1 and #6).  Thus, when the parole revocation board declared, after careful consideration of evidence presented, that petitioner violated Parole Conditions #1, #6, and #7, id., at 5556, it found that petitioner was guilty of forcible rape.  See also Brief for Respondents 1 (Spencer violated condition #1 by committing the crime of rape).  In addition, even apart from the rape finding, it is undisputed that the board found that petitioner used or possessed drugs, and that he used or possessed a dangerous weapon (which was only alleged to have been used during the rape).  App. 5556.

Indeed, vindicating ones reputation is the main interest at stake in a defamation case, and that interest has always been held to constitute a sufficient personal stake.  See, e.g., Paul, 424 U. S., at 697 ([R]espondents complaint would appear to state a classical claim for defamation actionable in the courts of virtually every State.  Imputing criminal behavior to an individual is generally considered defamatory per se, and actionable without proof of special damages); Gertz, 418 U. S., at 349350 (We need not define actual injury … .  Suffice it to say that actual injury is not limited to out-of-pocket loss.  Indeed, the more customary types of actual harm inflicted by defamatory falsehood include impairment of reputation and standing in the community, personal humiliation, and mental anguish and suffering); L. Eldredge, Law of Defamation §53, pp. 293294 (1978) (There is no doubt about the historical fact that the interest in ones good name was considered an important interest requiring legal protection more than a thousand years ago; and that so far as Anglo-Saxon history is concerned this interest became a legally protected interest comparatively soon after the interest in bodily integrity was given legal protection).

						There are compelling reasons for a court to consider petitioners challenge to the parole boards findings sooner rather than later.  As we stated in a related context:


The question of the validity of a criminal conviction can arise in many contexts, and the sooner the issue is fully litigated the better for all concerned.  It is always preferable to litigate a matter when it is directly and principally in dispute, rather than in a proceeding where it is collateral to the central controversy.  Moreover, litigation is better conducted when the dispute is fresh and additional facts may, if necessary, be taken without a substantial risk that witnesses will die or memories fade.  And it is far better to eliminate the source of a potential legal disability than to require the citizen to suffer the possibly unjustified consequences of the disability itself for an indefinite period of time before he can secure adjudication of the States right to impose it on the basis of some past action.  Sibron v. New York, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/392/40" class="subref" title="subref">392 U. S. 40</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">56</a>57 (1968)
 (citation omitted).
I also believe that, on the facts of this case, there are sufficient tangible consequences to the parole boards findings so as to defeat a claim of mootness.

						There are compelling reasons for a court to consider petitioners challenge to the parole boards findings sooner rather than later.  As we stated in a related context:


The question of the validity of a criminal conviction can arise in many contexts, and the sooner the issue is fully litigated the better for all concerned.  It is always preferable to litigate a matter when it is directly and principally in dispute, rather than in a proceeding where it is collateral to the central controversy.  Moreover, litigation is better conducted when the dispute is fresh and additional facts may, if necessary, be taken without a substantial risk that witnesses will die or memories fade.  And it is far better to eliminate the source of a potential legal disability than to require the citizen to suffer the possibly unjustified consequences of the disability itself for an indefinite period of time before he can secure adjudication of the States right to impose it on the basis of some past action.  Sibron v.

				An official determination that a person has committed a crime may cause two different kinds of injury.  It may result in tangible harms such as imprisonment, loss of the right to vote or to bear arms, and the risk of greater punishment if another crime is committed.  It may also severely injure the persons reputation and good name.

				  Assuming, as the Court does, that he had standing to bring that challenge while he remained in prison, the mootness question, as framed by the Court, is whether he continues to have a personal stake in the outcome of the lawsuit that is likely to be redressed by a favorable decision.

				Given the serious character of a finding that petitioner is guilty of forcible rape, that question must be answered affirmatively.  It may well be true that many prisoners have already caused so many self-inflicted wounds to their good names that an additional finding of guilt may have only a

						 Throughout the parole revocation proceedings, it was alleged that petitioner violated three parole conditions:  Parole Condition #1, because he allegedly was guilty of rape; Parole Condition #6, because he allegedly used or possessed crack cocaine; and Parole Condition #7, because he allegedly used or possessed a dangerous weapon (i.e., the screwdriver allegedly used during the rape).  App. 6064 (alleging violations of Conditions #1, #6, and #7); id., at 7276 (same); id., at 112114 (alleging violations of Conditions #1 and #6).  Thus, when the parole revocation board declared, after careful consideration of evidence presented, that petitioner violated Parole Conditions #1, #6, and #7, id., at 5556, it found that petitioner was guilty of forcible rape.  See also Brief for Respondents 1 (Spencer violated condition #1 by committing the crime of rape).  In addition, even apart from the rape finding, it is undisputed that the board found that petitioner used or possessed drugs, and that he used or possessed a dangerous weapon (which was only alleged to have been used during the rape).  App. 5556.

It may also severely injure the persons reputation and good name.

						 Throughout the parole revocation proceedings, it was alleged that petitioner violated three parole conditions:  Parole Condition #1, because he allegedly was guilty of rape; Parole Condition #6, because he allegedly used or possessed crack cocaine; and Parole Condition #7, because he allegedly used or possessed a dangerous weapon (i.e., the screwdriver allegedly used during the rape).  App. 6064 (alleging violations of Conditions #1, #6, and #7); id., at 7276 (same); id., at 112114 (alleging violations of Conditions #1 and #6).  Thus, when the parole revocation board declared, after careful consideration of evidence presented, that petitioner violated Parole Conditions #1, #6, and #7, id., at 5556, it found that petitioner was guilty of forcible rape.  See also Brief for Respondents 1 (Spencer violated condition #1 by committing the crime of rape).  In addition, even apart from the rape finding, it is undisputed that the board found that petitioner used or possessed drugs, and that he used or possessed a dangerous weapon (which was only alleged to have been used during the rape).

						There are compelling reasons for a court to consider petitioners challenge to the parole boards findings sooner rather than later.  As we stated in a related context:


The question of the validity of a criminal conviction can arise in many contexts, and the sooner the issue is fully litigated the better for all concerned.  It is always preferable to litigate a matter when it is directly and principally in dispute, rather than in a proceeding where it is collateral to the central controversy.  Moreover, litigation is better conducted when the dispute is fresh and additional facts may, if necessary, be taken without a substantial risk that witnesses will die or memories fade.  And it is far better to eliminate the source of a potential legal disability than to require the citizen to suffer the possibly unjustified consequences of the disability itself for an indefinite period of time before he can secure adjudication of the States right to impose it on the basis of some past action.  Sibron v. New York, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/392/40" class="subref" title="subref">392 U. S. 40</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">56</a>57 (1968)
 (citation omitted).
I also believe that, on the facts of this case, there are sufficient tangible consequences to the parole boards findings so as to defeat a claim of mootness.

						There are compelling reasons for a court to consider petitioners challenge to the parole boards findings sooner rather than later.  As we stated in a related context:


The question of the validity of a criminal conviction can arise in many contexts, and the sooner the issue is fully litigated the better for all concerned.  It is always preferable to litigate a matter when it is directly and principally in dispute, rather than in a proceeding where it is collateral to the central controversy.  Moreover, litigation is better conducted when the dispute is fresh and additional facts may, if necessary, be taken without a substantial risk that witnesses will die or memories fade.  And it is far better to eliminate the source of a potential legal disability than to require the citizen to suffer the possibly unjustified consequences of the disability itself for an indefinite period of time before he can secure adjudication of the States right to impose it on the basis of some past action.  Sibron v. New York,

				An official determination that a person has committed a crime may cause two different kinds of injury.

				  Assuming, as the Court does, that he had standing to bring that challenge while he remained in prison, the mootness question, as framed by the Court, is whether he continues to have a personal stake in the outcome of the lawsuit that is likely to be redressed by a favorable decision.

				Given the serious character of a finding that petitioner is guilty of forcible rape, that question must be answered affirmatively.  It may well be true that many prisoners have already caused so many self-inflicted wounds to their good names that an additional finding of guilt may have only a 
				<em>

						 Throughout the parole revocation proceedings, it was alleged that petitioner violated three parole conditions:  Parole Condition #1, because he allegedly was guilty of rape; Parole Condition #6, because he allegedly used or possessed crack cocaine; and Parole Condition #7, because he allegedly used or possessed a dangerous weapon (i.e., the screwdriver allegedly used during the rape).  App. 6064 (alleging violations of Conditions #1, #6, and #7); id., at 7276 (same); id., at 112114 (alleging violations of Conditions #1 and #6).  Thus, when the parole revocation board declared, after careful consideration of evidence presented, that petitioner violated Parole Conditions #1, #6, and #7, id., at 5556, it found that petitioner was guilty of forcible rape.  See also Brief for Respondents 1 (Spencer violated condition #1 by committing the crime of rape).  In addition, even apart from the rape finding, it is undisputed that the board found that petitioner used or possessed drugs, and that he used or possessed a dangerous weapon (which was only alleged to have been used during the rape).  App. 5556.

				Given the serious character of a finding that petitioner is guilty of forcible rape, that question must be answered affirmatively.  It may well be true that many prisoners have already caused so many self-inflicted wounds to their good names that an additional finding of guilt may have only a

						 Throughout the parole revocation proceedings, it was alleged that petitioner violated three parole conditions:  Parole Condition #1, because he allegedly was guilty of rape; Parole Condition #6, because he allegedly used or possessed crack cocaine; and Parole Condition #7, because he allegedly used or possessed a dangerous weapon (i.e., the screwdriver allegedly used during the rape).  App. 6064 (alleging violations of Conditions #1, #6, and #7); id., at 7276 (same); id., at 112114 (alleging violations of Conditions #1 and #6).  Thus, when the parole revocation board declared, after careful consideration of evidence presented, that petitioner violated Parole Conditions #1, #6, and #7, id., at 5556, it found that petitioner was guilty of forcible rape.  See also Brief for Respondents 1 (Spencer violated condition #1 by committing the crime of rape).  In addition, even apart from the rape finding, it is undisputed that the board found that petitioner used or possessed drugs, and that he used or possessed a dangerous weapon (which was only alleged to have been used during the rape).  App. 5556.

						There are compelling reasons for a court to consider petitioners challenge to the parole boards findings sooner rather than later.  As we stated in a related context:


The question of the validity of a criminal conviction can arise in many contexts, and the sooner the issue is fully litigated the better for all concerned.  It is always preferable to litigate a matter when it is directly and principally in dispute, rather than in a proceeding where it is collateral to the central controversy.  Moreover, litigation is better conducted when the dispute is fresh and additional facts may, if necessary, be taken without a substantial risk that witnesses will die or memories fade.  And it is far better to eliminate the source of a potential legal disability than to require the citizen to suffer the possibly unjustified consequences of the disability itself for an indefinite period of time before he can secure adjudication of the States right to impose it on the basis of some past action.  Sibron v. New York, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/392/40" class="subref" title="subref">392 U. S. 40</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">56</a>57 (1968)
 (citation omitted).
I also believe that, on the facts of this case, there are sufficient tangible consequences to the parole boards findings so as to defeat a claim of mootness.

				An official determination that a person has committed a crime may cause two different kinds of injury.  It may result in tangible harms such as imprisonment, loss of the right to vote or to bear arms, and the risk of greater punishment if another crime is committed.

						There are compelling reasons for a court to consider petitioners challenge to the parole boards findings sooner rather than later.  As we stated in a related context:


The question of the validity of a criminal conviction can arise in many contexts, and the sooner the issue is fully litigated the better for all concerned.  It is always preferable to litigate a matter when it is directly and principally in dispute, rather than in a proceeding where it is collateral to the central controversy.  Moreover, litigation is better conducted when the dispute is fresh and additional facts may, if necessary, be taken without a substantial risk that witnesses will die or memories fade.  And it is far better to eliminate the source of a potential legal disability than to require the citizen to suffer the possibly unjustified consequences of the disability itself for an indefinite period of time before he can secure adjudication of the States right to impose it on the basis of some past action.  Sibron v. New York,

				Given the serious character of a finding that petitioner is guilty of forcible rape, that question must be answered affirmatively.  It may well be true that many prisoners have already caused so many self-inflicted wounds to their good names that an additional finding of guilt may have only a

						 Throughout the parole revocation proceedings, it was alleged that petitioner violated three parole conditions:  Parole Condition #1, because he allegedly was guilty of rape; Parole Condition #6, because he allegedly used or possessed crack cocaine; and Parole Condition #7, because he allegedly used or possessed a dangerous weapon (i.e., the screwdriver allegedly used during the rape).  App. 6064 (alleging violations of Conditions #1, #6, and #7); id., at 7276 (same); id., at 112114 (alleging violations of Conditions #1 and #6).  Thus, when the parole revocation board declared, after careful consideration of evidence presented, that petitioner violated Parole Conditions #1, #6, and #7, id., at 5556, it found that petitioner was guilty of forcible rape.  See also Brief for Respondents 1 (Spencer violated condition #1 by committing the crime of rape).  In addition, even apart from the rape finding, it is undisputed that the board found that petitioner used or possessed drugs, and that he used or possessed a dangerous weapon (which was only alleged to have been used during the rape).  App. 5556.

				Given the serious character of a finding that petitioner is guilty of forcible rape, that question must be answered affirmatively.  It may well be true that many prisoners have already caused so many self-inflicted wounds to their good names that an additional finding of guilt may have only a

				</em>
				 impact on their reputations.  I do not believe, however, that one can say that about a finding that an individual has committed a serious felony.

						 Throughout the parole revocation proceedings, it was alleged that petitioner violated three parole conditions:  Parole Condition #1, because he allegedly was guilty of rape; Parole Condition #6, because he allegedly used or possessed crack cocaine; and Parole Condition #7, because he allegedly used or possessed a dangerous weapon (i.e., the screwdriver allegedly used during the rape).  App. 6064 (alleging violations of Conditions #1, #6, and #7); id., at 7276 (same); id., at 112114 (alleging violations of Conditions #1 and #6).  Thus, when the parole revocation board declared, after careful consideration of evidence presented, that petitioner violated Parole Conditions #1, #6, and #7, id., at 5556, it found that petitioner was guilty of forcible rape.  See also Brief for Respondents 1 (Spencer violated condition #1 by committing the crime of rape).  In addition, even apart from the rape finding, it is undisputed that the board found that petitioner used or possessed drugs, and that he used or possessed a dangerous weapon (which was only alleged to have been used during the rape).  App. 5556.

Eldredge, Law of Defamation §53, pp. 293294 (1978) (There is no doubt about the historical fact that the interest in ones good name was considered an important interest requiring legal protection more than a thousand years ago; and that so far as Anglo-Saxon history is concerned this interest became a legally protected interest comparatively soon after the interest in bodily integrity was given legal protection).

						There are compelling reasons for a court to consider petitioners challenge to the parole boards findings sooner rather than later.  As we stated in a related context:


The question of the validity of a criminal conviction can arise in many contexts, and the sooner the issue is fully litigated the better for all concerned.  It is always preferable to litigate a matter when it is directly and principally in dispute, rather than in a proceeding where it is collateral to the central controversy.  Moreover, litigation is better conducted when the dispute is fresh and additional facts may, if necessary, be taken without a substantial risk that witnesses will die or memories fade.  And it is far better to eliminate the source of a potential legal disability than to require the citizen to suffer the possibly unjustified consequences of the disability itself for an indefinite period of time before he can secure adjudication of the States right to impose it on the basis of some past action.  Sibron v. New York, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/392/40" class="subref" title="subref">392 U. S. 40</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">56</a>57 (1968)
 (citation omitted).
I also believe that, on the facts of this case, there are sufficient tangible consequences to the parole boards findings so as to defeat a claim of mootness.

				An official determination that a person has committed a crime may cause two different kinds of injury.  It may result in tangible harms such as imprisonment, loss of the right to vote or to bear arms, and the risk of greater punishment if another crime is committed.

				  Assuming, as the Court does, that he had standing to bring that challenge while he remained in prison, the mootness question, as framed by the Court, is whether he continues to have a personal stake in the outcome of the lawsuit that is likely to be redressed by a favorable decision.

						There are compelling reasons for a court to consider petitioners challenge to the parole boards findings sooner rather than later.  As we stated in a related context:


The question of the validity of a criminal conviction can arise in many contexts, and the sooner the issue is fully litigated the better for all concerned.  It is always preferable to litigate a matter when it is directly and principally in dispute, rather than in a proceeding where it is collateral to the central controversy.  Moreover, litigation is better conducted when the dispute is fresh and additional facts may, if necessary, be taken without a substantial risk that witnesses will die or memories fade.  And it is far better to eliminate the source of a potential legal disability than to require the citizen to suffer the possibly unjustified consequences of the disability itself for an indefinite period of time before he can secure adjudication of the States right to impose it on the basis of some past action.  Sibron v. New York,

I also believe that, on the facts of this case, there are sufficient tangible consequences to the parole boards findings so as to defeat a claim of mootness.

				An official determination that a person has committed a crime may cause two different kinds of injury.  It may result in tangible harms such as imprisonment, loss of the right to vote or to bear arms, and the risk of greater punishment if another crime is committed.  It may also severely injure the persons reputation and good name.

				  Assuming, as the Court does, that he had standing to bring that challenge while he remained in prison, the mootness question, as framed by the Court, is whether he continues to have a personal stake in the outcome of the lawsuit that is likely to be redressed by a favorable decision.

				Given the serious character of a finding that petitioner is guilty of forcible rape, that question must be answered affirmatively.  It may well be true that many prisoners have already caused so many self-inflicted wounds to their good names that an additional finding of guilt may have only a 
				<em>
					de minimis
				</em>
				 impact on their reputations.  I do not believe, however, that one can say that about a finding that an individual has committed a serious felony.

						 Throughout the parole revocation proceedings, it was alleged that petitioner violated three parole conditions:  Parole Condition #1, because he allegedly was guilty of rape; Parole Condition #6, because he allegedly used or possessed crack cocaine; and Parole Condition #7, because he allegedly used or possessed a dangerous weapon (i.e., the screwdriver allegedly used during the rape).  App. 6064 (alleging violations of Conditions #1, #6, and #7); id., at 7276 (same); id., at 112114 (alleging violations of Conditions #1 and #6).  Thus, when the parole revocation board declared, after careful consideration of evidence presented, that petitioner violated Parole Conditions #1, #6, and #7, id., at 5556, it found that petitioner was guilty of forcible rape.  See also Brief for Respondents 1 (Spencer violated condition #1 by committing the crime of rape).  In addition, even apart from the rape finding, it is undisputed that the board found that petitioner used or possessed drugs, and that he used or possessed a dangerous weapon (which was only alleged to have been used during the rape).  App. 5556.

:  Have the appellants alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions?  This is the gist of the question of standing.

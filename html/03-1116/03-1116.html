				Michigan and New York regulate the sale and importation of wine through three-tier systems requiring separate licenses for producers, wholesalers, and retailers.  These schemes allow in-state, but not out-of-state, wineries to make direct sales to consumers.  This differential treatment explicitly discriminates against interstate commerce by limiting the emerging and significant direct-sale business.  Influenced by an increasing number of small wineries and a decreasing number of wine wholesalers, direct sales have grown because small wineries may not produce enough wine or have sufficient consumer demand for their wine to make it economical for wholesalers to carry their products.  In Nos. 031116 and 031120, Michigan residents, joined by an intervening out-of-state winery, sued Michigan officials, claiming that the States laws violate the Commerce Clause.  The State and an intervening in-state wholesalers association responded that the direct-shipment ban was a valid exercise of Michigans power under the Twenty-first Amendment.  The District Court sustained the scheme, but the Sixth Circuit reversed, rejecting the argument that the Twenty-first Amendment immunizes state liquor laws from Commerce Clause strictures and holding that there was no showing that the State could not meet its proffered policy objectives through nondiscriminatory means.  In No. 031274, out-of-state wineries and their New York customers filed suit against state officials, seeking, 
				<em>
					inter alia,
				</em>
				 a declaration that the States direct-shipment laws violate the Commerce Clause.  State liquor wholesalers and retailers representatives intervened in support of the State.  The District Court granted the plaintiffs summary judgment, but the Second Circuit reversed, holding that New Yorks laws fell within the ambit of its powers under the Twenty-first Amendment.  Here, respondents in the Michigan cases and petitioners in the New York case are referred to as the wineries, while the opposing parties are referred to as the States.
			</p>
        <p class="SYLCTE">
            <em>
					Held:
				</em>
				 Both States laws discriminate against interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause, and that discrimination is neither authorized nor permitted by the Twenty-first Amendment.  Pp. 830.
			</p>
        <p class="SYLCTF">
				
				    
				(a) This Court has long held that, in all but the narrowest circumstances, state laws violate the Commerce Clause if they mandate differential treatment of in-state and out-of-state economic interests that benefits the former and burdens the latter.  
				<em>
					Oregon Waste Systems, Inc.

            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/511/93" class="subref" title="subref">511 U. S. 93</a>.  Laws such as those at issue contradict the principles underlying this rule by depriving citizens of their right to have access to other States markets on equal terms.  The Michigan systems discriminatory character is obvious.  It allows in-state wineries to ship directly to consumers, subject only to a licensing requirement, but out-of-state wineries, even if licensed, must go through a wholesaler and retailer.  The resulting price differential, plus the possible inability to secure a wholesaler for small shipments, can effectively bar small wineries from Michigans market.  New Yorks scheme also grants in-state wineries access to state consumers on preferential terms.  It allows in-state wineries to ship directly to consumers, but requires an out-of-state winery to open a New York branch office and warehouse, which drives up its costs.  Out-of-state wineries are also ineligible for a farm winery license, which provides the most direct means of shipping to New York consumers.  Pp. 812.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				(b) Section 2 of the Twenty-first Amendment does not allow States to regulate direct shipment of wine on terms that discriminate in favor of in-state producers.  The States position is inconsistent with this Courts precedents and the Amendments history.  Pp. 1226.

				 v. 
				<em>

            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/125/465" class="subref" title="subref">125 U. S. 465</a>.  While States could ban domestic liquor production,

				<em>

            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/123/623" class="subref" title="subref">123 U. S. 623</a>, such laws were ineffective because they could not regulate imported liquor in its original package,

            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/135/100" class="subref" title="subref">135 U. S. 100</a>.  To resolve this matter, Congress passed the Wilson Act, which empowered the States to regulate imported liquor on the same terms as domestic liquor.  After this Court narrowly construed the Act to permit regulation of the resale of imported liquor, not its direct shipment to consumers,

				 v. 
				<em>
					Iowa,

            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/170/412" class="subref" title="subref">170 U. S. 412</a>, Congress passed the Webb-Kenyon Act to close the direct-shipment loophole, see 
				<em>
					Clark Distilling Co.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Western Maryland R. Co.,

				<em>
					  
				</em>
				The States argue that the Webb-Kenyon Act went further, removing any barrier to discriminatory state liquor regulations, but that reading conflicts with 
				<em>
					Clark Distilling
				</em>
				s description of the Webb-Kenyon Acts purpose
				<em>
					,
				</em>
				 which was simply to extend the Wilson Act.  Nor does the statutes text compel a different response.  At the very least, it expresses no clear congressional intent to depart from the principle disfavoring discrimination against out-of-state goods.  Last, and most importantly, the Webb-Kenyon Act did not purport to repeal the Wilson Act, which expressly precludes state discrimination.  The Wilson Act reaffirmed, and the Webb-Kenyon Act did not displace, the Courts Commerce Clause cases striking down state laws that discriminated against out-of-state liquor.  States were required to regulate domestic and imported liquor on equal terms.  Pp. 1221.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				
				    
				(2) A brief respite from these legal battles brought on by the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxviii" class="subref" title="subref">Eighteenth Amendment</a>s ratification ended with the Twenty-first Amendment.  The States contend that §2 of the Twenty-first Amendment transfers to States the authority to discriminate against out-of-state goods, but the pre-Amendment history recited here provides strong support for the view that §2 only restored to the States the powers they had under the Wilson and Webb-Kenyon Acts.  The Twenty-first Amendments aim was to allow States to maintain an effective and uniform system for controlling liquor by regulating its transportation, importation, and use.  It did not give States the authority to pass nonuniform laws in order to discriminate against out-of-state goods, a privilege they never enjoyed.  Cases decided soon after the Twenty-first Amendments ratification did not take account of the underlying history and were inconsistent with this view, 
				<em>
					e.g., State Bd. of Equalization of Cal.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Youngs Market Co.,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/299/59" class="subref" title="subref">299 U. S. 59</a>, but the Courts reluctance to consider this history did not reflect a consensus that such evidence was irrelevant or that prior history was unsupportive of the principle that the Amendment did not authorize discrimination against out-of-state liquor.  More recent cases confirm that the Twenty-first Amendment does not supersede other provisions of the Constitution and, in particular, does not displace the rule that States may not give a discriminatory preference to their own producers.  Pp. 2123.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				
				    
				(3) This Court has held, in the modern §2 cases, (1) that state laws violating other provisions of the Constitution are not saved by the Twenty-first Amendment, 
				<em>
					e.g., 44 Liquormart, Inc.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Rhode Island,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/517/484" class="subref" title="subref">517 U. S. 484</a>, (2) that §2 does not abrogate Congress Commerce Clause powers with regard to liquor, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Capital Cities Cable, Inc.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Crisp,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/467/691" class="subref" title="subref">467 U. S. 691</a>, and (3) as most relevant here, that state regulation of alcohol is limited by the Commerce Clauses nondiscrimination principle, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Bacchus Imports, Ltd.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Dias,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/468/263" class="subref" title="subref">468 U. S. 263</a>.  
				<em>
					Bacchus,
				</em>
				 which dealt with a Hawaii excise tax exempting some in-state alcoholic beverages, provides a particularly telling example of this last proposition, and this Court declines the States suggestion to overrule or limit that case.  The decision to invalidate the instant direct-shipment laws also does not call into question their three-tier systems constitutionality, see 
				<em>
					North Dakota
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					United States,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/495/423" class="subref" title="subref">495 U. S. 423</a>.  State policies are protected under the Twenty-first Amendment when they treat liquor produced out of state the same as its domestic equivalent.  In contrast, the instant cases involve straightforward attempts to discriminate in favor of local producers.  Pp. 2326.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				(c) Concluding that the States direct-shipment laws are not authorized by the Twenty-first Amendment does not end the inquiry, for this Court must still consider whether either States regime advances a legitimate local purpose that cannot be adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives, 
				<em>
					New Energy Co. of Ind.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Limbach,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/486/269" class="subref" title="subref">486 U. S. 269</a>.  The States provide little evidence for their claim that purchasing wine over the Internet by minors is a problem.  The 26 States now permitting direct shipments report no such problem, and the States can minimize any risk with less restrictive steps, such as requiring an adult signature on delivery.  The States tax evasion justification is also insufficient.  Increased direct shipment, whether in or out of state, brings the potential for tax evasion.  However, this argument is a diversion with regard to Michigan, which does not rely on in-state wholesalers to collect taxes on out-of-state wines.  New Yorks tax collection objectives can be achieved without discriminating against interstate commerce, 
				<em>
					e.g., 
				</em>
				by requiring a permit as a condition of direct shipping, which is what it does for in-state wineries.  Both States also benefit from federal laws that supply incentives for wineries to comply with state regulations.  Other rationalesfacilitating orderly market conditions, protecting public health and safety, and ensuring regulatory accountabilitycan also be achieved through the alternative of an evenhanded licensing requirement.  Pp. 2629.

				These consolidated cases present challenges to state laws regulating the sale of wine from out-of-state wineries to consumers in Michigan and New York.  The details and mechanics of the two regulatory schemes differ, but the object and effect of the laws are the same: to allow in-state wineries to sell wine directly to consumers in that State but to prohibit out-of-state wineries from doing so, or, at the least, to make direct sales impractical from an economic standpoint.  It is evident that the object and design of the Michigan and New York statutes is to grant in-state wineries a competitive advantage over wineries located beyond the States borders.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We hold that the laws in both States discriminate against interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause, Art. I, §8, cl. 3, and that the discrimination is neither authorized nor permitted by the Twenty-first Amendment.  Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which invalidated the Michigan laws; and we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which upheld the New York laws.

				Like many other States, Michigan and New York regulate the sale and importation of alcoholic beverages, including wine, through a three-tier distribution system.  Separate licenses are required for producers, wholesalers, and retailers.  See FTC, Possible Anticompetitive Barriers to E-Commerce: Wine 57 (July 2003) (hereinafter FTC Report), available at http://www.ftc.gov/os/2003/07/ winereport2.pdf (all Internet materials as visited May 11, 2005, and available in Clerk of Courts case file).  The three-tier scheme is preserved by a complex set of overlapping state and federal regulations.  For example, both state and federal laws limit vertical integration between tiers.

As relevant to todays cases, though, the three-tier system is, in broad terms and with refinements to be discussed, mandated by Michigan and New York only for sales from out-of-state wineries.  In-state wineries, by contrast, can obtain a license for direct sales to consumers.  The differential treatment between in-state and out-of-state wineries constitutes explicit discrimination against interstate commerce.

				This discrimination substantially limits the direct sale of wine to consumers, an otherwise emerging and significant business.  FTC Report 7.  From 1994 to 1999, consumer spending on direct wine shipments doubled, reaching $500 million per year, or three percent of all wine sales.

				., at 5.  The expansion has been influenced by several related trends.  First, the number of small wineries in the United States has significantly increased.  By some estimates there are over 3,000 wineries in the country, WineAmerica, The National Association of American Wineries, Wine Facts 2004, http://www.americanwineries.org/newsroom/winefacts04.htm, more than three times the number 30 years ago, FTC Report 6.  At the same time, the wholesale market has consolidated.  Between 1984 and 2002, the number of licensed wholesalers dropped from 1,600 to 600.

The increasing winery-to-wholesaler ratio means that many small wineries do not produce enough wine or have sufficient consumer demand for their wine to make it economical for wholesalers to carry their products.  FTC Report 6.  This has led many small wineries to rely on direct shipping to reach new markets.  Technological improvements, in particular the ability of wineries to sell wine over the Internet, have helped make direct shipments an attractive sales channel.

				The wine producers in the cases before us are small wineries that rely on direct consumer sales as an important part of their businesses.  Domaine Alfred, one of the plaintiffs in the Michigan suit, is a small winery located in San Luis Obispo, California.  It produces 3,000 cases of wine per year.  Domaine Alfred has received requests for its wine from Michigan consumers but cannot fill the orders because of the States direct-shipment ban.  Even if the winery could find a Michigan wholesaler to distribute its wine, the wholesalers markup would render shipment through the three-tier system economically infeasible.

				Similarly, Juanita Swedenburg and David Lucas, two of the plaintiffs in the New York suit, operate small wineries in Virginia (the Swedenburg Estate Vineyard) and California (the Lucas Winery).  Some of their customers are tourists, from other States, who purchase wine while visiting the wineries.  If these customers wish to obtain Swedenburg or Lucas wines after they return home, they will be unable to do so if they reside in a State with restrictive direct-shipment laws.  For example, Swedenburg and Lucas are unable to fill orders from New York, the Nations second-largest wine market, because of the limits that State imposes on direct wine shipments.

				We first address the background of the suit challenging the Michigan direct-shipment law.  Most alcoholic beverages in Michigan are distributed through the States three-tier system.  Producers or distillers of alcoholic beverages, whether located in state or out of state, generally may sell only to licensed in-state wholesalers.  Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. §§436.1109(1), 436.1305, 436.1403, 436.1607(1) (West 2000); Mich. Admin. Code Rules 436.1705 (1990), 436.1719 (2000).  Wholesalers, in turn, may sell only to in-state retailers.  Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. §§436.1113(7), 436.1607(1) (West 2001).  Licensed retailers are the final link in the chain, selling alcoholic beverages to consumers at retail locations and, subject to certain restrictions, through home delivery.  §§436.1111(5), 436.1203(2)(4).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Under Michigan law, wine producers, as a general matter, must distribute their wine through wholesalers.  There is, however, an exception for Michigans approximately 40 in-state wineries, which are eligible for wine maker licenses that allow direct shipment to in-state consumers.  §436.1113(9) (West 2001); §§436.1537(2)(3) (West Supp. 2004); Mich. Admin. Code Rule 436.1011(7)(b) (2003).  The cost of the license varies with the size of the winery.  For a small winery, the license is $25.  Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. §436.1525(1)(d) (West Supp. 2004).  Out-of-state wineries can apply for a $300 outside seller of wine license, but this license only allows them to sell to in-state wholesalers.  §§436.1109(9) (West 2001), 436.1525(1)(e) (West Supp. 2004); Mich. Admin. Code Rule 436.1719(5) (2000).

				Some Michigan residents brought suit against various state officials in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.  Domaine Alfred, the San Luis Obispo winery, joined in the suit.  The plaintiffs contended that Michigans direct-shipment laws discriminated against interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause.  The trade association Michigan Beer &amp; Wine Wholesalers intervened as a defendant.  Both the State and the wholesalers argued that the ban on direct shipment from out-of-state wineries is a valid exercise of Michigans power under §2 of the Twenty-first Amendment.

				New Yorks licensing scheme is somewhat different.  It channels most wine sales through the three-tier system, but it too makes exceptions for in-state wineries.  As in Michigan, the result is to allow local wineries to make direct sales to consumers in New York on terms not available to out-of-state wineries.  Wineries that produce wine only from New York grapes can apply for a license that allows direct shipment to in-state consumers.  N. Y. Alco. Bev. Cont. Law Ann. §76a(3) (West Supp. 2005) (hereinafter N. Y. ABC Law).  These licensees are authorized to deliver the wines of other wineries as well, §76a(6)(a), but only if the wine is made from grapes at least seventy-five percent the volume of which were grown in New York state,  §3(20a).  An out-of-state winery may ship directly to New York consumers only if it becomes a licensed New York winery, which requires the establishment of a branch factory, office or storeroom within the state of New York.  §3(37).

				Laws of the type at issue in the instant cases contradict these principles.  They deprive citizens of their right to have access to the markets of other States on equal terms.  The perceived necessity for reciprocal sale privileges risks generating the trade rivalries and animosities, the alliances and exclusivity, that the Constitution and, in particular, the Commerce Clause were designed to avoid.  State laws that protect local wineries have led to the enactment of statutes under which some States condition the right of out-of-state wineries to make direct wine sales to in-state consumers on a reciprocal right in the shipping State.  California, for example, passed a reciprocity law in 1986, retreating from the States previous regime that allowed unfettered direct shipments from out-of-state wineries.  Riekhof &amp; Sykuta, 27 Regulation, No. 3, at 30.  Prior to 1986, all but three States prohibited direct-shipments of wine.  The obvious aim of the California statute was to open the interstate direct-shipping market for the States many wineries.  
				<em>
					Ibid

				.  The current patchwork of lawswith some States banning direct shipments altogether, others doing so only for out-of-state wines, and still others requiring reciprocityis essentially the product of an ongoing, low-level trade war.  Allowing States to discriminate against out-of-state wine invite[s] a multiplication of preferential trade areas destructive of the very purpose of the Commerce Clause.

				The discriminatory character of the Michigan system is obvious.  Michigan allows in-state wineries to ship directly to consumers, subject only to a licensing requirement.  Out-of-state wineries, whether licensed or not, face a complete ban on direct shipment.  The differential treatment requires all out-of-state wine, but not all in-state wine, to pass through an in-state wholesaler and retailer before reaching consumers.  These two extra layers of overhead increase the cost of out-of-state wines to Michigan consumers.  The cost differential, and in some cases the inability to secure a wholesaler for small shipments, can effectively bar small wineries from the Michigan market.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The New York regulatory scheme differs from Michigans in that it does not ban direct shipments altogether.  Out-of-state wineries are instead required to establish a distribution operation in New York in order to gain the privilege of direct shipment.  N. Y. ABC Law §§3(37), 96.  This, though, is just an indirect way of subjecting out-of-state wineries, but not local ones, to the three-tier system.  New York and those allied with its interests defend the scheme by arguing that an out-of-state winery has the same access to the States consumers as in-state wineries: All wine must be sold through a licensee fully accountable to New York; it just so happens that in order to become a licensee, a winery must have a physical presence in the State.  There is some confusion over the precise steps out-of-state wineries must take to gain access to the New York market, in part because no winery has run the States regulatory gauntlet.  New Yorks argument, in any event, is unconvincing.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The New York scheme grants in-state wineries access to the States consumers on preferential terms.  The suggestion of a limited exception for direct shipment from out-of-state wineries does nothing to eliminate the discriminatory nature of New Yorks regulations.  In-state producers, with the applicable licenses, can ship directly to consumers from their wineries.  §§76a(3), 76(4) (West Supp. 2005), and §77(2) (West 2000).  Out-of-state wineries must open a branch office and warehouse in New York, additional steps that drive up the cost of their wine.  §§3(37), 96 (West Supp. 2005).  See also App. in No. 031274, pp. 159160 (Affidavit of Thomas G. McKeon, General Counsel to the New York State Liquor Authority).  For most wineries, the expense of establishing a bricks-and-mortar distribution operation in 1 State, let alone all 50, is prohibitive.  It comes as no surprise that not a single out-of-state winery has availed itself of New Yorks direct-shipping privilege.  We have viewed with particular suspicion state statutes requiring business operations to be performed in the home State that could more efficiently be performed elsewhere.

				In addition to its restrictive in-state presence requirement, New York discriminates against out-of-state wineries in other ways.  Out-of-state wineries that establish the requisite branch office and warehouse in New York are still ineligible for a farm winery license, the license that provides the most direct means of shipping to New York consumers.  N. Y. ABC Law §76a(5) (No licensed farm winery shall manufacture or sell any wine not produced exclusively from grapes or other fruits or agricultural products grown or produced in New York state).  Out-of-state wineries may apply only for a commercial winery license.  See §§3(37), 76.  Unlike farm wineries, however, commercial wineries must obtain a separate certificate from the state liquor authority authorizing direct shipments to consumers, §77(2) (West 2000); and, of course, for out-of-state wineries there is the additional requirement of maintaining a distribution operation in New York.  New York law also allows in-state wineries without direct-shipping licenses to distribute their wine through other wineries that have the applicable licenses.  §76(5) (West Supp. 2005).  This is another privilege not afforded out-of-state wineries.

				,
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				the power to ship merchandise from one State into another carries with it, as an incident, the right in the receiver of the goods to sell them in the original packages, any state regulation to the contrary notwithstanding; that is to say, that the goods received by Interstate Commerce remain under the shelter of the Interstate Commerce clause of the Constitution, until by a sale in the original package they have been commingled with the general mass of property in the state.  170 U.

				That all fermented, distilled, or other intoxicating liquors or liquids transported into any State or Territory or remaining therein for use, consumption, sale or storage therein, shall upon arrival in such State or Territory be subject to the operation and effect of the laws of such State or Territory enacted in the exercise of its police powers, to the same extent and in the same manner as though such liquids or liquors had been produced in such State or Territory, and shall not be exempt therefrom by reason of being introduced therein in original packages or otherwise.  Ch. 728,

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
By its own terms, the Wilson Act did not allow States to discriminate against out-of-state liquor; rather, it allowed States to regulate imported liquor only to the same extent and in the same manner as domestic liquor.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court confirmed this interpretation in 
				<em>
					Scott, supra.
				</em>
            <em>
					Scott 
				</em>
				involved a constitutional challenge to South Carolinas dispensary law, 1895 S. C. Acts p. 721, which required that all liquor sales be channeled through the state liquor commissioner.  165 U. S., at 92.  The statute discriminated against out-of-state manufacturers in two primary ways.  First, §15 required the commissioner to purchase his supplies from the brewers and distillers in this State when their product reaches the standard required by this Act: Provided, Such supplies can be purchased as cheaply from such brewers and distillers in this State as elsewhere.  1895 S. C. Acts p. 732.  Second, §23 of the statute limited the States markup on locally produced wines to a 10-percent profit but provided no such limitation of charge in the case of imported wines.  165 U. S., at 93.  Based on these discriminatory provisions, the Court rejected the argument that the South Carolina dispensary law was authorized by the Wilson Act.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 100.  It explained that the Wilson Act was not intended to confer upon any State the power to discriminate injuriously against the products of other States in articles whose manufacture and use are not forbidden, and which are therefore the subjects of legitimate commerce.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  To the contrary, the Court said, the Wilson Act mandated equality or uniformity of treatment under state laws, 
				<em>
					ibid.,
				</em>
				 and did not allow South Carolina to provide an unjust preference to its products as against similar products of the other States,
				<em>
					 id., 
				</em>
				at 101.  The dissent also understood the validity of the dispensary law to turn in large part on §§15 and 23, but argued that even if these provisions were discriminatory the correct remedy was to sever them from the rest of the Act.

				Although the Wilson Act increased the States authority to police liquor imports, it did not solve all their problems.  In

				</em>
				two cases decided soon after

				as embodying two distinct holdings: First, the South Carolina dispensary law amount[ed] to an unjust discrimination against liquors, the products of other States.  170 U. S.
				<em>
					, 
				</em>
				at 442.  This aspect of the 
				<em>
					Scott 
				</em>
				holding, which confirmed the Wilson Acts nondiscrimination principle, was based on particular provisions of the law by which the discrimination was brought about.  170 U. S., at 442.  Second, in so far as the law then in question forbade the sending … of intoxicating liquors for the use of the person to whom it was shipped, the statute was repugnant to [the Commerce Clause].

            <em>

The Act, the Court said, authorized States to regulate only the resale of imported liquor, not direct shipment to consumers for personal use.  170 U. S., at 421.  Without a clear indication from Congress that it intended to allow States to ban such shipments, the 
				<em>
					Rhodes 
				</em>
				Court read the words upon arrival in the Wilson Act as authorizing the power of the State to attach to an interstate commerce shipment, only after its arrival at the point of destination and delivery there to the consignee.

				intact.

				After considering a series of bills in response to the Courts reading of the Wilson Act, Congress responded to the direct-shipment loophole in 1913 by enacting the Webb-Kenyon Act, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">37</a>Stat.
699, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/27/122.html" class="subref" title="subref">27 U. S. C. §122</a>.  See Rogers, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 363370.  The Act, entitled An Act Divesting intoxicating liquors of their interstate character in certain cases, provides:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				That the shipment or transportation … of any spirituous, vinous, malted, fermented, or other intoxicating liquor of any kind, from one State … into any other State … which said spirituous, vinous, malted, fermented, or other intoxicating liquor is intended, by any person interested therein, to be received, possessed, sold, or in any manner used, either in the original package or otherwise, in violation of any law of such State … is hereby prohibited.  37 Stat.
				<em>
					,
				</em>
				 at 699700.

The constitutionality of the Webb-Kenyon Act itself was in doubt.  
				<em>
					Vance 
				</em>
				and 
				<em>
					Rhodes 
				</em>
				implied that any law authorizing the States to regulate direct shipments for personal use would be an unlawful delegation of Congress Commerce Clause powers.  Indeed, President Taft, acting on the advice of Attorney General Wickersham, vetoed the Act for this specific reason.  S. Rep. No. 103, 63 Cong., 1st Sess., 36 (1913); 30 Op. Atty. Gen. 88 (1913).

, a divided Court upheld the Webb-Kenyon Act against a constitutional challenge.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court construed the Act to close the direct-shipment gap left open by the Wilson Act.  States were now empowered to forbid shipments of alcohol to consumers for personal use, provided that the States treated in-state and out-of-state liquor on the same terms.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 321322 (noting that the West Virginia law at issue in 
				<em>
					Clark Distilling 
				</em>
				forbade the shipment into or transportation of liquor in the State whether from inside or out).  The Court understood that the Webb-Kenyon Act was enacted simply to extend that which was done by the Wilson Act.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 324.  The Acts purpose was to prevent the immunity characteristic of interstate commerce from being used to permit the receipt of liquor through such commerce in States contrary to their laws, and thus in effect afford a means by subterfuge and indirection to set such laws at naught.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  The Court thus recognized that the Act was an attempt to eliminate the regulatory advantage, 
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				 its immunity characteristic, afforded imported liquor under 
				<em>

				 and 
				<em>

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Michigan and New York now argue the Webb-Kenyon Act went even further and removed any barrier to discriminatory state liquor regulations.  We do not agree.  First, this reading of the Webb-Kenyon Act conflicts with that given the statute in

				The statutes text does not compel a different result.  The Webb-Kenyon Act readily can be construed as forbidding shipment or transportation only where it runs afoul of the States generally applicable laws governing receipt, possession, sale, or use.  Cf. 
				<em>

				Last, and most importantly, the Webb-Kenyon Act did not purport to repeal the Wilson Act, which expressly precludes States from discriminating.

				The aim of the Twenty-first Amendment was to allow States to maintain an effective and uniform system for controlling liquor by regulating its transportation, importation, and use.

            <em>

				 provides a particularly telling example of this proposition.  At issue was an excise tax enacted by Hawaii that exempted certain alcoholic beverages produced in that State.  The Court rejected the argument that Hawaiis discrimination against out-of-state liquor was authorized by the Twenty-first Amendment.  468 U. S.,

				at 274276.  The central purpose of the [Amendment] was not to empower States to favor local liquor industries by erecting barriers to competition.  
				<em>

				, at 276.  Despite attempts to distinguish it in the instant cases, 
				<em>
					Bacchus
				</em>
				 forecloses any contention that §2 of the Twenty-first Amendment immunizes discriminatory direct-shipment laws from Commerce Clause scrutiny.  See also 
				<em>
					Brown-Forman, supra

				, at 576 (invalidating a New York price affirmation statute that required producers to limit the price of liquor based on the lowest price they offered out of state);

				Recognizing that

					Bacchus

				<em>

				</em>
				would also undermine 
				<em>

				The States argue that any decision invalidating their direct-shipment laws would call into question the constitutionality of the three-tier system.  This does not follow from our holding.  The Twenty-first Amendment grants the States virtually complete control over whether to permit importation or sale of liquor and how to structure the liquor distribution system.  
				<em>
					Midcal, supra

				, at 110.  A State which chooses to ban the sale and consumption of alcohol altogether could bar its importation; and, as our history shows, it would have to do so to make its laws effective.  States may also assume direct control of liquor distribution through state-run outlets or funnel sales through the three-tier system.  We have previously recognized that the three-tier system itself is unquestionably legitimate.

State policies are protected under the Twenty-first Amendment when they treat liquor produced out of state the same as its domestic equivalent.  The instant cases, in contrast, involve straightforward attempts to discriminate in favor of local producers.  The discrimination is contrary to the Commerce Clause and is not saved by the Twenty-first Amendment.

        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				Our determination that the Michigan and New York direct-shipment laws are not authorized by the Twenty-first Amendment does not end the inquiry.  We still must consider whether either State regime advances a legitimate local purpose that cannot be adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives.  
				<em>
					New Energy Co. of Ind.
				</em>
				, 486 U. S., at 278.  The States offer two primary justifications for restricting direct shipments from out-of-state wineries: keeping alcohol out of the hands of minors and facilitating tax collection.  We consider each in turn.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The States, aided by several 
				<em>
					amici,
				</em>
				 claim that allowing direct shipment from out-of-state wineries undermines their ability to police underage drinking.  Minors, the States argue, have easy access to credit cards and the Internet and are likely to take advantage of direct wine shipments as a means of obtaining alcohol illegally.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The States provide little evidence that the purchase of wine over the Internet by minors is a problem.  Indeed, there is some evidence to the contrary.  A recent study by the staff of the FTC found that the 26 States currently allowing direct shipments report no problems with minors increased access to wine.  FTC Report 34.  This is not surprising for several reasons.  First, minors are less likely to consume wine, as opposed to beer, wine coolers, and hard liquor.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 12.  Second, minors who decide to disobey the law have more direct means of doing so.  Third, direct shipping is an imperfect avenue of obtaining alcohol for minors who, in the words of the past president of the National Conference of State Liquor Administrators,  want instant gratification.   
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 33, and n. 137 (explaining why minors rarely buy alcohol via the mail or the Internet).  Without concrete evidence that direct shipping of wine is likely to increase alcohol consumption by minors, we are left with the States unsupported assertions.  Under our precedents, which require the clearest showing to justify discriminatory state regulation, 
				<em>
					C &amp; A Carbone, Inc.,
				</em>
				 511 U. S., at 393, this is not enough.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Even were we to credit the States largely unsupported claim that direct shipping of wine increases the risk of underage drinking, this would not justify regulations limiting only out-of-state direct shipments.  As the wineries point out, minors are just as likely to order wine from in-state producers as from out-of-state ones.  Michigan, for example, already allows its licensed retailers (over 7,000 of them) to deliver alcohol directly to consumers.  Michigan counters that it has greater regulatory control over in-state producers than over out-of-state wineries.  This does not justify Michigans discriminatory ban on direct shipping.  Out-of-state wineries face the loss of state and federal licenses if they fail to comply with state law.  This provides strong incentives not to sell alcohol to minors.  In addition, the States can take less restrictive steps to minimize the risk that minors will order wine by mail.  For example, the Model Direct Shipping Bill developed by the National Conference of State Legislatures requires an adult signature on delivery and a label so instructing on each package.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The States tax-collection justification is also insufficient.  Increased direct shipping, whether originating in state or out of state, brings with it the potential for tax evasion.  With regard to Michigan, however, the tax-collection argument is a diversion.  That is because Michigan, unlike many other States, does not rely on wholesalers to collect taxes on wines imported from out-of-state.  Instead, Michigan collects taxes directly from out-of-state wineries on all wine shipped to in-state wholesalers.  Mich. Admin. Code Rule 436.1725(2) (1989) (Each outside seller of wine shall submit … a wine tax report of all wine sold, delivered, or imported into this state during the preceding calendar month).  If licensing and self-reporting provide adequate safeguards for wine distributed through the three-tier system, there is no reason to believe they will not suffice for direct shipments.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				New York and its supporting parties also advance a tax-collection justification for the States direct-shipment laws.  While their concerns are not wholly illusory, their regulatory objectives can be achieved without discriminating against interstate commerce.  In particular, New York could protect itself against lost tax revenue by requiring a permit as a condition of direct shipping.  This is the approach taken by New York for in-state wineries.  The State offers no reason to believe the system would prove ineffective for out-of-state wineries.  Licensees could be required to submit regular sales reports and to remit taxes.  Indeed, various States use this approach for taxing direct interstate wine shipments, 
				<em>
					e.g
				</em>
				., N. H. Rev. Stat. Ann. §178.27 (Lexis Supp. 2004), and report no problems with tax collection.  See FTC Report 3840.  This is also the procedure sanctioned by the National Conference of State Legislatures in their Model Direct Shipping Bill.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g
				</em>
				., S. C. Code Ann. §614747(C) (West Supp. 2004).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Michigan and New York benefit, furthermore, from provisions of federal law that supply incentives for wineries to comply with state regulations.  The Tax and Trade Bureau (formerly the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms) has authority to revoke a winerys federal
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				license if it violates state law.  BATF Industry Circular 963 (1997).  Without a federal license, a winery cannot operate in any State.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/27/204.html" class="subref" title="subref">27 U. S. C. §204</a>.  In addition the Twenty-first Amendment Enforcement Act gives state attorneys general the power to sue wineries in federal court to enjoin violations of state law.  §122a(b).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				These federal remedies, when combined with state licensing regimes, adequately protect States from lost tax revenue.  The States have not shown that tax evasion from out-of-state wineries poses such a unique threat that it justifies their discriminatory regimes.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Michigan and New York offer a handful of other rationales, such as facilitating orderly market conditions, protecting public health and safety, and ensuring regulatory accountability.  These objectives can also be achieved through the alternative of an evenhanded licensing requirement.  FTC Report 4041.  Finally, it should be noted that improvements in technology have eased the burden of monitoring out-of-state wineries.  Background checks can be done electronically.  Financial records and sales data can be mailed, faxed, or submitted via e-mail.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In summary, the States provide little concrete evidence for the sweeping assertion that they cannot police direct shipments by out-of-state wineries.  Our Commerce Clause cases demand more than mere speculation to support discrimination against out-of-state goods.  The burden is on the State to show that the

				States have broad power to regulate liquor under §2 of the Twenty-first Amendment.  This power, however, does not allow States to ban, or severely limit, the direct shipment of out-of-state wine while simultaneously authorizing direct shipment by in-state producers.  If a State chooses to allow direct shipment of wine, it must do so on evenhanded terms.  Without demonstrating the need for discrimination, New York and Michigan have enacted regulations that disadvantage out-of-state wine producers.  Under our Commerce Clause jurisprudence, these regulations cannot stand.

				These consolidated cases present challenges to state laws regulating the sale of wine from out-of-state wineries to consumers in Michigan and New York.  The details and mechanics of the two regulatory schemes differ, but the object and effect of the laws are the same: to allow in-state wineries to sell wine directly to consumers in that State but to prohibit out-of-state wineries from doing so, or, at the least, to make direct sales impractical from an economic standpoint.  It is evident that the object and design of the Michigan and New York statutes is to grant in-state wineries a competitive advantage over wineries located beyond the States borders.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We hold that the laws in both States discriminate against interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause, Art. I, §8, cl. 3, and that the discrimination is neither authorized nor permitted by the Twenty-first Amendment.  Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which invalidated the Michigan laws; and we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which upheld the New York laws.

				Like many other States, Michigan and New York regulate the sale and importation of alcoholic beverages, including wine, through a three-tier distribution system.  Separate licenses are required for producers, wholesalers, and retailers.  See FTC, Possible Anticompetitive Barriers to E-Commerce: Wine 57 (July 2003) (hereinafter FTC Report), available at http://www.ftc.gov/os/2003/07/ winereport2.pdf (all Internet materials as visited May 11, 2005, and available in Clerk of Courts case file).  The three-tier scheme is preserved by a complex set of overlapping state and federal regulations.  For example, both state and federal laws limit vertical integration between tiers.

As relevant to todays cases, though, the three-tier system is, in broad terms and with refinements to be discussed, mandated by Michigan and New York only for sales from out-of-state wineries.  In-state wineries, by contrast, can obtain a license for direct sales to consumers.  The differential treatment between in-state and out-of-state wineries constitutes explicit discrimination against interstate commerce.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				This discrimination substantially limits the direct sale of wine to consumers, an otherwise emerging and significant business.  FTC Report 7.  From 1994 to 1999, consumer spending on direct wine shipments doubled, reaching $500 million per year, or three percent of all wine sales.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 5.  The expansion has been influenced by several related trends.  First, the number of small wineries in the United States has significantly increased.  By some estimates there are over 3,000 wineries in the country, WineAmerica, The National Association of American Wineries, Wine Facts 2004, http://www.americanwineries.org/newsroom/winefacts04.htm, more than three times the number 30 years ago, FTC Report 6.  At the same time, the wholesale market has consolidated.  Between 1984 and 2002, the number of licensed wholesalers dropped from 1,600 to 600.  Riekhof &amp; Sykuta, Regulating Wine by Mail, 27 Regulation, No. 3, pp. 30, 31 (Fall 2004), available at http://www.cato.org/
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				pubs/regulation/regv27n3/v27n3-3.pdf.  The increasing winery-to-wholesaler ratio means that many small wineries do not produce enough wine or have sufficient consumer demand for their wine to make it economical for wholesalers to carry their products.  FTC Report 6.  This has led many small wineries to rely on direct shipping to reach new markets.  Technological improvements, in particular the ability of wineries to sell wine over the Internet, have helped make direct shipments an attractive sales channel.

				The wine producers in the cases before us are small wineries that rely on direct consumer sales as an important part of their businesses.  Domaine Alfred, one of the plaintiffs in the Michigan suit, is a small winery located in San Luis Obispo, California.  It produces 3,000 cases of wine per year.  Domaine Alfred has received requests for its wine from Michigan consumers but cannot fill the orders because of the States direct-shipment ban.  Even if the winery could find a Michigan wholesaler to distribute its wine, the wholesalers markup would render shipment through the three-tier system economically infeasible.

				Similarly, Juanita Swedenburg and David Lucas, two of the plaintiffs in the New York suit, operate small wineries in Virginia (the Swedenburg Estate Vineyard) and California (the Lucas Winery).  Some of their customers are tourists, from other States, who purchase wine while visiting the wineries.  If these customers wish to obtain Swedenburg or Lucas wines after they return home, they will be unable to do so if they reside in a State with restrictive direct-shipment laws.  For example, Swedenburg and Lucas are unable to fill orders from New York, the Nations second-largest wine market, because of the limits that State imposes on direct wine shipments.

				We first address the background of the suit challenging the Michigan direct-shipment law.  Most alcoholic beverages in Michigan are distributed through the States three-tier system.  Producers or distillers of alcoholic beverages, whether located in state or out of state, generally may sell only to licensed in-state wholesalers.  Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. §§436.1109(1), 436.1305, 436.1403, 436.1607(1) (West 2000); Mich. Admin. Code Rules 436.1705 (1990), 436.1719 (2000).  Wholesalers, in turn, may sell only to in-state retailers.  Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. §§436.1113(7), 436.1607(1) (West 2001).  Licensed retailers are the final link in the chain, selling alcoholic beverages to consumers at retail locations and, subject to certain restrictions, through home delivery.  §§436.1111(5), 436.1203(2)(4).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Under Michigan law, wine producers, as a general matter, must distribute their wine through wholesalers.  There is, however, an exception for Michigans approximately 40 in-state wineries, which are eligible for wine maker licenses that allow direct shipment to in-state consumers.  §436.1113(9) (West 2001); §§436.1537(2)(3) (West Supp. 2004); Mich. Admin. Code Rule 436.1011(7)(b) (2003).  The cost of the license varies with the size of the winery.  For a small winery, the license is $25.  Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. §436.1525(1)(d) (West Supp. 2004).  Out-of-state wineries can apply for a $300 outside seller of wine license, but this license only allows them to sell to in-state wholesalers.  §§436.1109(9) (West 2001), 436.1525(1)(e) (West Supp. 2004); Mich.

				Some Michigan residents brought suit against various state officials in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.  Domaine Alfred, the San Luis Obispo winery, joined in the suit.  The plaintiffs contended that Michigans direct-shipment laws discriminated against interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause.  The trade association Michigan Beer &amp; Wine Wholesalers intervened as a defendant.  Both the State and the wholesalers argued that the ban on direct shipment from out-of-state wineries is a valid exercise of Michigans power under §2 of the Twenty-first Amendment.

				New Yorks licensing scheme is somewhat different.  It channels most wine sales through the three-tier system, but it too makes exceptions for in-state wineries.  As in Michigan, the result is to allow local wineries to make direct sales to consumers in New York on terms not available to out-of-state wineries.  Wineries that produce wine only from New York grapes can apply for a license that allows direct shipment to in-state consumers.  N. Y. Alco. Bev. Cont. Law Ann. §76a(3) (West Supp. 2005) (hereinafter N. Y. ABC Law).  These licensees are authorized to deliver the wines of other wineries as well, §76a(6)(a), but only if the wine is made from grapes at least seventy-five percent the volume of which were grown in New York state,  §3(20a).  An out-of-state winery may ship directly to New York consumers only if it becomes a licensed New York winery, which requires the establishment of a branch factory, office or storeroom within the state of New York.  §3(37).

				Laws of the type at issue in the instant cases contradict these principles.  They deprive citizens of their right to have access to the markets of other States on equal terms.  The perceived necessity for reciprocal sale privileges risks generating the trade rivalries and animosities, the alliances and exclusivity, that the Constitution and, in particular, the Commerce Clause were designed to avoid.  State laws that protect local wineries have led to the enactment of statutes under which some States condition the right of out-of-state wineries to make direct wine sales to in-state consumers on a reciprocal right in the shipping State.  California, for example, passed a reciprocity law in 1986, retreating from the States previous regime that allowed unfettered direct shipments from out-of-state wineries.  Riekhof &amp; Sykuta, 27 Regulation, No. 3, at 30.  Prior to 1986, all but three States prohibited direct-shipments of wine.  The obvious aim of the California statute was to open the interstate direct-shipping market for the States many wineries.  
				<em>
					Ibid

				.  The current patchwork of lawswith some States banning direct shipments altogether, others doing so only for out-of-state wines, and still others requiring reciprocityis essentially the product of an ongoing, low-level trade war.

				The discriminatory character of the Michigan system is obvious.  Michigan allows in-state wineries to ship directly to consumers, subject only to a licensing requirement.  Out-of-state wineries, whether licensed or not, face a complete ban on direct shipment.  The differential treatment requires all out-of-state wine, but not all in-state wine, to pass through an in-state wholesaler and retailer before reaching consumers.  These two extra layers of overhead increase the cost of out-of-state wines to Michigan consumers.  The cost differential, and in some cases the inability to secure a wholesaler for small shipments, can effectively bar small wineries from the Michigan market.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The New York regulatory scheme differs from Michigans in that it does not ban direct shipments altogether.  Out-of-state wineries are instead required to establish a distribution operation in New York in order to gain the privilege of direct shipment.  N. Y. ABC Law §§3(37), 96.  This, though, is just an indirect way of subjecting out-of-state wineries, but not local ones, to the three-tier system.  New York and those allied with its interests defend the scheme by arguing that an out-of-state winery has the same access to the States consumers as in-state wineries: All wine must be sold through a licensee fully accountable to New York; it just so happens that in order to become a licensee, a winery must have a physical presence in the State.  There is some confusion over the precise steps out-of-state wineries must take to gain access to the New York market, in part because no winery has run the States regulatory gauntlet.  New Yorks argument, in any event, is unconvincing.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The New York scheme grants in-state wineries access to the States consumers on preferential terms.  The suggestion of a limited exception for direct shipment from out-of-state wineries does nothing to eliminate the discriminatory nature of New Yorks regulations.  In-state producers, with the applicable licenses, can ship directly to consumers from their wineries.  §§76a(3), 76(4) (West Supp. 2005), and §77(2) (West 2000).  Out-of-state wineries must open a branch office and warehouse in New York, additional steps that drive up the cost of their wine.  §§3(37), 96 (West Supp. 2005).  See also App. in No. 031274, pp. 159160 (Affidavit of Thomas G. McKeon, General Counsel to the New York State Liquor Authority).  For most wineries, the expense of establishing a bricks-and-mortar distribution operation in 1 State, let alone all 50, is prohibitive.  It comes as no surprise that not a single out-of-state winery has availed itself of New Yorks direct-shipping privilege.  We have viewed with particular suspicion state statutes requiring business operations to be performed in the home State that could more efficiently be performed elsewhere.

				In addition to its restrictive in-state presence requirement, New York discriminates against out-of-state wineries in other ways.  Out-of-state wineries that establish the requisite branch office and warehouse in New York are still ineligible for a farm winery license, the license that provides the most direct means of shipping to New York consumers.  N. Y. ABC Law §76a(5) (No licensed farm winery shall manufacture or sell any wine not produced exclusively from grapes or other fruits or agricultural products grown or produced in New York state).  Out-of-state wineries may apply only for a commercial winery license.  See §§3(37), 76.  Unlike farm wineries, however, commercial wineries must obtain a separate certificate from the state liquor authority authorizing direct shipments to consumers, §77(2) (West 2000); and, of course, for out-of-state wineries there is the additional requirement of maintaining a distribution operation in New York.  New York law also allows in-state wineries without direct-shipping licenses to distribute their wine through other wineries that have the applicable licenses.  §76(5) (West Supp. 2005).  This is another privilege not afforded out-of-state wineries.

				<em>
					Bowman

				,
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				the power to ship merchandise from one State into another carries with it, as an incident, the right in the receiver of the goods to sell them in the original packages, any state regulation to the contrary notwithstanding; that is to say, that the goods received by Interstate Commerce remain under the shelter of the Interstate Commerce clause of the Constitution, until by a sale in the original package they have been commingled with the general mass of property in the state.  170 U.

				That all fermented, distilled, or other intoxicating liquors or liquids transported into any State or Territory or remaining therein for use, consumption, sale or storage therein, shall upon arrival in such State or Territory be subject to the operation and effect of the laws of such State or Territory enacted in the exercise of its police powers, to the same extent and in the same manner as though such liquids or liquors had been produced in such State or Territory, and shall not be exempt therefrom by reason of being introduced therein in original packages or otherwise.  Ch. 728,

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
By its own terms, the Wilson Act did not allow States to discriminate against out-of-state liquor; rather, it allowed States to regulate imported liquor only to the same extent and in the same manner as domestic liquor.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court confirmed this interpretation in 
				<em>
					Scott, supra.
				</em>
            <em>
					Scott 
				</em>
				involved a constitutional challenge to South Carolinas dispensary law, 1895 S. C. Acts p. 721, which required that all liquor sales be channeled through the state liquor commissioner.  165 U. S., at 92.  The statute discriminated against out-of-state manufacturers in two primary ways.  First, §15 required the commissioner to purchase his supplies from the brewers and distillers in this State when their product reaches the standard required by this Act: Provided, Such supplies can be purchased as cheaply from such brewers and distillers in this State as elsewhere.  1895 S. C. Acts p. 732.  Second, §23 of the statute limited the States markup on locally produced wines to a 10-percent profit but provided no such limitation of charge in the case of imported wines.  165 U. S., at 93.  Based on these discriminatory provisions, the Court rejected the argument that the South Carolina dispensary law was authorized by the Wilson Act.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 100.  It explained that the Wilson Act was not intended to confer upon any State the power to discriminate injuriously against the products of other States in articles whose manufacture and use are not forbidden, and which are therefore the subjects of legitimate commerce.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  To the contrary, the Court said, the Wilson Act mandated equality or uniformity of treatment under state laws, 
				<em>
					ibid.,
				</em>
				 and did not allow South Carolina to provide an unjust preference to its products as against similar products of the other States,
				<em>
					 id., 
				</em>
				at 101.  The dissent also understood the validity of the dispensary law to turn in large part on §§15 and 23, but argued that even if these provisions were discriminatory the correct remedy was to sever them from the rest of the Act.

				Although the Wilson Act increased the States authority to police liquor imports, it did not solve all their problems.  In

				</em>
				two cases decided soon after

				as embodying two distinct holdings: First, the South Carolina dispensary law amount[ed] to an unjust discrimination against liquors, the products of other States.  170 U. S.
				<em>
					, 
				</em>
				at 442.  This aspect of the 
				<em>
					Scott 
				</em>
				holding, which confirmed the Wilson Acts nondiscrimination principle, was based on particular provisions of the law by which the discrimination was brought about.  170 U. S., at 442.  Second, in so far as the law then in question forbade the sending … of intoxicating liquors for the use of the person to whom it was shipped, the statute was repugnant to [the Commerce Clause].

            <em>

				construed the Wilson Act narrowly to avoid interference with this right.  The Act, the Court said, authorized States to regulate only the resale of imported liquor, not direct shipment to consumers for personal use.  170 U. S., at 421.  Without a clear indication from Congress that it intended to allow States to ban such shipments, the 
				<em>
					Rhodes 
				</em>
				Court read the words upon arrival in the Wilson Act as authorizing the power of the State to attach to an interstate commerce shipment, only after its arrival at the point of destination and delivery there to the consignee.

				After considering a series of bills in response to the Courts reading of the Wilson Act, Congress responded to the direct-shipment loophole in 1913 by enacting the Webb-Kenyon Act, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">37</a>Stat.
699, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/27/122.html" class="subref" title="subref">27 U. S. C. §122</a>.  See Rogers, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 363370.  The Act, entitled An Act Divesting intoxicating liquors of their interstate character in certain cases, provides:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				That the shipment or transportation … of any spirituous, vinous, malted, fermented, or other intoxicating liquor of any kind, from one State … into any other State … which said spirituous, vinous, malted, fermented, or other intoxicating liquor is intended, by any person interested therein, to be received, possessed, sold, or in any manner used, either in the original package or otherwise, in violation of any law of such State … is hereby prohibited.  37 Stat.
				<em>
					,
				</em>
				 at 699700.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
The constitutionality of the Webb-Kenyon Act itself was in doubt.  
				<em>
					Vance 
				</em>
				and 
				<em>
					Rhodes 
				</em>
				implied that any law authorizing the States to regulate direct shipments for personal use would be an unlawful delegation of Congress Commerce Clause powers.  Indeed, President Taft, acting on the advice of Attorney General Wickersham, vetoed the Act for this specific reason.  S. Rep. No. 103, 63 Cong., 1st Sess., 36 (1913); 30 Op. Atty. Gen. 88 (1913).

, a divided Court upheld the Webb-Kenyon Act against a constitutional challenge.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court construed the Act to close the direct-shipment gap left open by the Wilson Act.  States were now empowered to forbid shipments of alcohol to consumers for personal use, provided that the States treated in-state and out-of-state liquor on the same terms.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 321322 (noting that the West Virginia law at issue in 
				<em>
					Clark Distilling 
				</em>
				forbade the shipment into or transportation of liquor in the State whether from inside or out).  The Court understood that the Webb-Kenyon Act was enacted simply to extend that which was done by the Wilson Act.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 324.  The Acts purpose was to prevent the immunity characteristic of interstate commerce from being used to permit the receipt of liquor through such commerce in States contrary to their laws, and thus in effect afford a means by subterfuge and indirection to set such laws at naught.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  The Court thus recognized that the Act was an attempt to eliminate the regulatory advantage, 
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				 its immunity characteristic, afforded imported liquor under 
				<em>

				 and 
				<em>

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Michigan and New York now argue the Webb-Kenyon Act went even further and removed any barrier to discriminatory state liquor regulations.  We do not agree.  First, this reading of the Webb-Kenyon Act conflicts with that given the statute in

				The statutes text does not compel a different result.  The Webb-Kenyon Act readily can be construed as forbidding shipment or transportation only where it runs afoul of the States generally applicable laws governing receipt, possession, sale, or use.  Cf. 
				<em>

				Last, and most importantly, the Webb-Kenyon Act did not purport to repeal the Wilson Act, which expressly precludes States from discriminating.

				The aim of the Twenty-first Amendment was to allow States to maintain an effective and uniform system for controlling liquor by regulating its transportation, importation, and use.

.  When a state statute directly regulates or discriminates against interstate commerce, or when its effect is to favor in-state economic interests over out-of-state interests, we have generally struck down the statute without further inquiry.

            <em>

				</em>
				 provides a particularly telling example of this proposition.  At issue was an excise tax enacted by Hawaii that exempted certain alcoholic beverages produced in that State.  The Court rejected the argument that Hawaiis discrimination against out-of-state liquor was authorized by the Twenty-first Amendment.  468 U. S.,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				at 274276.  The central purpose of the [Amendment] was not to empower States to favor local liquor industries by erecting barriers to competition.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 276.  Despite attempts to distinguish it in the instant cases, 
				<em>
					Bacchus
				</em>
				 forecloses any contention that §2 of the Twenty-first Amendment immunizes discriminatory direct-shipment laws from Commerce Clause scrutiny.  See also 
				<em>
					Brown-Forman, supra

				, at 576 (invalidating a New York price affirmation statute that required producers to limit the price of liquor based on the lowest price they offered out of state);

				Recognizing that 
				<em>

				is fatal to their position, the States suggest it should be overruled or limited to its facts.  As the foregoing analysis makes clear, we decline their invitation.  Furthermore, 
				<em>
					Bacchus

				does not stand alone in recognizing that the Twenty-first Amendment did not give the States complete freedom to regulate where other constitutional principles are at stake.  A retreat from 
				<em>

				</em>
				would also undermine 
				<em>

				</em>
				and

				The States argue that any decision invalidating their direct-shipment laws would call into question the constitutionality of the three-tier system.  This does not follow from our holding.  The Twenty-first Amendment grants the States virtually complete control over whether to permit importation or sale of liquor and how to structure the liquor distribution system.  
				<em>

				, at 110.  A State which chooses to ban the sale and consumption of alcohol altogether could bar its importation; and, as our history shows, it would have to do so to make its laws effective.  States may also assume direct control of liquor distribution through state-run outlets or funnel sales through the three-tier system.  We have previously recognized that the three-tier system itself is unquestionably legitimate.

State policies are protected under the Twenty-first Amendment when they treat liquor produced out of state the same as its domestic equivalent.  The instant cases, in contrast, involve straightforward attempts to discriminate in favor of local producers.  The discrimination is contrary to the Commerce Clause and is not saved by the Twenty-first Amendment.

        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				Our determination that the Michigan and New York direct-shipment laws are not authorized by the Twenty-first Amendment does not end the inquiry.  We still must consider whether either State regime advances a legitimate local purpose that cannot be adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives.  
				<em>
					New Energy Co. of Ind.
				</em>
				, 486 U. S., at 278.  The States offer two primary justifications for restricting direct shipments from out-of-state wineries: keeping alcohol out of the hands of minors and facilitating tax collection.  We consider each in turn.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The States, aided by several 
				<em>
					amici,
				</em>
				 claim that allowing direct shipment from out-of-state wineries undermines their ability to police underage drinking.  Minors, the States argue, have easy access to credit cards and the Internet and are likely to take advantage of direct wine shipments as a means of obtaining alcohol illegally.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The States provide little evidence that the purchase of wine over the Internet by minors is a problem.  Indeed, there is some evidence to the contrary.  A recent study by the staff of the FTC found that the 26 States currently allowing direct shipments report no problems with minors increased access to wine.  FTC Report 34.  This is not surprising for several reasons.  First, minors are less likely to consume wine, as opposed to beer, wine coolers, and hard liquor.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 12.  Second, minors who decide to disobey the law have more direct means of doing so.  Third, direct shipping is an imperfect avenue of obtaining alcohol for minors who, in the words of the past president of the National Conference of State Liquor Administrators,  want instant gratification.   
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 33, and n. 137 (explaining why minors rarely buy alcohol via the mail or the Internet).  Without concrete evidence that direct shipping of wine is likely to increase alcohol consumption by minors, we are left with the States unsupported assertions.  Under our precedents, which require the clearest showing to justify discriminatory state regulation, 
				<em>
					C &amp; A Carbone, Inc.,
				</em>
				 511 U. S., at 393, this is not enough.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Even were we to credit the States largely unsupported claim that direct shipping of wine increases the risk of underage drinking, this would not justify regulations limiting only out-of-state direct shipments.  As the wineries point out, minors are just as likely to order wine from in-state producers as from out-of-state ones.  Michigan, for example, already allows its licensed retailers (over 7,000 of them) to deliver alcohol directly to consumers.  Michigan counters that it has greater regulatory control over in-state producers than over out-of-state wineries.  This does not justify Michigans discriminatory ban on direct shipping.  Out-of-state wineries face the loss of state and federal licenses if they fail to comply with state law.  This provides strong incentives not to sell alcohol to minors.  In addition, the States can take less restrictive steps to minimize the risk that minors will order wine by mail.  For example, the Model Direct Shipping Bill developed by the National Conference of State Legislatures requires an adult signature on delivery and a label so instructing on each package.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The States tax-collection justification is also insufficient.  Increased direct shipping, whether originating in state or out of state, brings with it the potential for tax evasion.  With regard to Michigan, however, the tax-collection argument is a diversion.  That is because Michigan, unlike many other States, does not rely on wholesalers to collect taxes on wines imported from out-of-state.  Instead, Michigan collects taxes directly from out-of-state wineries on all wine shipped to in-state wholesalers.  Mich. Admin. Code Rule 436.1725(2) (1989) (Each outside seller of wine shall submit … a wine tax report of all wine sold, delivered, or imported into this state during the preceding calendar month).  If licensing and self-reporting provide adequate safeguards for wine distributed through the three-tier system, there is no reason to believe they will not suffice for direct shipments.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				New York and its supporting parties also advance a tax-collection justification for the States direct-shipment laws.  While their concerns are not wholly illusory, their regulatory objectives can be achieved without discriminating against interstate commerce.  In particular, New York could protect itself against lost tax revenue by requiring a permit as a condition of direct shipping.  This is the approach taken by New York for in-state wineries.  The State offers no reason to believe the system would prove ineffective for out-of-state wineries.  Licensees could be required to submit regular sales reports and to remit taxes.  Indeed, various States use this approach for taxing direct interstate wine shipments, 
				<em>
					e.g
				</em>
				., N. H. Rev. Stat. Ann. §178.27 (Lexis Supp. 2004), and report no problems with tax collection.  See FTC Report 3840.  This is also the procedure sanctioned by the National Conference of State Legislatures in their Model Direct Shipping Bill.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g
				</em>
				., S. C. Code Ann. §614747(C) (West Supp. 2004).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Michigan and New York benefit, furthermore, from provisions of federal law that supply incentives for wineries to comply with state regulations.  The Tax and Trade Bureau (formerly the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms) has authority to revoke a winerys federal
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				license if it violates state law.  BATF Industry Circular 963 (1997).  Without a federal license, a winery cannot operate in any State.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/27/204.html" class="subref" title="subref">27 U. S. C. §204</a>.  In addition the Twenty-first Amendment Enforcement Act gives state attorneys general the power to sue wineries in federal court to enjoin violations of state law.  §122a(b).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				These federal remedies, when combined with state licensing regimes, adequately protect States from lost tax revenue.  The States have not shown that tax evasion from out-of-state wineries poses such a unique threat that it justifies their discriminatory regimes.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Michigan and New York offer a handful of other rationales, such as facilitating orderly market conditions, protecting public health and safety, and ensuring regulatory accountability.  These objectives can also be achieved through the alternative of an evenhanded licensing requirement.  FTC Report 4041.  Finally, it should be noted that improvements in technology have eased the burden of monitoring out-of-state wineries.  Background checks can be done electronically.  Financial records and sales data can be mailed, faxed, or submitted via e-mail.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In summary, the States provide little concrete evidence for the sweeping assertion that they cannot police direct shipments by out-of-state wineries.  Our Commerce Clause cases demand more than mere speculation to support discrimination against out-of-state goods.  The burden is on the State to show that the

				States have broad power to regulate liquor under §2 of the Twenty-first Amendment.  This power, however, does not allow States to ban, or severely limit, the direct shipment of out-of-state wine while simultaneously authorizing direct shipment by in-state producers.  If a State chooses to allow direct shipment of wine, it must do so on evenhanded terms.  Without demonstrating the need for discrimination, New York and Michigan have enacted regulations that disadvantage out-of-state wine producers.  Under our Commerce Clause jurisprudence, these regulations cannot stand.

				These consolidated cases present challenges to state laws regulating the sale of wine from out-of-state wineries to consumers in Michigan and New York.  The details and mechanics of the two regulatory schemes differ, but the object and effect of the laws are the same: to allow in-state wineries to sell wine directly to consumers in that State but to prohibit out-of-state wineries from doing so, or, at the least, to make direct sales impractical from an economic standpoint.  It is evident that the object and design of the Michigan and New York statutes is to grant in-state wineries a competitive advantage over wineries located beyond the States borders.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We hold that the laws in both States discriminate against interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause, Art. I, §8, cl. 3, and that the discrimination is neither authorized nor permitted by the Twenty-first Amendment.  Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which invalidated the Michigan laws; and we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which upheld the New York laws.

				Like many other States, Michigan and New York regulate the sale and importation of alcoholic beverages, including wine, through a three-tier distribution system.  Separate licenses are required for producers, wholesalers, and retailers.  See FTC, Possible Anticompetitive Barriers to E-Commerce: Wine 57 (July 2003) (hereinafter FTC Report), available at http://www.ftc.gov/os/2003/07/ winereport2.pdf (all Internet materials as visited May 11, 2005, and available in Clerk of Courts case file).  The three-tier scheme is preserved by a complex set of overlapping state and federal regulations.  For example, both state and federal laws limit vertical integration between tiers.

As relevant to todays cases, though, the three-tier system is, in broad terms and with refinements to be discussed, mandated by Michigan and New York only for sales from out-of-state wineries.  In-state wineries, by contrast, can obtain a license for direct sales to consumers.  The differential treatment between in-state and out-of-state wineries constitutes explicit discrimination against interstate commerce.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				This discrimination substantially limits the direct sale of wine to consumers, an otherwise emerging and significant business.  FTC Report 7.  From 1994 to 1999, consumer spending on direct wine shipments doubled, reaching $500 million per year, or three percent of all wine sales.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 5.  The expansion has been influenced by several related trends.  First, the number of small wineries in the United States has significantly increased.  By some estimates there are over 3,000 wineries in the country, WineAmerica, The National Association of American Wineries, Wine Facts 2004, http://www.americanwineries.org/newsroom/winefacts04.htm, more than three times the number 30 years ago, FTC Report 6.  At the same time, the wholesale market has consolidated.  Between 1984 and 2002, the number of licensed wholesalers dropped from 1,600 to 600.  Riekhof &amp; Sykuta, Regulating Wine by Mail, 27 Regulation, No. 3, pp. 30, 31 (Fall 2004), available at http://www.cato.org/
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				pubs/regulation/regv27n3/v27n3-3.pdf.  The increasing winery-to-wholesaler ratio means that many small wineries do not produce enough wine or have sufficient consumer demand for their wine to make it economical for wholesalers to carry their products.  FTC Report 6.  This has led many small wineries to rely on direct shipping to reach new markets.  Technological improvements, in particular the ability of wineries to sell wine over the Internet, have helped make direct shipments an attractive sales channel.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Approximately 26 States allow some direct shipping of wine, with various restrictions.  Thirteen of these States have reciprocity laws, which allow direct shipment from wineries outside the State, provided the State of origin affords similar nondiscriminatory treatment.

				The wine producers in the cases before us are small wineries that rely on direct consumer sales as an important part of their businesses.  Domaine Alfred, one of the plaintiffs in the Michigan suit, is a small winery located in San Luis Obispo, California.  It produces 3,000 cases of wine per year.  Domaine Alfred has received requests for its wine from Michigan consumers but cannot fill the orders because of the States direct-shipment ban.  Even if the winery could find a Michigan wholesaler to distribute its wine, the wholesalers markup would render shipment through the three-tier system economically infeasible.

				Similarly, Juanita Swedenburg and David Lucas, two of the plaintiffs in the New York suit, operate small wineries in Virginia (the Swedenburg Estate Vineyard) and California (the Lucas Winery).  Some of their customers are tourists, from other States, who purchase wine while visiting the wineries.  If these customers wish to obtain Swedenburg or Lucas wines after they return home, they will be unable to do so if they reside in a State with restrictive direct-shipment laws.  For example, Swedenburg and Lucas are unable to fill orders from New York, the Nations second-largest wine market, because of the limits that State imposes on direct wine shipments.

				We first address the background of the suit challenging the Michigan direct-shipment law.  Most alcoholic beverages in Michigan are distributed through the States three-tier system.  Producers or distillers of alcoholic beverages, whether located in state or out of state, generally may sell only to licensed in-state wholesalers.  Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. §§436.1109(1), 436.1305, 436.1403, 436.1607(1) (West 2000); Mich. Admin. Code Rules 436.1705 (1990), 436.1719 (2000).  Wholesalers, in turn, may sell only to in-state retailers.  Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. §§436.1113(7), 436.1607(1) (West 2001).  Licensed retailers are the final link in the chain, selling alcoholic beverages to consumers at retail locations and, subject to certain restrictions, through home delivery.  §§436.1111(5), 436.1203(2)(4).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Under Michigan law, wine producers, as a general matter, must distribute their wine through wholesalers.  There is, however, an exception for Michigans approximately 40 in-state wineries, which are eligible for wine maker licenses that allow direct shipment to in-state consumers.  §436.1113(9) (West 2001); §§436.1537(2)(3) (West Supp. 2004); Mich. Admin. Code Rule 436.1011(7)(b) (2003).  The cost of the license varies with the size of the winery.  For a small winery, the license is $25.  Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. §436.1525(1)(d) (West Supp. 2004).  Out-of-state wineries can apply for a $300 outside seller of wine license, but this license only allows them to sell to in-state wholesalers.  §§436.1109(9) (West 2001), 436.1525(1)(e) (West Supp. 2004); Mich. Admin. Code Rule 436.1719(5) (2000).

				Some Michigan residents brought suit against various state officials in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.  Domaine Alfred, the San Luis Obispo winery, joined in the suit.  The plaintiffs contended that Michigans direct-shipment laws discriminated against interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause.  The trade association Michigan Beer &amp; Wine Wholesalers intervened as a defendant.  Both the State and the wholesalers argued that the ban on direct shipment from out-of-state wineries is a valid exercise of Michigans power under §2 of the Twenty-first Amendment.

				New Yorks licensing scheme is somewhat different.  It channels most wine sales through the three-tier system, but it too makes exceptions for in-state wineries.  As in Michigan, the result is to allow local wineries to make direct sales to consumers in New York on terms not available to out-of-state wineries.  Wineries that produce wine only from New York grapes can apply for a license that allows direct shipment to in-state consumers.  N. Y. Alco. Bev. Cont. Law Ann. §76a(3) (West Supp. 2005) (hereinafter N. Y. ABC Law).  These licensees are authorized to deliver the wines of other wineries as well, §76a(6)(a), but only if the wine is made from grapes at least seventy-five percent the volume of which were grown in New York state,  §3(20a).  An out-of-state winery may ship directly to New York consumers only if it becomes a licensed New York winery, which requires the establishment of a branch factory, office or storeroom within the state of New York.  §3(37).

				Laws of the type at issue in the instant cases contradict these principles.  They deprive citizens of their right to have access to the markets of other States on equal terms.  The perceived necessity for reciprocal sale privileges risks generating the trade rivalries and animosities, the alliances and exclusivity, that the Constitution and, in particular, the Commerce Clause were designed to avoid.  State laws that protect local wineries have led to the enactment of statutes under which some States condition the right of out-of-state wineries to make direct wine sales to in-state consumers on a reciprocal right in the shipping State.  California, for example, passed a reciprocity law in 1986, retreating from the States previous regime that allowed unfettered direct shipments from out-of-state wineries.  Riekhof &amp; Sykuta, 27 Regulation, No. 3, at 30.  Prior to 1986, all but three States prohibited direct-shipments of wine.  The obvious aim of the California statute was to open the interstate direct-shipping market for the States many wineries.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  The current patchwork of lawswith some States banning direct shipments altogether, others doing so only for out-of-state wines, and still others requiring reciprocityis essentially the product of an ongoing, low-level trade war.  Allowing States to discriminate against out-of-state wine invite[s] a multiplication of preferential trade areas destructive of the very purpose of the Commerce Clause.

				The discriminatory character of the Michigan system is obvious.  Michigan allows in-state wineries to ship directly to consumers, subject only to a licensing requirement.  Out-of-state wineries, whether licensed or not, face a complete ban on direct shipment.  The differential treatment requires all out-of-state wine, but not all in-state wine, to pass through an in-state wholesaler and retailer before reaching consumers.  These two extra layers of overhead increase the cost of out-of-state wines to Michigan consumers.  The cost differential, and in some cases the inability to secure a wholesaler for small shipments, can effectively bar small wineries from the Michigan market.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The New York regulatory scheme differs from Michigans in that it does not ban direct shipments altogether.  Out-of-state wineries are instead required to establish a distribution operation in New York in order to gain the privilege of direct shipment.  N. Y. ABC Law §§3(37), 96.  This, though, is just an indirect way of subjecting out-of-state wineries, but not local ones, to the three-tier system.  New York and those allied with its interests defend the scheme by arguing that an out-of-state winery has the same access to the States consumers as in-state wineries: All wine must be sold through a licensee fully accountable to New York; it just so happens that in order to become a licensee, a winery must have a physical presence in the State.  There is some confusion over the precise steps out-of-state wineries must take to gain access to the New York market, in part because no winery has run the States regulatory gauntlet.  New Yorks argument, in any event, is unconvincing.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The New York scheme grants in-state wineries access to the States consumers on preferential terms.  The suggestion of a limited exception for direct shipment from out-of-state wineries does nothing to eliminate the discriminatory nature of New Yorks regulations.  In-state producers, with the applicable licenses, can ship directly to consumers from their wineries.  §§76a(3), 76(4) (West Supp. 2005), and §77(2) (West 2000).  Out-of-state wineries must open a branch office and warehouse in New York, additional steps that drive up the cost of their wine.  §§3(37), 96 (West Supp. 2005).  See also App. in No. 031274, pp. 159160 (Affidavit of Thomas G. McKeon, General Counsel to the New York State Liquor Authority).  For most wineries, the expense of establishing a bricks-and-mortar distribution operation in 1 State, let alone all 50, is prohibitive.  It comes as no surprise that not a single out-of-state winery has availed itself of New Yorks direct-shipping privilege.  We have viewed with particular suspicion state statutes requiring business operations to be performed in the home State that could more efficiently be performed elsewhere.

				In addition to its restrictive in-state presence requirement, New York discriminates against out-of-state wineries in other ways.  Out-of-state wineries that establish the requisite branch office and warehouse in New York are still ineligible for a farm winery license, the license that provides the most direct means of shipping to New York consumers.  N. Y. ABC Law §76a(5) (No licensed farm winery shall manufacture or sell any wine not produced exclusively from grapes or other fruits or agricultural products grown or produced in New York state).  Out-of-state wineries may apply only for a commercial winery license.  See §§3(37), 76.  Unlike farm wineries, however, commercial wineries must obtain a separate certificate from the state liquor authority authorizing direct shipments to consumers, §77(2) (West 2000); and, of course, for out-of-state wineries there is the additional requirement of maintaining a distribution operation in New York.  New York law also allows in-state wineries without direct-shipping licenses to distribute their wine through other wineries that have the applicable licenses.  §76(5) (West Supp. 2005).  This is another privilege not afforded out-of-state wineries.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				the power to ship merchandise from one State into another carries with it, as an incident, the right in the receiver of the goods to sell them in the original packages, any state regulation to the contrary notwithstanding; that is to say, that the goods received by Interstate Commerce remain under the shelter of the Interstate Commerce clause of the Constitution, until by a sale in the original package they have been commingled with the general mass of property in the state.  170 U.

				That all fermented, distilled, or other intoxicating liquors or liquids transported into any State or Territory or remaining therein for use, consumption, sale or storage therein, shall upon arrival in such State or Territory be subject to the operation and effect of the laws of such State or Territory enacted in the exercise of its police powers, to the same extent and in the same manner as though such liquids or liquors had been produced in such State or Territory, and shall not be exempt therefrom by reason of being introduced therein in original packages or otherwise.  Ch. 728,

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
By its own terms, the Wilson Act did not allow States to discriminate against out-of-state liquor; rather, it allowed States to regulate imported liquor only to the same extent and in the same manner as domestic liquor.

				The Court confirmed this interpretation in 
				<em>
					Scott, supra.
				</em>
            <em>
					Scott 
				</em>
				involved a constitutional challenge to South Carolinas dispensary law, 1895 S. C. Acts p. 721, which required that all liquor sales be channeled through the state liquor commissioner.  165 U. S., at 92.  The statute discriminated against out-of-state manufacturers in two primary ways.  First, §15 required the commissioner to purchase his supplies from the brewers and distillers in this State when their product reaches the standard required by this Act: Provided, Such supplies can be purchased as cheaply from such brewers and distillers in this State as elsewhere.  1895 S. C. Acts p. 732.  Second, §23 of the statute limited the States markup on locally produced wines to a 10-percent profit but provided no such limitation of charge in the case of imported wines.  165 U. S., at 93.  Based on these discriminatory provisions, the Court rejected the argument that the South Carolina dispensary law was authorized by the Wilson Act.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 100.  It explained that the Wilson Act was not intended to confer upon any State the power to discriminate injuriously against the products of other States in articles whose manufacture and use are not forbidden, and which are therefore the subjects of legitimate commerce.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  To the contrary, the Court said, the Wilson Act mandated equality or uniformity of treatment under state laws, 
				<em>
					ibid.,
				</em>
				 and did not allow South Carolina to provide an unjust preference to its products as against similar products of the other States,
				<em>
					 id., 
				</em>
				at 101.  The dissent also understood the validity of the dispensary law to turn in large part on §§15 and 23, but argued that even if these provisions were discriminatory the correct remedy was to sever them from the rest of the Act.

				<em>
					, 
				</em>
				at 442.  This aspect of the 
				<em>
					Scott 
				</em>
				holding, which confirmed the Wilson Acts nondiscrimination principle, was based on particular provisions of the law by which the discrimination was brought about.  170 U. S., at 442.  Second, in so far as the law then in question forbade the sending … of intoxicating liquors for the use of the person to whom it was shipped, the statute was repugnant to [the Commerce Clause].

Without a clear indication from Congress that it intended to allow States to ban such shipments, the 
				<em>

				After considering a series of bills in response to the Courts reading of the Wilson Act, Congress responded to the direct-shipment loophole in 1913 by enacting the Webb-Kenyon Act, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">37</a>Stat.
699, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/27/122.html" class="subref" title="subref">27 U. S. C. §122</a>.  See Rogers, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 363370.  The Act, entitled An Act Divesting intoxicating liquors of their interstate character in certain cases, provides:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				That the shipment or transportation … of any spirituous, vinous, malted, fermented, or other intoxicating liquor of any kind, from one State … into any other State … which said spirituous, vinous, malted, fermented, or other intoxicating liquor is intended, by any person interested therein, to be received, possessed, sold, or in any manner used, either in the original package or otherwise, in violation of any law of such State … is hereby prohibited.  37 Stat.

				 at 699700.

The constitutionality of the Webb-Kenyon Act itself was in doubt.  
				<em>
					Vance 
				</em>
				and 
				<em>
					Rhodes 
				</em>
				implied that any law authorizing the States to regulate direct shipments for personal use would be an unlawful delegation of Congress Commerce Clause powers.  Indeed, President Taft, acting on the advice of Attorney General Wickersham, vetoed the Act for this specific reason.  S. Rep. No. 103, 63 Cong., 1st Sess., 36 (1913); 30 Op. Atty. Gen. 88 (1913).

, a divided Court upheld the Webb-Kenyon Act against a constitutional challenge.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court construed the Act to close the direct-shipment gap left open by the Wilson Act.  States were now empowered to forbid shipments of alcohol to consumers for personal use, provided that the States treated in-state and out-of-state liquor on the same terms.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 321322 (noting that the West Virginia law at issue in 
				<em>
					Clark Distilling 
				</em>
				forbade the shipment into or transportation of liquor in the State whether from inside or out).  The Court understood that the Webb-Kenyon Act was enacted simply to extend that which was done by the Wilson Act.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 324.  The Acts purpose was to prevent the immunity characteristic of interstate commerce from being used to permit the receipt of liquor through such commerce in States contrary to their laws, and thus in effect afford a means by subterfuge and indirection to set such laws at naught.  
				<em>
					Ibid.

				  The Court thus recognized that the Act was an attempt to eliminate the regulatory advantage,

				</em>
				 its immunity characteristic, afforded imported liquor under

				Michigan and New York now argue the Webb-Kenyon Act went even further and removed any barrier to discriminatory state liquor regulations.  We do not agree.  First, this reading of the Webb-Kenyon Act conflicts with that given the statute in

				The statutes text does not compel a different result.  The Webb-Kenyon Act readily can be construed as forbidding shipment or transportation only where it runs afoul of the States generally applicable laws governing receipt, possession, sale, or use.  Cf. 
				<em>

				Last, and most importantly, the Webb-Kenyon Act did not purport to repeal the Wilson Act, which expressly precludes States from discriminating.

				The aim of the Twenty-first Amendment was to allow States to maintain an effective and uniform system for controlling liquor by regulating its transportation, importation, and use.

            <em>

				 provides a particularly telling example of this proposition.  At issue was an excise tax enacted by Hawaii that exempted certain alcoholic beverages produced in that State.  The Court rejected the argument that Hawaiis discrimination against out-of-state liquor was authorized by the Twenty-first Amendment.  468 U. S.,

				at 274276.  The central purpose of the [Amendment] was not to empower States to favor local liquor industries by erecting barriers to competition.  
				<em>

				, at 276.  Despite attempts to distinguish it in the instant cases, 
				<em>
					Bacchus
				</em>
				 forecloses any contention that §2 of the Twenty-first Amendment immunizes discriminatory direct-shipment laws from Commerce Clause scrutiny.  See also 
				<em>
					Brown-Forman, supra

				Recognizing that

					Bacchus

				does not stand alone in recognizing that the Twenty-first Amendment did not give the States complete freedom to regulate where other constitutional principles are at stake.  A retreat from 
				<em>

				</em>
				would also undermine 
				<em>

				The States argue that any decision invalidating their direct-shipment laws would call into question the constitutionality of the three-tier system.  This does not follow from our holding.  The Twenty-first Amendment grants the States virtually complete control over whether to permit importation or sale of liquor and how to structure the liquor distribution system.  
				<em>

States may also assume direct control of liquor distribution through state-run outlets or funnel sales through the three-tier system.  We have previously recognized that the three-tier system itself is unquestionably legitimate.

State policies are protected under the Twenty-first Amendment when they treat liquor produced out of state the same as its domestic equivalent.  The instant cases, in contrast, involve straightforward attempts to discriminate in favor of local producers.  The discrimination is contrary to the Commerce Clause and is not saved by the Twenty-first Amendment.

				Our determination that the Michigan and New York direct-shipment laws are not authorized by the Twenty-first Amendment does not end the inquiry.  We still must consider whether either State regime advances a legitimate local purpose that cannot be adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives.  
				<em>
					New Energy Co. of Ind.
				</em>
				, 486 U. S., at 278.  The States offer two primary justifications for restricting direct shipments from out-of-state wineries: keeping alcohol out of the hands of minors and facilitating tax collection.  We consider each in turn.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The States, aided by several 
				<em>
					amici,
				</em>
				 claim that allowing direct shipment from out-of-state wineries undermines their ability to police underage drinking.  Minors, the States argue, have easy access to credit cards and the Internet and are likely to take advantage of direct wine shipments as a means of obtaining alcohol illegally.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The States provide little evidence that the purchase of wine over the Internet by minors is a problem.  Indeed, there is some evidence to the contrary.  A recent study by the staff of the FTC found that the 26 States currently allowing direct shipments report no problems with minors increased access to wine.  FTC Report 34.  This is not surprising for several reasons.  First, minors are less likely to consume wine, as opposed to beer, wine coolers, and hard liquor.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 12.  Second, minors who decide to disobey the law have more direct means of doing so.  Third, direct shipping is an imperfect avenue of obtaining alcohol for minors who, in the words of the past president of the National Conference of State Liquor Administrators,  want instant gratification.   
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 33, and n. 137 (explaining why minors rarely buy alcohol via the mail or the Internet).  Without concrete evidence that direct shipping of wine is likely to increase alcohol consumption by minors, we are left with the States unsupported assertions.  Under our precedents, which require the clearest showing to justify discriminatory state regulation, 
				<em>
					C &amp; A Carbone, Inc.,
				</em>
				 511 U. S., at 393, this is not enough.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Even were we to credit the States largely unsupported claim that direct shipping of wine increases the risk of underage drinking, this would not justify regulations limiting only out-of-state direct shipments.  As the wineries point out, minors are just as likely to order wine from in-state producers as from out-of-state ones.  Michigan, for example, already allows its licensed retailers (over 7,000 of them) to deliver alcohol directly to consumers.  Michigan counters that it has greater regulatory control over in-state producers than over out-of-state wineries.  This does not justify Michigans discriminatory ban on direct shipping.  Out-of-state wineries face the loss of state and federal licenses if they fail to comply with state law.  This provides strong incentives not to sell alcohol to minors.  In addition, the States can take less restrictive steps to minimize the risk that minors will order wine by mail.  For example, the Model Direct Shipping Bill developed by the National Conference of State Legislatures requires an adult signature on delivery and a label so instructing on each package.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The States tax-collection justification is also insufficient.  Increased direct shipping, whether originating in state or out of state, brings with it the potential for tax evasion.  With regard to Michigan, however, the tax-collection argument is a diversion.  That is because Michigan, unlike many other States, does not rely on wholesalers to collect taxes on wines imported from out-of-state.  Instead, Michigan collects taxes directly from out-of-state wineries on all wine shipped to in-state wholesalers.  Mich. Admin. Code Rule 436.1725(2) (1989) (Each outside seller of wine shall submit … a wine tax report of all wine sold, delivered, or imported into this state during the preceding calendar month).  If licensing and self-reporting provide adequate safeguards for wine distributed through the three-tier system, there is no reason to believe they will not suffice for direct shipments.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				New York and its supporting parties also advance a tax-collection justification for the States direct-shipment laws.  While their concerns are not wholly illusory, their regulatory objectives can be achieved without discriminating against interstate commerce.  In particular, New York could protect itself against lost tax revenue by requiring a permit as a condition of direct shipping.  This is the approach taken by New York for in-state wineries.  The State offers no reason to believe the system would prove ineffective for out-of-state wineries.  Licensees could be required to submit regular sales reports and to remit taxes.  Indeed, various States use this approach for taxing direct interstate wine shipments, 
				<em>
					e.g
				</em>
				., N. H. Rev. Stat. Ann. §178.27 (Lexis Supp. 2004), and report no problems with tax collection.  See FTC Report 3840.  This is also the procedure sanctioned by the National Conference of State Legislatures in their Model Direct Shipping Bill.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g
				</em>
				., S. C. Code Ann. §614747(C) (West Supp. 2004).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Michigan and New York benefit, furthermore, from provisions of federal law that supply incentives for wineries to comply with state regulations.  The Tax and Trade Bureau (formerly the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms) has authority to revoke a winerys federal
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				license if it violates state law.  BATF Industry Circular 963 (1997).  Without a federal license, a winery cannot operate in any State.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/27/204.html" class="subref" title="subref">27 U. S. C. §204</a>.  In addition the Twenty-first Amendment Enforcement Act gives state attorneys general the power to sue wineries in federal court to enjoin violations of state law.  §122a(b).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				These federal remedies, when combined with state licensing regimes, adequately protect States from lost tax revenue.  The States have not shown that tax evasion from out-of-state wineries poses such a unique threat that it justifies their discriminatory regimes.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Michigan and New York offer a handful of other rationales, such as facilitating orderly market conditions, protecting public health and safety, and ensuring regulatory accountability.  These objectives can also be achieved through the alternative of an evenhanded licensing requirement.  FTC Report 4041.  Finally, it should be noted that improvements in technology have eased the burden of monitoring out-of-state wineries.  Background checks can be done electronically.  Financial records and sales data can be mailed, faxed, or submitted via e-mail.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In summary, the States provide little concrete evidence for the sweeping assertion that they cannot police direct shipments by out-of-state wineries.  Our Commerce Clause cases demand more than mere speculation to support discrimination against out-of-state goods.  The burden is on the State to show that the

				States have broad power to regulate liquor under §2 of the Twenty-first Amendment.  This power, however, does not allow States to ban, or severely limit, the direct shipment of out-of-state wine while simultaneously authorizing direct shipment by in-state producers.  If a State chooses to allow direct shipment of wine, it must do so on evenhanded terms.  Without demonstrating the need for discrimination, New York and Michigan have enacted regulations that disadvantage out-of-state wine producers.  Under our Commerce Clause jurisprudence, these regulations cannot stand.

				These consolidated cases present challenges to state laws regulating the sale of wine from out-of-state wineries to consumers in Michigan and New York.  The details and mechanics of the two regulatory schemes differ, but the object and effect of the laws are the same: to allow in-state wineries to sell wine directly to consumers in that State but to prohibit out-of-state wineries from doing so, or, at the least, to make direct sales impractical from an economic standpoint.  It is evident that the object and design of the Michigan and New York statutes is to grant in-state wineries a competitive advantage over wineries located beyond the States borders.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We hold that the laws in both States discriminate against interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause, Art. I, §8, cl. 3, and that the discrimination is neither authorized nor permitted by the Twenty-first Amendment.  Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which invalidated the Michigan laws; and we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which upheld the New York laws.

				Like many other States, Michigan and New York regulate the sale and importation of alcoholic beverages, including wine, through a three-tier distribution system.  Separate licenses are required for producers, wholesalers, and retailers.  See FTC, Possible Anticompetitive Barriers to E-Commerce: Wine 57 (July 2003) (hereinafter FTC Report), available at http://www.ftc.gov/os/2003/07/ winereport2.pdf (all Internet materials as visited May 11, 2005, and available in Clerk of Courts case file).  The three-tier scheme is preserved by a complex set of overlapping state and federal regulations.  For example, both state and federal laws limit vertical integration between tiers.

As relevant to todays cases, though, the three-tier system is, in broad terms and with refinements to be discussed, mandated by Michigan and New York only for sales from out-of-state wineries.  In-state wineries, by contrast, can obtain a license for direct sales to consumers.  The differential treatment between in-state and out-of-state wineries constitutes explicit discrimination against interstate commerce.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				This discrimination substantially limits the direct sale of wine to consumers, an otherwise emerging and significant business.  FTC Report 7.  From 1994 to 1999, consumer spending on direct wine shipments doubled, reaching $500 million per year, or three percent of all wine sales.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 5.  The expansion has been influenced by several related trends.  First, the number of small wineries in the United States has significantly increased.  By some estimates there are over 3,000 wineries in the country, WineAmerica, The National Association of American Wineries, Wine Facts 2004, http://www.americanwineries.org/newsroom/winefacts04.htm, more than three times the number 30 years ago, FTC Report 6.  At the same time, the wholesale market has consolidated.  Between 1984 and 2002, the number of licensed wholesalers dropped from 1,600 to 600.  Riekhof &amp; Sykuta, Regulating Wine by Mail, 27 Regulation, No. 3, pp. 30, 31 (Fall 2004), available at http://www.cato.org/
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				pubs/regulation/regv27n3/v27n3-3.pdf.  The increasing winery-to-wholesaler ratio means that many small wineries do not produce enough wine or have sufficient consumer demand for their wine to make it economical for wholesalers to carry their products.  FTC Report 6.  This has led many small wineries to rely on direct shipping to reach new markets.  Technological improvements, in particular the ability of wineries to sell wine over the Internet, have helped make direct shipments an attractive sales channel.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Approximately 26 States allow some direct shipping of wine, with various restrictions.  Thirteen of these States have reciprocity laws, which allow direct shipment from wineries outside the State, provided the State of origin affords similar nondiscriminatory treatment.  
				<em>

				., at 78.  In many parts of the country, however, state laws that prohibit or severely restrict direct shipments deprive consumers of access to the direct market.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The wine producers in the cases before us are small wineries that rely on direct consumer sales as an important part of their businesses.  Domaine Alfred, one of the plaintiffs in the Michigan suit, is a small winery located in San Luis Obispo, California.  It produces 3,000 cases of wine per year.  Domaine Alfred has received requests for its wine from Michigan consumers but cannot fill the orders because of the States direct-shipment ban.  Even if the winery could find a Michigan wholesaler to distribute its wine, the wholesalers markup would render shipment through the three-tier system economically infeasible.

				Similarly, Juanita Swedenburg and David Lucas, two of the plaintiffs in the New York suit, operate small wineries in Virginia (the Swedenburg Estate Vineyard) and California (the Lucas Winery).  Some of their customers are tourists, from other States, who purchase wine while visiting the wineries.  If these customers wish to obtain Swedenburg or Lucas wines after they return home, they will be unable to do so if they reside in a State with restrictive direct-shipment laws.  For example, Swedenburg and Lucas are unable to fill orders from New York, the Nations second-largest wine market, because of the limits that State imposes on direct wine shipments.

				We first address the background of the suit challenging the Michigan direct-shipment law.  Most alcoholic beverages in Michigan are distributed through the States three-tier system.  Producers or distillers of alcoholic beverages, whether located in state or out of state, generally may sell only to licensed in-state wholesalers.  Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. §§436.1109(1), 436.1305, 436.1403, 436.1607(1) (West 2000); Mich. Admin. Code Rules 436.1705 (1990), 436.1719 (2000).  Wholesalers, in turn, may sell only to in-state retailers.  Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. §§436.1113(7), 436.1607(1) (West 2001).  Licensed retailers are the final link in the chain, selling alcoholic beverages to consumers at retail locations and, subject to certain restrictions, through home delivery.  §§436.1111(5), 436.1203(2)(4).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Under Michigan law, wine producers, as a general matter, must distribute their wine through wholesalers.  There is, however, an exception for Michigans approximately 40 in-state wineries, which are eligible for wine maker licenses that allow direct shipment to in-state consumers.  §436.1113(9) (West 2001); §§436.1537(2)(3) (West Supp. 2004); Mich. Admin. Code Rule 436.1011(7)(b) (2003).  The cost of the license varies with the size of the winery.  For a small winery, the license is $25.  Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. §436.1525(1)(d) (West Supp. 2004).  Out-of-state wineries can apply for a $300 outside seller of wine license, but this license only allows them to sell to in-state wholesalers.  §§436.1109(9) (West 2001), 436.1525(1)(e) (West Supp. 2004); Mich.

				Some Michigan residents brought suit against various state officials in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.  Domaine Alfred, the San Luis Obispo winery, joined in the suit.  The plaintiffs contended that Michigans direct-shipment laws discriminated against interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause.  The trade association Michigan Beer &amp; Wine Wholesalers intervened as a defendant.  Both the State and the wholesalers argued that the ban on direct shipment from out-of-state wineries is a valid exercise of Michigans power under §2 of the Twenty-first Amendment.

				New Yorks licensing scheme is somewhat different.  It channels most wine sales through the three-tier system, but it too makes exceptions for in-state wineries.  As in Michigan, the result is to allow local wineries to make direct sales to consumers in New York on terms not available to out-of-state wineries.  Wineries that produce wine only from New York grapes can apply for a license that allows direct shipment to in-state consumers.  N. Y. Alco. Bev. Cont. Law Ann. §76a(3) (West Supp. 2005) (hereinafter N. Y. ABC Law).  These licensees are authorized to deliver the wines of other wineries as well, §76a(6)(a), but only if the wine is made from grapes at least seventy-five percent the volume of which were grown in New York state,  §3(20a).  An out-of-state winery may ship directly to New York consumers only if it becomes a licensed New York winery, which requires the establishment of a branch factory, office or storeroom within the state of New York.  §3(37).

				Laws of the type at issue in the instant cases contradict these principles.  They deprive citizens of their right to have access to the markets of other States on equal terms.  The perceived necessity for reciprocal sale privileges risks generating the trade rivalries and animosities, the alliances and exclusivity, that the Constitution and, in particular, the Commerce Clause were designed to avoid.  State laws that protect local wineries have led to the enactment of statutes under which some States condition the right of out-of-state wineries to make direct wine sales to in-state consumers on a reciprocal right in the shipping State.  California, for example, passed a reciprocity law in 1986, retreating from the States previous regime that allowed unfettered direct shipments from out-of-state wineries.  Riekhof &amp; Sykuta, 27 Regulation, No. 3, at 30.  Prior to 1986, all but three States prohibited direct-shipments of wine.  The obvious aim of the California statute was to open the interstate direct-shipping market for the States many wineries.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  The current patchwork of lawswith some States banning direct shipments altogether, others doing so only for out-of-state wines, and still others requiring reciprocityis essentially the product of an ongoing, low-level trade war.  Allowing States to discriminate against out-of-state wine invite[s] a multiplication of preferential trade areas destructive of the very purpose of the Commerce Clause.

				The discriminatory character of the Michigan system is obvious.  Michigan allows in-state wineries to ship directly to consumers, subject only to a licensing requirement.  Out-of-state wineries, whether licensed or not, face a complete ban on direct shipment.  The differential treatment requires all out-of-state wine, but not all in-state wine, to pass through an in-state wholesaler and retailer before reaching consumers.  These two extra layers of overhead increase the cost of out-of-state wines to Michigan consumers.  The cost differential, and in some cases the inability to secure a wholesaler for small shipments, can effectively bar small wineries from the Michigan market.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The New York regulatory scheme differs from Michigans in that it does not ban direct shipments altogether.  Out-of-state wineries are instead required to establish a distribution operation in New York in order to gain the privilege of direct shipment.  N. Y. ABC Law §§3(37), 96.  This, though, is just an indirect way of subjecting out-of-state wineries, but not local ones, to the three-tier system.  New York and those allied with its interests defend the scheme by arguing that an out-of-state winery has the same access to the States consumers as in-state wineries: All wine must be sold through a licensee fully accountable to New York; it just so happens that in order to become a licensee, a winery must have a physical presence in the State.  There is some confusion over the precise steps out-of-state wineries must take to gain access to the New York market, in part because no winery has run the States regulatory gauntlet.  New Yorks argument, in any event, is unconvincing.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The New York scheme grants in-state wineries access to the States consumers on preferential terms.  The suggestion of a limited exception for direct shipment from out-of-state wineries does nothing to eliminate the discriminatory nature of New Yorks regulations.  In-state producers, with the applicable licenses, can ship directly to consumers from their wineries.  §§76a(3), 76(4) (West Supp. 2005), and §77(2) (West 2000).  Out-of-state wineries must open a branch office and warehouse in New York, additional steps that drive up the cost of their wine.  §§3(37), 96 (West Supp. 2005).  See also App. in No. 031274, pp. 159160 (Affidavit of Thomas G. McKeon, General Counsel to the New York State Liquor Authority).  For most wineries, the expense of establishing a bricks-and-mortar distribution operation in 1 State, let alone all 50, is prohibitive.  It comes as no surprise that not a single out-of-state winery has availed itself of New Yorks direct-shipping privilege.  We have viewed with particular suspicion state statutes requiring business operations to be performed in the home State that could more efficiently be performed elsewhere.

				In addition to its restrictive in-state presence requirement, New York discriminates against out-of-state wineries in other ways.  Out-of-state wineries that establish the requisite branch office and warehouse in New York are still ineligible for a farm winery license, the license that provides the most direct means of shipping to New York consumers.  N. Y. ABC Law §76a(5) (No licensed farm winery shall manufacture or sell any wine not produced exclusively from grapes or other fruits or agricultural products grown or produced in New York state).  Out-of-state wineries may apply only for a commercial winery license.  See §§3(37), 76.  Unlike farm wineries, however, commercial wineries must obtain a separate certificate from the state liquor authority authorizing direct shipments to consumers, §77(2) (West 2000); and, of course, for out-of-state wineries there is the additional requirement of maintaining a distribution operation in New York.  New York law also allows in-state wineries without direct-shipping licenses to distribute their wine through other wineries that have the applicable licenses.  §76(5) (West Supp. 2005).  This is another privilege not afforded out-of-state wineries.

				The Court confirmed this interpretation in

            <em>
					Scott 
				</em>
				involved a constitutional challenge to South Carolinas dispensary law, 1895 S. C. Acts p. 721, which required that all liquor sales be channeled through the state liquor commissioner.  165 U. S., at 92.  The statute discriminated against out-of-state manufacturers in two primary ways.  First, §15 required the commissioner to purchase his supplies from the brewers and distillers in this State when their product reaches the standard required by this Act: Provided, Such supplies can be purchased as cheaply from such brewers and distillers in this State as elsewhere.  1895 S. C. Acts p. 732.  Second, §23 of the statute limited the States markup on locally produced wines to a 10-percent profit but provided no such limitation of charge in the case of imported wines.  165 U. S., at 93.  Based on these discriminatory provisions, the Court rejected the argument that the South Carolina dispensary law was authorized by the Wilson Act.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 100.  It explained that the Wilson Act was not intended to confer upon any State the power to discriminate injuriously against the products of other States in articles whose manufacture and use are not forbidden, and which are therefore the subjects of legitimate commerce.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  To the contrary, the Court said, the Wilson Act mandated equality or uniformity of treatment under state laws, 
				<em>
					ibid.,
				</em>
				 and did not allow South Carolina to provide an unjust preference to its products as against similar products of the other States,
				<em>
					 id., 
				</em>
				at 101.  The dissent also understood the validity of the dispensary law to turn in large part on §§15 and 23, but argued that even if these provisions were discriminatory the correct remedy was to sever them from the rest of the Act.

				<em>

				at 442.  This aspect of the 
				<em>
					Scott 
				</em>
				holding, which confirmed the Wilson Acts nondiscrimination principle, was based on particular provisions of the law by which the discrimination was brought about.  170 U. S., at 442.  Second, in so far as the law then in question forbade the sending … of intoxicating liquors for the use of the person to whom it was shipped, the statute was repugnant to [the Commerce Clause].

Without a clear indication from Congress that it intended to allow States to ban such shipments, the 
				<em>

				After considering a series of bills in response to the Courts reading of the Wilson Act, Congress responded to the direct-shipment loophole in 1913 by enacting the Webb-Kenyon Act, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">37</a>Stat.
699, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/27/122.html" class="subref" title="subref">27 U. S. C. §122</a>.  See Rogers, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 363370.  The Act, entitled An Act Divesting intoxicating liquors of their interstate character in certain cases, provides:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				That the shipment or transportation … of any spirituous, vinous, malted, fermented, or other intoxicating liquor of any kind, from one State … into any other State … which said spirituous, vinous, malted, fermented, or other intoxicating liquor is intended, by any person interested therein, to be received, possessed, sold, or in any manner used, either in the original package or otherwise, in violation of any law of such State … is hereby prohibited.  37 Stat.

					,
				</em>
				 at 699700.

The constitutionality of the Webb-Kenyon Act itself was in doubt.  
				<em>
					Vance 
				</em>
				and 
				<em>
					Rhodes 
				</em>
				implied that any law authorizing the States to regulate direct shipments for personal use would be an unlawful delegation of Congress Commerce Clause powers.  Indeed, President Taft, acting on the advice of Attorney General Wickersham, vetoed the Act for this specific reason.  S. Rep. No. 103, 63 Cong., 1st Sess., 36 (1913); 30 Op. Atty. Gen. 88 (1913).

, a divided Court upheld the Webb-Kenyon Act against a constitutional challenge.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court construed the Act to close the direct-shipment gap left open by the Wilson Act.  States were now empowered to forbid shipments of alcohol to consumers for personal use, provided that the States treated in-state and out-of-state liquor on the same terms.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 321322 (noting that the West Virginia law at issue in 
				<em>
					Clark Distilling 
				</em>
				forbade the shipment into or transportation of liquor in the State whether from inside or out).  The Court understood that the Webb-Kenyon Act was enacted simply to extend that which was done by the Wilson Act.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 324.  The Acts purpose was to prevent the immunity characteristic of interstate commerce from being used to permit the receipt of liquor through such commerce in States contrary to their laws, and thus in effect afford a means by subterfuge and indirection to set such laws at naught.  
				<em>
					Ibid.

				  The Court thus recognized that the Act was an attempt to eliminate the regulatory advantage,

				</em>
				 its immunity characteristic, afforded imported liquor under

				Michigan and New York now argue the Webb-Kenyon Act went even further and removed any barrier to discriminatory state liquor regulations.  We do not agree.  First, this reading of the Webb-Kenyon Act conflicts with that given the statute in

				The statutes text does not compel a different result.  The Webb-Kenyon Act readily can be construed as forbidding shipment or transportation only where it runs afoul of the States generally applicable laws governing receipt, possession, sale, or use.  Cf. 
				<em>

				Last, and most importantly, the Webb-Kenyon Act did not purport to repeal the Wilson Act, which expressly precludes States from discriminating.

				The aim of the Twenty-first Amendment was to allow States to maintain an effective and uniform system for controlling liquor by regulating its transportation, importation, and use.

				The plaintiffs ask us to limit this broad command [of §2].

				The States argue that any decision invalidating their direct-shipment laws would call into question the constitutionality of the three-tier system.

We have previously recognized that the three-tier system itself is unquestionably legitimate.

				Our determination that the Michigan and New York direct-shipment laws are not authorized by the Twenty-first Amendment does not end the inquiry.  We still must consider whether either State regime advances a legitimate local purpose that cannot be adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives.  
				<em>
					New Energy Co. of Ind.
				</em>
				, 486 U. S., at 278.  The States offer two primary justifications for restricting direct shipments from out-of-state wineries: keeping alcohol out of the hands of minors and facilitating tax collection.  We consider each in turn.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The States, aided by several 
				<em>
					amici,
				</em>
				 claim that allowing direct shipment from out-of-state wineries undermines their ability to police underage drinking.  Minors, the States argue, have easy access to credit cards and the Internet and are likely to take advantage of direct wine shipments as a means of obtaining alcohol illegally.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The States provide little evidence that the purchase of wine over the Internet by minors is a problem.  Indeed, there is some evidence to the contrary.  A recent study by the staff of the FTC found that the 26 States currently allowing direct shipments report no problems with minors increased access to wine.  FTC Report 34.  This is not surprising for several reasons.  First, minors are less likely to consume wine, as opposed to beer, wine coolers, and hard liquor.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 12.  Second, minors who decide to disobey the law have more direct means of doing so.  Third, direct shipping is an imperfect avenue of obtaining alcohol for minors who, in the words of the past president of the National Conference of State Liquor Administrators,  want instant gratification.   
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 33, and n. 137 (explaining why minors rarely buy alcohol via the mail or the Internet).  Without concrete evidence that direct shipping of wine is likely to increase alcohol consumption by minors, we are left with the States unsupported assertions.  Under our precedents, which require the clearest showing to justify discriminatory state regulation, 
				<em>
					C &amp; A Carbone, Inc.,
				</em>
				 511 U. S., at 393, this is not enough.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Even were we to credit the States largely unsupported claim that direct shipping of wine increases the risk of underage drinking, this would not justify regulations limiting only out-of-state direct shipments.  As the wineries point out, minors are just as likely to order wine from in-state producers as from out-of-state ones.  Michigan, for example, already allows its licensed retailers (over 7,000 of them) to deliver alcohol directly to consumers.  Michigan counters that it has greater regulatory control over in-state producers than over out-of-state wineries.  This does not justify Michigans discriminatory ban on direct shipping.  Out-of-state wineries face the loss of state and federal licenses if they fail to comply with state law.  This provides strong incentives not to sell alcohol to minors.  In addition, the States can take less restrictive steps to minimize the risk that minors will order wine by mail.  For example, the Model Direct Shipping Bill developed by the National Conference of State Legislatures requires an adult signature on delivery and a label so instructing on each package.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The States tax-collection justification is also insufficient.  Increased direct shipping, whether originating in state or out of state, brings with it the potential for tax evasion.  With regard to Michigan, however, the tax-collection argument is a diversion.  That is because Michigan, unlike many other States, does not rely on wholesalers to collect taxes on wines imported from out-of-state.  Instead, Michigan collects taxes directly from out-of-state wineries on all wine shipped to in-state wholesalers.  Mich. Admin. Code Rule 436.1725(2) (1989) (Each outside seller of wine shall submit … a wine tax report of all wine sold, delivered, or imported into this state during the preceding calendar month).  If licensing and self-reporting provide adequate safeguards for wine distributed through the three-tier system, there is no reason to believe they will not suffice for direct shipments.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				New York and its supporting parties also advance a tax-collection justification for the States direct-shipment laws.  While their concerns are not wholly illusory, their regulatory objectives can be achieved without discriminating against interstate commerce.  In particular, New York could protect itself against lost tax revenue by requiring a permit as a condition of direct shipping.  This is the approach taken by New York for in-state wineries.  The State offers no reason to believe the system would prove ineffective for out-of-state wineries.  Licensees could be required to submit regular sales reports and to remit taxes.  Indeed, various States use this approach for taxing direct interstate wine shipments, 
				<em>
					e.g
				</em>
				., N. H. Rev. Stat. Ann. §178.27 (Lexis Supp. 2004), and report no problems with tax collection.  See FTC Report 3840.  This is also the procedure sanctioned by the National Conference of State Legislatures in their Model Direct Shipping Bill.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g
				</em>
				., S. C. Code Ann. §614747(C) (West Supp. 2004).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Michigan and New York benefit, furthermore, from provisions of federal law that supply incentives for wineries to comply with state regulations.  The Tax and Trade Bureau (formerly the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms) has authority to revoke a winerys federal
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				license if it violates state law.  BATF Industry Circular 963 (1997).  Without a federal license, a winery cannot operate in any State.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/27/204.html" class="subref" title="subref">27 U. S. C. §204</a>.  In addition the Twenty-first Amendment Enforcement Act gives state attorneys general the power to sue wineries in federal court to enjoin violations of state law.  §122a(b).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				These federal remedies, when combined with state licensing regimes, adequately protect States from lost tax revenue.  The States have not shown that tax evasion from out-of-state wineries poses such a unique threat that it justifies their discriminatory regimes.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Michigan and New York offer a handful of other rationales, such as facilitating orderly market conditions, protecting public health and safety, and ensuring regulatory accountability.  These objectives can also be achieved through the alternative of an evenhanded licensing requirement.  FTC Report 4041.  Finally, it should be noted that improvements in technology have eased the burden of monitoring out-of-state wineries.  Background checks can be done electronically.  Financial records and sales data can be mailed, faxed, or submitted via e-mail.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In summary, the States provide little concrete evidence for the sweeping assertion that they cannot police direct shipments by out-of-state wineries.  Our Commerce Clause cases demand more than mere speculation to support discrimination against out-of-state goods.  The burden is on the State to show that the

				States have broad power to regulate liquor under §2 of the Twenty-first Amendment.  This power, however, does not allow States to ban, or severely limit, the direct shipment of out-of-state wine while simultaneously authorizing direct shipment by in-state producers.  If a State chooses to allow direct shipment of wine, it must do so on evenhanded terms.  Without demonstrating the need for discrimination, New York and Michigan have enacted regulations that disadvantage out-of-state wine producers.  Under our Commerce Clause jurisprudence, these regulations cannot stand.

				These consolidated cases present challenges to state laws regulating the sale of wine from out-of-state wineries to consumers in Michigan and New York.  The details and mechanics of the two regulatory schemes differ, but the object and effect of the laws are the same: to allow in-state wineries to sell wine directly to consumers in that State but to prohibit out-of-state wineries from doing so, or, at the least, to make direct sales impractical from an economic standpoint.  It is evident that the object and design of the Michigan and New York statutes is to grant in-state wineries a competitive advantage over wineries located beyond the States borders.

Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which invalidated the Michigan laws; and we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which upheld the New York laws.

				Like many other States, Michigan and New York regulate the sale and importation of alcoholic beverages, including wine, through a three-tier distribution system.  Separate licenses are required for producers, wholesalers, and retailers.  See FTC, Possible Anticompetitive Barriers to E-Commerce: Wine 57 (July 2003) (hereinafter FTC Report), available at http://www.ftc.gov/os/2003/07/ winereport2.pdf (all Internet materials as visited May 11, 2005, and available in Clerk of Courts case file).  The three-tier scheme is preserved by a complex set of overlapping state and federal regulations.  For example, both state and federal laws limit vertical integration between tiers.

As relevant to todays cases, though, the three-tier system is, in broad terms and with refinements to be discussed, mandated by Michigan and New York only for sales from out-of-state wineries.  In-state wineries, by contrast, can obtain a license for direct sales to consumers.  The differential treatment between in-state and out-of-state wineries constitutes explicit discrimination against interstate commerce.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				This discrimination substantially limits the direct sale of wine to consumers, an otherwise emerging and significant business.  FTC Report 7.  From 1994 to 1999, consumer spending on direct wine shipments doubled, reaching $500 million per year, or three percent of all wine sales.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 5.  The expansion has been influenced by several related trends.  First, the number of small wineries in the United States has significantly increased.  By some estimates there are over 3,000 wineries in the country, WineAmerica, The National Association of American Wineries, Wine Facts 2004, http://www.americanwineries.org/newsroom/winefacts04.htm, more than three times the number 30 years ago, FTC Report 6.  At the same time, the wholesale market has consolidated.  Between 1984 and 2002, the number of licensed wholesalers dropped from 1,600 to 600.  Riekhof &amp; Sykuta, Regulating Wine by Mail, 27 Regulation, No. 3, pp. 30, 31 (Fall 2004), available at http://www.cato.org/
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				pubs/regulation/regv27n3/v27n3-3.pdf.  The increasing winery-to-wholesaler ratio means that many small wineries do not produce enough wine or have sufficient consumer demand for their wine to make it economical for wholesalers to carry their products.  FTC Report 6.  This has led many small wineries to rely on direct shipping to reach new markets.  Technological improvements, in particular the ability of wineries to sell wine over the Internet, have helped make direct shipments an attractive sales channel.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Approximately 26 States allow some direct shipping of wine, with various restrictions.  Thirteen of these States have reciprocity laws, which allow direct shipment from wineries outside the State, provided the State of origin affords similar nondiscriminatory treatment.  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 78.  In many parts of the country, however, state laws that prohibit or severely restrict direct shipments deprive consumers of access to the direct market.  According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), [s]tate bans on interstate direct shipping represent the single largest regulatory barrier to expanded e-commerce in wine.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The wine producers in the cases before us are small wineries that rely on direct consumer sales as an important part of their businesses.  Domaine Alfred, one of the plaintiffs in the Michigan suit, is a small winery located in San Luis Obispo, California.  It produces 3,000 cases of wine per year.  Domaine Alfred has received requests for its wine from Michigan consumers but cannot fill the orders because of the States direct-shipment ban.  Even if the winery could find a Michigan wholesaler to distribute its wine, the wholesalers markup would render shipment through the three-tier system economically infeasible.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Similarly, Juanita Swedenburg and David Lucas, two of the plaintiffs in the New York suit, operate small wineries in Virginia (the Swedenburg Estate Vineyard) and California (the Lucas Winery).  Some of their customers are tourists, from other States, who purchase wine while visiting the wineries.  If these customers wish to obtain Swedenburg or Lucas wines after they return home, they will be unable to do so if they reside in a State with restrictive direct-shipment laws.  For example, Swedenburg and Lucas are unable to fill orders from New York, the Nations second-largest wine market, because of the limits that State imposes on direct wine shipments.

				We first address the background of the suit challenging the Michigan direct-shipment law.  Most alcoholic beverages in Michigan are distributed through the States three-tier system.  Producers or distillers of alcoholic beverages, whether located in state or out of state, generally may sell only to licensed in-state wholesalers.  Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. §§436.1109(1), 436.1305, 436.1403, 436.1607(1) (West 2000); Mich. Admin. Code Rules 436.1705 (1990), 436.1719 (2000).  Wholesalers, in turn, may sell only to in-state retailers.  Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. §§436.1113(7), 436.1607(1) (West 2001).  Licensed retailers are the final link in the chain, selling alcoholic beverages to consumers at retail locations and, subject to certain restrictions, through home delivery.  §§436.1111(5), 436.1203(2)(4).

				Under Michigan law, wine producers, as a general matter, must distribute their wine through wholesalers.  There is, however, an exception for Michigans approximately 40 in-state wineries, which are eligible for wine maker licenses that allow direct shipment to in-state consumers.  §436.1113(9) (West 2001); §§436.1537(2)(3) (West Supp. 2004); Mich. Admin. Code Rule 436.1011(7)(b) (2003).  The cost of the license varies with the size of the winery.  For a small winery, the license is $25.  Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. §436.1525(1)(d) (West Supp. 2004).  Out-of-state wineries can apply for a $300 outside seller of wine license, but this license only allows them to sell to in-state wholesalers.  §§436.1109(9) (West 2001), 436.1525(1)(e) (West Supp. 2004); Mich.

				Some Michigan residents brought suit against various state officials in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.  Domaine Alfred, the San Luis Obispo winery, joined in the suit.  The plaintiffs contended that Michigans direct-shipment laws discriminated against interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause.  The trade association Michigan Beer &amp; Wine Wholesalers intervened as a defendant.  Both the State and the wholesalers argued that the ban on direct shipment from out-of-state wineries is a valid exercise of Michigans power under §2 of the Twenty-first Amendment.

				New Yorks licensing scheme is somewhat different.  It channels most wine sales through the three-tier system, but it too makes exceptions for in-state wineries.  As in Michigan, the result is to allow local wineries to make direct sales to consumers in New York on terms not available to out-of-state wineries.  Wineries that produce wine only from New York grapes can apply for a license that allows direct shipment to in-state consumers.  N. Y. Alco. Bev. Cont. Law Ann. §76a(3) (West Supp. 2005) (hereinafter N. Y. ABC Law).  These licensees are authorized to deliver the wines of other wineries as well, §76a(6)(a), but only if the wine is made from grapes at least seventy-five percent the volume of which were grown in New York state,  §3(20a).  An out-of-state winery may ship directly to New York consumers only if it becomes a licensed New York winery, which requires the establishment of a branch factory, office or storeroom within the state of New York.  §3(37).

				The rule prohibiting state discrimination against interstate commerce follows also from the principle that States should not be compelled to negotiate with each other regarding favored or disfavored status for their own citizens.  States do not need, and may not attempt, to negotiate with other States regarding their mutual economic interests.  Cf. U. S. Const., Art. I, §10, cl. 3.

				Laws of the type at issue in the instant cases contradict these principles.  They deprive citizens of their right to have access to the markets of other States on equal terms.  The perceived necessity for reciprocal sale privileges risks generating the trade rivalries and animosities, the alliances and exclusivity, that the Constitution and, in particular, the Commerce Clause were designed to avoid.  State laws that protect local wineries have led to the enactment of statutes under which some States condition the right of out-of-state wineries to make direct wine sales to in-state consumers on a reciprocal right in the shipping State.  California, for example, passed a reciprocity law in 1986, retreating from the States previous regime that allowed unfettered direct shipments from out-of-state wineries.  Riekhof &amp; Sykuta, 27 Regulation, No. 3, at 30.  Prior to 1986, all but three States prohibited direct-shipments of wine.  The obvious aim of the California statute was to open the interstate direct-shipping market for the States many wineries.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  The current patchwork of lawswith some States banning direct shipments altogether, others doing so only for out-of-state wines, and still others requiring reciprocityis essentially the product of an ongoing, low-level trade war.  Allowing States to discriminate against out-of-state wine invite[s] a multiplication of preferential trade areas destructive of the very purpose of the Commerce Clause.

				The discriminatory character of the Michigan system is obvious.  Michigan allows in-state wineries to ship directly to consumers, subject only to a licensing requirement.  Out-of-state wineries, whether licensed or not, face a complete ban on direct shipment.  The differential treatment requires all out-of-state wine, but not all in-state wine, to pass through an in-state wholesaler and retailer before reaching consumers.  These two extra layers of overhead increase the cost of out-of-state wines to Michigan consumers.  The cost differential, and in some cases the inability to secure a wholesaler for small shipments, can effectively bar small wineries from the Michigan market.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The New York regulatory scheme differs from Michigans in that it does not ban direct shipments altogether.  Out-of-state wineries are instead required to establish a distribution operation in New York in order to gain the privilege of direct shipment.  N. Y. ABC Law §§3(37), 96.  This, though, is just an indirect way of subjecting out-of-state wineries, but not local ones, to the three-tier system.  New York and those allied with its interests defend the scheme by arguing that an out-of-state winery has the same access to the States consumers as in-state wineries: All wine must be sold through a licensee fully accountable to New York; it just so happens that in order to become a licensee, a winery must have a physical presence in the State.  There is some confusion over the precise steps out-of-state wineries must take to gain access to the New York market, in part because no winery has run the States regulatory gauntlet.  New Yorks argument, in any event, is unconvincing.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The New York scheme grants in-state wineries access to the States consumers on preferential terms.  The suggestion of a limited exception for direct shipment from out-of-state wineries does nothing to eliminate the discriminatory nature of New Yorks regulations.  In-state producers, with the applicable licenses, can ship directly to consumers from their wineries.  §§76a(3), 76(4) (West Supp. 2005), and §77(2) (West 2000).  Out-of-state wineries must open a branch office and warehouse in New York, additional steps that drive up the cost of their wine.  §§3(37), 96 (West Supp. 2005).  See also App. in No. 031274, pp. 159160 (Affidavit of Thomas G. McKeon, General Counsel to the New York State Liquor Authority).  For most wineries, the expense of establishing a bricks-and-mortar distribution operation in 1 State, let alone all 50, is prohibitive.  It comes as no surprise that not a single out-of-state winery has availed itself of New Yorks direct-shipping privilege.  We have viewed with particular suspicion state statutes requiring business operations to be performed in the home State that could more efficiently be performed elsewhere.

				In addition to its restrictive in-state presence requirement, New York discriminates against out-of-state wineries in other ways.  Out-of-state wineries that establish the requisite branch office and warehouse in New York are still ineligible for a farm winery license, the license that provides the most direct means of shipping to New York consumers.  N. Y. ABC Law §76a(5) (No licensed farm winery shall manufacture or sell any wine not produced exclusively from grapes or other fruits or agricultural products grown or produced in New York state).  Out-of-state wineries may apply only for a commercial winery license.  See §§3(37), 76.  Unlike farm wineries, however, commercial wineries must obtain a separate certificate from the state liquor authority authorizing direct shipments to consumers, §77(2) (West 2000); and, of course, for out-of-state wineries there is the additional requirement of maintaining a distribution operation in New York.  New York law also allows in-state wineries without direct-shipping licenses to distribute their wine through other wineries that have the applicable licenses.  §76(5) (West Supp. 2005).  This is another privilege not afforded out-of-state wineries.

				That all fermented, distilled, or other intoxicating liquors or liquids transported into any State or Territory or remaining therein for use, consumption, sale or storage therein, shall upon arrival in such State or Territory be subject to the operation and effect of the laws of such State or Territory enacted in the exercise of its police powers, to the same extent and in the same manner as though such liquids or liquors had been produced in such State or Territory, and shall not be exempt therefrom by reason of being introduced therein in original packages or otherwise.  Ch. 728,

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
By its own terms, the Wilson Act did not allow States to discriminate against out-of-state liquor; rather, it allowed States to regulate imported liquor only to the same extent and in the same manner as domestic liquor.

				The Court confirmed this interpretation in 
				<em>

				</em>
            <em>
					Scott 
				</em>
				involved a constitutional challenge to South Carolinas dispensary law, 1895 S. C. Acts p. 721, which required that all liquor sales be channeled through the state liquor commissioner.  165 U. S., at 92.  The statute discriminated against out-of-state manufacturers in two primary ways.  First, §15 required the commissioner to purchase his supplies from the brewers and distillers in this State when their product reaches the standard required by this Act: Provided, Such supplies can be purchased as cheaply from such brewers and distillers in this State as elsewhere.  1895 S. C. Acts p. 732.  Second, §23 of the statute limited the States markup on locally produced wines to a 10-percent profit but provided no such limitation of charge in the case of imported wines.  165 U. S., at 93.  Based on these discriminatory provisions, the Court rejected the argument that the South Carolina dispensary law was authorized by the Wilson Act.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 100.  It explained that the Wilson Act was not intended to confer upon any State the power to discriminate injuriously against the products of other States in articles whose manufacture and use are not forbidden, and which are therefore the subjects of legitimate commerce.  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  To the contrary, the Court said, the Wilson Act mandated equality or uniformity of treatment under state laws, 
				<em>
					ibid.,
				</em>
				 and did not allow South Carolina to provide an unjust preference to its products as against similar products of the other States,
				<em>
					 id., 
				</em>
				at 101.  The dissent also understood the validity of the dispensary law to turn in large part on §§15 and 23, but argued that even if these provisions were discriminatory the correct remedy was to sever them from the rest of the Act.

				<em>
					, 
				</em>
				at 442.  This aspect of the 
				<em>
					Scott 
				</em>
				holding, which confirmed the Wilson Acts nondiscrimination principle, was based on particular provisions of the law by which the discrimination was brought about.  170 U. S., at 442.  Second, in so far as the law then in question forbade the sending … of intoxicating liquors for the use of the person to whom it was shipped, the statute was repugnant to [the Commerce Clause].

Without a clear indication from Congress that it intended to allow States to ban such shipments, the 
				<em>

				After considering a series of bills in response to the Courts reading of the Wilson Act, Congress responded to the direct-shipment loophole in 1913 by enacting the Webb-Kenyon Act, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">37</a>Stat.
699, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/27/122.html" class="subref" title="subref">27 U. S. C. §122</a>.  See Rogers, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 363370.  The Act, entitled An Act Divesting intoxicating liquors of their interstate character in certain cases, provides:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				That the shipment or transportation … of any spirituous, vinous, malted, fermented, or other intoxicating liquor of any kind, from one State … into any other State … which said spirituous, vinous, malted, fermented, or other intoxicating liquor is intended, by any person interested therein, to be received, possessed, sold, or in any manner used, either in the original package or otherwise, in violation of any law of such State … is hereby prohibited.  37 Stat.

					,
				</em>
				 at 699700.

The constitutionality of the Webb-Kenyon Act itself was in doubt.  
				<em>
					Vance 
				</em>
				and 
				<em>
					Rhodes 
				</em>
				implied that any law authorizing the States to regulate direct shipments for personal use would be an unlawful delegation of Congress Commerce Clause powers.  Indeed, President Taft, acting on the advice of Attorney General Wickersham, vetoed the Act for this specific reason.  S. Rep. No. 103, 63 Cong., 1st Sess., 36 (1913); 30 Op. Atty. Gen. 88 (1913).

, a divided Court upheld the Webb-Kenyon Act against a constitutional challenge.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court construed the Act to close the direct-shipment gap left open by the Wilson Act.  States were now empowered to forbid shipments of alcohol to consumers for personal use, provided that the States treated in-state and out-of-state liquor on the same terms.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 321322 (noting that the West Virginia law at issue in 
				<em>
					Clark Distilling 
				</em>
				forbade the shipment into or transportation of liquor in the State whether from inside or out).  The Court understood that the Webb-Kenyon Act was enacted simply to extend that which was done by the Wilson Act.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 324.  The Acts purpose was to prevent the immunity characteristic of interstate commerce from being used to permit the receipt of liquor through such commerce in States contrary to their laws, and thus in effect afford a means by subterfuge and indirection to set such laws at naught.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  The Court thus recognized that the Act was an attempt to eliminate the regulatory advantage, 
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				 its immunity characteristic, afforded imported liquor under 
				<em>

				 and 
				<em>

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Michigan and New York now argue the Webb-Kenyon Act went even further and removed any barrier to discriminatory state liquor regulations.  We do not agree.  First, this reading of the Webb-Kenyon Act conflicts with that given the statute in 
				<em>

				The statutes text does not compel a different result.  The Webb-Kenyon Act readily can be construed as forbidding shipment or transportation only where it runs afoul of the States generally applicable laws governing receipt, possession, sale, or use.  Cf. 
				<em>

				Last, and most importantly, the Webb-Kenyon Act did not purport to repeal the Wilson Act, which expressly precludes States from discriminating.

				The aim of the Twenty-first Amendment was to allow States to maintain an effective and uniform system for controlling liquor by regulating its transportation, importation, and use.

				The plaintiffs ask us to limit this broad command [of §2].

				<em>

				The States argue that any decision invalidating their direct-shipment laws would call into question the constitutionality of the three-tier system.  This does not follow from our holding.  The Twenty-first Amendment grants the States virtually complete control over whether to permit importation or sale of liquor and how to structure the liquor distribution system.  
				<em>
					Midcal, supra
				</em>
				, at 110.  A State which chooses to ban the sale and consumption of alcohol altogether could bar its importation; and, as our history shows, it would have to do so to make its laws effective.  States may also assume direct control of liquor distribution through state-run outlets or funnel sales through the three-tier system.  We have previously recognized that the three-tier system itself is unquestionably legitimate.

State policies are protected under the Twenty-first Amendment when they treat liquor produced out of state the same as its domestic equivalent.  The instant cases, in contrast, involve straightforward attempts to discriminate in favor of local producers.  The discrimination is contrary to the Commerce Clause and is not saved by the Twenty-first Amendment.

				Our determination that the Michigan and New York direct-shipment laws are not authorized by the Twenty-first Amendment does not end the inquiry.  We still must consider whether either State regime advances a legitimate local purpose that cannot be adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives.  
				<em>
					New Energy Co. of Ind.
				</em>
				, 486 U. S., at 278.  The States offer two primary justifications for restricting direct shipments from out-of-state wineries: keeping alcohol out of the hands of minors and facilitating tax collection.  We consider each in turn.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The States, aided by several 
				<em>
					amici,
				</em>
				 claim that allowing direct shipment from out-of-state wineries undermines their ability to police underage drinking.  Minors, the States argue, have easy access to credit cards and the Internet and are likely to take advantage of direct wine shipments as a means of obtaining alcohol illegally.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The States provide little evidence that the purchase of wine over the Internet by minors is a problem.  Indeed, there is some evidence to the contrary.  A recent study by the staff of the FTC found that the 26 States currently allowing direct shipments report no problems with minors increased access to wine.  FTC Report 34.  This is not surprising for several reasons.  First, minors are less likely to consume wine, as opposed to beer, wine coolers, and hard liquor.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 12.  Second, minors who decide to disobey the law have more direct means of doing so.  Third, direct shipping is an imperfect avenue of obtaining alcohol for minors who, in the words of the past president of the National Conference of State Liquor Administrators,  want instant gratification.   
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 33, and n. 137 (explaining why minors rarely buy alcohol via the mail or the Internet).  Without concrete evidence that direct shipping of wine is likely to increase alcohol consumption by minors, we are left with the States unsupported assertions.  Under our precedents, which require the clearest showing to justify discriminatory state regulation, 
				<em>
					C &amp; A Carbone, Inc.,
				</em>
				 511 U. S., at 393, this is not enough.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Even were we to credit the States largely unsupported claim that direct shipping of wine increases the risk of underage drinking, this would not justify regulations limiting only out-of-state direct shipments.  As the wineries point out, minors are just as likely to order wine from in-state producers as from out-of-state ones.  Michigan, for example, already allows its licensed retailers (over 7,000 of them) to deliver alcohol directly to consumers.  Michigan counters that it has greater regulatory control over in-state producers than over out-of-state wineries.  This does not justify Michigans discriminatory ban on direct shipping.  Out-of-state wineries face the loss of state and federal licenses if they fail to comply with state law.  This provides strong incentives not to sell alcohol to minors.  In addition, the States can take less restrictive steps to minimize the risk that minors will order wine by mail.  For example, the Model Direct Shipping Bill developed by the National Conference of State Legislatures requires an adult signature on delivery and a label so instructing on each package.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The States tax-collection justification is also insufficient.  Increased direct shipping, whether originating in state or out of state, brings with it the potential for tax evasion.  With regard to Michigan, however, the tax-collection argument is a diversion.  That is because Michigan, unlike many other States, does not rely on wholesalers to collect taxes on wines imported from out-of-state.  Instead, Michigan collects taxes directly from out-of-state wineries on all wine shipped to in-state wholesalers.  Mich. Admin. Code Rule 436.1725(2) (1989) (Each outside seller of wine shall submit … a wine tax report of all wine sold, delivered, or imported into this state during the preceding calendar month).  If licensing and self-reporting provide adequate safeguards for wine distributed through the three-tier system, there is no reason to believe they will not suffice for direct shipments.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				New York and its supporting parties also advance a tax-collection justification for the States direct-shipment laws.  While their concerns are not wholly illusory, their regulatory objectives can be achieved without discriminating against interstate commerce.  In particular, New York could protect itself against lost tax revenue by requiring a permit as a condition of direct shipping.  This is the approach taken by New York for in-state wineries.  The State offers no reason to believe the system would prove ineffective for out-of-state wineries.  Licensees could be required to submit regular sales reports and to remit taxes.  Indeed, various States use this approach for taxing direct interstate wine shipments, 
				<em>
					e.g
				</em>
				., N. H. Rev. Stat. Ann. §178.27 (Lexis Supp. 2004), and report no problems with tax collection.  See FTC Report 3840.  This is also the procedure sanctioned by the National Conference of State Legislatures in their Model Direct Shipping Bill.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g
				</em>
				., S. C. Code Ann. §614747(C) (West Supp. 2004).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Michigan and New York benefit, furthermore, from provisions of federal law that supply incentives for wineries to comply with state regulations.  The Tax and Trade Bureau (formerly the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms) has authority to revoke a winerys federal
				<span class="softbreak"></span>
				license if it violates state law.  BATF Industry Circular 963 (1997).  Without a federal license, a winery cannot operate in any State.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/27/204.html" class="subref" title="subref">27 U. S. C. §204</a>.  In addition the Twenty-first Amendment Enforcement Act gives state attorneys general the power to sue wineries in federal court to enjoin violations of state law.  §122a(b).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				These federal remedies, when combined with state licensing regimes, adequately protect States from lost tax revenue.  The States have not shown that tax evasion from out-of-state wineries poses such a unique threat that it justifies their discriminatory regimes.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Michigan and New York offer a handful of other rationales, such as facilitating orderly market conditions, protecting public health and safety, and ensuring regulatory accountability.  These objectives can also be achieved through the alternative of an evenhanded licensing requirement.  FTC Report 4041.  Finally, it should be noted that improvements in technology have eased the burden of monitoring out-of-state wineries.  Background checks can be done electronically.  Financial records and sales data can be mailed, faxed, or submitted via e-mail.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In summary, the States provide little concrete evidence for the sweeping assertion that they cannot police direct shipments by out-of-state wineries.  Our Commerce Clause cases demand more than mere speculation to support discrimination against out-of-state goods.  The burden is on the State to show that the 
				<em>
					discrimination
				</em>
				 is demonstrably justified, 

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">344</a> (1992)
 (emphasis in original).  The Court has upheld state regulations that discriminate against interstate commerce only after finding, based on concrete record evidence, that a States nondiscriminatory alternatives will prove unworkable.  See,

				States have broad power to regulate liquor under §2 of the Twenty-first Amendment.  This power, however, does not allow States to ban, or severely limit, the direct shipment of out-of-state wine while simultaneously authorizing direct shipment by in-state producers.  If a State chooses to allow direct shipment of wine, it must do so on evenhanded terms.  Without demonstrating the need for discrimination, New York and Michigan have enacted regulations that disadvantage out-of-state wine producers.  Under our Commerce Clause jurisprudence, these regulations cannot stand.
